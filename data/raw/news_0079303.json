( Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press file photo ) By Salmaan Farooqui Staff Reporter Tues., Feb. 28, 2017 \nSteady rain throughout Tuesday night and into Wednesday could cause flooding thanks to a still frozen ground, Environment Canada warns. \nEnvironment Canada has issued a special weather statement, saying Toronto can expect between 15 and 25 millimetres of rain between Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. \nThat isn’t an absurdly high amount — Environment Canada meteorologist Mark Schuster says we get that multiple times a year — the ground is still frozen, which means it can’t absorb moisture as it normally would. \nOwners of property where flooding tends to be an issue should look out. \nAreas near rivers and streams are also at risk of higher water levels. Article Continued Below \nThe rain will start to move into the GTA at around 9 p.m., although some showers could start in the afternoon. \nThe rainy weather could last into midday Wednesday, with a possibility of lighter showers during the day. \nDespite all the rain, Torontonians will have one thing to look forward to: warmth. \nTuesday is forecasted to have a high of 8 C, and Wednesday will get to a balmy 15 C. Both days are a lot higher than the seasonal average of 1 C. \nDon’t hold your breath over the warmth staying for long, though. Schuster reckons that temperatures will be back to below freezing by Thursday, and will stay around there until the end of the weekend.
