Image caption The creatures, like this Lego longhorn beetle and froghopper, are about 10cm in length \nManaged by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, it is one of the largest restoration projects of its type in Europe. \nWorking with organisations including Natural England and the Environment Agency, they aim to transform the land and conserve its wildlife. Image copyright Great Fen Image caption In the future, the Great Fen will include a fully-equipped visitor centre Image caption It will, of course, include toilet facilities which have already been created in Lego \nEventually the Great Fen should cover 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres). About 55% of that land has been acquired so far. \nThe idea for a fundraising and awareness-raising giant Lego model came about as Ms Weightman works for Natural England and colleagues were aware of her love of Lego creations. \nThe 10m (32ft) x 5m (16.5ft) map base will be created on about 14 tables in the visitor centre at Hinchingbrooke Country Park from Sunday. Image caption Catherine Weightman with a few of the many boxes of Lego which will be used to make the map Image caption A Lego cardinal beetle is one of many which will be put on the map \nMs Weightman and Mr Addis have already made a few creatures such as dragonflies and spiders to populate the map, as well as buildings including a proposed visitor centre for Great Fen, complete with Lego public toilets. \nA number of sold-out sessions later in the week will see members of the public build their own creatures which will be added to the base. \nJo Dixon, from the Wildlife Trust, said: \"We aren't too particular, and if the odd dinosaur or alien turns up, we'll add it to the map anyway.\" Image copyright Great Fen Image caption A map showing the eventual extent of the Great fen - land in green has already been acquired ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:27:19.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
