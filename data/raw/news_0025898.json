We are not against Dego Ride, but we are against this mode of transportation, where motorcycles are being used to take passengers. \nIt will create higher risks for road users,” he said here after his ministry’s monthly assembly and Chinese New Year celebration. \nDuring the Chinese New Year Ops Selamat this year, 151 deaths out of 257 on the roads involved motorcycles. \nAlthough the number of deaths is fewer than the 158 recorded during the same period last year, it still accounted for over 60% of accidents, which remains a worrying figure,” said Liow. \n“challenge” the law. \nUnder this Act, our enforcement officers can take action against the motorcycle rider. We will even pose as passengers to catch them in the act. \nSection 16 and 47 of the SPAD Act states that any company wishing to set up a taxi service must have a commercial licence from SPAD. Dego Ride does not have a commercial licence. \nIt has never contacted us and never applied for it,” said Liow. \n’s order on Sunday for Dego to stop operations immediately on safety grounds, the company is pleading with the authorities for a chance to show its safety data before being forced out of business. \nFounder and chief executive officer Nabil Feisal Bamadhaj said they had zero accidents since starting operations three months ago. \n“” he told mStar Online. \nOn another matter, Liow said the ministry was looking to introduce mini-taxis” to improve last-mile connectivity for public transportation users. \nOn the Kejara demerit system and the Automated Enforcement System (AES), Liow said he expects these to be implemented around April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:44:55.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
