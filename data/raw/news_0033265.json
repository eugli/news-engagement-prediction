The most important changes, though, are two revamped features for finding matches: “2017 Questions & Categories” and “DoubleTake Mobile Matching.” The latter is a replacement for OK Cupid’s Tinder-style feature Quickmatch, which let you swipe to connect with potential dates based on a single photo, name, age, location, and compatibility score. DoubleTake simply crams a bit more information into this same interface, showing multiple photos, specific interests, and a bit of each user’s full profile. It’s not much of a difference, but OK Cupid claims a limited roll-out of the feature saw users’ number of mutual matches triple. “Quickmatch” is on the left; the new “DoubleTake” feature is on the right. Photo: OK Cupid As well as DoubleTake, OK Cupid is also updating its questionnaires with a new category of topical questions that “daters are extremely passionated about.” Fifty new queries have been added, including: “Is climate change real?”; “Do you feel there should be a ban on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries entering the U.S.?”; and — quite simply — “Trump?” Topical questions cover everything from Trump to ghosting on dates. Photo: OK Cupid Users can answer and weight these questions to help improve matches, and the new data is divided into a number of categories including sex, ethics, religion, and lifestyle. These sorts of personal questions have long been a big part of OK Cupid’s pitch, but the company is putting even more weight behind them than ever before, promising it will update its topical queries ever year. As with DoubleTake, the aim here (according to OK Cupid) is to encourage more meaningful connections. This is how the company wants to distinguish itself from apps like Tinder, which has a reputation as a hook-up tool. (Although, as noted by TechCrunch , this differentiation is more about branding than competition: both Tinder and OK Cupid — as well as PlentyOfFish and Match.com — are owned by the same company, Match Group.) These new features may just be more toys and distractions for the dating masses, but in an age where political differences can break up even decades-old marriages , it’s probably better to be safe than sorry.
