The Rohingya people are viewed with suspicion by locals on Sandwip Island.

The threat of piracy means armed officers had to escort ITV News to the island.

Aid agencies are alarmed by the idea of moving the refugees to Thengar Char.

If not, it will be very bad for us.\" Rohingya community faces rejection and suffering \nBangladesh is an already overpopulated and impoverished nation so the thousand of refugees spilling in across the border from Myanmar are not welcome. \nThey are also arriving into the border area close to Cox’s Bazar, home to the world’s longest beach and which the government is trying to sell as a premier holiday resort. The arrival of refugees close to the tourist trap of Cox’s Bazar has made them deeply unpopular. Credit: ITV News \nThere are now eight camps stretching from the Naf River which forms the border up towards Cox’s Bazar. \nOnly two of the camps are official and being supported by aid agencies. \nWe visited one of the newest camps in Balikhali where there is still a daily influx. Burmese navy wades in to target human traffickers \nMaheen Newaz from Save the Children in Cox’s Bazar told us: \"The situation is actually not good in the camps. The sheds they are living in, the facilities they have, this is not adequate, not up to standard, even not actually sufficient.\" \nThe aid agencies are alarmed by the idea of moving the refugees to Thengar Char. \nThey hope a more sensible solution and appropriate sanctuary can be found for the hundreds of thousand who have fled their homes in fear.
