(Photo: Dearborn Police) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDearborn police are investigating two separate incidents of harassment targeting the Muslim community in the last week. \nOn Sunday, the American Moslem Society received a voicemail from an unknown male threatening Muslims and their children, calling them \"agents of Satan\" who would be \"eradicated.\" \nDearborn Police Chief Ron Haddad played the a tape of the voicemail the media Thursday and said police are taking the threat seriously. \n“The mosque is located in one of the safest areas in the community,’’ said Haddad. “There seems to be a need to lash out at people. I really take exception to that. If they want lash out, lash out at me. Leave the people alone, leave the kids alone; leave the faith-based community alone.\" \nMeanwhile, a fictitious post is making the rounds on Facebook warning about a string of robberies in which the victims were tricked into allowing women dressed in traditional Arabic clothing into their homes. \n“That was totally untrue,’’ said Haddad. “We have a full deployment of personnel and we know what’s going on in the city.’’ \nAnyone with information on either incident is asked to call police, 313-943-2242.
