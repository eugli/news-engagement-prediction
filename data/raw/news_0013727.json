"language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Super Bowl 51 offered a bounty of commercials – some good, some not so good. Here’s our rundown of the best and worst of Sunday’s TV presentation:\nBudweiser Facebook Twitter Pinterest \n“You don’t look like you’re from around here.”\nThis politically charged commercial from Budweiser has been causing quite a stir since it debuted during the week. Anheuser-Busch, Budweiser’s owners, say the ad was not created with political intent – but the parallels between today’s politics and the message in the ad are certainly evident.\nThis spot tells the (fictionalised) story of Adolphus Busch, who leaves Germany for America in 1857 to follow his dreams and make something of himself as a master brewer. In this filmic, sweeping commercial, Busch endures a perilous voyage across the Atlantic, a fire onboard a paddle steamer – but the key motif is the hostility and rancour he receives from the locals, who don’t take kindly to the accented immigrant from an ocean away.\nSuper Bowl ads: a guide to new TV and film trailers Read more \nBudweiser makes a big deal of this, showing Busch being jostled and harried upon arrival, and greeted with cries of: “You’re not wanted here! Go back home!” In spite of this, Busch gets to St Louis, meets Eberhard Anheuser, and the pair go on to brew the beer so quintessentially American it actually emblazoned its cans with “America” last summer.\nOf course, it’s merely coincidence that the spot was released just after Donald Trump’s travel ban took effect, but the timing certainly gives the ad an extra frisson. It’s already roused the ire of Sarah Palin and Breitbart, among others, for being “pro-immigrant”, as if that were something deeply iniquitous. The payoff line? When Nothing Stops Your Dreams. It’s a fine, and thoughtful, ad.\n84 Lumber Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nThere was more controversy in this ad from 84 Lumber. The original spot was rejected by the network for being too controversial, so a watered-down version was aired on Sunday evening. Initially, a Mexican mother and daughter, on their way to the US, come across a border wall – just like the one to be built by Trump.\nBut that first ad was deemed too political – so the wall was replaced by a barbed-wire fence. “Of course we were disappointed,” said Amy Smiley, 84 Lumber’s director of marketing, of Fox’s decision. “But ultimately, it’s their network and their decision.”\nMercedes-Benz Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nA classy Easy Rider spoof from Mercedes, all texture and tone. This spot was directed by the Coen brothers, and you can tell.\nWe join a gang of bikers in a divey bar, full of scowl and spittle, doing things bikers in bars love to do, like playing pool and head-butting each other. Steppenwolf’s Born to Be Wild plays on the jukey; much alcohol is drunk; everyone’s having a fine old time. But then the music stops, and suddenly the mood turns ugly. There’s a car outside, blocking the bikes’ way. A Mercedes! Let’s get the bastard who blocked us in! The bikers go outside to mete out some justice … only to find the blocker-inner is, of all people, Peter Fonda , driving past in his $132k AMG GT Roadster. “Still looking good,” sighs one of the female bikers. And you know what: he really is.\nNational Geographic Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nGeoffrey Rush plays Albert Einstein in National Geographic’s new series Genius, which focuses each season on a different, um, genius. To celebrate NatGeo’s first ever Super Bowl commercial, Rush plays Lady Gaga’s Bad Romance on the violin – and it’s great.\nWendy’s Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nThe famous chain that cooks square hamburgers makes its burgers with fresh beef that’s never frozen – and don’t you forget it. This ad, set in an industrial freezer and entitled Cold Storage, neatly encapsulates that idea: don’t settle for frozen beef from the competition (cunningly disguised as Other Guyz LLC). Very on-brand.\nNFL Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nLast year, the NFL showcased its Super Bowl babies concept, with a video based on an interesting quirk: cities that win a Super Bowl see a rise in births nine months after their team wins. This year, the baby motif is back, and the adorable tots (© all tabloid newspapers) are dressed like a series of legends of the NFL: Mike Ditka, Michael Irvin, Vince Lombardi, Joe Namath, Bill Belichick, Marshawn Lynch and Von Miller – the latter in glasses and a cowboy hat.\nThe point of this, according to the NFL’s tagline, is that “Super Bowl legends inspire Super Bowl babies” because “football is family”. Obviously, and technically, football is family and debilitating head trauma, but I suppose that doesn’t scan quite so well.\nAvocados from Mexico Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nA nice ad from those good people at Avocados from Mexico, based around the “dirty secret” that avocados are full of good fat. “How can we be a secret society if we can’t keep all of our secrets?” asks the crumpled head of this slightly shambolic clandestine organisation, which has gathered to discuss how to ramp up security and stop various beans from being spilled.\nI like this ad. It’s funny, and well acted, and its motif is clear, and there’s a good gag about Deflategate. Plus, I like the reference to the Stonecutters episode of The Simpsons. Who enjoys avo-ca-do? We do … and so on.\nT-Mobile Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nT-Mobile loves to get its claws into a celeb. Last year’s Super Bowl ad starred Drake; the year before, Kim Kardashian. And this year it’s no different: Justin Bieber is T-Mobile’s man, alongside Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and former NFL star Terrell Owens, trying to make the link between the “unlimited moves” of touchdown celebrations and the unlimited data sold by a telecoms behemoth.\n'Wanna pet my roo?': Yellow Tail's Super Bowl ad 'humiliates' Australia Read more \nThere’s lots to enjoy here: Gronk as a caveman, TO “taking it to the next level”, Biebs, in glasses and a tux, acting the giddy goat. It’s perhaps a slightly tenuous concept, but it’s pulled off with great panache, and it’s charming. Go Biebs. \nMichelob Ultra \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nDefinitely a contender for most irritating ad of the evening. First of all, I don’t think the good people at Michelob should be taking Where Everybody Knows Your Name, the theme tune from Cheers, in vain. It’s not yours to appropriate, Michelob! Second, the link between deeply mediocre beer and attractive people self-absorbedly working out is thin, to say the least. All that whooping and hollering in the name of self-improvement really grates! Come on, now: you’re doing push-ups in a gym, you’re not Nelson Mandela.\n“Brewed for those who go the extra mile,” reads the tagline. Pish.\nHonda Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nDid Steve Carell really have a little moustache in high school? It seems so! This is an amusing ad, creative and funny, but totally spoiled by a mawkish payoff line that makes Honda sound like they’re a band of international socialists rather than a car company.\nThe conceit is neat: nine stars – Tina Fey, Robert Redford, Amy Adams, Magic Johnson, Steve Carell, Missy Elliott, Stan Lee, Jimmy Kimmel and Viola Davis – emerge from their deeply embarrassing high school yearbook photos and give a little homily about following your dreams and never giving up. Kimmel and Carell, especially, are funny, especially Carell’s Michael Scott-esque retort of: “That was a rhetorical question, Darryl .”\nAnd I fully concur with the ad’s motif. It’s a noble sentiment! Don’t be put off. Be the best you can be. Don’t listen to the haters. And then Honda comes along and says: “We felt this ad fits really well into who Honda is, as far as chasing your dreams no matter what people tell you – keep trying, keep innovating and keep going.”\nHm. So Honda is … chasing your dreams no matter what people tell you? I thought it was selling cars. Shows how much I know!\nBud Light Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nThe return of Bud Light late-1980s mascot Spuds MacKenzie, who made his debut during Super Bowl XXI in 1987. In this ad, the ghostly figure of Spuds appears to dispense advice to a man who really needs his help – because he’s decided to stay home like a plum instead of going to watch the game with his friends.\nAccording to Bud Light, Spuds MacKenzie’s “affinity for living life to the fullest with friends, both old and new, embodied the spirit of Bud Light that we still honor today”. The spirit of Bud Light! Marvellous.\nMr Clean Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nYou gotta love a man who cleans, haven’t you! I like to scrub the toilet bowl so clean that I could eat my dinner off it. (In it?) This is a funny ad, in which we see a woman dreaming of getting hot and heavy with the cartoon Mr Clean and, erm, a mop. Plus, in those white jeans of his, Mr Clean’s butt looks impressively high and tight.\nSuper Bowl ads trolling Trump: 'The world is more beautiful the more you accept' Read more Wix Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nMy friend Adam is a fan of Jason Statham’s movies, so he’ll love, love, love this action-thriller spoof for the Israeli tech company Wix. Wix builds websites, so in that sense the thrillingly urgent Statham is a slightly incongruous pitchman, but it’s certainly a watchable ad. Gal Gadot is on hand to kick some butt, too, and there are many shots of J Statham brooding in a turtleneck, which is something we can all get behind. \nBuick Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nCam Newton’s Panthers aren’t involved this year, but he is in this reasonably amusing ad for Buick. It’s a variation on that old “Well, if he’s a so-and-so, then I’m a Dutchman!” line. In this case: if that gorgeous, sleek vehicle in the parking lot is a Buick, then my kid is Cam Newton on the football field. And then the real Cam Newton comes in to the game, which is nice, because it’s always fun to see eight-year-old kids getting thrown to the floor by a 6ft 5in, 245lb NFL quarterback. Watch out for Miranda Kerr’s gratuitous appearance at the end.\nSquarespace Facebook Twitter Pinterest \nI wonder how much money Squarespace, which sells domain names, paid John Malkovich for appearing in this amusingly sweary ad. Loads, probably. Anyway, Malkovich is at his fulminating best after learning that some anonymous internet dweeb has taken the URL johnmalkovich.com. Hilarity ensues, but the funny thing is, the site johnmalkovich.com exists – it’s being used by the real John Malkovich to sell his new clothing line, of all things.
