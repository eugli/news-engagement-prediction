Prime Minister Modi called this an “exceptional achievement” and congratulated the entire team of scientists and the Secretary of the Department of Space. He went on to tweet that this record was a “proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation”. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:17:52.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
