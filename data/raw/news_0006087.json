BBC Nicky Morgan, former Secretary of State for Education was stone-faced during Maskell's tirade \nMorgan, who initially campaigned to Remain in the EU said: “Well I was quite clear from about the Autumn onwards that we needed a short sharp bill to trigger Article 50. That Parliament – in order to avoid a crisis in our democracy – needed to respect the democratic results that came from the 23 June. \n“But of course as many of us said, we’d really rather not have been in this situation of never having to pass this legislation.” \nWithin her resignation letter, Maskell said the Government’s plans for Brexit create an “unjustifiable level of risk” for her constituents and local businesses.
