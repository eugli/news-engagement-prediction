Government 'listened to community' \nLocal Government NSW (LGNSW) president Keith Rhoades welcomed the policy shift, saying the Berejiklian Government had listened to the community. \n\"LGNSW has spent a lot of today in meetings with Deputy Premier John Barilaro and the newly installed Local Government Minister Gabrielle Upton,\" Cr Rhoades said. \n\"It would be inappropriate to reveal the content of those discussions, but I can certainly say they were both constructive and productive.\" \nThe policy is deeply unpopular in regional areas, and was seen as a major reason behind the Nationals losing the seat of Orange to the Shooters and Fishers Party in a by-election late last year. \nThe Nationals suffered a swing of more than 20 per cent against them. \nThere are more by-elections on the horizon with Government MPs Mr Baird and Jillian Skinner retiring. \nThe proposed merger between North Sydney, Mosman and Willoughby, is a controversial issue in Ms Skinner's seat of North Shore. \nMeanwhile, in Mr Baird's seat of Manly, opponents of the policy have vowed to unseat the Liberal Party.
