We already know their price tags but how do they fare against the current king of the hill which are the Intel Core i7 processors? Well, the company certainly has a lot to say regarding that matter at Ryzen 7’s launch event earlier this week. \nAt the event, AMD’s President and CEO, Lisa Su brought plenty of charts to her presentation which compare Ryzen 7 series against Intel Core i7 processors. These comparisons are not only for 6 th generation Intel Core i7 chips but also the newly released 7 th gen models: \nNot only that, the company is also hammering hard on the fact that AMD Ryzen 7 processors are able to reach these figures at a much lower price tag than high-end Intel Core i7 chips: \nGiven that these test results only came from AMD’s internal Cinebench R15 tests, it might be too soon to jump into conclusions. Nevertheless, expect to see more information on the performance of Ryzen 7 processors to be made public as they made their way to market next week.
