Picture courtesy: Instagram/seniornomads \n\"I love to travel\" has become a very common sentence of late, don't you think? \nNow, think about leaving behind all your worldly possessions and living just out of a backpack, only to fulfill your wildest globetrotting fantasies. How many of us can actually muster up the courage to do it? \nMeet this retired couple from Seattle who gave up everything they earned just for the love of travel. Debbie and Michael Campbell call themselves Senior Nomads, who literally sold off everything, even their house, to realise that 'one more adventure' of exploring the entire world.
