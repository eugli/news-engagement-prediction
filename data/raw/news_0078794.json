Sarah Silverman explains choice between ‘motherhood’& living ‘fullest life’ Posted at 11:54 pm on February 27, 2017 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSarah Silverman took a short break from being a comedian and hoping for a military coup to ponder motherhood and life choices: As a comic always working & on the road I have had to decide between motherhood & living my fullest life & I chose the latter. \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 28, 2017 \nNot surprisingly, a lot of people don’t consider motherhood and living a full life to be mutually exclusive: @SarahKSilverman honest question. Does motherhood have to be at odds with living the fullest life? \n— Cody Q Balfour (@CodyBalfour) February 28, 2017 What a sad thought that so many women find motherhood is incompatible with living a full life. https://t.co/eXLpHEn4sC \n— Bethany S. Mandel (@bethanyshondark) February 28, 2017 Yeah, moms don’t live their fullest lives or anything. https://t.co/2IXqVgy4lV \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 28, 2017 The idea that \"living ones fullest life\" is in opposition to having kids, for anyone, is proof that it's good you didn't do the former. https://t.co/wY0h1lha3t", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:53:13.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
