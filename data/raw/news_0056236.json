(Licensed) BTW \nThe Trump administration is preparing to roll back federal guidance set by the Obama administration that protects transgender students’ use of bathrooms in public schools. \nTrump had previously said that the government should protect transgender people, but it should ultimately be up to states to decide whether people can legally use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \n“I think that all you have to do is look at what the president’s view has been for a long time, that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in. This is a states’ rights issue,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. \nThe Obama administration believed that denying transgender people rights of choice violates Title IX, which federally prohibits sex discrimination in public schools. Taking action against the guidance put in place by the Obama administration would be a civil rights setback for the LGBTQ community. \nNew guidance at the federal level from Trump wouldn't immediately change much across American public schools because a federal judge put a hold on Obama's directive, which stressed gender identity over biological sex, back in May. \nA Trump pivot here would impact ongoing legal cases, however. \n“Such clear action directed at children would be a brazen and shameless attack on hundreds of thousands of young Americans who must already defend themselves against schoolyard bullies, but are ill-equipped to fight bullies on the floors of their state legislatures and in the White House,” said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in a statement released Tuesday. \nAccording to the Washington Post , nearly 800 parents of transgender students wrote letters to Trump last week, pleading against the removal of the guidance that currently protects their children from discrimination. \nStates like Texas and North Carolina are legal and legislative battlegrounds for transgender rights—Trump’s decision could help settle those scores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:36:40.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
