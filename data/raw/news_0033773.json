He gave the example of a candidate who might love brewing beer in their free time — they would be expected to use the whiteboard to draw and explain the brewing process. \nHe said he learned four things from the exercise: what the candidates care about most deeply, how well they can explain themselves, how they think about process, and how they deal with ambiguity. \nReferring to a viral blog post by LinkedIn boss Jeff Weiner that the ideal employee should fit into three overlapping areas , “dream big”, “get s*** done” and “know how to have fun”, Mr Browne said the whiteboard exercise helped him get a feel for the three components. \n“An interview assessment is hard and hyper-flawed, but really what I want to know is who the heck are you, and what is it going to feel like when you and I are working on a really hard problem and we’re working our asses off?” he told Business Insider . \nWhile candidates are often expecting a question more specific to the role they’re applying for, Mr Browne said gauging their response to the feeling of unease was a “decent leading indicator” of how they would cope at the company. \n“Maybe we decide to scrap a project we’re working on or something changes, like it does all the time in business and definitely in Silicon Valley — I want to see how you deal,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:08:01.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
