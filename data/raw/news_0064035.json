Credit Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency David Pulphus is no Chris Ofili. Mr. Pulphus, a high school artist from St. Louis, may never become a free speech cause célèbre akin to Mr. Ofili, the professional London artist whose depiction of a black Virgin Mary, encrusted with a lump of elephant dung, caused a furor in 1999. Still, Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday arguing that the removal of a work by Mr. Pulphus from the Cannon House Office Building in Washington violates the artist’s First Amendment rights. “This case is truly about something much bigger than a student’s painting,” Mr. Clay said in comments outside a courthouse in Washington on Tuesday. “It is about defending our fundamental First Amendment freedoms which are currently under assault in this country.” He went on to argue that the painting — which renders some police officers as pigs in a confrontation with people in downtown St. Louis — “was wrongly disqualified and removed” from a public exhibition of work by high school winners of a Congressional Art Competition . Mr. Clay asserts that the Architect of the Capitol, the office in charge of the contest, “shamefully chose to retroactively censor and suppress Mr. Pulphus’s artwork in response to the enormous political pressure he experienced from the Speaker of the House and certain right-wing media outlets.” The Architect of the Capitol has seven days to respond, and a hearing before the federal court is expected within 21 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:18:53.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
