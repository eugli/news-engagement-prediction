These two keys can be used to jump to the beginning or end of a page. \nWith a Mac keyboard, there are two keyboard shortcuts that provide Home and End key functionality. \n1. Fn + left and right arrow keys \nPress the Function key and the right arrow key to jump to the end of a page, and Function and left arrow to jump to the top of a page. \nThis keyboard shortcut works on most non-editable and some editable pages. It works, for example, with the new Photos app and iTunes, along with Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It also works when editing a document in LibreOffice but not when you are editing a page in Google Drive. \n2. Command + up and down arrow keys \nPress the Command key and the down arrow key to jump to the end of a page, and Command and up arrow to jump to the top of a page. \nThis keyboard shortcut works with Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It also works when editing a page in LibreOffice and Google Drive, but it does not work with Photos or iTunes.
