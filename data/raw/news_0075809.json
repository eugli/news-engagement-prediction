But his well-deserved win also made history, because Ali is the first Muslim actor ever to win an Oscar. This particular Oscar record couldn't possibly have come at a more important time, just weeks after President Donald Trump imposed his now-stalled travel ban on immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries. It was an unprecedented act of hostility against Islam—much as the White House tried to deny it was \"a Muslim ban\"—and Ali made an emotional speech about his faith following his win at the Screen Actors Guild awards last month.\n My mother is an ordained minister, I'm a Muslim,\" Ali said at the SAG Awards. \"She didn't do backflips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now, we put things to the side, I'm able to see her, she's able to see me, we love each other, the love has grown. That stuff is minutiae. It's not that important.\"\nMoonlight went on to pull off a stunning underdog victory in the Best Picture race, taking the prize from La La Land after the latter was read out in error.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:59:37.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
