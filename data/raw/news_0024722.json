While buying something from Nordstrom is a nice show of solidarity (wouldn’t it be interesting if the company posted a banner-sales month?), you can take it a step further with purchases that are a bit more pointed . Like a nice white pantsuit, or a newspaper tote bag, or a pair of boys’ gloves (size small).\nBecause after Tom Ford told the ladies on The View that he had refused to dress Melania, Trump told Fox News that he wasn’t a fan of the designer, and never had been. (Yes, $37 is expensive for a bar of soap, but it’s a cute-slash-ridiculous Valentine’s Day gift for a Fashion Man.)\nBuy Tom Ford Oud Wood Soap Bar $37, Nordstrom Because the politically engaged designers of Opening Ceremony just staged a protest-themed fashion show .\nBuy Opening Ceremony Elastic Logo Sweatpants $150, Nordstrom Because it’s a key chain or bag charm in the shape of a very small, yellow penis …\nBuy J. W. Anderson Bag Charm $115, Nordstrom Because these sneakers literally say the word Mexico on them.\nBuy Onitsuka Tiger ‘Mexico Delegation’ Sneaker $90, Nordstrom Because this bag is literally covered in fake news.\nBuy Kate Spade Newspaper Tote Bag $24, Nordstrom Because we cannot even begin to imagine what Rei Kawakubo would do to Donald Trump if left in a room alone with him, but we are fairly certain it would not be pretty.\nBuy Comme des Garçons Heart Graphic Woven Cotton Shirt $255, Nordstrom Because this is an actual (and very chic) pussy hat.\nBuy Eugenia Kim ‘Caterina’ Genuine Mink Trim Beret $189, Nordstrom Because this is not a pussy-bow blouse , and because Rachel Comey paid for her staff to attend the Women’s March and donated half of her proceeds that weekend to Planned Parenthood.\nBuy Rachel Comey Meryl Tie Front Blouse $368, Nordstrom Because Maria Cornejo’s also been very vocally anti-Trump .\nBuy Zero + Maria Cornejo Gemma Ruched Marine Twill Skirt $595, Nordstrom Because Nike’s CEO, Mark Parker, spoke out strongly against the Muslim ban.\nBuy Nike ‘Free Flyknit’ Running Shoe $130, Nordstrom Because Patagonia’s been super (and very consistently) anti-Trump, and donated 100 percent of its Black Friday sales to environmental nonprofits.\nBuy Patagonia ‘Re-Tool’ Snap Pullover $119, Nordstrom Because you’re still #withher.\nBuy BOSS Jacket & Trousers $625, Nordstrom Because as any kid who’s been bullied on the schoolyard will tell you, the only way to defuse an insult is to reclaim it as a badge of honor. Not only are these the most comfortably warm wool socks — they also scream, “Yes, I’m a snowflake, and I’m proud of it.”\nBuy Smartwool Snowflake Pattern Crew Socks $24, Nordstrom Because these have double meaning! The easily bruised Trump really does need to be handled with kid gloves; and, of course, Drumpf is famously sensitive about his smaller-than-average hands. And either way, your son will have a nice, new pair of warm gloves.\nBuy The North Face ‘eTip’ Gloves (Boys) $40, Nordstrom The Strategist is a new site designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
