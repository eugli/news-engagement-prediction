Photo: Nick Moir \n\"Is this lady for turning? Is this lady for turning?\" Mr Secord heckled, alluding to the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's famous declaration. \nWhether the words were a nod to Mrs Thatcher, a wink at Mr Harwin or both is under dispute, with the veteran Labor MP claiming that they were actually a reference to Premier Gladys Berejiklian. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link NSW MP Don Harwin has moved from the president's chair to the floor of the NSW legislative council. Photo: Dallas Kilponen \nMr Harwin appeared not to hear Mr Secord the first time he uttered the question, but did a double take on its repetition. \nSeveral members of the legislative council told Fairfax Media they were taken aback by the comment, which came as part of a targeted attack on Mr Harwin, and was met by a low roar around the chamber. Advertisement \nLiberal member Shayne Mallard said he was offended. \n\"I heard it and I thought it was petty and homophobic,\" Mr Mallard said. \nBut Mr Secord said his comments had been intended for the Premier, rather than Mr Harwin. \n\"He told parliament that he and Premier Gladys Berejiklian were holding steadfast on the decision to spend more than $2 billion to sell the Powerhouse Museum site to developers and move it to Parramatta,\" Mr Secord said. \n\"Don Harwin is well-known as a staunch monarchist, a conservative, a lover of all things British including the late Maggie Thatcher. \n\"I regret any misunderstanding as the joke was directed at the Premier's position on the Powerhouse Museum. \n\"For the record, I was one of the few MPs to march in last year's Mardi Gras.\" \nLabor MPs had been gleefully anticipating the transposition of Mr Harwin from the president's chair to the floor of the house, whereupon they would be released of their obligation to respect his position as the presiding officer. \nWhen he took up his chair as leader of government on Tuesday morning, it was the first time in six years that he had joined members in the throng and the majority of questions were directed towards him. \n\"It's Don Harwin day,\" Mr Secord said, when his Labor colleague Lynda Voltz directed her question about the Powerhouse towards Mr Harwin. \nIndependent MP Alex Greenwich, a gay rights activist who sits in the lower house, said Mr Secord's remarks were \"appalling\". \n\"The comments are offensive, unnecessary, and archaic, and have no place in a modern and inclusive parliament,\" Mr Greenwich said. \nMr Harwin declined to comment. \nFormer British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher coined the catchphrase \"the lady's not for turning\" in 1980, referring to her refusal to buckle to opponents of her economic policies.
