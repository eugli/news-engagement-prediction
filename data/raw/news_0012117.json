(Representative Image: Reuters) \nChina’s newly-formed Rocket Force has held an exercise with advanced DF-16 medium-range ballistic missile with a range of over 1,000 kms that could threaten a number countries, including India, Japan and the US. Significantly the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which is secretive about its weapons systems, has released a video of the recent exercise of its troops employing the advanced DF-16 medium-range ballistic missile. \nChina’s Rocket Force is a special contingent to handle range of missiles in its military’s arsenal. \nSeveral launch vehicles carrying the ballistic missiles were seen in the footage released to show the training of Rocket Force missile brigade soldiers around the Spring Festival holiday. \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe participating units handled a number of scenarios, including chemical/biological contamination, countering satellite reconnaissance and electronic jamming, state-run China Daily reported today. \nThe crews practiced in multiple manoeuvres, such as rapid loading, redeployment and launch sequence, though the video showed no missile actually being launched. \nTwo types of DF-16 appeared in the exercise. The video represents the third time the DF-16 has been shown to the public. \nThe missile made its debut at a military parade in Beijing in September 2015. \nIn July, a television news programme showed General Fan Changlong, a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspecting a DF-16 unit of the Southern Theatre Command. \nThough the PLA has never disclosed its ballistic missiles’ specifications, experts said the DF-16 poses a challenge to foreign military installations along the first island chain, which is what the Chinese military calls the series of islands that stretch from Japan in the north to Taiwan and the Philippines to the south, the Daily report said. \nSince the election of Donald Trump as US President, China has been striking aggressive postures against Taiwan after he spoke to Taiwanese President Tsai-Ing-wen. \nWhile criticising his moves, China has sent its first aircraft carrier to Taiwan straits, as well as the first island chain in the Pacific and stepped up naval drills in the disputed South China Sea. \nWashington Free Beacon, a news website in the United States that specialises in military affairs, reported on January 31 that China conducted the first flight of the DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile in January. \nChina has also deployed its long range missile close to the Russian border which the Russian media said is aimed at US. \nReports in the official media said China is stepping up preparedness for a possible military conflict with the US as Trump signalled to follow more hardline policy to counter China’s claims on the disputed South China Sea, official media reports here said. \nA commentary in the official website of People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) said on January 20 the day Trump assumed presidency that the chances of war have become “more real” amid a more complex security situation in Asia Pacific. \nXu Guangyu, a retired major general and now a strategy researcher, said that DF-16 has a strike range of more than 1,000 kms, filling the gap that previously existed with the absence of a medium-range ballistic missile in the PLA’s arsenal. \nHe said the missile also is able to reach Okinawa, a Japanese island about 400 km from China’s Diaoyu Islands. \nShi Hong, executive editor of Shipborne Weapons, said the DF-16 has a strike accuracy as good as that of a cruise missile, Shi said. \nIt is also able to manoeuvre in its final stage to penetrate enemy defensive firepower, he said. \nOther PLA Rocket Force brigades also mobilised their DF-11, DF-15 and DF-21C ballistic missiles during training around Spring Festival, according to PLA media outlets.
