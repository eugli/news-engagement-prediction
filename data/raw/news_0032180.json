Or was she calm? \nWas she contemplating her life as it was in those short 30 years or was she struck by an unbelievable fear, as we can only imagine she would have been? \nAs she looked across the horizon, or perhaps to the women standing next to her, she surely longed to be home. Did she cry or was she stoic? \nAs the machine gun fired out from behind her, did she hear it? Or was she dead before the sound could reach her? \n\"Kath\" Neuss went to war as a nurse in 1941. On February 4 of that year she sailed from Sydney on the Queen Mary to Singapore. \nFor a young woman who had been trained at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, it was an exhilarating time but also nerve-racking. It was war after all. Photo: Kathleen Neuss went to war as a nurse in early February 1941, sailing from Sydney to Singapore. (Supplied) \nAlmost exactly a year later, on the 16th of February 1942, she was killed. \n\"They were machine-gunned to death; those who weren't immediately killed the Japanese came back and bayoneted,\" Michael Noyce, Kathleen's nephew told the ABC. \nFour days before her death Ms Neuss was among the 65 nurses evacuated during the fall of Singapore on-board the SS Vyner Brooke, which then sank after being bombed by the Japanese. \nShe was among 22 nurses who drifted at sea and made it ashore on Indonesia's Bangka Island. \nDays later they were forced to wade into the ocean by Japanese soldiers and sprayed with bullets from behind. \n\"No-one knew anything, basically nothing was confirmed until 1945 when the nurses were finally found three weeks after the war finished,\" Mr Noyce said. \nThe better known \"Bully\", or Vivian Bullwinkel, was the only nurse among the group to survive. She died in Perth in 2000. Victims remembered 75 years later \nSome 75 years on Ms Neuss and the other Australian nurses will be remembered on the little-known, 300-metre Radji beach, on Bangka Island near Sumatra, and for the first time a plaque will be erected there. Photo: A plaque has been erected on Radji Beach for the 50 people executed at the site. (Supplied) \nMore than 100 relatives, officials and nurses will attend the ceremony on Thursday. \n\"It had a devastating effect on our family, not me personally because I was just young then, but on my uncles and aunts,\" Mr Noyce said. \n\"It basically killed my grandparents, they both died quite young at 51, 52 years old. Our story is typical of all the families that suffered like this.\" \nFor the Bangka Island locals they have their own war stories to tell. Their own hurt and pain. \nFor now though on a far-away beach they have agreed to care for a plague for the Australian nurses who died for their country. \n\"For years and years they tell us fishermen wouldn't fish there again because they said the waters were haunted,\" Mr Noyce said. \n\"So this is very, very important to bring closure to a lot of people 75 years later.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:57:11.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
