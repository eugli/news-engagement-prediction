SHARE Former prime minister Tony Abbott says he would cut the Renewable Energy Target. Photo: Rick Rycroft \nHow else to explain Wednesday's extraordinary interview with conservative commentator Andrew Bolt in which he unloaded on the government as \"drifting to defeat\" and set out a plan which he claims would correct the Coalition's poor standing in the polls, and haemorrhaging of votes to One Nation? [ Sky News ] \nHe recorded the interview before delivering a blistering critique of the Turnbull government in a speech launching a collection of essays called Making Australia Right . [ Full speech ] [ James Massola/Fairfax ] \n\"The gloves are off,\" observed Bolt. [ Herald Sun ] \nWith Parliament due back next week this could boil over and that may be what Abbott intends. Ironically, it would come of the back of the best two weeks Turnbull has had in the job although as Michelle Grattan notes, the government's gains from Turnbull's bullish attack on Shorten have been so far minimal if at all. [ The Conversation ] Advertisement \nIf Abbott believes he has the numbers in the partyroom, well over his unhelpful interventions, to make a comeback he possess a greater lack of self-awareness than we've previously appreciated. \nOne Twitter follower whimsically observed that for someone who hates Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott spends a lot of time copying him. Funny indeed but to me this looks more like the mimicry of another former Labor leader - Simon Crean, when he took it upon himself to challenge Julia Gillard for the leadership as a way of blowing open Kevin Rudd's destabilisation of Gillard. \nThe move was disastrous for Crean. Rudd sat tight, Crean didn't have a hope and was sacked from Cabinet. His career never recovered and he resigned from parliament in 2013. \nMinister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nColleagues think its possible that Abbott is about to embark on a \"suicide bomber\" mission. The eventual successor, intended or otherwise, could be Peter Dutton, who as Immigration Minister gets a tough hearing in the media but has been quietly gaining support internally. This is largely because he was not part of the mission to install Turnbull but has proved himself a reliable Cabinet colleague of the PM, despite being the leading conservative in the lower house. \nThe fraccas over whether or not the deal with the US to take our asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru is a people swap or not (it clearly is as Australia is accepting refugees from Costa Rica) is not the dunderhead mistake from Dutton (who said as much with Bolt this week) that some people are making it out to be. \nIt was deliberate. He is signalling that he is a straight-talking conservative and that he understands voters are sick of political sophistry and pretence. Although he was the one who ended up backing down after being \"corrected\" by Julie Bishop, Dutton's willingness to speak plainly could see him awarded the eventual political victory because he gets marks internally and externally for saying what voters already know is true. \nTreasurer Scott Morrison. Photo: Andrew Meares \nWhat should also not be missed is that during Bolt and Abbott's love-in on Sky, the pair sledged Julie Bishop as disloyal in praising Dutton and notably did not mention Scott Morrison. He was once seen as an heir to the leadership but has floundered in the Treasury role. \nBut there's no guarantee of what will happen if Abbott presses the thermo-nuclear button. Remember when Crean blew himself up it reinforced Gillard's position for a few more months longer. \nBut change or no change, Julie Bishop will go down as the \"forever undefeated\" No 2. writes Graham Richardson.
