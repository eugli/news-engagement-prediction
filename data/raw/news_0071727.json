Rooney's exit at the end of the season, after 13 years at Old Trafford, looks certain though. He had envisaged seeing out his contract at United, which runs until 2018, yet his diminishing playing opportunities have prompted a re-evaluation of his career path. That deviation was only underpinned by the comments of manager Jose Mourinho on Tuesday when he refused to give any guarantees that Rooney will be at the club much longer. Mourinho expected to be quizzed by the media following Rooney's appearance at United's open training session but the manager's blunt assessment is understood to have taken his club captain's advisors by surprise as they plan how best to handle the end of his Old Trafford career. Rooney still believes he can play a significant role this season and beyond in the Premier League but is loath to play for another English side apart from Everton. The Goodison Park club have discussed a romantic re-signing of their former academy star but his £235,000 a week basic salary plus image rights bonuses mean any such project is unrealistic without Rooney taking a substantial cut of more than £100,000 a week. United boss Jose Mourinho could also lose the England skipper to a Major League Soccer outfit Indeed, unless a compromise is made over his terms, China is the most viable option and some of his United teammates believe he is close to taking that decision. He can command a salary in excess of £35million a season in the Super League making him the world's best paid player and recognises his earning capacity there is at its peak. Jiangsu Suning, Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, who are managed by Felipe Scolari, and Beijing Guoan, who finished fifth in the CSL last season have been the main suitors. Tianjian Quanjian have a foreign player slot available though coach Fabio Cannavaro confirmed on Wednesday: 'We did make an approach for Rooney, but it was just chit-chat because he simply doesn’t suit our style of play. No further discussion was necessary.' The Red Devils skipper could become the world's best player should he make the China move One consequence of a move to the Far East could be the end to Rooney's international career after 119 England caps though that is already in jeopardy owing to his lack of game time for United. Less lucrative options for Rooney could yet materialise in the MLS. Though the Americans are reluctant to bring in more imports over the age of 30, David Beckham is still battling to establish his Miami franchise as an expansion team for 2018. A decisive factor will be where and how Rooney's young family can best settle but the riches on offer will help smooth any transition. It is feasible they could even remain based in England should he undertake a one or two year contract. In the interim, Rooney is continuing to improve his fitness at United's Carrington complex and maintains a healthy working relationship with Mourinho, at least until the summer.
