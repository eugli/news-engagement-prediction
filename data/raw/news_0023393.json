Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and Tory MPs have joined growing outrage at the Government’s refusal to take more stranded child refugees. \nThe number is barely a tenth of the 3,000 demanded by 84-year-old peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis to Britain as a child. \nDespite furious criticism today the Prime Minister claimed Britain's approach was \"absolutely right\". \nAnd Home Secretary Amber Rudd claimed continuing the scheme would \"incentivise\" people fleeing war to cross into Europe.

Britain will no longer help stranded children who have already crossed into Europe (Photo: Reuters) \n\"We cannot withdraw from our long and proud history of helping the most vulnerable.\" \nTory MP Will Quince said he was “sad and disappointed” by the move. \nHis colleague David Burrowes MP accused the government of “shutting the door” on the Dubs scheme. \n“This was not what Parliament intended. It looks like they have cut and run from child refugees. \n“Our legal and moral obligation to child refugees has not been fulfilled,” he said. \nThe Conservative MP Heidi Allen said it was “utterly unacceptable” the government was not prepared to talk to councils about continuing the scheme next year. The row came as Theresa May met Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at No10 (Photo: Barcroft) \n“There are an awful lot of us that are not going to let this go,” she told the BBC. \nIn a joint press conference with Theresa May today, the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni warned all European nations must pull their weight. \n\"Europe needs a common strategy for migrants and obviously the weight of the response we give to these influx of migrants need to be shared between the EU countries,\" he said. \n\"We need to push for a common sharing of responsibilities.\" \nYet Theresa May defended the decision, highlighting a separate scheme that will resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 - but only those who have not reached Europe. \nShe claimed: \"I think what we’re doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:45:43.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
