Ryan will miss 4-to-6 weeks with a broken finger, while Stone (neck) and Hoffman (groin) are day to day.\n\"I think it's just our character that we stuck to the structure, everyone was on the same page,\" Anderson said. \"It doesn't take talent to play defense and play your position. Usually the talented guys are your offensive minded, and gifted skilled guys. As far as the guys we have in our lineup right now, there's still some skill there, but it starts with structure and taking care of the puck and frustrating the other team.\"\nThe Senators have done that to the Devils all season. In sweeping their three-game series, Ottawa held New Jersey to two goals.\n\"Everybody stepped up; guys were just playing simple but making important plays that may not look like big plays at the time but we kept them from gaining momentum,\" said Kyle Turris, who scored for Ottawa along with defenseman Erik Karlsson.\nTurris played a game-high 26:09, while center Derick Brassard logged 20:06.\n\"Sometimes when you lose people that play a lot of minutes you know someone else is going to have to fill that spot,\" Karlsson said. \"I think tonight, we really embraced it and everyone here wanted to do that job.\"\nTravis Zajac scored for New Jersey and Cory Schneider made 21 saves. The Devils have lost two in a row, three of four and are six points out of a playoff spot.\n'We're not in the best spot' \"We're not in the best spot, but we have to keep finding a way to win games and compete and keep ourselves relevant in the race,\" Schneider said. \"Again, it is going to take a lot now, but we can't stop.\"\nTurris gave the Senators the lead 59 seconds into the second period after the Devils twice failed to get the puck out of their own end. The center fired the puck behind the New Jersey goal line, and Jean-Gabriel Pageau retrieved it and found Ryan Dzingel in the left circle. He sent a cross-ice pass to Turris for a shot into an open net for his 20th goal.\nKarlsson has points in six straight games after stretching the lead to 2-0 early in the third period with a power-play goal from the left circle. He beat a screened Schneider over the shoulder.\nWith Tom Pyatt off for delay of game, Zajac got the Devils within a goal, putting a rebound of Joseph Blandisi's shot into an open net at 6:37.\nAnderson, whose wife Nicolle is battling throat cancer, was outstanding in the first two periods. He stopped deflections by Adam Henrique and Jacob Josefson in the first period and shots in close in each of the first two periods by Mike Cammalleri, who returned to the lineup after being benched for two games.\nHe stopped a deflection by Zajac in close in the final minute.\nZajac scored for New Jersey and Cory Schneider made 21 saves. The Devils have lost two in a row and three of four.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:09:30.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
