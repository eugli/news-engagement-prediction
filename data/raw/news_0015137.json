Brady’s jersey went missing after the game. Credit A J Mast for The New York Times HOUSTON — Tom Brady jerseys have been the top sellers among N.F.L. players for the better part of the past year. But now not even Brady has the most coveted one, the one he wore in the New England Patriots ’ stunning, come-from-behind Super Bowl LI victory over the Atlanta Falcons. It went missing shortly after he took it off in the locker room after the game Sunday night, and on Monday nobody seemed to know where it was. The lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, asked the state police to help their local counterparts in Houston find Brady’s jersey. “In Texas we place a very high value on hospitality and football,” Patrick said in a statement on Monday. “Tom Brady’s jersey has great historical value and is already being called ‘the most valuable N.F.L. collectible ever.’ It will likely go in the Hall of Fame one day. It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas.” It is not clear if it was misplaced or stolen; a spokesman for the team declined to comment. In a video shot in the locker room, Brady is heard complaining that somebody took the jersey. He had put it in a bag, he said, and noticed it was gone when he checked the bag later.
