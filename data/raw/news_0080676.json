This picture was taken back in 2000 (Picture: Cover Images) \nGiles’ first thoughts as he looked at Michelle were ‘Wow!’ \nBy 2002, Giles, a children’s author and Michelle, a designer and store planner, were a married couple. \nAnd, with two years of photobooth photos already under their belts, they decided to keep the tradition going – to watch their lives unfold and develop as they grew older. By 2002, the pair were wed (Picture: Cover Images) \n‘I loved having a picture with my ‘wife’. We felt as if we’d been together for many years and knew it was right,’ explained Giles. \nThe pictures continued as the years went on, but according to Giles, 2006’s image will always remain the most ‘momentous photobooth moment’, as they’d just found out that Michelle was three months pregnant. \nGiles said: ‘She had terrible morning sickness that day. I think we both knew life would never be the same again.’ \nThe last picture of the pair as a single couple came just before their son, Elijah, was born in 2007. The pair gave birth to their son, Elijah, in 2007 (Picture: Cover Images) \nThe couple ran off into a booth outside a supermarket knowing they were soon to become parents, to take one last photo on their own for the photobooth album. \nLater, in 2009, Giles and Michelle gave birth to their second child, Sonny, who was able to join the family portrait alongside Elijah. Though Giles admits, it wasn’t easy. \nHe said: ‘The photobooth was in a post office and I remember trying to squeeze two growing children into the booth and realising there would be less and less space each year as they got bigger and that one day they would be grown men like me.’ They were a family of four by 2009! (Picture: Cover Images) \nBy 2012, the effects of having two active young sons were visible, as Giles says he finally let his grey hair come through. \nThe family say they will continue the photobooth tradition as Elijah, now 10 and Sonny, 8, grow up – although Giles says: ‘It’s getting harder to find photo booths, they are becoming more scarce.’ \nWhile they will continue to hunt for photobooths to keep up tradition, Giles and Michelle will also spend time looking back on the photos they have already saved. They say that having looked back on the album already, they’ve noticed how drastically things have changed – yet they’re happier than ever. Here they are, all grown up! (Picture: Cover Images) \nLooking back, Giles said: ‘I think we both know we are different people, but the same somehow. My feelings for Michelle are just the same, perhaps stronger than ever. \n‘Our favourite picture is the one where the four of us are in it for the first time, our family complete.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T22:41:05.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
