Then he left in a metallic dark grey Mercedes Benz. \nA relative at the wake said the family would not respond to rumours or speculation on the incident. \n“There is no need to clarify anything as long as we know the truth. There is no need to explain too much to the public,” he said. \nAnother relative said the family was hurt by rumours on social media that Lee was pregnant when she died. \nPenang police chief Comm Datuk Wira Chuah Ghee Lye said the gunmen were dark skinned but police could not identify their race. \nHe said investigators were still studying footage from CCTV cameras near Lee’s office and at the crime scene. \n“We’ve been searching for clues the past week. Hopefully the images will lead us to something,” he added. \nPenang CID chief Senior Asst Comm Zainol Samah said Lee was hit by six bullets on the chest and face, and police had recovered 10 casings at the scene. \nHe said the investigating officer and his team went back there to look for more clues on Wednesday. \nOn two photographs that went viral on social media, supposedly of another fatal shooting that happened in the area, SAC Zainol told the public not to spread rumours. \n“The photographs are of the incident on Tuesday. Don’t speculate, let the police investigate,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:31:17.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
