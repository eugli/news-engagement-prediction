Steve King \nRemember how, in the Watergate scandal, the cover-up was worse than the crime? According to Rep. Steve King, when it comes to Donald Trump’s national security adviser resigning over his secret conversations with a Russian official, the lack of cover-up is the real problem . \n\"We have to find the people that are working against this administration and they need to be purged from this community,\" the Iowa Republican told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" [...] \n\"I think what is most important here is the leaks coming out of the intelligence community that appear to be designed to politically assassinate members of the Trump Administration and at least weaken the Trump Administration.\" \nFacts about what Donald Trump and his top aides are doing should not be public unless they make Trump look good, dammit. Unflattering facts are political assassination. Donald Trump can do whatever he wants and it’s unpatriotic to so much as raise your eyebrow about it. \nAll of this must also have King worried for his other Russia-backed, white nationalist politician friend , France’s Marine Le Pen. If bad stuff about Trump gets out and people notice his similarities with Le Pen, maybe that will get in the way of her being elected president of France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:36:27.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
