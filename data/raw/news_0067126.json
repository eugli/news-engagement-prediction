Well, kind of—it was actually Jimmy Fallon, bringing his impression of the president back to The Tonight Show. On a night when—for once—there was no particularly urgent Trump-related thing for hosts to skewer, Fallon was able to make hay by doing what he does best: mocking the president in his own words. But Tuesday’s impersonation, like last Thursday’s before it, had a little more bite than it used to. “I will be talking about various things, and very big things in the world of things,” Fallon-as-Trump said. “That’s right; this is how your president talks now.” “Trump’s” top story for the evening? The attack in Sweden that definitely, 100 percent happened . But the highlight of the segment came when Fallon addressed the newly hired H.R. McMaster, Trump’s replacement for Michael Flynn: “Normally, when I’m talking to H.R., it’s because one of my female employees is threatening to sue,” Fallon said. “But now H.R. is gonna stand for huge ratings.” ( James Corden also noted the irony of the name later on during Late Late Show, quipping, “This guy’s name is H.R. McMaster. And given Trump’s conduct, this is going to be so confusing for him at work. They’re going to be like, ‘Excuse me, Mr. President. H. R. wants a word with you.’ And he’s like, ‘I didn’t touch her! I didn’t touch her! Oh, the other H. R. Sorry, yeah, send him in.’”) Like any good news network, TNN also covers sports. Today’s story? “A new study finds that golf totally counts as work.” And then, the cherry on top: Jo Firestone returning as Betsy DeVos, TNN’s meteorologist. Is she roundly unqualified for the job? Definitely. But as the show pointed out, that hasn’t stopped her before. To some critics, Fallon’s Trump impression might be “ insufficient ” as a tool for skewering the president. The more direct approach taken by more scathing voices like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers might be more attuned to today’s charged political climate. But that’s simply not who Fallon is—or what The Tonight Show does. And as the country slowly settles into a Trump presidency—one in which there isn’t always an explosive news hook for comedians to capitalize on—Fallon’s approach could prove more sustainable than his critics might expect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:10:17.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
