At Marcy Open in Northeast, about 20 people, including teachers, staff, parents and students, held welcoming signs outside school.\nIt was students' first day at school since Thursday because of a couple days off for students, and their first moments in school since President Donald Trump announced the ban on refugees from some countries. \nMinneapolis schools Superintendent Ed Graff said in a statement Monday that the district backed immigrant students and families. \n\"We view our diversity as one of our greatest strengths,\" he said in the statement.\nFour teachers led the effort to bring staff together for the Tuesday welcome at South High, said the school's public relations coordinator Lisa Ramirez: Corinth Matera, Mary Manor, Rob Panning-Miller and Corbin Doty.\nRamirez said about 40 to 50 staff members, mostly teachers, participated in the morning greeting. Teachers and staff lined the school's entryway.\nThey held signs including \"REFUGEES are WELCOME HERE,\" \"Hate-Free Zone\" and \"We Stand With Our Muslim Students.\"\nSome sang \"We Shall Overcome\" as kids came in the building, and some choir students joined in, Ramirez said.\nMarcy is a kindergarten through eighth-grade school with about 18 percent English Language Learners, said Principal Donna Andrews. She said Tuesday was a calm first day back at school.\n\"I really support the idea of letting kids know that they are all welcome here, all the time,\" Andrews said.\nOlder Post \"Demography doesn't define destiny,\" charter leader says in new video Newer Post Osseo Area Schools forms partnership to diversify teacher workforce", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:25:50.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
