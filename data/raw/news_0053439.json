As those who sought to capture the home for their very own would discover, the eye-catching property was the launch listing for Plumbid, a new online real estate auction business. If the home’s $699,000 list price seemed curiously low, well, that’s because it was actually the opening bid price. As Plumbid’s website explains, would-be buyers register to be qualified by the site in advance of a specified auction date. Bids incorporate four separate factors: sales price, amount of down payment, length of escrow, and the buyer’s inspection requirements. Participants can see how much other bidders are offering, but not the other three elements of the bid. Auctions last for three hours, unless someone swoops in with a last-minute bid, in which case they are briefly extended. Not at all surprisingly, there was no shortage of bidders for the Eagle Rock A-frame. At one point prior to the February 12 auction, there looked to be at least two dozen contenders in the mix. As of this writing, however, just 10 bids are recorded on the site, the lowest being $728,400, continuing all the way up to the winning figure of $1,032,600.
