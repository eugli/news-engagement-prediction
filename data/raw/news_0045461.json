This time, it’s a team effort. After spending much of his time on the set of the much-hyped Murder on the Orient Express remake attempting to coax Last Jedi spoilers out of Daisy Ridley (he’s got the video compilation to prove it ), Josh Gad culled as many A-list Star Wars fans as he could find in his latest video to attempt to figure out what happens in Episode 8. “I have no more questions,” Gad assures the Star Wars heroine, who he called the “Taylor to [his] Katy.” Then he leads her into the lion’s den: “I have no more questions, but they do.” Inside, Leslie Odom Jr. (“How many musical numbers are there?”), Colin Trevorrow, Lucy Boynton, Bryce Dallas Howard (“Do the heels of your boots ever get stuck in the grates of the Millennium Falcon?”), Penélope Cruz, Derek Connolly, Tom Bateman, and J.J. Abrams pepper Ridley with questions. Chris Pratt is there, too, but he’s just plugging his own blockbuster: “ Jurassic World opens June 2018.”\nThis has been a battle of attrition. #daisyridley has been a force to be reckoned with. In many ways she is the Vader to my Luke or the Taylor to my Katy. But like any good opponent, I have tried to outmaneuver her at every turn. This will be her final judgement. May the force be with her, because kids, she is going to need it. All I ask is that you don't ruin the surprise for others. #TheLastJedi #starwars #broughtsomefriendsalongfortheride @disney @starwars @penelopecruzoficial @prattprattpratt @brycedhoward @colintrevorrow @leslieodomjr @lucyboynton1 @brycedhoward @derek.connolly #tombateman @jjabramsofficial \nA post shared by Josh Gad (@joshgad) on Feb 20, 2017 at 4:59am PST \nTags: josh gad daisy ridley the last jedi movies star wars Josh Gad Is Still Trolling Daisy Ridley for Last Jedi Hints Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Bono Praises Mike Pence for His Commitment to AIDS Relief Drake on Grammy Wins: ‘I Don’t Even Want Them’ Mariah Carey Is Still Feeling ‘Victimized’ by Her New Year’s Eve Performance Most Viewed Stories The Bachelor Recap: No Place Like Home Airplane Passenger Reportedly Called Police After Feeling ‘Not Comfortable’ Sitting Next to Mykki Blanco Jane the Virgin Recap: Reality Check Vanderpump Rules Recap: Life Is a Drag Timeless Season-Finale Recap: Lost in Time What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Emma Watson’s Poor Provincial Town Honestly Seems Pretty Great in the New Beauty and the Beast ’s ‘Belle’ Clip Bates Motel Season-Premiere Recap: Mother Knows Best For a Black Artist to Win Album of the Year, They Have to Make an Album of the Decade Milo Yiannopoulos Lost His Book Deal Over Pedophilia Comments The Walking Dead Recap: Meet the Vulcans Most Popular Video On Vulture An Evolution of Beyoncé’s Grammy Performances Latest News from Vulture 3 mins ago Andy Cohen Condemns Jewish Cemetery Vandalism on Watch What Happens Live “We cannot allow acts of hate against anyone to become normal.”\n9 mins ago How The Good Fight Handled the Trump Question The CBS spinoff needed sudden rewrites after the election.
