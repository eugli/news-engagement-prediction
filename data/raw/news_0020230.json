(Photo: AP) \nLook, we're not going to sit here debate who should and shouldn't get Super Bowl rings. Players get rings when they're an an eligible member of the team. Michael Floyd was, so he got a ring. Credit to him. \nBut after the Patriots' stunning Super Bowl 51 victory, not everyone was so sure he deserved one. Floyd himself took issue with those he said he didn't after the game, though he didn't seem overly bothered by it. Damn I just realized ppl are really mad that I got a ring. I thought everyone would be happy for me. Oh well. I'm a champion!! — MichaelFloyd (@MichaelMFloyd) February 7, 2017 \nThe issue, of course, isn't that Floyd got a ring, but rather how he got it. \nFloyd was a member of the Arizona Cardinals for most of the season until he was released on December 14th, two days after a DUI incident. He was picked up by the Pats the the next day, which means he was on the team for a grand total of 17 days before collecting his ring. \nHe wasn't exactly a major part of the team, but in fairness, part of that was due to injury - which kept him on the sidelines following New England's first playoff game against Houston. That's right; Floyd didn't just not play in the Super Bowl , he didn't even play in the AFC Championship game . But he did, to his credit, earn more than $1.2 million for the pleasure . \nYes, yes, but what about his stats before the playoffs? Well, they're not much more impressive. \nFloyd hit the field for two games in the regular season for the Pats, started one , was targeted six times for four catches and a smooth 42 yards . He did catch one touchdown , though, so props on that I guess. \nIt's not unusual in other sports to withhold rings for players like this - in the Premier League, for example, players don't get a winner's medal until they make 10 appearances. So, with that in mind, we'll throw it over to you… Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/michael-foyd-patriots-stats-super-bowl-ring-51/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:38:02.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
