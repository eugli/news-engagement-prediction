Salt and chilly should be rubbed on their wounds, so that they scream for their lives. That is what I had got done when I was chief minister (of Madhya Pradesh from 2003 to 2004).\" \n\nThe Union minister of water resources also revealed that when a police officer objected to such treatment of the culprits, \"I told him people who behave like 'danav' (demons) have no human rights. Their heads should be cut off like Ravana's\". Bharti also claimed that she asked a rape survivor to watch the rapist's torture through a lockup window so that she could get some \"peace\". \n\nThis is the latest of the ascetic and senior BJP's leaders numerous controversial statements, including during her tenure as Union minister with the NDA government. Defending the surgical strikes by the armed forces in 2016, Bharti had said, in a reference to Opposition leaders, \"Those who seek evidence about surgical strikes should go to Pakistan\". \n\nThe ascetic, who was associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the early 1990s, came to prominence in that period for her fiery speeches against the Babri mosque structure. In 2004, she was forced to resign as chief minister of MP because of an arrest warrant in connection with the 1994 Hubli riots. \n\nAt the Thursday rally, Bharti also castigated the Akhilesh government for not doing enough to ensure that the alleged rapists weren't bailed out. She also criticized Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav for seeking votes for her husband's party, but not meeting the rape survivors. \n\nDefending BJP's Hindutva agenda, the Union minister said, \"When we talk about cow, Rama and Ganga, we are accused of dividing the country, whereas it was Congress who divided it.\" She added that \"efforts could be made\" to get back the parts which had been \"divided\" earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:22:17.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
