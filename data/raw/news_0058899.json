She hopes to be the role model that she never had growing up. \n“I feel very strongly that we have to have role models in this community,” van Oers said. “Our community is very young and we need different role models from different ages doing that kind of work and I think the work that really is important is that community building. \n“It’s that building of our own families.” \nvan Oers will be recognized at an awards ceremony on March 10 at the Lethbridge Lodge. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
