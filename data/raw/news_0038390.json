Bouchard, from Westmount, Que., went on a date with New England Patriots fan John Goehrke on Wednesday night after the two agreed to a bet over Twitter during Super Bowl 51.\nBouchard had tweeted that she “knew Atlanta would win” with the Falcons holding a big lead over the Patriots during the NFL’s championship game. The fan then asked her to go on a date if the Patriots somehow ended up winning and in what must have seemed like a low-risk reply, Bouchard said “sure.”\nAfter New England came back to win 34-28 in overtime she tweeted: “Lesson learned. Never bet against Tom Brady.”\nOn Wednesday, Bouchard followed through on the bet and tweeted a photo of the two of them in the backseat of a car with the caption “Just met my ‘Super Bowl Twitter Date’ John. On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!”\n Bouchard is ranked 42nd in the world. Earlier on Wednesday she announced that she would be included in Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit edition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:50:42.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
