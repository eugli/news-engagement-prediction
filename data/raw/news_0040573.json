However, it was 0.92 degrees Celsius warmer than the mean January temperature from 1951-1980. \nThey said two of the three top January temperature anomalies have been during the past two years. “2016 was the hottest on record, at 1.12 degrees Celsius warmer than the January mean temperature, followed by 2007 at 0.96 degrees Celsius warmer. January 2017 placed third,” NASA said. \nNASA says the monthly analysis by the scientists is assembled from publicly available data acquired by about 6,300 meteorological stations around the world, ship- and buoy-based instruments measuring sea surface temperature, and Antarctic research stations. \nThe modern global temperature record begins around 1880 because previous observations didn't cover enough of the planet.
