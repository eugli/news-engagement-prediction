Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nBut Trump does keep an eye on CNN and The New York Times , at the very least, if his past tweets pushing back against both are any indication. \nSo Gergen asked tonight, “He talks all the time about fake news… Why, then, does he spend so damn much time watching television news? It’s a mystery.” \nHe said the president should be avoiding cable news and Twitter and focus on the intel he’s getting from briefings, adding that the distractions are “not helpful to his presidency.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:18:23.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
