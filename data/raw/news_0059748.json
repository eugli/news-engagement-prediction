The device will come with a price tag of Rs 13,990 and will be available across retail outlets. The phone comes in three colour options – Black, Gold and Titanium. But the most interesting feature that the LG K10 has brought is the SOS panic button. The function of this button is to call the emergency number 112 in the case of some issue. The user needs to press the power button thrice in order for the phone to make the call. The phone will also be available on major online e-commerce websites from February 26. The LG K10 has first announced ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show 2017. \nIn India, the K10 (2017) smartphone supports 9 regional languages. The device also supports dual SIM (Nano), in India. Along with the new panic button, the smartphone also supports VoLTE and ViLTE in terms of connectivity. LG has also offered 45 days of Hungama subscription free for K10 2017 customers. The phone has a huge 120-degree wide angle camera and a unique design. This phone is the successor to the earlier device, LG K10 (2016). This time too LG seems to be targeting the saturated mid-range section. The K10 2017, however, was launched in the world market when the company had launched the LG K3, K4 and K8. \nIn terms of specifications, LG K10 (2017) smartphone has a 5.3-inch HD (720p) In-cell display screen. The K10 is powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz coupled with 2GB RAM and 16GB internal memory and can be expanded up to 2TB. The phone runs the latest Android 7.0. In the camera department, the front shooter is 5MP and has the 120 degrees angled wide lens. At the back, the phone has a 13 MP camera. The device is fueled by 2,800 mAh battery and has OTG support too. \nK10’s dimensions are 148.7×75.3×7.9mm and weigh 142 grams. The phone has most of the latest connectivity settings. While at the CES 2017, LG upgraded its last devices, K3, K4, K8 and K10, but in India, it has only brought the K10. It remains to be seen if LG will introduce the other models in India too.
