That’s ridiculous, I should know. All my life my mother has told me it was fashionable at the time.'” \nOn a subsequent trip to see his physician, Stewart asked, “By the way, my wife and I have had a little disagreement, I am circumcised, aren’t I?” Stewart continued, “He took a closer look and said, ‘Not! I am Jewish and definitely know the difference!'” \nAt this point, the X-Men star began to worry he had overshared. “Oh no, my grandchildren will be watching this!” he said with a laugh. \nStewart was joined on the British talk show by his X-Men costars, Sir Ian McKellan and Hugh Jackman , as well as singer James Blunt . In another revelation, Stewart and Jackman confirmed they will be retiring as X-Men after their new film Logan , which hits theaters March 3. \n“Last week, we were at a screening in Berlin sitting next to each other and when it got to the very emotional ending, and I noticed Hugh wipe away a tear. Then I did the same and during the credits he held my hand and I was done. I was weeping and sobbing,” Stewart said. “While the credits were rolling, I realized that if it was the end, there was no more perfect and beautiful way to say, ‘Au revoir, goodbye, adios.'”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:45:14.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
