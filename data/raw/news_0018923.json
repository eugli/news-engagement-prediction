Key points: Experts say legislation required to protect the supply of privatised power to the public There have been a string of blackouts disrupting businesses and customers in SA Text messages requesting 'AC switch-off' a possibility \nThe state's power supply was insufficient this week when wind-generated electricity was down and technical issues at three generators prevented them providing baseload power — prompting the Australian Energy Market Operator to turn off power to 90,000 customers in Adelaide . \nCritics said the situation could have been alleviated if AEMO ordered the turning on of a back-up generator at Pelican Point . \nAssociate Professor John Spoehr from the University of Adelaide said the NEM was all about maximising revenue for the generators, \"a so-called market-based system where generators are bidding into the market for the provision of energy\". \n\"That is responsible for some of the chaos we have seen,\" he said. \n\"It doesn't lend itself to the most reliable and most affordable outcomes for consumers and states.\" \nPremier Jay Weatherill yesterday pledged to spend a significant amount of money from the state's budget surplus to intervene in the market , but did not elaborate on what actions he would take. \nWednesday's outage was the latest in a string of blackouts that have been significantly disrupting SA businesses and customers. \nProfessor Spoehr said it was possible the Government would look to increase its self-sufficiency by going ahead with a gas-fired power station to provide 75 per cent of the Government's long-term needs. \nHe said it was also an opportunity for SA to make serious investment in solar thermal to provide baseload power, with projects on the drawing board in the state's Mid North. \n\"I think it is a good time to put in place two generation capabilities, one is gas, the other is a solar thermal plant,\" Professor Spoehr said. \nHe said another option was to spend the money on a second interconnector — SA currently relies on just one interconnector to Victoria — but this was less likely due to the high costs and a lukewarm attitude from the Federal Government to co-invest. \n\"And there's no guarantees we'll get sufficient electricity in additional interconnectors either, under certain conditions, where we've seen AEMO choose to load shed rather than get Pelican Point on screen,\" Professor Spoehr said.

(ABC News) Rules 'should be implemented' to favour public good \nProfessor Stefan Trueck from Macquarie University said rules were needed that allowed AEMO to enforce generators to dispatch power \"that doesn't make it necessary that AEMO negotiates with the Government first to make sure it's an emergency\". \n\"I think electricity is treated too much as a financial market — you need to have legislation in place to make sure the supply is guaranteed,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:39:29.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
