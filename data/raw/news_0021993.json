Photo: Andrew Meares \nOn Saturday, Ms Smith posted a statement in which she claimed the media is engaged in a \"witch hunt\" against her friend Mr Pickering and Mr Cameron. \n\"Larry is a friend and we don't see eye-to-eye on a number of issues including the issue of gays and also my Christian faith. But we are mature enough to engage in debate and not spit the dummy every time the other says something we don't like,\" Ms Smith wrote. \n\"To be clear â€“ I do not accept, condone or agree with Larry's statement. \n\"What disappoints me the most is that the media are on a witch hunt over Larry and Ross BUT completely ignore the fact that there are Muslims that actually do throw gays off buildings! Where is the same level of outrage directed at the Islamic practice that inspired Larry's comment? Absolutely condemn his comment but it is time the same offenderati brigade got equally worked up about the daily human rights abuses that are being carried out by some Muslims here and around the world.\" \n\"I felt in the context of his speech and his dry humour he had every right to say those things at a dinner defending freedom of speech. His walk through history and his dry, sharp humour highlighted the danger we now live in when the media elite and political class censor, abuse, deride and isolate people because they hold a different view. The SMH article was actually a perfect illustration of how when the media don't like something they throw their full weight behind whipping up offence and shutting people down without engaging in debate,\" she wrote. \nMr Cameron has resisted making an apology as some of his colleagues on Sky News distanced themselves from him. \nFormer Liberal MP Ross Cameron resisted making an apology for Thursday's derogatory remarks about gay people he made at the fundraiser, as colleagues and the NSW Liberal Party distanced themselves from him. \nSky News political editor David Speers called the Q Society event \"appalling\" and commentator Peter van Onselen said he was \"scared where this kind of hate is going\". \nThe Greens motion will note that \"Malcolm Turnbull's failure to rein in George Christensen [is a] tacit endorsement of the homophobic and Islamophobic views that this hate group espouses\" and the Prime Minister's silence \"sends a message to people of Islam faith that they are not welcome in Australia\". \nGreens leader Richard Di Natale said: \"There was a time that these views were not welcome inside the Coaltion. Senator Pauline Hanson was expelled from the Liberal Party for similar views but they are now clearly embraced inside the Coalition\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:46:50.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
