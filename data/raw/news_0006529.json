While the movie kicked off at the theatres with a bang over the extended weekend, it has understandably slowed down over the weekdays. 'Kaabil' made Rs 5.25 crore on Day 9 (Thursday) and its total collections now read an impressive Rs 90.63 crore. The Sanjay Gupta-directed film clashed with Shah Rukh Khan's ambitious project 'Raees' as the two films released together on January 25. 'Kaabil' is said to have got 40 per cent of the screens in comparison to SRK 's 'Raees'. While 'Raees' has already zoomed past the 100-crore mark, Hrithik 's film is heading towards making an entry into the coveted club. The good news is that both the films have made their mark at the box-office. In fact, 'Kaabil' has become the first Hindi film to be screened in Pakistan, after the ban on Bollywood releases was lifted. Proud producer Rakesh Roshan even took to Twitter on February 1 to announce, \"Yes it's true! Kaabil releasing tonight in Karachi & shows starting tomorrow across Pakistan\". The team of 'Kaabil' is even planning to host a success bash soon. Hrithik recently posted a video on Twitter, inviting all his fans across the country to join him in the celebration.
