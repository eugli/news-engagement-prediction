JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nFire burning down towards Governors Bay from Summit Rd. Ohinetahi homestead can be seen in the bottom of the image. \n\"All the work and tender loving care that's gone in that bush by those amazing volunteers has literally gone up in smoke,\" president Bill Woods said. \nREAD MORE: \nThe loss of \"some of the finest native preservation work on the Port Hills\" was devastating to the group and the community, he said. MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nBlackened bush in Ohinetahi Reserve in the hills above Governors Bay. \nThe society was working to re-establish native plants in the affected areas \"as quickly as possible\", and would work alongside local experts. \nSummit Road Society member Tony Edney said the new plants needed to be sourced locally, so the society would collect seeds from nearby, undisturbed bush for propagation as soon as cordons around the fire-affected areas were lifted. \n\"At the moment, native plants are seeding and so we need to be able to go in and collect seed . . . for next year's planting,\" he said. \n\"Time is of the essence.\" Ad Feedback \nTrees for Canterbury project coordinator Robin Stove said the fire destroyed \"decades of work\", particularly at Marleys Hill and Eastside Bush. \nThe annual volunteer planting days scheduled for May and June at Marleys Hill, Bowenvale, Dry Bush and Eastside Bush were \"up in the air\". \nLosing native trees impacted on the wider area's ecosystems, Stove said. \n\"It will take decades to recover.\" \nChristchurch City Council park rangers worked extensively with local groups to maintain native bush on the Port Hills, but their priority at the moment was to extinguish the fire, council regional parks manager Kay Holder said. \n\"When the fire is out we will be working with the communities to provide further planting opportunities.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:08:14.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
