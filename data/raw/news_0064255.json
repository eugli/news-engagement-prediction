The staff are waiting for me. Their shotguns are ready in hand. \n\"You are not right in the deep forest, but there are a lot of wild elephants roaming around here, so, be careful and stay close to us,\" Watchara Thammasorn, chief of the Centre to Revive Phu Luang Wild Elephants' Food, warns. \nSteps from his office, I notice I am trekking on a dirt trail which is filled up with huge footprints. Each is a bit over a foot wide. Of course, they are elephant tracks. \n\"Come on, we are going to make an additional salt lick for them,\" he points to the site in the deeper part of the forest. His staff are digging a shallow hole. Then huge amounts of sea salt and mineral supplement for cattle are dumped into the pool bed and mixed with soil. Now, a new mineral rich salt lick is ready to serve. \nMaking a salt lick is just part of his duty. Watchara and his staff work hard to keep elephants away from farms that surround the wildlife sanctuary. \nFrom dusk to dawn, elephants from Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary often go out of the sanctuary's territory to feed on crops from nearby farms, and sometimes, attack farmers who protect their plantations. \nDuring her visit to Phu Luang in the year 2000, Queen Mother Sirikit acknowledged the problem and initiated this project to cope with the situation. \nTourists and staff make a salt lick for the wild elephants. Peerawat Jariyasombat \nPhu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, in Loei province, is surrounded by 12 villages and 200,000 rai of farmland. Inadequate food during dry season drives wild elephants to roam out of the forest to search for food. Rice paddies, sugarcane plantations and fruit orchards are quite tempting for them. \nThe limited area of the wildlife sanctuary is another factor of the problem. Naturally, when male elephants mature, they are driven from the herd. The bull elephant lives alone and makes its new territory. \n\"Making new salt licks is only part of our job. We revive the old neglected salt licks by adding mineral supplements. By the year 2014, 25 salt licks were made and elephants visit all of them. In 2016, more 25 salt licks are added but only 23 of them attract elephants. The remaining two are neglected, we do not know why.\" \nWatchara and his team cultivate crops,like bananas and Burmese grape, which constitute the wild elephants natural diet. They also dig pools to provide more water sources in the forest. \n\"Wild elephants are keen enough to keep their water sources clean. They play at one pool and drink water from another.\" \nWith more food sources, the elephant population has expanded, from 50 in 1999, to more than 100 currently. The wildlife sanctuary has the capacity for about 130 elephants, Watchara said. \nThe Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary is the first place in Thailand to use an electric fence to keep wild elephants in. The fence has been extended from 5km to 12km recently and new poles are used. \n\"During the first three years, the electric fence worked very well. By the fourth year, the elephants began to destroy the fence by pulling down the poles.\" \nA new version of the electric fence comes with additional wires connected to compression spring poles that resume to the original position after being stepped on by the gigantic creatures. \nWith new fence, elephant invasions were reduced to 52 last year from 244 in 2015. \nA \"beehive\" fence is another successful trick of the project to keep elephants at bay. Beehives are placed on ropes that stretch between the poles. If an elephant touches the rope, the vibration causes the bees to leave their hive and frighten away the elephants. \nBesides keeping the elephants off their land, farmers earn more from the honey. \nWatchara says the fences are so successful that his team can sleep through most nights without worrying about the elephants crossing into the farmland. \n\"We do not hate elephants. We love them all and hope they can share the place with people.\" \nThe Centre to Revive Phu Luang Wild Elephants' Food is located in Wang Sapung District of Loei province. Tourists can contribute by subsidising the salt lick programme at 8,000 baht per site and participate in making a salt lick. Call 081-871-6478. \nBeehives are the new tools used to keep elephants away from nearby farms.
