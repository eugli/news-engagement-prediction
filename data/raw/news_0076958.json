He died at his owner’s home and his “body was disposed of”, a NSW Police spokeswoman said. \nPolice said the cause of death was unknown but 7 News reports the puppy choked on a dog treat . \nThe sad confirmation follows fresh pleas from police yesterday for information about the whereabouts of Egg. \nEgg had been ‘missing’ since February 9, when his owner came forward with his story the pooch had been snatched. \nIt sparked a public appeal to help find the pooch. Egg’s 29-year-old owner told police the three men armed with knives had approached him as he walked the dog near Sydney Olympic Park. \nThey demanded his wallet and backpack, and also took baby Egg, he claimed, and he even provided detailed description of the ‘dognappers’. \nThe 29-year-old man has been charged with making a false report of armed robbery and is due to appear at Burwood Local Court in April. \nRIP, Egg.
