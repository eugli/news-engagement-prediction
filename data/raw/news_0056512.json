Police say they found “evidence” at the site but have not revealed what they found. \nNews of the property connection comes as police confirm they were called last year to investigate the area on the tip offs of locals. \nA Mount Macedon resident, who gave his name only as Dean, told police he witnessed two men matching the description of the brothers bogged in a white truck on Salisbury Road in the days after her disappearance. \nThe spot is metres from where Ms Ristevski's remains were found. \nDean said he came forward after spending \"sleepless nights\" wondering if what he saw was connected to the missing Ms Ristevski. \nIt was also revealed this morning police fitted a tracking device to a car used by Borce in the months after Ms Ristevski disappeared but it was either removed or fell off, The Age reports. \nIt is not unusual for tracking devices to be fitted to the vehicles of suspects, sources close to the investigation told the newspaper. \nPolice also believe Mr Ristevski had been warned against speaking on phones and could have been given information about investigative techniques homicide detectives use. \nMr Ristevski visited the office of leading criminal lawyer Rob Stary on Wednesday. Mr Stary has since claimed police consider Mr Ristevski the \"number one suspect\" in the murder investigation, but maintains his client’s innocence. Mr Ristevski was interviewed by police shortly after his wife’s disappearance and released. \nMs Ristevski's body was found on Monday wedged between two logs in bushland. She had been missing since June 29 last year. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 TRENDING VIDEO 'This is not Trump's America!': Passenger accused of racism kicked off flight A US man who was accused of taunting a Pakistani couple while they were boarding a flight has found himself booted from the plane – to the cheers of fellow passengers.
