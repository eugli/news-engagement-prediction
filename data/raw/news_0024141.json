Neung Kongsom had the knife raised as police jumped out of the car and shot him. He later died. Peter Poulson, holding his grandchildren Malee and Bas. Source: News Limited \nThis is a nightmare unimaginable for many, but for Ms Poulson this is her reality. Having lived it herself, she now fights against the horror of domestic violence. \nAt the end of this month, Ms Poulson will speak out at the National Family Violence Summit in Canberra about the lack of understanding around domestic violence and what needs to change. \nNot only was Ms Poulson’s sister a victim of domestic violence, but she herself also suffered \nfrom having an abusive partner. \nHe would pinch and twist her skin and push and shove her around. At first, she didn’t even realise she was being abused. \n“Domestic violence is not just full-on punching,” she told news.com.au. \n“You have emotional, psychological and sexual abuse as well and some of it is hard to pinpoint.” \nMs Poulson said if a man told a woman what to wear or texted her 50 times a day, he could be an abusive partner because he was controlling. \nPeople who are put down or criticised by their partners could also be victims of domestic violence. \nMs Poulson said her partner would criticise her for how she would maintain the house and her parenting skills. \nThe terrifying thing about violent partners is sometimes it’s not discovered until people are deep in relationships and often women in particular will fall in love with a charming persona before they turn evil and violent. \nIn her book about her traumatic experiences with domestic violence, Killing Love , Ms Poulson says Kongsom was clever in the end. \n“He had outwitted us all. His threats had only ever been about self harm, which had us dancing attendance on him,” she wrote. \n“He knew it was a weak point; our family had been riddled with the guilt of Adrian’s suicide for ten years. \n“How gleeful and superior he must have felt as we handed Malee and Bas over to him, again and again ... we thought they were safe with him. Neung was claiming our lives too. His rage was seeping out.” Bas Kongsom.
