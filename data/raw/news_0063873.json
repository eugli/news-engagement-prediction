ring finger at Brits \nRumours have been swirling for months about their pair's relationship FROM DAN WOOTTON'S BIZARRE COLUMN 23rd February 2017, 8:00 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments IT has been the biggest secret in showbiz, with ADELE and her partner SIMON KONECKI refusing to confirm whether they have married despite months of speculation. \nBut at Wednesday night’s Brit Awards the charity boss finally let the cat out of the bag. Adele accepted her Brit award all the way from Australia ITV 8 The ring was visible in her video \nI can reveal that Simon was wearing a wedding ring as he attended the biggest night in British music solo this week — confirming he has tied the knot with the pop superstar. \nWhile Global Success award winner Adele was missing from the ceremony due to her tour preparations in Australia, Simon was there for the second-year running, going as incognito as possible with a table tucked away right at the back of London’s O2 Arena. \nYet despite efforts to keep his left hand concealed, his new gold ring was in clear view. Getty Images 8 The cat is out of the bag, Adele and Simon got hitched \nA source revealed: “Simon was sat right at the back of the venue, away from all the other artists and celebrities. \n“He was wearing a gold ring on his wedding finger. He did try his best to keep it hidden for a lot of the evening but it was blatantly obvious. \n“It’s amazing that the pair of them have married and even more impressive they have managed to keep it quiet. related stories Arsenal ace Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain claims he gives BRIT-winning girlfriend Perrie Edwards 'street cred' 'I'D LOVE TO GO BACK' Emmerdale beauty Gemma Atkinson eyes up a return to Casualty STILL PLAYING THE FIELD Jamie O'Hara and Lauren Pope exchange numbers at London dinner before leaving TOGETHER 'shout out to zm!'

It was very cute. \n“He snuck off home 15 minutes before the ceremony finished.” Getty Images 8 Adele was also spotted with a ring on her left hand \nAdele and Simon, who has been married once before, have been together since 2011 and had their first child, Angelo, the following year. \nThe singer gave the biggest hint yet about the pair’s marital status at last week’s Grammys, when she referred to Simon as her “husband” on stage during her thank yous. Adele arrive s in Sydney with her son Angelo as she disembarks from a private jet \nDuring her pre-recorded acceptance speech at the Brits she was also wearing a gold band on her wedding finger. \nAdele is now the most decorated female in the history of the Brit Awards with nine gongs. \nNow she’s married she’ll have to give half of them to Simon. \nREAD ON FOR THE REST OF DAN WOOTTON'S BIZARRE COLUMN Mayor the merrier, Katy \nKATY PERRY ’s skeleton jibe at US President DONALD TRUMP and PM THERESA MAY during the Brits wasn’t her only political stunt of the night. \nThe singer buddied up with the Mayor of London SADIQ KHAN at her record label Universal’s official after-party. 8 Sadiq Khan caught up with Katy at the party \nThe Labour politician made a beeline for the US superstar as soon as he arrived at the bash, held at 180 The Strand in London. \nUnsurprisingly after her anti-May performance, they got on like a house on fire. \nA source revealed: “Katy was sitting in her own area of the room chatting to ELLIE GOULDING when Sadiq left his wife for a moment and bowled up to meet her. \n“Her security let him straight through and Katy recognised him straight away and stood up to give him a hug. \n“They talked for at least five minutes, whipsering in each other’s ears and joking away.” 8 \nSpeaking after their introduction, an excitable Sadiq said: “I love Katy Perry! It’s great to meet her.” \nKaty celebrated her amazing night by getting on the decks with Radio 1’s NICK GRIMSHAW and Ellie, while NICOLE SCHERZINGER turned up late before catching up with her old X Factor chum JAMES ARTHUR . Abbey days 8 Abbey was a bit worse for wear at the party \nABBEY CLANCY smashed the free bar while her Premier League star husband PETER CROUCH talked music with NIALL HORAN and NOEL GALLAGHER . \nShe stumbled out of the Warner party, going all camera shy – a huge contrast to how she went in. \nWalking tipsy in those heels is an art in itself. bizbit MAISIE WILLIAMS has managed to complete six series of Game of Thrones without her character facing serious harm. But the sozzled actress nearly came a croper after stacking it down a stair case. However, she managed to style out the stumble by instantly recreating the SPICE GIRLS ’ Wannabe video. MATT HEALY from The 1975 came close to overshadowing his band’s first ever Brit during the ceremony. The frontman, who earlier picked up the Best Group gong, smoked a suspicious-looking cigarette under his table when ED SHEERAN was performing. It was all captured on video and posted online. Naughty boy. SARA COX told me on the red carpet she’d knocked back three gin and tonics while waiting for pal NICK GRIMSHAW before the show. She later watched his DJ set at the Universal party from behind the decks, dancing more than those facing the Radio One Breakfast Show host. She’s clearly still got it. PIXIE LOTT gave Abbey her nearest competition for the most worse for wear female star. Perhaps preparing for her future Hen party, the singer looked very bleary eyed as she left the Warner party in her metallic dress. Fiance OLIVER CHESHIRE kept her standing on the way out. What a gentlemen. CONOR MAYNARD used the Warner after- party to scout out as many single girls asa possible. He was spotted flirting and exchanging numbers with KISS FM presenter CHARLIE HEDGES . You plon-Kerr \nCHARLI XCX ’s ex-boyfriend MIKE KERR , from Brit Award-winning band ROYAL BLOOD , was close to being turfed out of the Warner after-party. \nHe shocked guests by attempting to climb over a wall inside in the exclusive bash before security pulled him down. \nThey threatened to throw him out unless he behaved. \nMike was taken out into the corridor and given a telling-off by four staff members as pals begged for him to stay. The rocker was given a second chance as long as he promised to remain on the ground. \nFellow guest Charli appeared to be on good terms with her ex as they came face to face. \nThe two greeted each other before keeping a good distance as they continued to enjoy the night. \nHowever, Charli looked suitably unimpressed by his Spider-Man stunt. Here's looking at shoe \nTHEY’VE managed to keep their romance largely under the radar. \nBut ED SHEERAN and Cherry Seaborn made up for that on Wednesday, snogging non-stop. Xposure 8 Ed and Cherry were spotted getting cosy at the party \nEd and his childhood sweetheart smooched more than 12 times in less than two hours at Warner Music and Ciroc’s after-party. \nVIP onlookers included B IFFY CLYRO’s SIMON NEIL, CAROLINE FLACK, CHARLI XCX and KANO . Ed, who performed with SKEPTA at the bash, was a perfect gent too, giving Cherry his trainers after she bust a heel, above. Speaking exclusively, Cherry revealed: “I broke them dancing. I was like, ‘Babes, you need to support me’.” \nHumble Ed added: “It’s impossible wearing Louboutins. I could never do it.” His doctor will be glad to hear it. A Bugg's strife \nJAKE BUGG was feeling broken and bruised yesterday – but it wasn’t to do with a hangover from the free booze. \nThe singer was almost booted out of the Universal afterparty after getting into an early-hours scuffle with three guys. \nMy source said: “It was moving like a brawl through the top floor of the party. \n“It was unclear what started it, but one quick-thinking guest stepped in fast, grabbed Jake with both arms and pulled him away, telling him it wasn’t worth risking his career over. \n“The security were aware and nearly chucked him out, but let him stay after he calmed down. But Jake properly saw red and was playing the hard man.” \nEarlier, Jake confirmed his romance with LEONARDO DiCAPRIO ’s model ex ROXY HORNER as he swanned around with her on his arm, two months after I revealed they were dating. \nShe will nurse him better. Alex sees cred \nALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN thinks he has made PERRIE EDWARDS cooler – by dating her. \nSpeaking exclusively at the Brits, the Arsenal ace boasted: “I’m giving her street cred.” \nThe couple made the most of their first official appearance tog-ether by publicly kissing while celebrating LITTLE MIX scooping a gong for Best British Single. \nThey partied until 3am at London club Mahiki with pals including bandmate LEIGH-ANNE PINNOCK. \nEarlier in the night , a tipsy JESY NELSON shocked Perrie by mentioning her former fiancé ZAYN MALIK in a backstage interview. A post shared by Chris Clark (@chrisjclark_) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:25pm PST \nLeigh-Anne joked that they wanted to thank their former partners after winning an award for Shout Out To My Ex when Jesy said: “Shout out to ZM.” \nShe was later seen cosying up to rumoured boyfriend, Towie star CHRIS CLARK . \nHe shared a photograph on Instagram of himself with Jesy outside the O2 Arena. \nShe’ll definitely boost his street cred.
