The map shows the distribution of ancestral birth locations associated with these clusters\nHOW THEY DID IT AncestryDNA scientists analysed genome-wide genotype data from 774,516 Americans.\nWith this sample, the team then uncovered the patterns of ‘identity-by-descent’ (IBD).\nIBD can 'reveal signatures of recent demographic history,' they explain in the paper.\nBy identifying groups of individuals that were slightly related to each other, they were able to spot the 'clusters' - or, genetic communities.\nIn the study, published to Nature Communications , AncestryDNA scientists analysed genome-wide genotype data from 774,516 Americans.\nWith this sample, the team then uncovered the patterns of ‘identity-by-descent’ (IBD).\n'Following the arrival of Columbus and his contemporaries, population expansion in the Americas has proceeded at an exceptionally rapid pace, with factors such as war, slavery, disease and climate shaping human demography,' the researchers wrote.\n‘We first created a network of genetically-identified relationships – based on DNA alone – among over 700,000 individuals who consented to research,’ the AncestryDNA team explains in a blog post .\n‘Using network analysis techniques, we identified clusters of individuals in the network: groups of individuals who are slightly more related to one another than to individuals outside their cluster.\n‘In other words, from genetic data we identified novel ‘population structure’ – subtly different groups of individuals within a larger population.’\nThe researchers grouped the clusters into four broad categories: intact immigrant, continental admixed, assimilated immigrant, and post-migration isolated groups.\nThe first cluster, they say, likely came about from population structures that existed prior to immigration to the US.\nIn the study, scientists analysed genome-wide genotype data from 774,516 Americans. With this sample, the team then uncovered the patterns of ‘identity-by-descent’ (IBD). The researchers grouped the clusters into four broad categories: intact immigrant, continental admixed, assimilated immigrant, and post-migration isolated groups\nThis included clusters of Finnish, Scandinavian, Jewish, and Irish ancestries – groups who came to the country in large numbers within the last 200 years – as well as African Americans and individuals of Polynesian ancestry.\nIn addition, the team included Acadians and French Canadians, who they found to have clusters with ‘clear geographic concentrations both within and outside the United States.’\nAdmixed clusters largely represented Hispanic/Latino populations, including groups from Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nThe third group, the researchers found, accounted for the majority of the samples, with the five largest clusters described as assimilated immigrant clusters.\nMaking up 60 percent of the samples, assimilated immigrants ‘exhibit a markedly different profile,’ the authors wrote, and lacked ‘distinctive affiliations to non-US populations.’\nAMERICA'S IMMIGRANT GROUPS The researchers grouped the clusters into four broad categories: intact immigrant, continental admixed, assimilated immigrant, and post-migration isolated groups.\nIntact immigrant clusters:\n· African Americans : The researchers found that this group appeared to originate in the US in the coastal plans of North and South Carolina, pushing west until it hit eastern Texas. According to the team, the pattern coincides with regions that have both high self-reported African ancestry and regions that historically practiced slavery.\n· European Jewish : This was one of the largest clusters found in the study. This cluster was most strongly represented in New York and Chicago, where large numbers of Jewish immigrants arrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n· Portuguese : While it’s known that the many Portuguese immigrants began to come to the US in the late 19th century, flocking to the eastern US, the study does not reflect this. The researchers believe this is likely due to the arrival of many other groups in this region as well. But, it does show immigration to a number of cities in California, including the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area, Santa Cruz, the Central Valley, and San Diego. But, they also found another surge, mainly in the Northeast in the mid to late 20th century.\n· Eastern Europeans : The researchers identify this group as the ‘Midwest immigrants.’ Some of these clusters, they say, relate to geographic structure and immigration patterns from Eastern Europe. Between 1840 and 1870, they found that immigrants mostly came from Hungary, Poland, Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Italy, heading for New York and Pennsylvania. They also found a cluster linked to German, Dutch, and Eastern Europeans where people were mostly found in the Midwest.\n· Northern Europe : This cluster included Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegians and Scandinavians. These groups came to the country in large numbers within the last 150-200 years.\n· Irish : According to the researchers, six million Irish came to the US in the 19th century.\n· Polynesians, East Asians, and Hawaiians : For this group, the researchers say Hawaiians represent the Polynesian population with some East Asian mixture. The study shows Hawaiians likely remained genetically isolated due to their geographical distance, though there has recently been abrupt population changes and growth.\nIn addition, the team included Acadians and French Canadians, who they found to have clusters with ‘clear geographic concentrations both within and outside the United States.’ The map shows the origins of Cajuns/Acadians in Atlantic Canada (blue) and migration of French Canadians (magenta) to the US\nContinental admixed groups :\nAdmixed clusters largely represented Hispanic/Latino populations, including groups from Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nThe researchers broke these clusters down to include Mexico clusters, New Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans (though they do not distinguish PR from other Caribbean Island peoples).\nAssimilated immigrant groups:\nThe third group, the researchers found, accounted for the majority of the samples, with the five largest clusters described as assimilated immigrant clusters.\nMaking up 60 percent of the samples, assimilated immigrants ‘exhibit a markedly different profile,’ the authors wrote, and lacked ‘distinctive affiliations to non-US populations.’\nOne of these clusters is the Pennsylvania cluster, accounting for massive amounts of Germans that arrived in the country in the 1700s.\nAbout 80,000 Germans immigrated between 1717 and 1775, settling in Philadelphia, southeast Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.\n‘By 1760, 50,000 Germans had settled in southeast Pennsylvania alone,’ the authors write. ‘At the time, Germans constituted the largest ethnic group in the colony with a distinct language, religious culture, and identity.’\nPost-migration isolated groups:\nThe researchers also identified clusters that are thought to have experienced some form of isolation, whether geographic or cultural, though they maintained high levels of diversity and gene flow.\nThis includes the Amish, along with a group in Utah likely linked to the decedents of Mormon settlers, and a cluster thought to represent the residents of Appalachia, ‘who experienced delayed economic development and regional isolation up until the 20th century.’\nAnd, they identified a sub cluster linked to Mennonites throughout the Great Plains.\n‘Genealogical data reveal a north-to-south trend, most consistently east of the Mississippi River,’ the authors explain.\n‘These findings imply greater east-west than north-south gene flow, which is broadly consistent with recent westward expansion of European settlers in the United States, and possibly somewhat limited north-south migration due to cultural differences.’\nThe researchers also identified clusters that are thought to have experienced some form of isolation, whether geographic or cultural, though they maintained high levels of diversity and gene flow.\nThis includes the Amish, along with a group in Utah likely linked to the decedents of Mormon settlers, and a cluster thought to represent the residents of Appalachia, ‘who experienced delayed economic development and regional isolation up until the 20th century.’\nThe researchers say the analysis makes for a much finer picture of the genetic communities across the United States, and the histories behind them.\nWith this new methodology, the AncestryDNA team explains it’s now possible to see ‘how specific groups of people are connected through their DNA, what places they called home, and which migration paths they followed to get there – allowing genetics to reveal the history in a more recent time period than ever before.’\nTHE PENNSYLVANIA CLUSTER OF GERMANS One of these clusters is the Pennsylvania cluster, accounting for massive amounts of Germans that arrived in the country in the 1700s.\nAbout 80,000 Germans immigrated between 1717 and 1775, settling in Philadelphia, southeast Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.\n‘By 1760, 50,000 Germans had settled in southeast Pennsylvania alone,’ the authors write.\nThe influx of German immigrants included Moravians, who founded the city of Bethlehem in 1741. The city is pictured in the 18th century illustration above\n‘At the time, Germans constituted the largest ethnic group in the colony with a distinct language, religious culture, and identity.’\nAccording to the researchers, this group married within for many generations, and remained stable over the years.\nThe German immigrants who came to Pennsylvania were ‘remarkably diverse,’ according to ExplorePAHistory .\nThose who identified as German came from all over central Europe, many fleeing intolerance and persecution, while others sought economic and social freedom.\nPennsylvania German is a variety of West Central German spoken by the Amish and Old Order Mennonites in the United States and Canada, closely related to the Palatine dialects.\nOne of these clusters is the Pennsylvania cluster, accounting for massive amounts of Germans that arrived in the country in the 1700s. About 80,000 Germans immigrated between 1717 and 1775, settling in Philadelphia, southeast Pennsylvania, and New Jersey\nThere are believed to be more than 300,000 native speakers in North America.\nIt has traditionally been the language of the Pennsylvania Dutch, descendants of late 17th- and early 18th-century immigrants to Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina from southern Germany, eastern France (Alsace and Lorraine), and Switzerland.\nIn Pennsylvania, the German immigrants were predominantly farmers, and lived in tight-knit communities, distancing themselves from the ‘mainstream “English” world that surrounded them,’ the site explains.", "external_links": ["http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-150", "https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2017/02/07/nature-communications-publishes-ancestrydna-breakthrough-on-genetic-communities/", "http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14238"], "published": "2017-02-08T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:40:13.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
