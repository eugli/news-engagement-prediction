He hugs a supporter in front of the Manhattan Supreme Court in this file photo from 2009. (Hagen, Kevin Freelance NYDN/Freelance, NYDN) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  04 PM \nA man imprisoned 18 years for a murder he did not commit will receive a $7 million settlement from the city, his lawyer said. \nFernando Bermudez spent nearly two decades behind bars for gunning down 16-year-old Raymond Blount outside a Greenwich Village nightclub on Aug. 4, 1991, according to reports and the National Registry of Exonerations. \nBermudez, who a jury found guilty of second-degree murder in 1992, was 22 at the time of his conviction. \nAll five witnesses who implicated Bermudez recanted their testimony in 1993 — saying cops had pressured them into identifying him as the gunman, the exoneration registry has noted. \nBermudez, now 48, began his legal fight with the city and state six years ago. \"Fernando will never recover what he has lost - which is 18 years of liberty. But this provides some closure to six years of litigation,\" says lawyer Michael Lamonsoff. (Hagen, Kevin Freelance NYDN/Freelance, NYDN) \nWhile the state settled with Bermudez for $4.75 million in 2014, the city didn't agree to a settlement until Wednesday, according to his lawyer, Michael Lamonsoff. \n“Fernando will never recover what he has lost — which is 18 years of liberty,” Lamonsoff told the Daily News. “But this provides some closure to six years of litigation.” \nThe NYPD deferred to the Law Department for comment. It did not immediately answer to an inquiry. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:38:32.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
