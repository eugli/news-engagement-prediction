He became involved with National Action, described as a ‘small, secretive Neo-Nazi British youth nationalist organisation’. Yesterday a judge gave the boy a three-year Youth Rehabilitation Order because he had already served the equivalent of a 14-month sentence on remand. Pictured, the teenager's terrifying Snapchat messages It was said to be a ‘white supremacist group’ which was ‘anti-Muslim, anti-black, anti-Semitic and anti-gay’. Evidence of his shocking views were revealed on his social media exchanges, the court was told. One Snapchat image was of a mosque being blown up along with the words: ‘It’s time to enact retribution upon the Muslim filth.’ Another was a picture of a pipe bomb with an image of the Bradford skyline and the message: ‘Incendiary explosive and home-made black powder. More to come.’ The defendant told fellow extremists on one message: ‘I make miniature pipe bombs... just f*** around with them.’ Prosecutor Barnaby Jameson said the pipe bomb was ‘more to do with an ideological war he was waging’. On the day last June that Mrs Cox was murdered by Thomas Mair in her West Yorkshire constituency, the teenager posted a picture of the killer on Facebook. His message read: ‘Tommy Mair is a HERO. There’s one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man.’ Dressed in combat jacket and trousers and steel-capped army boots, he ‘revealed his true colours’ by making it clear he denied the Holocaust and believed men were superior to women The court heard he attended a meeting with his mother last July at his college after being found to have put up racist posters on the site. When police entered his bedroom they found it covered in flags, including the Swastika and the symbol of the Waffen SS. Pictured, one of the boy's Snapchats Dressed in combat jacket and trousers and steel-capped army boots, he ‘revealed his true colours’ by making it clear he denied the Holocaust, believed women were inferior to men and should stay at home to raise children and that whites were more important than other races, the court heard. When police entered his bedroom they found it covered in flags, including the Swastika and the symbol of the Waffen SS. His laptop screensaver was an image of a Nazi eagle over a Swastika and a German phrase, which translates to ‘One Nation, One Empire, One Leader.’ The teenager told police he made the bomb from sparklers and cut off the fuse from a firework. He said in a statement when interviewed: ‘I’ve simply been fooling around with fireworks and showing them off to my peers in my naivety. I have never had the intention to cause any harm to any person.’ The defendant said in the witness box that he only posted a picture of the pipe bomb to see if he could get a reaction and then put it back in his drawer. He said he did not plan to attack anybody.
