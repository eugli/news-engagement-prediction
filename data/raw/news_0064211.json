Share on Twitter Print This Post \nDonald Trump has officially rescinded an Obama-era protection for transgender students on Wednesday, less than a year after former President Barack Obama introduced it . \nAccording to Reuters, the Trump administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court that they are abandoning the previous administration’s directive that allows public school students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. \nTweet: \n— Reuters Politics (@ReutersPolitics) February 23, 2017 \nOfficials in Betsy DeVos’ Department of Education and Jeff Sessions’ Department of Justice notified the nation’s highest court that, going forward, they would ignore the Obama administration’s guidelines and leave the issue up to individual states. \nIf your state wants to discriminate against LGBT Americans, have at it, the Trump administration says. \nWhile this is obviously a devastating blow for advocates of LGBTQ rights in this country, it’s also unsurprising. Remember, two days after Sessions was confirmed as the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Justice announced that they would no longer defend these protections in court. \nWednesday’s move is just the latest step in Donald Trump’s quest to turn back the clock on civil rights in America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:53:28.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
