[ 40 Nobel laureates, thousands of academics sign protest of Trump immigration order ] \n“I’m establishing a new vetting measure to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,” Trump said when he signed the order. “We don’t want them here. We want to make sure we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.” \nThe measure immediately drew strong reaction. Some welcomed the order as a much-needed way to strengthen national security and filter out extremists. But many others responded with alarm, protests and legal challenges, arguing that the ban was morally incompatible with American principles.

(Susan Walsh/AP) \nChristopher Eisgruber, the president of Princeton University, wrote the original draft of the letter with University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann and then asked others to sign on. The weight of the executive order felt personal, Eisgruber said. \nIt was personal in terms of his commitment to higher education, what it is and what it stands for, he explained. It was personal because of his research and experience as a scholar of religious liberties. And it was personal because of his own family history. \n“My mother was a refugee from war-torn Europe,” he said. “If a refugee ban had been in place, she and her parents almost certainly would be killed.” [ “I am trusting the American people\": Yale professor worries he, his wife and baby won’t be allowed back into the U.S. after Trump’s executive order ] \nHe said his father was an exchange student who emigrated from Germany five years after World War II. Had the United States treated his father as a likely enemy, Eisgruber said, he never would have been able to pursue his life here. \n“When I see immigrants affected by this order, their story resonates with me, and how my family was treated,” he said by phone Thursday evening. \nPrinceton, like other universities, is trying to help its students and scholars affected by the order, Eisgruber said, as some are unable to re-enter the country to continue their studies or teach, and many more are worried about the future.

The vetting procedures already in place are rigorous. Improvements to them should be based on evidence, calibrated to real risks, and consistent with constitutional principle. \n“Throughout its history America has been a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom in the world. It has attracted talented people to our shores and inspired people around the globe. This executive order is dimming the lamp of liberty and staining the country’s reputation. We respectfully urge you to rectify the damage done by this order.” \nTwo spokesmen for the administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the letter on Thursday. \nRead the letter in full here: \nFebruary 2, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:27:39.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
