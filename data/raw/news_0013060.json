Night Shyamalan’s Master Plan Is in Motion The surprise box-office hit is just the juice the director needed to launch a cinematic universe. by Twitter Courtesy of Universal Pictures. M. Night Shyamalan is back on top, and he’s ready to make the most of his moment. The director’s latest film, Split , has been quietly topping the box office for the last three consecutive weeks in a row, making it the only film in Shyamalan’s catalogue to achieve such a feat since The Sixth Sense —which held the top spot for five weeks, according to Deadline . Thus far, the thriller starring James McAvoy as a kidnapper with violent split personalities has raked in about $98.4 million. And it turns out there’s good news for fans who can’t get enough of the film—Shyamalan is already working on a Split sequel. “I have an 11 page outline for my next film in my bag. I can’t tell you what it is, but If you’ve seen #Split...” he tweeted on Saturday. \nhttps://twitter.com/MNightShyamalan/status/827951147470225408 Spoiler alert : Split in itself is already a sequel of sorts to Shyamalan’s film Unbreakable , though we won’t say what gives that fact away. ( Read here if you must know.) But now that Spilt is a box-office hit, Shyamalan can go full steam ahead with building an entire Unbreakable cinematic universe (who knew that would ever be a thing?). Cinematic worlds are all the rage now, and it would probably make Universal very happy to nurture another little franchise, especially if future films within it can be made on budgets as low as Split ’s (a shocking $9 million). The new Split sequel also feeds Shyamalan’s master plan for his movies. In a recent interview with Cinema Blend , the director revealed that he essentially owns all the rights to his films so that no one else can make sequels to them without his permission. “I took care of all the right stuff,” he said. Perhaps, then, the Shyamalaneissance is nigh? After a string of flops ( After Earth , The Last Airbender ), the filmmaker redeemed himself last year with comedic horror film The Visit . Made on a meager $5 million budget, it ended up pulling about $98.4 million worldwide, setting the stage for Split ’s success. Now there’s a comeback story with a juicy plot twist—and more to come.
