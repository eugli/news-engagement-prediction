Source: AFP \nAustralian Test legend Kerry O’Keeffe has criticised the home side for their attitude as India were rocked by Steve Smith’s men on day two. \nO’Keeffe told Triple M’s The Weekenders program that Australia had simply fought harder throughout the Test match so far, outworking their heavily favoured hosts. \n“All the predictions were 4-0 India, 3-0 India,” O’Keeffe said. \n“But Steve Smith you can tell in his face, he said ‘stuff that, we’re going to go over there and win’.” \n“India have played arrogantly. They’ve fielded like Pakistan, they’ve stood there when they’ve been caught out asking to go to the third umpire and we’re making them pay for it. \n“There’s something about this (Australian) team. They’re a driven group of men.” \nIndia came into the Test series in incredible form and had not lost a Test for 20 matches. It’s an undefeated streak that stretches back to 2015, but O’Keeffe says that dominance is a thing of the past. \n“The spider has been caught in its web and it’s being eaten alive by Aussie mozzies,” O’Keeffe stated. \nMuch maligned spinner Steve O’Keefe was the hero for Australia, taking six wickets in a devastating display of bowling. \nShane Warne was critical of O’Keefe early on day two, but the similarly named leg-spinner says Australia’s star is as intelligent bowler as you will find. \n“Warney is a hater because he doesn’t have the viper, he hasn’t the big breaker,” O’Keeffe said. \n“But what he has got — he knows his game, he’s clever, he varies his pace. Some deliveries are ACDC other deliveries are Jose Feliciano.” O'Keefe puts Aussies on top 4:28 \nCricket: In the space of 25 deliveries Steve O'Keefe may have changed his career forever. In that time he took six Indian wickets and swung the first test in Australia's favour. India in tatters at the end of day two.
