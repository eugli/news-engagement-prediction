(Typically the iconic lingerie brand holds its presentation or show in Milan). It should come as no surprise that the Vogue cover star will be walking the show, either. Jenner has modeled lingerie for Victoria’s Secret and for the Spring 2017 La Perla campaign, and off the runway she has perhaps made the lacy bedroomwear an integral part of her day-to-day uniform. By night, she’s been known to don slinky pieces such as a lace-trimmed slip with a leopard-print robe for a New Year’s Eve party or a long lace skirt on top of high-waisted panties while heading out with friend and fellow model Cara Delevingne . And, of course, Jenner has been known to daringly “free the nipple,” too, sporting pieces like a semi-see-through cropped bra top or a barely there lace-embroidered sheer bralette. Jenner’s off-duty underpinning moments boldly appear in her daytime looks as well. For a jolt of color, the model has turned heads in a parakeet yellow camisole and for a more sultry appeal, she has confidently hit the town in low-slung leather flares with a silk black spaghetti-strap tank. Her most head-turning look yet? A sheer bodysuit and black tape pasties. Let’s see if she brings her bare-it-all look on tonight’s La Perla runway onto the street, too.
