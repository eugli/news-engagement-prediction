It attempts to trample on our due process rights.” \nCommittee Chairman Mike Foote, D-Lafayette, echoed the criticism, questioning a provision in the bill that would exempt it from judicial review by Colorado’s courts. Foote suggested it could be unconstitutional to subject local politicians to a lawsuit. \nHe referenced a 1998 case, Bogan vs. Scott-Harris, in which the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously extended the concept of “legislative immunity” to local officials — meaning they can’t be held personally liable for perceived harm caused by legislative activity. Williams’ bill would do just that, subjecting them to not just civil liability but also potential criminal charges, creating the crime of “rendering assistance to an illegal alien.” RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post Alexandra Flores cries as her friend translates her speech to english as people gathered to speak against HB17-1134 at the Colorado State Capitol’s west foyer, Feb. 22, 2017. Flores had a nephew killed in Guatemala after being deported from United States. \nThe handful of people who spoke at the news conference said the legislation would also essentially reimpose a law from about a decade ago that forced Colorado law enforcement to investigate people’s immigration status during routine policing. Gabriela Flora, of the American Friends Service Committee, said the law terrorized immigrant families. \n“In the state of Colorado,” she said, “we learn from our mistakes.” \nAlexandra Flores, speaking in Spanish, said the old law led to the deportation of her nephew to Guatemala, where he was killed by gangs just days after returning to the Central American nation. \n“This bill will only hurt families as it did mine,” she said. \nFlores called House Bill 1134 “una ley muy mala” — Spanish for a “very bad law.” \nAt the hearing, lawmakers heard emotional testimony from both sides — including some from family members of people killed in car crashes and other crimes involving illegal immigrants. Williams said one Arizona man whose daughter was killed in a car accident involving an undocumented immigrant flew to Denver just to testify at the hearing. \nWilliams, a freshman lawmaker who is Hispanic, has been publicizing his legislation on the national stage. Leading up to his election, he posted on Facebook that “we will send a loud and clear message that grassroots conservatives are the boss, not the party elites who have lost touch.” \nThe hearing on Williams’ bill comes after President Donald Trump’s administration sent immigration to the national forefront Tuesday as documents were released showing plans to widely expand the number of people who are considered a priority for deportation. \nThe Homeland Security Department memos — a sweeping rewrite of the nation’s immigration enforcement priorities — explain that any immigrant living in the United States illegally who is a suspect in a crime or has been charged or convicted will be an enforcement priority. That could include people arrested for shoplifting or minor traffic offenses.
