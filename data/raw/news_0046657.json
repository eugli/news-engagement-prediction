Hooray for commerce! \nhooray for commerce! If you aren’t lucky enough to purchase one of the cards, which comes preloaded with two subway rides, you can also buy one on eBay . There are already dozens available for resale, and some of the listings were mysteriously posted before the cards became publicly available. Prices range from $50 to $999.97 (good luck with that one) for a MetroCard, which functions as a MetroCard, and happens to have the logo of a popular streetwear brand on one side. \nif I copped some supreme metrocards and hid them all over New York and posted like photo clues would y'all look for them! \n— SNEAKER UPDATES (@yeezyworldwide) February 20, 2017 Neither Supreme nor the MTA has announced how many cards are available (and did not respond to a request for comment), but it was likely a fairly low-cost advertising campaign for the brand. The MTA website lists rates for advertising on MetroCards as 51 cents per card for the first 50,000 to 124,999 cards printed. \nThe cards are part of Supreme’s new spring / summer line of clothes and accessories, which also includes this jacket: \nThough this was certainly not the intent of the collaboration, the Supreme MetroCard strikes me as a particularly effective way of winning the hearts of NYC youths who have taken to proudly deleting their Uber accounts on social media in the last month. What better way to get bros to take ethical transportation than by slapping a Supreme logo on the ticket to ride?\nA limited edition brick from Supreme’s fall / winter 2016 line — literally a brick that said “Supreme” on it — went for up to $1,000 on eBay at the time. So the MetroCard is cool, but not as cool as a brick. Please spend the next five minutes thinking about what you do with your expendable income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:33:58.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
