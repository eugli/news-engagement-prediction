All Stories \nAfter James Corden spent his Saturday sick at home, he devoted an entire Late Late Show segment to watching \"absolute masterclass\" film Britney Ever After . The Lifetime original movie based on Britney Spears ' early life and career also portrayed the pop star's romance with *NSYNC's Justin Timberlake.

Equally entertaining is the portrayal of boy band *NSYNC, who serenade the singer in \"Happy Birthday\" in one clip. Corden was particularly amused by the Timberlake character's bizarre lingo. \"You know it's Timberlake when you hear 'bomb diggity,'\" Corden cracked. \nCorden also highlighted a pivotal moment where Timberlake and the \"Oops!...I Did It Again\" singer end their high-profile relationship via – to Lifetime's imagination – a Nineties-style dance-off that allegedly lasts nearly 10 minutes (\"we had to cut seven minutes of this,\" Corden said). \nThe host cracked that the creative team \"spent so much on writers and actors that it appears they ran out of money, forgetting the rights to Britney Spears' music.\" Instead, they used approximations of Spears songs like the bluesy \"If You're Looking for Trouble\" and repetitive synth-pop track \"Alright Alright.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:34:06.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
