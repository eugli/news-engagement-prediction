PUBLISHED: 09:07, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:30, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 The former Conservative Party leader slammed comments from ex Prime Minister Sir John Major that those pushing Brexit were showing a “disregard” for Remainers.

Remain-backing Sir Major said Britain’s vote to leave the European Union was “a historic mistake” during a speech at Chatham House. BBC•GETTY Iain Duncan-Smith has said he welcomed debate on Brexit I seem to recall he and many of his cabinet shouted down those who were concerned about Maastricht Iain Duncan-Smith Speaking on Newsnight , Mr Duncan-Smith said the Maastricht Treaty had been an “unmitigated disaster”. “With a bit of respect to John Major, I was here 25 years ago when the Maastricht Treaty was being pushed through. I seem to recall he and many of his cabinet shouted down those who were concerned about Maastricht which has turned out to be an unmitigated disaster,” he said. “So I think a little bit of humility in this might not be a bad thing. The reality is that is the nature of robust debate.

The MP for Chingford and Woodford Green felt his predecessor – who previously promised to stay out of political debates – sounded “strangely bitter” as he made a series of “unrealistic and angry threats” opposing Brexit during a “rather sad” speech. The 73-year-old former Prime Minister also personally criticised Theresa May, saying she needed to use “a little more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric” during her upcoming Brexit talks. But although he admitted Brexit would not be a “walk in the park”, Mr Duncan-Smith praised May for taking a realistic approach to Brexit.
