Picture: Dave Abrahams / INLSA \nCape Town - The annual Passion for Speed international historic race meeting at Killarney on Saturday was brought to a premature close when former South African motorcycle champion Gavin Ramsay died as a result of multiple injuries sustained in a crash during the second SA TT motorcycle race. \nRamsay’s Suzuki slid and went down under braking into Turn 1 at the start of lap three, apparently on oil which had been spilled on the track by another motorcycle which had crashed in the same spot seconds earlier, and was still lying at the edge of the circuit. \nRamsay was flung off his machine and slid into the crashed motorcycle, sustaining injuries which proved fatal at the scene. Authorities immediately cancelled further racing for the day. \nEarlier, Ramsay had finished fifth in the day’s first race in the international SA TT series for pre-1989 motorcycles; a week earlier he won the first race in the 2017 series at Zwartkops near Pretoria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:08:15.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
