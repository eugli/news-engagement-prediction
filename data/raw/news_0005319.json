This is one of the largest attachment of assets made by the ED in a PMLA case till now. \n\nThe agency had registered a money laundering case against him and others based on an FIR registered last year by the CBI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:43:11.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
