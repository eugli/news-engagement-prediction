FS1 cancels \"Fox Sports Live;\" Jay and Dan's contracts not likely to be renewed. Story coming in SportsBusiness Daily. — John Ourand (@Ourand_SBJ) February 23, 2017 \nFox Sports Live debuted in 2013 and was seen as the answer to ESPN's flagship SportsCenter program but shifted to be more of a sports comedy show in 2016. — Dan O'Toole (@fs1otoole) February 22, 2017 \nA ccording to Ourand , the show aired its last episode on Wednesday night and will be replaced with a variety of programming until MLB Whiparound begins on April 3. \nMore from a statement from FS1: \n\"Throughout the evolution of FS1, we've been committed to creating programming that resonates with sports fans. As part of that commitment, we are constantly assessing all of FS1's studio offerings, and despite changes to the format of FOX SPORTS LIVE and the popularity of Jay and Dan as individuals, we've made the difficult decision to move forward with other projects,\" said Charlie Dixon, Executive Vice President of Content for FS1 and FS2. \n\"Motivated by the success of the 2016 MLB postseason on FS1, MLB WHIPAROUND will begin airing at 11:00 PM ET on FS1 starting Monday, April 3. We are excited to bring the show to a new group of viewers just in time for FOX Sports' 22nd consecutive season as the home of Major League Baseball.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/fs1-cancels-fox-sports-live-replaces-it-with-mlb-show/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:38:05.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
