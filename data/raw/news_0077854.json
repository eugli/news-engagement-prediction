In the original clip, Liam Payne, Niall Horan , Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson run off the screen in different directions, making the news about their hiatus all that much more real. However, this version sees the bandmates running back together, which may or may not be some serious symbolism for their future. \nSpeaking with MTV News in February 2016, Winston and Turner admitted that they cut the scene because they didn't think it fit in well with the visual. \"It just didn’t look that great,\" Turner confessed. \"But there certainly wasn’t any… it wasn’t supposed to be them walking off, it was just kind of like an, “OK, see you in a bit, guys!'\" A post shared by Fulwell 73 Productions (@fulwell73productions) on Feb 26, 2017 at 10:35am PST \nPhoto: YouTube/One Direction", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:08:28.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
