Duterte's drug war in the Philippines is out of control, he needs to be stopped | Robert Muggah Read more \nThe current age of criminal responsibility in the Philippines is 15. President Rodrigo Duterte’s allies have been pushing to lower it, coupled with another draft bill that would restore the death penalty. \nPoliticians opposing the bills say their passing could lead to a situation in which a nine-year-old may be sentenced to death. \nDuterte won May elections following a campaign in which he vowed to kill tens of thousands of drug dealers and promised to stop traffickers from using minors as narcotic couriers. \nBut Sylwander said a nine-year-old child is unable to fully comprehend the consequences of a crime, especially if they are coerced by an adult. \n“Apart from the fact that it’s against human rights, it’s very unfair to a child, to punish them in such a harsh way as the criminal system would be, for something that they never understood was that serious.” \nAnd she said the proposed law will not lower criminality and may have the opposite result. “By incarcerating children at such a young age, they in fact become well-trained criminals by being brought up in prisons with other criminals,” she said. \nNational police statistics show less than two percent of all crimes in the county arecommitted by childrenbelow the age of 15, a point Sylwander says Duterte has ignored in his support for the bill.

Children, too, have been killed. \n“Yes, children are used as petty sellers ... but why go after the children who do not understand what they are doing instead of going for the big syndicates? \n“It seems there is less effort to get the big guys. You shoot the small gangsters or the small drug traders in the slum areas and the poor areas. But there seems to be no real, concerted efforts to get the big drug lords in the country. And there are quite a few,” Sylwander said. \nThe UN committee on the rights of the child has stated that setting the age of criminal responsibility below 12 is considered “not to be internationally acceptable”. And Unicef says alternatives to detention such as restorative justice programs can reduce offending by up to 70%. \nChildren in the Philippines are already liable to be arrested and detained like adults from the age of nine but cannot be convicted. More than 52,000 children in the Philippines have been arrested since 1995, Unicef says , often for petty theft or sniffing of glue and solvents.

But there has been growing opposition in the senate, delaying the bill. \nUnicef has been working to convince politicians of its damaging implications, Sylwander said, in part by highlighting how children will likely have to share cells with adult offenders for months even before being judged. \n“The court system is extremely slow so it would take a long time for these kids to be convicted, which means they will basically spend a long time in prison,” she said.
