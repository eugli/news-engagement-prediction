You may have already seen the Apocalypse Now homage, and here comes a crazed, monster-laden Japanese take on the film, as tweeted by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts while on the Tokyo arm of the movie's promotional tour. \nEschewing the usual headshots, this goes for full-on carnage, and while it's hard to tell exactly how representative of the movie it is, we'd be happy to hang it on our walls. \nSkull Island aims to re-introduce the giant ape in even more giant form. Tom Hiddleston 's former SAS officer and tracker and Brie Larson 's photojournalist accompany a military team led by Samuel L. Jackson to investigate the mysteries of Skull Island. But of course, there's more to the mission than that, and corporate type John Goodman isn't letting on. \nOf course, none of them are quite prepared for what they find, among them John C. Reilly , who has been surviving on the island for years and knows what's up with Kong (turns out he's more the lonely protector of the place) and the real threats are some reptilian nasties. Along with, of course, man's humanity to both man and beast. The move will be with us on 10 March, and you can find much more about the movie in the latest issue of Empire , which is out now .
