And I'm on Ellen !\" the model exclaimed on her first-everappearance on the talk show Friday. \nWhile Hadid's career is taking off, she's still leaving some much needed time for her personal life, namely her relationship with boyfriend Zayn Malik . The 21-year-old told DeGeneres that they've been dating for \"a year-and-a-half now, not that I'm counting.\" \nVIDEO: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik's Cutest Couple Moments \n\"We actually met at a friend's birthday party a few years ago, and then he was in New York to come to the Victoria's Secret Show last year, I think, and ended up not coming. I was like, I'll play it cool, I'll go to the after-party. He wasn't there,\" she joked. Somehow, the two still got in touch. \"And later that week, we ended up going on our first date,\" she said. \n\"We played it cool for about like 10 minutes and then I was like, you're really cute. We connected really quickly. We have kind of the same sense of humor and sharing videos and obviously Noah Ritter videos started coming up.\" \nRELATED: 15 Things InStyle Editors Wanted to Buy Immediately from Tommy Hilfiger's Show \nClearly these two have a love of comedy in common.
