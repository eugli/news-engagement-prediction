Bolt was not having a bar of it. Picture: Sky News\n“What that verse is really putting as a scenario is if you come home and you’re really, really angry — we’ve seen many men act violently towards their women — what this verse is saying really is playing on the psychology of the man saying violence is a last resort,” he said.\n“The first thing you must do is counselling ... Before you even consider using your hand, before you consider an act of violence, have you checked box number one, which is counselling, have you checked boxed number two?\n“So what does counselling entail? Maybe next time you should bring her a bunch of flowers, maybe next time you should bring her a box of chocolates, maybe next time you should take her out to dinner.”\nMr Bolt interjected: “And then beat her. If you still don’t see sense, beat her. That’s what that says. I’m reading the Koran.”\nmedia_camera Keysar Trad has previously advocated for the legal recognition of aspects of sharia law in Australia. Picture: Renee Nowytarger\nMr Trad argued that what the text was saying was that “a good person would never get to that step because the first step would eliminate the problem”.\n“When you sit down and talk about it and say I’ve become angry about something, I go to my wife and say what happens, I say I’m sorry I was wrong, I made the wrong assumption, so you never get to step three,” he said.\n“This is the psychology.”\nMr Bolt said he hoped his guest’s interpretation of the verse “catches on”.\nmedia_camera ABC identity Yassmin Abdel-Magied said Islam was the ‘most feminist religion’ on Q&A.
