But, it looks like we've gotten one of our own! \nThe Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Las Vegas is home to the first Champagne vending machine in the US. You can find it inside the hotel on the 23rd floor at the \"Sky Bar.\" It is fully stocked with mini bottles of Moet & Chandon and tiny flutes so you can keep it classy and not drink out of the bottle. \nTo use the vending machine you must purchase a $20 coin from the front desk and also provide an ID to show you are legal drinking age. Simple enough! Then take the coin, drop it into the machine and then cheers - champagne time!
