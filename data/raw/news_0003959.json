That does not mean I don't try to stay present in my recovery and adjust when necessary, but there are basic, core recovery maintenance principals that work for me on a daily basis.\nI recently had one of those shaking moments. A headline in the Dallas Morning News: Attorney Brian 'Strong Arm' Loncar's death ruled accidental cocaine overdose.\nAttorney Brian 'Strong Arm' Loncar's death ruled accidental cocaine overdose In December 2016, Brian was found unresponsive in his car outside of his office. He was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead. The week before that, Brian and family had sustained a tragic loss with the suicide of one of their daughters, 16-year-old Grace, who had struggled with depression. Unimaginable loss, grief and pain. At the time of Brian's passing, the cause of his death was unknown pending toxicology. There was a lot of speculation at the time. Suicide, drugs or that Brian had simply died of a broken heart due to the loss of his daughter.\nBrian's struggles with alcohol and drugs as well as his long term recovery were known within the general and legal recovery community. I have no idea whether the cocaine overdose was his initial relapse or if he had relapsed at some point prior. It does not matter. In recovery, we are only as good as our last day sober.\nBrian and I knew each other but we were not close. In fact, our early relationship had at one point, been volatile. In the mid-to-late 90s, I was approached to take a harassment case against him personally. An employee of his office at the time told me that Brian said he would have my legs broken if I took the case. Of course, I have no idea if Brian really said that, but it is something that stands out as I reflect back on our interactions. I never brought it up when I saw him over the years. We became \"friends\" on Facebook and our interactions were cordial. He congratulated me a couple of times on my sobriety anniversaries.\nAs I read the story about his cause of death with a heavy heart, my thoughts drifted back to my own critical cocaine moment, in a hotel bathroom in Dallas in 1987. As the first line of cocaine I ever did went up my nose, I thought about a man I'd never met. I thought about Lenny Bias. Lenny was a first round draft pick of the NBA Boston Celtics in 1986. Lenny was a can't-miss future NBA prospect. He died of a cocaine overdose two days after being the second overall pick in the draft -- it caused a deadly arrhythmia. No warning. No second chance. Just dead.\nThat could never happen to me. People didn't die from cocaine. And I did not die, but cocaine was a factor in the collapse of my legal career, three failed marriages and many other difficulties. I totally get the power of the evil white powder. Any single line could have ended my life. I didn't care. I was an addict.\nI then thought about the pain and grief Brian must have felt about the loss of his daughter and the thought that no one could help him out of that dark abyss. Not his family. Not his recovery group. I've been there. I was fortunate to get through those moments. When I put down my beloved dog and campaign of 15 years, Peanut, I felt emptiness as I pounded a table top with my fists, wondering where I could get some cocaine. (I am not quantifying my loss to the loss of a child, only describing my context for intense grief). With the help of my peer-support group, my therapist and my family, I thankfully made it through.\nRelapse always exerts a powerful pull. The years do not matter. It can happen at one, 10 or 20 years. It can happen to anyone. After Brian's death, I took stock once more of my recovery program and have made adjustments. For that, I thank you Brian. In your passing, my program became stronger. I will be more vigilant in assessing its effectiveness because tragedies will occur in life. Those are the times when my program must be at its strongest. I am not done facing loss and I am only as good as my last day sober.\nBrian Cuban is a non-practicing lawyer, writer and speaker. He wrote this column for Above the Law .
