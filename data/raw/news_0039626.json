Contributed When Santa Fe Christian’s Caleb Phillips steps onto Stanford’s campus he may take one look back at the roads not taken, almost all of which would have been easier than accepting a preferred walk-on spot with the Cardinal.\nMost likely it will only be a quick glance over his shoulder before he refocuses on fulfilling the dream he had since freshman year of high school to play football at Stanford. Phillips turned down scholarships to Air Force, Fresno State, signing day calls from Boise State and Hawaii, and the Ivies lining up for the star student-athlete who is a lanky 6-foot-5, 200 pounds.\nPhillips will be an outside linebacker for the Cardinal, but his combination of size and speed allowed him to play middle linebacker, receiver and tight end for Santa Fe Christian. He was recruited by colleges at each position because of his ability to never leave the field and be productive.\nBut it’s not always easy to be noticed by your favorite school. Enter Doug Miller, the receivers coach at Santa Fe Christian and the father of Reed, a former Stanford long snapper and current graduate assistant. Doug helped guide Phillips through the process and encouraged him to re-engage the Stanford coaches by sending his senior highlights.\n“They actually got very interested, so I was pretty stoked,” Phillips said. “They asked if I was interested in a preferred walk-on spot. That’s where it started. Once I got in I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity. It’s the best football you can play with the best academics, and it’s a really special place. I gave up a lot of other opportunities.\n“When Stanford came along it was the only option I could see choosing over those other schools. I don’t think I’d take a preferred walk-on anywhere unless it was Stanford. It was a pretty tough situation. Air Force was looking like a really solid option. They would pay for my med school, which is kind of what I want to do after. That was a huge draw. But Stanford … it’s my dream school.”\nPhillips camped at Stanford after his sophomore year and went up to watch his friend Jake Bailey, who went to Santa Fe Christian before becoming Stanford’s punter, during a spring game. Even as communication waned between the two sides, Doug made sure to keep the hope alive that Stanford was a possibility while Phillips started focusing on other schools.\n“He’s always been like a second dad to me,” Phillips said. “Ever since I was a freshman and wanted to go to Stanford he was all about getting me better. He’s an incredibly generous person. He’s taken me up there (Stanford) and been there when I needed him. I’m very thankful to have him in my life.”\nPhillips’ skill, academics and the help he received eventually landed him on The Farm for a recruiting visit the weekend before signing day. He was joined by fellow walk-on Thunder Justice Keck.\n“I really felt that they did want me, so I wasn’t too nervous about getting in,” he said. “When I went up on my visit they were very good to us. It felt like it was an official. We had a good time and met with a couple of coaches who were there. They took us on tours. I felt pretty welcome there. It was a pretty good feeling.”\nDuring the visit he talked to Michael Rector, who balanced biology courses and lab work with being a football player. Phillips also spoke to Craig Jones to get more insight into life as a Stanford walk-on than he already had from Bailey and the Millers.\nThe message from Bailey, Reed and Jones was: “If you come in and work hard Stanford is a pretty good place to come in as a walk-on and potentially earn a scholarship. Their lives have really changed because of this program and obviously the school is incredible. They talk very highly of it and it made me want to go that much more.”\nJones also offered the advice that, “You have to come in and make yourself valuable to the team and things will work out.”\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kyah36wknvtisplt3m11)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kyah36wknvtisplt3m11"], "published": "2017-02-14T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:42:23.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
