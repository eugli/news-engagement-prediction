For years, Bhangarh fort in Alwar was regarded as the most haunted place in India but the easy access to spirits at Marina beach has pushed it ahead of Bhangarh. Dare to visit! \nWhile everything about Bhangarh is a legend, Marina beach is providing live evidence of the presence of a spirit. First it was the incumbent CM O Panneerselvam who spoke to Jayalalitha’s spirit when he visited her memorial at Marina beach. Then it was CM aspirant Sasikala who experienced a magnetic power when she visited the same place. These incidents have convinced everyone that Jayalalitha’s spirit is present there and is willing to speak to anyone who visits. \n“It isn’t about the number of spirits but how easily you can come across those spirits and apparently, you just have to go to Marina beach for that. That is why it has become the number one destination for adrenaline junkies who like to go to haunted spots”, a leading holiday planner told Faking News. \nAs per sources, Tamil Nadu Governor is also likely to visit the site before making his decision and announcing the next CM of the state. \nEver since the news broke, many excited Chennai residents have been heading to Jaylalitha memorial to experience the presence of a spirit. Even though Panneerselvam and Sasikala have claimed that it is Jayalalitha’s spirit, experts aren’t convinced yet and some think that it could be the ghost of some political rival of AIADMK who is misleading both the politicians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:34:18.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
