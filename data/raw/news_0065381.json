By Cavan Sieczkowski \nDon’t expect Trump supporters to stick around for any political Oscars speeches Sunday. \nA new survey of 400 Hillary Clinton supporters and 400 Donald Trump supporters by The Hollywood Reporter and the National Research Group shows that 66 percent of those who voted for Trump have stopped watching an award show because a winner discussed political views during his or her speech, compared with just 19 percent of those who voted for Clinton. \nThe words that Trump supporters used to describe these speeches include: “too political,” “phony,” “out of touch” and “boring.” Whereas Clinton supporters considered them “touching,” “inspirational” and “funny.” \nStars like Meryl Streep , Viola Davis and “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour have used their platforms at recent award shows to speak out against Trump and his policies. While more are expected to voice their disapproval at Sunday’s Oscars, President Trump ― like some of his supporters ― is likely to tune out. \n“Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions,” press secretary Sean Spicer said in White House briefing Wednesday. “I have to be honest with you, I think the president will be hosting the Governors Ball that night. Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event, and the first lady has put a lot of time into this event that’s going to occur, welcoming our governors to the capital. I feel like that is where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night and so we will go from there.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:42.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
