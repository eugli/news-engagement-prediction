The package was delivered by Royal Mail later the same day and the charity contacted the estate to ask what had happened to the goshawk. The goshawk's mysterious death Bird charity's tracker places the goshawk in trees 185 yards from Sandringham House August 11 Bird's body 'disposed of' by estate staff because it had been dead 'for a long time' August 11 Electronic tag from incinerated goshawk posted to charity with a compliments slip A member of staff said the bird had been found dead on August 9 and was ‘disposed of’ as it had been dead ‘for a long time’ and was decomposing, according to Mr Stancliffe. The charity, whose patron is Prince Philip, alerted police as it had ‘initial uncertainties’ about the story, because the bird’s tag showed it alive on August 8. Police later found Sandringham’s initial account was inaccurate due to ‘a breakdown of communication’ as the staff member who spoke to the charity had not talked directly with the gardener who found the bird. The gardener claimed the bird had been alive when he found it beside a perimeter fence, but it was in a poor condition and quickly died. Estate staff told the police they had put the body in an incinerator. ‘The police came back to us about three weeks later and said they had found no suspicious circumstances surrounding the bird’s death,’ said Mr Stancliffe, who added that he would have preferred the body to have been returned to the BTO for a post-mortem to ‘rule out foul play’. He said: ‘The bird could have died from natural causes, but we do not know.’ The Sandringham probe is the third police inquiry conducted in the past ten years into the suspected deaths of hawks on the estate or bordering land. Pictured, an aerial view of the Sandringham estate Killing a goshawk is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, carrying a maximum penalty of a £5,000 fine and six months’ imprisonment. Norfolk Police said: ‘A thorough investigation was carried out and no wrongdoing was identified.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We note the findings of the investigation.’ Police launched an earlier investigation after a rare Montagu’s harrier mysteriously vanished on land bordering Sandringham in 2014. The bird had been fitted with a tracking device by the RSPB, but no body was found. In 2007, two visitors at the Dersingham Bog nature reserve claimed they were watching two hen harriers flying over Sandringham when they were blasted out of the sky. Police interviewed Prince Harry and his friend William van Cutsem, who were shooting duck and pigeon nearby at the time. The pair and a gamekeeper denied any knowledge of the incident and no bodies were found.
