By Maryam Saleh | Contributor Feb. 2, 2017, at 6:11 p.m. Cancel President Donald Trump will reportedly change the name of the Countering Violent Extremism program to Countering Islamic Extremism or Countering Radical Islamic Extremism. The Associated Press \nCivil rights advocates and Democrats in Congress are reacting angrily to reports that President Donald Trump wants to narrow the scope of a program established by the Obama administration to fight the roots of terrorism by instead singling out Islam. \nThe reactions came in response to a Reuters report that the Trump administration intended to rename the federally funded Countering Violent Extremism program to Countering Islamic Extremism or Countering Radical Islamic Extremism. At the same time, Reuters quoted sources who said the program would no longer target white supremacists who have carried out lethal attacks in the United States. The Reuters report could not be independently verified.
