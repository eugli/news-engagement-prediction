Last year she was named the north of England’s most transformational leader at the inaugural Northern Power Women awards, set up to celebrate the region’s talented women.\nAs criticism of the organisers mounted, one of those listed in the press release, Graham Robb, chair of the North East Institute of Directors (IOD), tweeted that he had “insisted” on sharing his speaking slot with Natalie Sykes, IOD regional director for Yorkshire.\nJulie Elliott, MP for Sunderland Central, said the male-heavy lineup was “staggering”.

We have already started a dialogue with our commercial partners, advisory board members and sponsors to address the issue for next year’s event.”\nOne of the few female speakers at the conference, Kirsty Styles, just launched a media and public speaker training programme for women with Tech North.\nShe said: “The ‘northern powerhouse’ is still being shaped — but what we do know is that it seeks to rebalance the UK economy by ensuring the north works together and speaks with one voice — which cannot be done if local women and other groups are excluded from high-level conversations.\n“If we keep sourcing our speakers and our local leaders from the same places, we’ll keep hearing the same old ideas and coming up with the same solutions.”\n\nResearch by the Fawcett Society last year found that while 40% of councillors in the northern powerhouse are female, women make up just 28% of senior leadership roles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:39:15.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
