According to the release, any money raised would go to Moore’s rehab, physical therapy, travel home and other medical bills not covered by insurance. \nMoore was injured on Jan. 29 as he tried to land a double backflip in the snowmobile best trick final. Earlier that week, Moore won his seventh X Games medal with a silver in the snowmobile freestyle competition. \nX GAMES COVERAGE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:44:19.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
