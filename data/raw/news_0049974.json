PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:08, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 RSPCA Animal abusers abandoned this sick dog to die in a pitch black coal shed Only when the dumped pet's pitiful cries were heard by a passer by was she finally freed from her nightmare inside the squalid living tomb. There was no water, food or bedding left for the terrified dog and it is impossible to say how long she had been scratching and howling inside the shed attached to a derelict house. The RSPCA has launched a major investigation into the neglect case, saying the nine-year-old dog had been abandoned to endure a slow and lingering death suffering from untreated tumours.
