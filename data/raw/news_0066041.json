Collections represents the total cash collected by us from our customers in a given period and is calculated by adding the change in deferred revenues for a particular period to revenues for the same period. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company has not reconciled its guidance as to free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities because it does not provide guidance for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. As items that impact net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the Company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is not available without unreasonable effort. \nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.
