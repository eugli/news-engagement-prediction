The recently-opened Cedar Springs eatery’s namesake is the fusion of Peruvian and Japanese cuisine that was developed in Peru more than 35 years ago as Japanese fisherman immigrated to the country. In Dallas, Nikkei fuses Japanese techniques, Peruvian flavors, and top-quality seafood thanks to its chefs, former On The Lamb exec Ross Demers and Nick Harrison, most recently of TJ’s Seafood. The duo will serve up dishes like sashimi and fusion rolls like the Doble Cangrejo, made with crispy lump crab, shiso panca, garlic, and creamy snow crab in a soy wrapper. Cocktail enthusiasts will find plenty to love. Belly up to the artsy bar or park in the rooftop lounge, both perfect for dimly-lit Instagram shots, and order from a menu of fancy cocktails crafted by the team behind STIRR, Nikkei’s sister concept. Nikkei officially kicked open the doors for service last week. If you haven’t yet made your reservations, scope out the restaurant courtesy of Eater photographer Kathy Tran.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:19:48.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
