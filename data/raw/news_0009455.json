Cuomo has secured legal assistance for her family and said doctors at Mt. Sinai have agreed to perform the much-needed procedure for free.\nFatemah Taghizadeh has been unable to travel to the U.S. for a procedure due to the immigration ban put in place by President Trump last week.\nCuomo told the Daily News that the baby’s family were given boarding documents to come to the U.S. — just as a federal judge in Seattle granted a temporary restraining order halting Trump’s order.\nThe governor worked with the the International Refugee Assistance Project to petition for a waiver for the family.\n“We will continue to work with the International Refugee Assistance Project to ensure this baby receives the treatment she needs, and fight for those being unfairly shut out of America’s gates by this policy,” Cuomo said.\nThe law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison agreed to cover the family’s expenses and legal costs, Cuomo said.\nFatemah and her parent were scheduled to meet with doctors at Oregon Health & Science University this weekend.\nThe family was set to travel to Dubai, en route to the U.S., when Trump signed the order barring visitors and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n“Everything was okay. They asked for a lot of paperwork. She got the appointment, February 5, in the morning,” Fatemah’s uncle, Sam Taghizadeh, told KPTV. “All the papers, everything was ready, and just in the last minute they canceled everything.”\nTaghizadeh has lived in the U.S for 13 years. He resides in Portland with the young girl’s grandparents, who are U.S. citizens.\nGov. Cuomo was taken with the 4-month-old and was able to secure her free surgery at Mt. Sinai, but the plans for the infant's trip to the U.S. have been cancelled. (Samad Teghizadeh) According to medical records, Fatemah has structural abnormalities and two holes in her heart.\n“Her heart is twisted. Her heart’s working overtime to compensate ... and it’s causing more and more damage to her every day that she doesn’t have the surgery,” said attorney Amber Murray, who was assisting the family’s petition for a visa waiver.\n“I am pleased to announce that the world-renowned pediatric cardiac surgical team at Mount Sinai Hospital, who has extensive experience in managing patients with this condition, has generously offered to provide the surgery and medical care at no cost to the family,” Cuomo said.\nEarlier, U.S. District Judge James Robart granted a temporary restraining order Friday halting Trump’s order.\nThe White House insists the ban on travel for 90 days from the seven countries, as well as other restrictions, is necessary to protect the U.S. from terrorism.\nLast weekend, Cuomo blasted the order as un-American and vowed to help detainees and others affected by the ban.\nLawmakers in Oregon were also fighting for the tiny toddler.\nOregon senator Jeff Merkley also submitted a formal request for a waiver to allow the little girl into the country, according to the Oregonian.\n“I can’t imagine the State Department wouldn’t grant such a waiver,” he told the newspaper. “A little girl’s life is at stake.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:53:27.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
