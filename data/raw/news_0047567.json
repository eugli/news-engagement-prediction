Tesla’s value has climbed 27% since the start of this year, while Ford’s has increased 4%. \nRelated: Elon Musk and Donald Trump – New BFF’s? \nFord was worth twice as much as Tesla as recently as a year ago, and less than four years ago it was worth 10 times as much. Telsa is already worth more than twice as much as Fiat Chrysler, ( FCAU ) the U.S.-Italian automaker formed after Chrysler’s 2009 bankruptcy. \nFord is one of the world’s iconic automakers, and founder Henry Ford is the father of the modern assembly line. And unlike rivals General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler, it avoided bankruptcy in 2009 which wiped out those automakers’ shareholders. \nTesla, led by superstar CEO Elon Musk, is the top electric carmaker, but it’s still is a small niche player compared to the major automakers. \nTesla has sold 76,000 cars last year, compared Ford, which sold 6.7 million cars and trucks worldwide. Tesla expects to report full-year revenue of about $7 billion, compared to Ford’s annual revenue of $152 billion. \nAnd Ford reported a profit of $4.6 billion. Tesla has never reported full-year profit. Its third quarter profit of $22 million was only its second profitable quarter it’s had since it went public in 2010. \nRelated: I rented a guy’s $145,000 Tesla Model X \nBut investors are betting on the company’s future prospects, especially the sale of its first mass market car, the Model 3 , which is due to go on sale late this year. The company has already taken orders for more than 300,000 of the Model 3 , which will have a list price of about $35,000 . \nFord and other traditional automakers are rushing to develop mass market electric cars of their own. In January Ford announced plans to invest $4.5 billion to build electrified vehicles by 2020, including electric versions of some of its iconic vehicles such as the F-150 pickup and the Mustang . \nFord is trying to play catch-up with Tesla and General Motors ( GM ) , which has the Chevrolet Bolt . Ford CEO Mark Fields predicted in January that hybrid and electric vehicles will outsell purely gasoline-powered cars within the next 15 years.
