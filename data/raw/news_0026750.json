When the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau even though he had two years left on his contract, the sacking was accompanied by a classless kick out the door. “When everyone is on the same page, trust develops, and teams can grow and succeed together,’’ Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement at the time. “Unfortunately, there has been a departure from this culture.’’ Thibodeau did not retaliate and took the high road. Or maybe he just chose to wait to deliver his statement. Make that two statements and counting after Sunday. For the second time this season, Thibodeau had the last laugh as his Timberwolves swept the season series from the Bulls with a 117-89 rout. The Bulls were without Dwyane Wade (bruised right wrist), Jimmy Butler (bruised right heel), Nikola Mirotic (back spasms) and Paul Zipser (tendinitis in left ankle, illness), but they weren’t going to get any sympathy from Thibodeau. Coach Fred Hoiberg started Doug McDermott, Michael Carter-Williams and Jerian Grant alongside Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez, but there was still no excuse for letting a 21-34 team sprint ahead to a 34-17 lead after the first quarter. The Bulls (26-29) were pretty much dead and buried after that woeful start. Coincidentally, in the teams’ first meeting this season — a game in which Wade and Butler played — Minnesota was down 21 before coming back for a 99-94 victory. “Oh, without a doubt [the victories mean extra to Thibodeau],’’ Gibson said. “I know him too well. When most people think it’s not a big deal, it’s a big deal to him. You saw he kept coaching the whole game; he even left some of the guys in late. “I could see his hand shaking all the way on our end. I know he really wanted to win that game, and nothing is going to change. He’s going to be the same guy.’’ Gibson understands why Thibodeau always enjoys beating his former team. “He doesn’t forget things,’’ Gibson said. “He’s going to always have the Bulls on his radar. It’s just the way the game goes. A lot of people tend to hold grudges, but it’s none of my business. That’s between him and the guys [above].’’ Butler agreed with Gibson. ‘‘He should [want to beat the Bulls],’’ Butler said. ‘‘Not only because it’s his former team, but because you want to win as many games in this league as possible. Wins are hard to come by, so I’m sure he’s excited.’’ Thibodeau downplayed any hard feelings, but his actions spoke loudly. He kept Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins on the floor until the last few minutes with the Timberwolves up by 20 points. “I’ve been around, so there are a lot of those teams, and it’s always hard when you’ve been through things with people, so I really root for that team and those guys — particularly the ones I’ve coached — and I want them to do well,’’ Thibodeau said. “I had a great five years there, so I pull for them when they’re not playing against us.’’ Previously from Sports ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:05:59.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
