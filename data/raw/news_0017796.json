We were not finding anyone all these years who could replace Gautam,\" former India spinner and current Delhi selector Nikhil Chopra told PTI today. \n\"The Hazare Trophy gives us opportunity to test Rishabh' s captaincy skills and with Gautam and other seniors around, he will get ample guidance from Gautam. Obviously Atul has spoken to Gautam and he has been taken into confidence,\" said Chopra. \nThe 21-year-old Pant has recently made his senior India debut in T20 format against England.
