Trump signed a 60-year lease with the federal government two years before he began his presidential campaign. \nAs president, he now oversees the GSA, and is effectively both landlord and tenant. A clause appears to prohibit elected officials from benefiting from the lease . \nDemocrats and outside ethics lawyers say the hotel allows Trump to profit off the presidency because foreign government officials and business leaders have a clear incentive to do business there. \nThe GSA faced a Monday deadline to answer questions from the Democrats about the matter. \nIn response, the agency reported that it was still evaluating whether Trump was in violation of the lease, said Jennifer Werner, an aide to Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee. \nIn addition, the GSA did not give the Democrats unredacted reports on the hotel's revenue and expenses, as they had requested, Werner said. \nThe GSA did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney for comment. \nThe Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee is Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. He was scheduled to meet privately on Tuesday with Trump. \nA document made public by ProPublica last week shows that Trump placed his stake in the hotel into a trust controlled by his son Donald Trump Jr. and a Trump Organization executive. \nRelated: Trump will leave business, but won't sell \nThat was part of what Trump called a plan to avoid conflicts of interest. But Trump declined to sell anything, which means he still stands to profit. \nAn ethics watchdog organization is arguing in a lawsuit that Trump, by accepting foreign government payments, is in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. Trump's lawyers have said settling a hotel bill does not constitute an emolument. \nThe White House, the Trump Organization and Chaffetz's office also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
