The trailer clocks in at under two minutes, but it gives us plenty in the tension department and brandishes a flame-throwing Reynolds in a particularly heated moment. \nTurns out one little biological cell can cause plenty of mayhem, and that, yes, maybe you shouldn't jump the gun on celebrating a breakthrough until you take a closer look at what you've just discovered — or unleashed. \nLife is set for a March 24 theatrical release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:23:08.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
