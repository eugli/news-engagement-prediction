This film will be produced by Vishnu Vishal's V Studios banner which produced 'VVV'. Now the yet to be titled film of Vishnu Vishal and Chella Ayyavu has got a heroine. It has been confirmed that Regina Cassandra whose next release will be director Selvaraghavan's 'Nenjam Marappathillai', will be playing the female lead in this film. This will be the first time the two young and talented actors will be seen sharing space and it is going to be a refreshing experience for movie buffs. Vishnu Vishal is presently shooting for his second production venture 'Kathanayagan' directed by debutant Muruganandam.
