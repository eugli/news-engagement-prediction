We criticize presidents. They want to criticize us back, that’s fine . . . But when he said that the fake news media is not my enemy, it’s the enemy of the American people, I believe that crosses an important line.” Chris Wallace On “Fox & Friends,” Wallace pointed out that many presidents had contentious relationships with the media, but they still recognized that an independent press was essential to America’s democracy.\nWallace noted that even former President Barack Obama was a media critic: “Lord knows, Barack Obama criticized Fox News. If Donald Trump wants to criticize the New York Times, that’s fine. But it’s different from saying that we are an enemy of the American people. That’s a different thing.”\nIn a tweet Friday, Trump railed against a number of media organizations that he labeled “fake news.”\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 On Sunday, Wallace warned Trump supporters against automatically taking his point of view.\n“And I know there are a lot of [Fox News] listeners out there who are going to reflexively take Donald Trump’s side on this,” he said. “It’s a different thing when it’s a president — because if it’s a president you like trying to talk about the press being the enemy of the people, then it’s going to be a president you don’t like saying the same thing. And that’s very dangerous.”\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) agreed with that sentiment in an interview with NBC News that aired Sunday on “Meet the Press.”\n“That’s how dictators get started,” McCain said. “When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.”\n'That's how dictators get started': @SenJohnMcCain defends the free press in exclusive @MeetThePress interview pic.twitter.com/yUINj0plIU\n— Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) February 18, 2017 More from MarketWatch Disney Cuts Ties to YouTube Superstar PewDiePie Tips for Hearing TVs Better How to Clean Your Gross Smartphone", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MeetThePress", "https://twitter.com/CBS", "https://twitter.com/NBCNews", "https://t.co/yUINj0plIU", "https://twitter.com/nytimes", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxA0YgybTbw", "https://twitter.com/ABC", "https://twitter.com/MeetThePress/status/833032310979170308", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:48:37.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
