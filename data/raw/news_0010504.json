But soon after it was released, the video was discovered to have already been available on public websites for nearly a decade. The military took down the video after the embarrassing discovery. \nThe subtitles in the movie begin, “Now we start with a practical training on how to destroy the cross with explosives,” as a black hooded figure goes through the steps of creating a terror bomb. \nU.S. Central Command spokesman Col. John Thomas explained, “we didn’t want to make it appear that we were trying to pass off old video,” and said the error was made due “to our lack of having time to properly analyze it.” \n“We were trying to provide an example of some of the things recovered on the raid, ” Thomas said. \nBoth the military and the White House denied that the Trump administration had pressured anyone to release the media from the raid. \nMilitary botches release of video seized in Yemen raid, @jimsciutto reports https://t.co/2QhkY9NEGK \nhttps://t.co/0l83okDejq \n— The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) February 3, 2017 \n\nIn addition to the death of a U.S. soldier and the botched video release, the Trump and Obama administrations are in a game of “hot potato” about who ordered the raid, as one accuses the other in order to avoid responsibility for the U.S. soldier’s death. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that former President Obama planned the raid before the inauguration, but later an Obama security official vehemently denied the claim.\n“I was there. … No specific raid was discussed. … The ‘moonless night’ thing is B.S.,” he said, referring to Spicer’s contention that Obama planned the raid but wanted to wait until weather conditions were right, which forced it to be scheduled after the inauguration. \n\nThe raid also claimed the lives of 30 civilians, and has been characterized by an al-Qaeda official as a “massacre.” CENTCOM says that the raid was approved without proper evidence of backup operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:59:20.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
