What were the Northern Ireland flag protests? \nHowever, the Supreme Court has unanimously overturned that decision and said that the PSNI \"misconstrued their legal powers to stop parades\". \nIt added that the police had an \"inescapable duty to prevent, where possible, what were plainly illegal parades from taking place\". Image copyright AFP Image caption There were protests in December 2012 after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the union flag at City Hall every day of the year \nThe case was taken to the Supreme Court by a resident from Belfast's Short Strand area, who cannot be named to protect his safety. \nThe flag protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and Belfast's City Hall, which passed the Short Strand. \nThe resident had claimed that the PSNI had failed in their legal duty to stop the parades. \nThe PSNI had argued that they did not have the legal powers to stop the parades, and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse. \nThe original claim by the resident was upheld by the High Court who said that the PSNI had not understood the full scope of their powers. \nIn its full judgement , the Supreme Court agreed with the High Court and said it was \"right to conclude that the police laboured under a misapprehension as to the extent of their powers\". \nParades in Northern Ireland are managed by the Parades Commission . The Supreme Court noted that participation in a parade that has not been notified to the commission is a criminal offence. \nThe Supreme Court said: \"The police failed to recognise that the integrity of that system depended on the enforcement of the requirement to notify an intention to hold a parade. \n\"It is the police, not the Parades Commission, who have the responsibility for preventing un-notified parades from taking place.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:22:57.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
