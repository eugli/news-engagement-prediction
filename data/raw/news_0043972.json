After almost 60 years of operation, the Hall Of Presidents & First Ladies Museum in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania closed its doors on Nov. 27. The good news: Some 367 items from its eclectic and truly unique collection are up for auction on Jan. 14. If you feel inclined to travel to Gettysburg, the details of the auction are here . For simple looky-loos, here are 11 of the oddest, most interesting and, frankly, most creepy items for sale. Pa. OnSite Auction Co. \"President Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 life size wax figure w/ name plaque, 6’ 3” tall, missing 1 hand.\" Auctioneer Randy Dickensheets, with Pa. Onsite Auction Co., thinks the wax likeness of our nation's third president will be on the more popular end of the life-size figures collection. He estimates that Jefferson will sell for between $1,000 and $2,000, but he qualified that number by saying: \"If you say [something is worth] too much, you scare people.\" PA Onsite Auction Co. \"First Lady Abigail Adams figure w/ framed & matted glass name plaque, 3’ 10” tall\" The wax figures of the first ladies of the United States are a third of the size of the presidents, so Adams stands at 3 feet, 10 inches, roughly the height of an average 7-year-old girl . Dickensheets estimates that the wax figure of the prolific epistolarian who reminded her husband John to \"remember the ladies\" when framing the Declaration of Independence will sell for between $500 and $1000. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"11 glass counter jars.\" Dickensheets tells U.S. News the museum is looking to liquidate everything they have, including a bunch of fairly large glass jars. They could be yours, he says, for likely around $50 or $100. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"President Abraham Lincoln 1861-1865 life size wax figure w/ name plaque, 6’ 4” tall.\" Dickensheets estimates our 16th president's wax representation will sell for between $3,000 and $5,000. The photograph features Lincoln sitting in a chair that is being sold separately, but Dickensheets predicts the two items will be purchased by the same buyer. After all, a house divided against itself cannot stand. The chair dates back to the 19th century and will likely go for between $300 and $400, he says. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"Antique beaver skin top hat Dunlap & Co. H.C. Dodge Harrisburg & long dress jacket.\" Want to step out in Lincoln-era style? This hat and jacket combo may be just the ticket. Dickensheets thinks the set will sell for between $250 and $350 and will be added to a Lincoln-era aficionado's collection rather than being worn out on the town. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"Framed early 1900s photo group of Dwight Eisenhower’s High School & West Point & family.\" This group of photos of young Dwight Eisenhower, the country's 34th president, are likely originals, Dickensheets tells U.S. News. He adds he has already fielded a call from a member of the Eisenhower family who is interested in the auction. This particular set is predicted to sell for between $300 and $500. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 1933-1945 life size wax figure to be sold w/ wooden wheelchair of the period & name plaque.\" FDR is among the more popular U.S. presidents, which makes his wax figure's predicted value higher. The likeness of Roosevelt, who was left paralyzed from the waist down after contracting polio when he was 39, is depicted in a period-style wheelchair. Dickensheets believes the wax figure will sell for between $2,000 and $4,000. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"President James Earl Carter Jr. 1977-1981 life size wax figure w/ name plaque, 5’ 10” tall.\" The value of some items is proving harder to predict. The likeness of the 39th president, famous for orchestrating the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, is among them. \"A lot of people liked Jimmy,\" Dickensheets tells U.S. News. \"With this particular auction, it’s all going to depend on the bidders. If you run into two people who love Jimmy Carter, [his wax figure] may go for $5,000. If there's just one, it could be as low as $500.\" PA Onsite Auction Co. \"First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton figure w/ framed & matted glass name plaque, 3’ 10” tall.\" Before she was the first woman to secure the presidential nomination of a major political party, Hillary Rodham Clinton had a pint-sized wax figurine made of her at the Hall of Presidents and First Ladies museum. \"Hillary is going to be interesting,\" Dickensheets says. His estimate is that Clinton's waxy, miniature doppelganger will sell for about $2,000. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"3 old tapes: sound tracks for presidents.\" You may ask yourself: Who would want a museum's old tapes? The answer: another museum. Dickensheets said he's had a museum inquire about the tapes and suggests that it \"could save them a lot of time\" in putting together an exhibit. However, a private bidder has also asked after the tapes, though the reason why is unknown. Still, depending on how badly each bidder wants these relics from a bygone era, they could sell for $200 or even $2,000, Dickensheets says. PA Onsite Auction Co. \"Beautiful large hand painted oil on canvas wall mural signed by artist “Chas. Morganthaler St. Louis 1964” of lady w/ girl on countryside, farmland, buildings, train, trees, horses & buggies.\" When asked what the most rare and valuable item was up for auction, Dickensheets indicated the murals and paintings by artist Charles Morganthaler painted specifically for the museum. The work being auctioned was finished between 1957 and 1964 and, depending on the size of the work and the bidder, one of these pieces could sell for approximately $10,000. \"There's been a lot of interest [in the auction] coming in from all over the country,\" Dickensheets tells U.S. News. \"It’s going to be interesting.\" PA Onsite Auction Co. x of x x of x Would you like a Lincoln?

The Christian Science monitor wrote earlier this month: \"Trump has embraced the idea that he's a modern-day Old Hickory, a populist outsider and scourge of Washington elites.\" \nThe plantation under William Tyler's care, Sherwood Forest, was named as such by the president after his time in the White House. Tyler, like Trump, was a member of many different political parties during his career. The name \"Sherwood Forest\" is a nod to the Robin Hood story ; Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party, then a major party, while president. Accordingly, he considered himself a political outlaw. \nPresident Tyler was not unique in marrying a younger woman. The federal government is still paying a Civil War pension. A North Carolina woman, daughter of a veteran of that war, is still collecting benefits from the Department of Veterans' Affairs for his service. \nDan Pierce, a history professor at the University of North Carolina -- Asheville, who specializes in the American South, spoke to U.S. News about May-December marriages in generations of this era, and what might have contributed to young women sometimes marrying and having children with far older men. \n\"[There was] not much economic opportunity during this period,\" so many men would leave their native areas, Pierce said. \nHe added that, in many situations, parents \"would encourage daughters, who perhaps cost more to feed than they provided to the economic well being of the farm, to marry.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:38:41.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
