(AP) \nShe will be quarantined there for a month before meeting visitors, said base director Wei Rongping, as officials make efforts to accustom her to her new home. \nBorn on August 23, 2013, Bao Bao shot to international stardom as the “panda cam” at the National Zoo documented her birth and childhood for millions of fans worldwide. In this photo released by China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Pandas, american-born Bao Bao looks out from a cage as she arrived at the Chengdu Panda Breeding Research Center in Chengdu. (AP) \nThe National Zoo said her return was in line with an agreement with the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association. It requires that panda cubs born at the zoo be sent to China by the age of four, for breeding and research purposes.
