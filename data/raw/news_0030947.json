Volunteers try to assist some more stranded pilot whales in Golden Bay Credit: Reuters \nT he precise cause of the strandings was not known. \nBeached whales are not uncommon on Golden Bay. Its shallow muddy waters confuse the whale's sonar, leaving it vulnerable to stranding by an ebb tide, according to marine environmental organisation Project Jonah. \nPilot whales are not listed as endangered, but little is known about their population in New Zealand waters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:26:54.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
