Jack Pitt-Brooke was at Stamford Bridge....\n1. Tactical changes did not pay off for Arsenal For a manager not always known for his tactical ingenuity, Arsene Wenger did spring a surprise giving up his favoured 4-2-3-1 for a 4-3-3 in the first half. It was meant to provide more stability in the middle, with Alex Iwobi alongside Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, in front of Francis Coquelin. It worked up to a point, with Arsenal stable in the game aside from the concession of the opening goal. But in the second half Wenger wanted to make Mesut Ozil more central, so he abandoned it to go back to 4-2-3-1, opening his team up and conceding the second goal.\n2. Bellerin was not fit (AFP/Getty Images) Hector Bellerin was not fit enough to start against Watford on Tuesday night but Wenger decided to take a risk today and play the young right-back. But Bellerin, still struggling with an ankle injury, never looked fully ready for the match. It should not have been too much of a surprise when he failed to jump high enough to the second ball after Petr Cech saved from Diego Costa’s header, beaten to it by Marcos Alonso, an incident in which Bellerin was injured and had to go off.\n3. Ozil lacked interest and desire On a day when Arsenal were steamrollered by Chelsea’s superior strength and desire, no-one encapsulated the difference between the two teams better than Mesut Ozil. A brilliant player on his day, he never got in the game, but did not always look as if he was trying to. Ozil barely won a single 50-50, showing no real desire to win the ball or even to make things difficult for Chelsea. He ducked out of challenges, did not jump for headers and, when he found himself in wide areas, did not try to stop crosses. Defending is not his natural game but top players take responsibility and that is what Ozil has been failing to do for months.\n(Getty Images) 4. The genius of Kante What more can be said about N’Golo Kante? This was yet another masterclass of his brilliant skills, his power, his running, his football intelligence and his mastery of the whole midfield. He is going to drive his team to a second straight title and deservedly so. Even when Arsenal switched to three in middle Kante and Nemanja Matic dominated the area. This was probably Matic’s best game this season, too, and he won every loose ball. For Chelsea to be stopped next season, opponents will have to wind a way to overpower or unpick that phenomenal pair. It will not be easy.\n(Getty Images) 5. The title race is over Today is only 4 February and yet there was a definite end of season feel about this tie. This was the end of Arsenal’s title race and it will take a desperately implausible Chelsea collapse for Manchester City or Tottenham to get near them. The title race is over and we must now move onto other questions: who will go down? Will an English team win a European trophy? And can Chelsea win the double? It would be madness to bet against them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:35:15.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
