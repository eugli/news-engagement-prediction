YouGov Even Ukip's Paul Nuttall is ahead is Jeremy Corbyn in the approval rating \nEven more worrying for Corbyn is that amongst young/old, North/South, Leave/Remain, male/female, middle/working class and even those who voted Labour in 2015, Corbyn has a net negative approval rating (% who replied favourably, minus % who replied unfavourably). Google Tap here for full-size image. \nAmongst the working class, traditionally Labour’s heartland, he has a score of -40 and amongst the 18-24 age group, -1. \nMeanwhile, Theresa May went up one point to +6, her party rose 6 points to -10 and Labour as a whole gained 2 points to -29. Jeremy Corbyn's net favourability rating hits -40 in our latest survey (62% view him unfavourably vs 22% favourably) https://t.co/fbSbC3IDem pic.twitter.com/2rosMPVVry \nThe news comes in yet another difficult week for Corbyn as he makes his fourth cabinet reshuffle in an 18-month tenure. \nDepending on how he manages the situation, his approval rating could slip even further. \nDuring this period he has already had more Shadow Cabinet members , 63, than Ed Miliband did in five years. \nCorbyn can perhaps take some solace from the fact both Miliband and Nick Clegg had lower scores in the lead up to the 2015 General Election. YouGov Remember David Cameron? Rumours Corbyn had made plans to step down as leader were branded “fake news” in a combative interview on BBC One’s Breakfast on Thursday morning. \nOn Wednesday key Corbyn ally Clive Lewis quit as shadow business secretary so he could oppose the Brexit bill in its third reading, bringing the total number of shadow cabinet resignations to four. \nCorbyn said it was “not a disaster” that ally Lewis, who is tipped as a future leader, quit. \n“The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents. My argument is it was a national vote, it was a national referendum, and Parliament has to respect that,” he said. \nCorbyn had ordered his MPs to vote in favour of the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill which passed by a vote of 494 to 122 - a government majority of 372. \nIn the past two weeks shadow minister for early years Tulip Siddiq, shadow environment secretary Rachael Maskell and shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler all resigned from the front bench. \nCorbyn’s first reshuffle, in January 2016, took 34 hours to complete.
