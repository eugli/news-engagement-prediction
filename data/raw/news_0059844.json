And it all begins with what AMD couldn’t do with the brand.\nAs John Taylor, corporate vice president of marketing for AMD, describes it, AMD was between a rock and a hard place. Mike Clark, an engineering fellow at AMD who led the Zen architecture development, had dubbed the architecture “Zen” for the balance it struck between various aspects of the design. Fans who had followed Zen’s development would buttonhole AMD execs and rave about the Zen name: “‘I love Zen...there’s something about it I’m just connecting with,’ they’d say,” Taylor said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:07:15.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
