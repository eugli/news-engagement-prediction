'Make Australia great again' Video: Tony Abbott calls for unity in the Liberal Party (ABC News) \nDonning a \"Make Australia Great Again\" hat, the senator warned his party not to ignore the lessons of Mr Trump's victory. \n\"Unfortunately there are too few in our body politic willing to take the path less travelled — a trustworthy track that has fallen out of use,\" he wrote in a newsletter earlier this month. \n\"For the sake of our nation, we must get back on track.\" \nLast year, he set up the Australian Conservatives, modelled on the grassroots tactics of the US Tea Party, and he says his supporters now number more than 60,000. \nAustralian Conservatives is not a registered political party and a related fundraising group set up by the senator in 2009, the Conservative Leadership Foundation, does not purport to directly fund Australian politics. \nIt has never made any declarations to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) about the source of its money or its expenditure, meaning it operates in a grey area of the political donations system. \nHe has previously threatened to quit the Liberal Party and in his most recent newsletter foreshadowed his move. Bestiality and gay marriage \nWhen Senator Bernardi questioned whether gay marriage would lead to bestiality in 2012, the backlash was fierce and swift. \n\"There are even some creepy people out there ... (who) say it is OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals,\" he said during a debate on same-sex marriage. \n\"Will that be a future step? In the future will we say 'These two creatures love each other and maybe they should be able to be joined in a union?'\" \nThen opposition leader Tony Abbott said he did not share Senator Bernardi's view and accepted his resignation as parliamentary secretary. \nAt the time, Malcolm Turnbull described the views as \"extreme.\" \n\"They are hysterical, they're not the views of the mainstream Australian society — let alone of the Liberal Party,\" Mr Turnbull said. Islam and immigration \nSenator Bernardi has described Islam as a \"totalitarian, political and religious ideology,\" but says he's not racist because his issue is with the religion, not Muslims. \nHe has been rebuked by the Liberal leadership for meeting with Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders, and has attended rallies and events with Reclaim Australia and Q Society. \nBoth groups oppose Islam, and describe the Halal certification of food as a tax that benefits terrorism. \nSenator Bernardi has been a strong backer of a ban on the burka, describing it as a \"flag of fundamentalism\" and a \"shroud of oppression.\" \nHe was born to an Italian immigrant, but has strong views on others who cross the sea to make Australia home. \nHe has described asylum seekers as \"welfare squatters\" and during the outpouring of emotion over the drowning death of toddler Aylan Kurdi , he said the boy's father was to blame. \n\"The father sent them on that boat so the father could get dental treatment. They were in no fear, they were in no persecution and they were in no danger in Turkey,\" he said. \nThe comments earned him a sharp rebuke from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. \nHe was also told off over his criticism of the Government's decision to fly survivors of the Christmas Island refugee boat disaster to Sydney for their families' funerals.

(7.30) Family values \nIn his maiden speech, Senator Bernardi set his agenda as one of the Liberal Party's key defenders of conservative values. \nHe spoke about the \"sanctity of human life\" and marriage, and the role of his mother in the family home. \nIn a book titled The Conservative Revolution, Senator Bernardi described abortion as an \"abhorrent form of birth control\" and anyone who supports it as \"pro-death\". \n\"Given the increasing number of non-traditional families, there is a temptation to equate all family structures as being equal or relative,\" he writes. \n\"Why then the levels of criminality among boys and promiscuity among girls who are brought up in single-parent families, more often than not headed by a single mother?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:14:01.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
