Every player has his own quality. \n\"I am not expecting Gabriel to do what Sergio does and I am not going to ask Sergio to do what Gabriel did. \n“Every player has his quality. Just go there, play as best as possible and that’s all. Gabriel has his own qualities and Sergio has his own qualities. \n“With both we are a stronger team. \n\"Now we've had an unlucky situation with Gabriel like we had with Gundogan and with the other players we are going to fight.” \nAguero was on the sidelines for three consecutive games while Jesus took his chance last month, left out of the starting line-up against West Ham, Swansea and Bournemouth after missing the Crystal Palace game with a slight injury. \nHowever, Guardiola has not had any worries about the player's attitude throughout that period - or indeed at other points in the season when he was out of favour. Read More Sergio Aguero could remain Pep Guardiola's odd man out at Man City \n“He was from the beginning of the season, not just these three games, playing always good – not just Sergio, all the players. \n“It’s not easy for the players who do not play and be out for a long, long time in many cases, like Kelechi Iheanacho, Nolito or the other players. Their behaviour has been more than professional, it was perfect, and Sergio too. \n“He showed in the last minutes against Swansea, for example, or in the last game at Bournemouth after the injury from Gabriel where he came in and played good and scored a goal. \n\"I don’t have doubts about the quality because it was always there.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:59:37.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
