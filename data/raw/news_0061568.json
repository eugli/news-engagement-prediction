Scroll Staff Published 7 hours ago. \nMadhya Pradesh Police Inspector Daulatram Jogawat on Thursday asked if columnist Shobhaa De would pay for his obesity treatment, after the columnist posted his photo with a description that read “Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today” on Twitter, The Times of India reported. Jogawat said he will consult his lawyer about sending a notice to De, who has been accused of fat-shaming the police officer on February 21. \n“It hurts when I see my photo on social media or when people tell me about it. India is a democratic country and people have freedom to express their views, but it should not hurt or shame someone,” the officer from Neemuch told the daily. The 58-year-old officer said his obesity was because of an insulin imbalance and not caused by overeating. \n“Shobhaa De is a big personality and people of such prominence should write responsibly. I am not fat since childhood. I became fat when my gall bladder was removed, as it was infected. She posted my picture on her account, but will she pay for my treatment.” \nJogawat also said the photograph, taken by an unidentified photographer, was an old image. He is scheduled to retire in 2019. \nOn February 21, the Mumbai Police responded to De’s tweet with a rebuttal. “We love puns too Ms De, but this one is totally misplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you,” a post by their Twitter account said. The author responded with another tweet that said, “No offence intended. MP police, consult a dietician, if it is an asli (authentic image). Doctored image doing the rounds.” \nDe’s tweets have been the subject of controversy in the past too. Her post mocking Indian sportspersons for clicking selfies in Brazil and claiming that the money spent on them was a waste had attracted ire on social media. When the formation of Telangana state was being discussed, the columnist’s tweet that “Mumbai has always fancied itself as an independent entity” had also drawn criticism from the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Her tweet criticising the Maharashtra government’s decision to make it mandatory for multiplexes to screen at least one Marathi film between 6 pm-9 pm every day led to a Shiv Sena MLA moving a privilege motion against her in April 2015. We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you. https://t.co/OcKOoHO5bX — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) February 21, 2017 Mumbai/Maharashtra Police, pranaam. No offence intended.

He and producer Mike Smith had to audition bands and decide if any were good enough to be signed on to the record label. At 11:00 am, either Rowe or Smith, history is not sure who, listened a group of 4 boys who had driven for over 10 hours through a snowstorm from Liverpool, play 15 songs. After a long day spent listening to other bands, the Rowe-Smith duo signed on a local group that would be more cost effective. The band they rejected went on to become one of the greatest acts in musical history – The Beatles. However, in 1962, they were allegedly dismissed with the statement “Guitar groups are on the way out”.

History is full of examples of poor decisions that have had far reaching and often disastrous consequences. \nIn the world of business, where decisions are usually made after much analysis, bad decisions have wiped out successful giants. Take the example of Kodak – a company that made a devastating wrong decision despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Everyone knows that Kodak couldn’t survive as digital photography replaced film. What is so ironic that Alanis Morissette could have sung about it, is that the digital camera was first invented by an engineer at Kodak as early as 1975. In 1981, an extensive study commissioned by Kodak showed that digital was likely to replace Kodak’s film camera business in about 10 years. Astonishingly, Kodak did not use this time to capitalise on their invention of digital cameras – rather they focused on making their film cameras even better. In 1996, they released a combined camera – the Advantix, which let users preview their shots digitally to decide which ones to print. Quite understandably, no one wanted to spend on printing when they could view, store and share photos digitally. The Advantix failed, but the company’s unwillingness to shift focus to digital technology continued. Kodak went from a 90% market share in US camera sales in 1976 to less than 10% in 2012, when it filed for bankruptcy. It sold off many of its biggest businesses and patents and is now a shell of its former self.

However, Britain remained out of his grasp and so, he imposed a trade blockade against the island nation. But the Russia’s Czar Alexander I refused to comply due to its effect on Russian trade. To teach the Russians a lesson, Napolean assembled his Grand Armée – one of the largest forces to ever march on war. Estimates put it between 450,000 to 680,000 soldiers. Napoleon had been so successful because his army could live off the land i.e. forage and scavenge extensively to survive. This was successful in agriculture-rich and densely populated central Europe. The vast, barren lands of Russia were a different story altogether. The Russian army kept retreating further and further inland burning crops, cities and other resources in their wake to keep these from falling into French hands. A game of cat and mouse ensued with the French losing soldiers to disease, starvation and exhaustion. The first standoff between armies was the bloody Battle of Borodino which resulted in almost 70,000 casualties. Seven days later Napoleon marched into a Moscow that was a mere shell, burned and stripped of any supplies. No Russian delegation came to formally surrender. Faced with no provisions, diminished troops and a Russian force that refused to play by the rules, Napolean began the long retreat, back to France. His miseries hadn’t ended - his troops were attacked by fresh Russian forces and had to deal with the onset of an early winter. According to some, only 22,000 French troops made it back to France after the disastrous campaign.

The stakes were extremely high – Pakistan had never won a major cricket tournament, the atmosphere at the Sharjah stadium was electric, the India-Pakistan rivalry at its height. Pakistan had one wicket in hand, with four runs required off one ball. And then the unthinkable happened – Chetan Sharma decided to bowl a Yorker. This is an extremely difficult ball to bowl, many of the best bowlers shy away from it especially in high pressure situations. A badly timed Yorker can morph into a full toss ball that can be easily played by the batsman. For Sharma who was then just 18 years old, this was an ambitious plan that went wrong. The ball emerged as a low full toss which Miandad smashed for a six, taking Pakistan to victory. Almost 30 years later, this ball is still the first thing Chetan Sharma is asked about when anyone meets him. \nSo, what leads to bad decisions? While these examples show the role of personal biases, inertia, imperfect information and overconfidence, bad advice can also lead to bad decisions.
