Horse-lovers demonstrate in Montreal, urge end to slaughter \n“We can have Cirque du Soleil performing and demonstrating how forward this city is but no, we’re going backwards to some barbaric manifestation of animal cruelty,” Hinojosa added. \nHe was referring to the city’s decision to hold an urban rodeo as part of Montreal’s 375th anniversary celebrations. \nREAD MORE: Urban rodeo part of Montreal’s 375th anniversary celebrations causing a stir \nThe calèche industry has also been a point of friction between animal rights activists and the city for months. \nLast summer, Coderre decided to ban the industry for a year after several incidents where horses appeared to be hurt. \nA Quebec Superior Court judge overturned the ban a week after it was imposed. \nBack in December, the city approved a $500,000 investment in the calèche industry. \nThe city is paying for shelters, microchips for the horses and training and uniforms for the drivers. \n“You can’t just improve them, you have to put an end to it,” Steven Harnad criticized. \nAdditionally, last summer’s decision to ban pit bull-type dogs sparked outrage among dog owners and animal activists. \nSome consider it unfair and poorly thought out. \n“Mr. Coderre, can you respect our rights?” Louise Makovsky asked. \n“We’re being terrorized for owning pets.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:04:28.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
