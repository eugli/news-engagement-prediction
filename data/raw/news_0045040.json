According to rumours, Apple will introduce new iPads, along with 128GB variant of the iPhone SE, and red colour iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at an event scheduled for March 2017. \nAccording to Japanese website, Macotakara, Apple will introduce four new iPad Pros – 7.9”, 9.7”, 10.5” and 12.9” models. If true, this would mean that Apple would replace the iPad mini line-up with a brand new 7.9” iPad Pro model. This rumour hasn’t been very consistent though, both Barclays and KGI Securities never mentioned anything about a 7.9” iPad Pro model, so it could be replaced by the 10.5” iPad Pro instead. \nBut how could a 10.5” iPad Pro replace a 7.9” iPad mini that is so much smaller? Macotakara previously mentioned that the 10.5” iPad Pro would have the same overall footprint as an iPad mini thanks to an edge-to-edge design. There will still be a bezel at the top for the FaceTime camera, but just like the iPhone 8 rumours , there will be no Home Button on board. Video Leak Shows Off a Functioning Lightning EarPod \nAs for the 9.7” and 12.9” iPad Pros, they would be an upgrade to the current iPad Pros. The 9.7” iPad Pro will be a “low-cost” device featuring an A9X chipset, while the 12.9” variant, along with the new 10.5” iPad Pro, will likely be powered by a new faster Apple A10X chip. \nFinally, if you were hoping that Apple would introduce a new “mini” iPhone, you might be in for a disappointment. Macotakara said that Apple will only introduce a 128GB option for the iPhone SE. The website also adds that Apple will introduce red colour option for its current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This would likely be part of Apple’s (Product)RED initiative . \nAgain, while Macotakara has a pretty decent track record in terms of Apple rumours, always take things with a pinch of salt. Apple could always change its mind before the event, so don’t get your hopes up too high.
