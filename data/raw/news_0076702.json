As she was not microchipped, we don’t know where she came from or who did this to her.\n“It is very upsetting for passers-by and everyone involved when animal bodies are dumped so callously like this as if they were rubbish, but for us what is even more concerning is finding out what caused their deaths.\n“Sadly situations such as this one is not uncommon and we see far too many incidents involving dead horses dumped in this way.\n– Dave McCartney, RSPCA The horse was found on Saturday Credit: RSPCA The removal of dead bodies is the responsibility of the landowner on private land, or the local authority if the land is public.\nThe RSPCA and other horse charities are facing huge problems with horses being left to fly graze on public and private land across England and Wales, and often moved on and off the land, which can make monitoring their ongoing welfare difficult.\nThe RSPCA has lobbied for new legislation in England to help landowners and local authorities to tackle fly grazing and to enforce identification laws.\nLast updated Thu 23 Feb 2017 West Midlands Shropshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:11:44.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
