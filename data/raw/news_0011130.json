Jeremy Wilkinson \nJust one trailer-load of dead catfish, 3,801 were caught in total. \nOn Saturday over eight hours 224 divers managed to cull 3,801 catfish, nearly twice the amount as the previous year, and New Plymouth based duo Pat Swanson and Rowan Virbickas took out the top prize for the third year in a row - spearing 171 fish between them. \nREAD MORE: \nSwanson has also been involved in organising the event since its inception in 2010 and said the aim was to simply \"kill as many as possible\". James Young/Primitive Aquatics \nCatfish have no legal status in New Zealand meaning there's no size or take limit. \n\"In 2009 a group of us got together in Turangi and thought it would be something a bit different to do,\" he said. \n\"It's a chance to rid the lake of some pretty nasty fish and also to have New Zealand's only freshwater spearfishing competition, and the only pole-spearing competition.\" \nSwanson and Virbakas beat their own record of 150 from a previous year but were nearly pipped from the podium by second place winners Chris Marshall and Colt Johnson who came in with 168. Jeremy Wilkinson \nGloves are recommended when handling the catfish as they have three poisonous barbs on their fins. \nThis year the aim of the cull was also to get into the Gusiness Book of World Records for the most amount fo catfish killed in one go, but they'll have to wait a few weeks before they find out whether they've made the cut. Ad Feedback \nCatfish are only small and weigh on average 300-400 grams and the biggest this year weighed in at 686g - 100g short of the record - while the smallest clocked in at under 24g. \nDOC community ranger Peter Shepherd said catfish had no legal status and there were therefore no regulations around the method, limit or size of the fish. Jeremy Wilkinson \nCatfish grow on aeverage to around 300-400grams. \n\"Catfish have been abundant enough to be observed in Lake Taupo since the 1980's. It's unknown if the introduction was accidental or deliberate,\" he said. \nHe said catfish populations had reached the extremity of their likely range and said DOC had seen a steady decline in their numbers and were confident they had a minor impact on trout. \nAs for numbers of the fish in the lake Shepherd said he couldn't give an accurate estimate but the department was more interested in abundance trends in certain areas. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nNew Plymouth resident Pat Swanson is part of a the duo that has won the event for the third year running. \nDOC provide a small financial investment every year and educate the competitors about MPI's check,clean dry campaign . The organisers also provide the department with 20 catfish to provide them with information about catfish caught in areas not covered by their monitoring. \nSpearfishermen can spear catfish in Lake Taupo all year round but spearing trout is strictly forbidden, so much so competitors are warned it could spell the end of the competition if even a single trout died at the hands of a spear. Jeremy Wilkinson \n224 divers descended on Lake Taupo for the day. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:43:04.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
