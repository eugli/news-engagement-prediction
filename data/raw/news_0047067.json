NotMyPresidentsDay \nOpposition of President Trump and his administration’s policies has centered on women’s reproductive rights, immigration and climate change. \n“A lot of people are angry because he lost the popular vote and is ruling like somebody who won by a landslide,” Ogla Lexell, who along with 20 others helped organize the rallies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, told CNN. \nShe said the rallies are intended to “keep the momentum” between the massive attendance at the Women’s March last month and the upcoming Tax Day March on April 15. Portland \nAbout 300 people turned up for the anti-Trump rally in Portland, but police clashed with the group early on as protesters blocked the street. \nPortland Police Bureau said the traffic blockage was not permitted and anyone who failed to return to the sidewalk would be arrested. \nAnother Portland event began at Director Park at noon, and police said organizers did have a permit for street closure. Here is second encounter.
