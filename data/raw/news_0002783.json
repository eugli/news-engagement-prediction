'The photo uploaded to the app is just the evidence and every one is looked at by a member of staff before a ticket is printed.' Company boss James Randall claims that the new app will empower people who find people parking on their land The new system will teach account-holders to set up their land as places where legally enforceable fines can be issued. On the company's website, it offers to send DIY signs that people can put up on their land, warning people that they could face fines if they park there. After setting up the signs, users simply take photos of offending vehicles and their registration plates, email them to the company and 'we'll do the rest'. And the account-holders are offered 'complete privacy' by the company. It boasts: 'Not only is the issuing process quick and discrete, CPM also operates under complete confidentiality. 'Our parking tickets and signs have no reference to yourself, all correspondence are designed to make the motorist believe they have been caught by a CPM Patrol Warden.' But the practice was slammed by RAC spokesman Simon Williams, who told The Mirror it 'beggars belief'. 'The sharp practices of parking companies are already regularly called into question with paid officials dishing out fines, but with members of the public being financially encouraged to shop motorists who overstay, it's a recipe for disaster,' he added.
