Not surprisingly, at least a few Houston restaurants are participating in the strike. “A Day Without Immigrants” hasn’t been as big in Houston’s restaurant scene as it has other cities, like Austin, where several eateries closed their doors in solidarity with the protests , but a few short-staffed restaurants in Houston have also been forced to shut down business for the day. A post to the Facebook page for Torchy’s Tacos in the Heights announced earlier this morning that the outpost would be forced to close due to limited staffing, which caused a comment explosion from its fans, both praising the restaurant’s employees and criticizing them. Check out the full post below: KHOU also reports that Pollo Bravo on Richmond Ave has closed its doors in solidarity with the protest . Scope out this photo of the sign posted to the restaurant’s window announcing its participation: We found a restaurant in Houston closed today for #ADayWithoutImmigrants protest, Pollo Bravo off Richmond. #KHOU11 pic.twitter.com/sZjYv9L2GF — Lauren Talarico (@KHOULauren) February 16, 2017 We’ll keep updating this post as restaurants get ready to open (or not) for dinner service this evening.
