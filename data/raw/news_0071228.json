He had deliberately concealed private rental negotiations with property tycoon Bill Wong Cho-bau while his cabinet discussed and approved a digital broadcasting licence for a now defunct radio company, Wave Media, in which Wong was a major shareholder. \nTsang was acquitted of a second misconduct charge. \nHis conviction adds to a number of scandals ensnaring powerful officials that have marred the former British colony's reputation as a relatively corruption-free society. \nTsang's legal woes looked set to continue, however, with the court saying a retrial would be tentatively set for September for another bribery charge for which jurors failed to return a majority verdict. \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:28:52.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
