Employees whose Aadhaar number is seeded will not be required to get employer’s attestation for withdrawing PF but employees without the seeded Aadhaar number will need the employer’s approval on their forms before submitting it to the EPFO. \nFurther, a single form signed by the employee will be treated as ‘self-certification’ instead of the present requirement of submitting various documents. However, in case PF is being withdrawn for medical purposes, a doctor’s certificate will still be required", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:50:03.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
