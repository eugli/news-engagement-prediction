(Bailey White/CBC)\nKaulback was charged with a second count of child luring as a result on July 9, 2014 — a year after he had pleaded not guilty to the initial charge.\nRCMP officer Ian Kaulback faces another child luring charge Suspended RCMP officer faces charges in Nunavut According to court documents, Kaulback spent the better part of a year trying to secure a lawyer before turning to the Legal Aid Commission for help.\nEventually, a trial date was set for November 2015, but Judge Joy wrote that a more realistic start time was in June 2016. There was never a preliminary inquiry.\nJudge Joy says the civilian investigator who collected computer forensic evidence in the Kaulback case was overwhelmed with work.\nOn Oct. 13, 2015, the defence filed an application for a stay of proceedings, citing an unreasonable amount of time to go to trial, calling that a breach of Kaulback's charter rights.\nLabrador courts challenged In his Feb. 17 decision, Joy agreed to the stay, saying the overall estimated time for the case to conclude was 33 months — an estimate he called overly optimistic, with a realistic timeline of 41 months total.\nGiven the seriousness of child luring charges, Joy said there is \"considerable public interest\" in seeing such cases go to trial in a timely manner.\nHe pointed to the Jordan decision from the Supreme Court of Canada, which said trials should be heard within 30 months, or 18 months if there is no preliminary inquiry.\nMountie on child luring charge granted bail Joy said there is a \"formidable\" caseload for Legal Aid in Labrador, a region which he said has a number of specific challenges paired with the sheer volume of cases.\nDay-to-day delays Also, Joy said the case provides examples of inadequate institutional resources in the court system.\nJoy wrote there is a 'formidable' caseload for Legal Aid in Labrador. (Glenn Payette/CBC)\nA civilian investigator for the RNC was working on obtaining digital forensics in the Kaulback case continuously for eight months, while also answering requests to obtain digital information on other cases.\n\"The obvious lesson here is that the government must provide an adequate number of properly trained and experienced experts in this field with the necessary equipment and offices in order to complete this type of work in a shorter space of time,\" Joy wrote.\nHow a Supreme Court of Canada decision sparked concerns in N.L., and what's being done to address them Joy wrote that delays in getting the computer forensic results, including Facebook evidence, were not exceptional circumstances, but rather a day-to-day issue for the Crown because of a failure to hire trained and experienced technicians.\nJoy said overnment must provide the resources and staffing to ensure court cases are able to meet a specific deadline. (Stephane Mahe/Reuters)\nJoy said the technicians and investigating officers involved \"performed their duties in an exemplary fashion, but they could only operate within the limited scope of the resources of their respective offices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:58:47.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
