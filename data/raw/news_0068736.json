Visitors lingered for an average of six hours or more on weekends compared to the one or two hours most museum directors expect to hold visitor interest. Why you need to see the Emmett Till exhibit at the Smithsonian \n“The best part is that the museum has struck a chord because people really wanted to see this story, to understand this story, to see the collections,” says Lonnie Bunch, the museum director. “And that’s what’s been happening.” Among the latest visitors: President Trump, accompanied Tuesday by his daughter Ivanka and Ben Carson, whose groundbreaking work as a neurosurgeon is featured in an exhibit. \nVisitors want to stay all day, and they also want to eat a good meal.

Indiana's pre-Civil War black farming community a Smithsonian surprise \nThe new museum opened last September with much fanfare. Then-President Barack Obama was joined at the ceremony by former President George W. Bush, who had signed the legislation authorizing the museum and urged that it be built on the National Mall, and by members of Congress and a host of celebrities. \nThere are other museums focusing on African-American history, including the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum scheduled to open in December in Jackson, but few are likely to attract as much attention as the new 400,000-square foot museum on the National Mall. \nVisitors to the National Museum of African American History and Culture study an interactive exhibit on sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in the 1960s.

Some visitors say the exhibits don’t show a wide enough array of contributions, particularly from scientists and inventors.

Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY \n“The museum has done a tremendous job of illustrating our plight from slavery through Jim Crow through present day,” says Deanne Adams of Owings, Md. “It’s a very emotional journey, and at the end you see all the contributions that we’ve made to entertainment and sports and it’s amazing.’’ Who was Frederick Douglass, anyway? \nStill, Adams, a mother of four, had hoped for more exhibits on African-American inventors to inspire her three sons. “Where we’ve missed the mark is highlighting the hundreds of contributions that we have made to science and technology,” she says. “We could have highlighted that better for our young generations. I’m hoping that this museum is going to be evolving and that more exhibits like that are to come.” \nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 14: A pair of slave shackles are on display in the Slavery and Freedom Gallery in the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture during the press preview on the National Mall September 14, 2016 in Washington, DC.

There are no plans yet to change exhibits. \n“Let the public engage with these exhibitions that were years in the making,” Bunch says. “It’s premature to talk about change because there’s still so many millions of people who want to get in to see what we’ve done.” \nThat interest has produced huge crowds. Lines for the history galleries, which are underground, are sometimes so long that the wait can take hours. \nSharlene Kranz of Washington, D.C., called the galleries dark, narrow and “scary crowded.” \nThere’s “so many people so intent on absorbing this experience that everything moves very slowly,” says Kranz, who has visited three times. “People come, and they stay for hours and hours ... They’re not breezing through and getting an overview. They really want to take in everything the museum has to offer.” \nThe museum’s collection includes a log cabin that once housed freed slaves. Other items in the Slavery and Freedom exhibit include shackles used to confine slaves (center image), a stone auction block on which human beings were sold to the highest bidder and a tin box in which a freedman carried his papers to prove he was no longer a slave. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla) \nBunch says: “What long lines tell us is that the public cares about this in large and record numbers. ... We will do everything we can to mitigate (the lines).” \nMuseum officials are working to better use the entire building by directing visitors to exhibits on upper floors. \nEarly in January, advance online passes for April were being snapped up within hours. Scalpers have jumped on the demand for tickets, and Bunch says there’s little officials can do about it. \nBut distribution of same-day timed entry passes recently changed to let visitors get tickets online or come after 1 p.m. In the past, some have lined up as early as 7 a.m. only to learn that there were no more passes. \n“I (didn’t) want all those people standing in line outside the building especially as winter came,” Bunch said. “Our goal is to help the visitor have the best customer experience they can.” \nBy Preston Keres, AFP/Getty Images; all others by chip somodevilla, getty imagesThe Tuskegee Airmen — groundbreaking African-American military pilots who served with distinction during World War II — trained on PT-13 aircraft, including this fully restored plane.

The museum is training more volunteers as docents to offer tours once visitor numbers level off. \n“It’s important that the African-American experience be documented like this,” says Trey Baker of Grenada, Miss., who visited in September. “It’s truly amazing to see that we can go from that King Cotton exhibit, where people were picking cotton by hand to ... the ascension of black people in this country. I don’t think any single group has come as far in as little time.”   Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2m63kxa NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.
