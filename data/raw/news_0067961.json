The Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics did not. \nWith less than 30 games left in the regular season, where does that leave the balance of power in the Eastern Conference? \nThe Cavs remain the team to beat even with forward Kevin Love (knee) shooting guard J.R. Smith (fractured thumb) out until late March. With All-Stars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, the Cavs should hold onto first-place in the East, even with a tough schedule remaining and with the Celtics right there. \nThe Wizards and Raptors made improvements, enough that they should challenge the Celtics for the No. 2 seed in the East. That should be an entertaining competition for seeds two, three and four, and throw the Atlanta Hawks into the mix, too. \nHeaded into Thursday’s games, the Celtics were three games behind the Cavs, the Wizards five games back, the Raptors seven and Hawks 7½. \nWhat has changed headed into the stretch run? \nMore NBA trade deadline coverage: 76ers trade Nerlens Noel to Mavericks for Justin Anderson, Bogut \nToronto missed a chance in January to pass the Cavs for first place in the East, and president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri had to make a bold move if the Raptors wanted another shot at Cleveland in the conference finals. \nThe Raptors acquired forwards Serge Ibaka and P.J. Tucker in trades with the Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns. Ibaka provides scoring, a stretch four at the three-point line, a rim protector and rebounder – all qualities the Raptors need. \nTucker isn’t much of a scorer but that’s OK. Toronto wants his defense and toughness. Both players give Coach Dwane Casey lineup flexibility, too. \nThe Wizards are the hottest team in the East but were missing depth. Adding shooter Bojan Bogdanovic, who has played well in big international games, helps the league’s second-lowest scoring bench. He averages more than twice as many points (14.2) than any Wizards reserve and shoots 35.7% on three-pointers. Give Bogdanovic, a starter in Brooklyn, some minutes with All-Star point guard John Wall, and he will get open shots. \nHere’s another fact to consider: By trading Andrew Nicholson to Brooklyn and shedding his salary, the Wizards have the financial flexibility to match a max offer for small forward Otto Porter, a Most Improved candidate who leads the league in three-point shooting percentage. \nMore NBA: Did Pelicans steal DeMarcus Cousins for Tyreke Evans, Hield and picks? \nCeltics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge covets his draft picks and is content to take the long view. He told reporters Thursday afternoon after the trade deadline that “Nothing was good enough for us to do.” \nHolding onto first-round picks and not acquiring another All-Star to put alongside guard Isaiah Thomas and center Al Horford bother those want to see the Celtics make a big move now. But Ainge has earned enough leeway from ownership and from the way he constructed this roster to be patient. \nWhen the right deal is there, Ainge will make it, and that includes a possible run this summer during free agency at All-Star Gordon Hayward, who played for Celtics coach Brad Stevens at Butler. \nThe Cavs’ big trade was acquiring guard Kyle Korver in early January. Now, they are active in the buyout market, and they want to sign point guard Deron Williams, who was waived by the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday. Williams needs to clear waivers first, but if that happens, the Cavs will get the backcourt help they want. \nCleveland plans to re-sign forward Derrick Williams for the remainder of the season after his second 10-day contract expires. The Cavs are also in the market for a big man. Center Andrew Bogut is likely to hit the buyout market, too, but keep your eye on former NBA player Larry Sanders, who worked out for the Cavs this week. \nIt will be difficult to dethrone Cleveland from the No. 1 seed but their road to the Finals will be more difficult this season than it has been the previous two. \nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt .
