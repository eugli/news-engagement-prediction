Mike Bianchi General Manager Rob Hennigan told me something peculiar the other day.\nHe said, “Hope is not a strategy.” \nThis is a good thing. \nBecause there doesn’t seem to be any in sight. \nNot after five years – five long, languishing, depressing, even regressing years – of losing. \nThis is why Rob Hennigan must soon be replaced. \nHope is gone. \nThere is no other way to look at it. \nHis rebuild has failed. \nHis rebuild of the rebuild has failed. \nNow it’s time to rebuild his rebuilt rebuild. \nThe lowest point of a lowly season came in a home loss to the even lowlier (and undermanned) Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. The defeat was so embarrassing that coach Frank Vogel went Hindu after the game and talked about the Magic’s bad “karma” and how it “bit them in the butt.” \nIf only it were just bad karma instead of a bad roster. Bad karma can be fixed with a few good deeds; a bad roster could take years of luck and skill to correct. \nBarring some miracle move at the upcoming trade deadline or some rousing rally after the All-Star Break, Hennigan’s plan has flopped. \nHopefully, the underachieving team he has put together proves me wrong and the Magic go on some season-saving winning streak in the next two months. But don’t kid yourself. It’s absurd to think some miraculous turnaround is on the horizon. The Magic haven’t won back-to-back games in a month-and-a-half. Heading into Saturday night’s game at Dallas, they had the third-worst record in the Eastern Conference , the fifth-worst record in the league and were on pace to go 30-52 – five more losses than last season.

See more videos \nThis is why Hennigan will soon be Henni-gone – because the team is getting worse, not better. Everybody deserves some of the blame – the owners, the players, the new coach – but Hennigan is the one who was given full authority five years ago to rebuild after the Dwightmare on Church Street. \nYes, he has been unlucky – no question. Most Magic historians will tell you that hockey guy John Weisbrod was the worst GM in team history, but even a puck-head like Weisbrod was lucky enough to get Dwight Howard in the draft. Under Hennigan, the Magic have tanked entire seasons in order to get high draft picks in hopes of landing a superstar to build the franchise around. As lottery luck would have it, there simply were no superstars to be had when Hennigan drafted. \n“We’ve done the best we can with the hand we’ve been dealt,” Hennigan says. “When you look around the NBA , fortune and luck are typically the ignition points for teams that become really, really successful. That’ s just the way it is, but we have to focus on what we control. We don’t make excuses.” \nAs Hennigan concludes, “Luck isn’t something you can count on.” And, likewise, as Bill Parcells once concluded, “You are what your record says you are.” And right now the Magic are 123-260 in Hennigan’s four-plus seasons. They have no superstar on the roster and no discernible path out of this perennial pit. \nThis has been the worst five-year stretch in franchise history. If Hennigan stays, it would be impossible to explain to Magic fans why the organization would stick with him after the worst five-year stretch in franchise history when they fired Stan Van Gundy after the best five-year stretch in franchise history. Especially when you consider teams that began their rebuilds just before or just after the Magic – including Stan’s Pistons , the Boston Celtics and the Charlotte Hornets – have already made the Eastern Conference playoffs. \nEven more troubling is this: That promising young nucleus of draft picks the Magic have been selling for years doesn’t look so promising anymore. Shooting guard Victor Oladipo is gone, traded after last season for veteran Serge Ibaka , who will likely be playing elsewhere next season. Point guard Elfrid Payton has been benched for the second time this season in favor of career backup C.J. Watson . Aaron Gordon’s signature moment was finishing second in the dunk contest last year while Mario Hezonja has so far been a bust. \nHennigan’s best move was his first move – refusing to take Andrew Bynum in the Dwight Howard trade and ending up with the Magic’s most valuable commodity – center Nik Vucevic. Unfortunately, that was five years ago and Vucevic simply isn’t good enough to carry a bad team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:08:26.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
