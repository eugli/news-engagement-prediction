Wayne Rooney is staying put... for now at least (Photo: Reuters) \nHowever, one person isn't... well, there's always one isn't there. \nBelow are the five people who will be chuffed with Rooney's decision to snub the Far East and the Red Devils fan who is pulling his hair out. Enjoy: Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nThe big man himself will be pleased Rooney is staying in the UK. \nThe Swedish striker called the 31-year-old a \"fantastic\" person in a recent interview. \nHe then bettered his comment by referring to him as the \"perfect player\". Now a cynic could look at that at think it's pretty standard praise from someone in the world of football. The Swedish striker will be very pleased Rooney is staying in the Premier League (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nBut think for a second. This is Ibrahimovic making these claims - a man who loves himself more than anything in the world AND even took credit for Henrikh Mkhitaryan's wondergoal. \nSo it's a pretty big deal. Phil Neville \nThe former Red Devils midfielder is another who will punch the air with joy at the news Rooney is to stay put in England. \nNeville strongly believes the striker has a lot left in the tank, and could easily break back into the Man United first team, should injuries continue to pile up at Old Trafford. \n\"What I would say to him is 'stick it out at Manchester United'\", Neville told BBC Radio 5 live. Phil Neville tips Rooney to feature in Man United's EFL Cup final on Sunday (Photo: John Peters) \n\"At the moment, he's not in the team and has got a slight knock but Mkhitaryan has gone off injured tonight [Wednesday]. \n\"You never know, he could come on in the final on Sunday and make a massive impact, score, and then finish the season so well.\" Roy Keane \n\"Madness\" is the way the Irishman described Rooney's proposed move to China, suggesting he would definitely like to see the forward stay in Manchester. \nWhy? Well, according to the Red Devils legend, who spoke on ITV's Champions League Highlights show, there is plenty of life left in the 31-year-old. \"There's plenty left yet for Wayne Rooney to do in Europe\" (Photo: ITV) \n\"He can still play football and still play at the top level in England, Germany, Spain, Italy. Madness,\" explained Keane. \n\"Going to China? Madness. He's 31-years of age. There's plenty left yet for Wayne Rooney to do in Europe. I don't think he's short of money, is he?\" Gareth Southgate \nIt's always favourable to be in the good books of the manager of the England national team. \nAnd fortunately for Rooney, Gareth Southgate absolutely loves him - at least that's what we get from the above video - and will be very pleased he is staying in the UK. Gareth Southgate hailed Rooney's experience (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nSpeaking to the press, the England boss hailed the invaluable experience the United front man brings to the national team. \nAdding that when he gets into his rhythm he's actually pretty good... Jose Mourinho \nThe Red Devils manager has had an up-and-down relationship with Rooney this season. \nHe's opted to drop him for a number of games, and apparently considers other players to better options in attack for his squad. (Photo: Michael Regan) \nThat said, he was clear when he told the press that should the 31-year-old decide to leave it will NOT be because he has been forced out of the club. \nIt will be because Rooney wants a new challenge. So there, there you go, that's undeniable proof Mourinho absolutely LOVES the forward. A fan named Andrew \nThe man, the myth, the legend and the ONE person who will be unhappy Rooney has decided to stay at Manchester United. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live shortly after the striker broke Sir Bobby Robson's record to become the club's all-time goal-scorer, Andrew well and truly slammed him. You can't please everyone (Photo: Action Images via Reuters / Jason Cairnduff) \n\"It's time to get rid of Rooney, because he's a liability,\" explained Andrew. \n\"Mourinho is a decent manager, he will do a decent job, but they need to get rid of Rooney now while they can still get money for him.\" Dear me. poll loading Is Rooney right to stay at Manchester United? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:35:58.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
