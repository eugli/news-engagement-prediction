The MLA reached the Greenways Road residence of chief minister O Panneerselvam in Chennai to narrate his escape story. \n\nSoon after reaching OPS residence, Saravanan, accompanied by Lok Sabha member R Gopalakrishnan addressed reporters in the presence of Panneerselvam and other senior party leaders in his camp. Saravanan said he had managed to flee the Koovathur resort before Sasikala arrived there + on Monday evening. The total tally in the OPS camp has now risen to eight MLAs, including the CM, and 12 MPs. \n\n\"I am an engineer by profession and I devised ways to escape from the resort. There are many other MLAs, who are mentally and physically stressed + . Every MLA is ready to switch camps and that will happen soon,\" said Saravanan to loud cheers from party cadres. \"With an MLA and MP from Madurai crossing over, it is as if Madurai Meenakshi Amman herself has come to bless this camp,\" said Saravanan. \n\nSasikala says she and her MLAs will leave Koovathur resort ‘happily’ after SC verdict on Tuesday AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala said on Monday evening that she and her MLAs, staying at a resort at Koovathur, will leave the place “happily” on Tuesday after the Supreme Court pronounces its verdict on the disproportionate assets case in which she is an accused. \n\nStating that he was in constant touch with his well-wishers and voters, Saravanan said he assiduously tracked social media. \"Except during breakfast, lunch and dinner, I spent the rest of the time on social media, replying to my voters and well-wishers. All of them wanted to know whether I would support OPS annan and I merely said \"sure\" as I did not want to add more details from the resort,\" said Saravanan. \n\n\"I am only a cat. There are several lions in the resort, who want to switch camps. Within a few days, more MLAs will join OPS and we will prove our majority under his leadership and form the government,\" said Saravanan. \n\nGopalakrishnan praised former chief minister J Jayalalithaa for giving him a chance to contest in the Lok Sabha elections from a Madurai constituency and sending him to Parliament. \"My family is at peace now after I joined the OPS camp. They have been pestering me to take a decision in favour of OPS annan,\" said Gopalakrishnan. \n\nMonday's events in the OPS camp were orchestrated by former electricity minister Natham Viswanathan, said sources. Significantly, both praised Viswanathan in their speeches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:09:34.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
