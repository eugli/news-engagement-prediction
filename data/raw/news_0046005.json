They are expected to be released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) early next week. \nUnder the orders, hundreds of thousands of people would face expedited removal proceedings, including those that had not been prioritised for deportation under former President Barack Obama.

Instead, migrants who have been charged with crimes but not convicted would be prioritised for deportation. The guidance also allows ICE agents wide discretion in deciding who to deport and considers anyone in the United States illegally to be subject to deportation. \nThe guidance does leave in place Obama's 2012 executive action that protected 750,000 people brought to the United States illegally by their parents. The fate of the policy, known as DACA, has been hotly debated within the White House, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Mr Trump said in a news conference Friday that DACA was a difficult subject for him.

It is not known whether the White House may alter the guidance. \nKelly said in one of the memos that illegal immigration across the U.S. border with Mexico had \"created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States.\" Follow Telegraph News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:36:54.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
