By Bill Bradley \nUnlike CNN and the “failing” New York Times , Seth Meyers’ recut press conference with Donald Trump is totally fake news. Still, dude got real. \nBecause President Trump’s most recent press conference left him with a lot of questions, Meyers held a “ Late Night White House Press Conference ” by asking questions and showing recut footage as answers. \nWhen Meyers asked what Trump has been up to lately, a clip showed the president saying, “Lying to you to get elected.” When Meyers asked how Americans are handling Trump’s presidency, he appeared to respond, “They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave.” \nIt was a lot of that. \nEventually, Meyers even went all Oscar Mayer with a question about Trump’s wiener. (Spoiler alert: Like Trump’s thoughts on recent Russian provocations , it is “not good.”) ALSO ON HUFFPOST:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:20:04.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
