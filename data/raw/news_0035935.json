Photo: Fiona Morris \nThough it took almost a minute for auctioneer Damien Cooley to get an opening bid of $2.1 million from the reserved crowd, a bidding war quickly erupted between two of the 11 registered bidders, with the bidding rising in $50,000 increments until it hit $2.6 million. \nIt was at that point that the eventual buyer, who was accompanied by her adult daughter, joined in the bidding war. It was her fourth bid, that secured her the property, which was owned by the late arts patron Jane Macgowan for more than 30 years. \n“I’m overwhelmed and relieved,” said Ms Macgowan’s daughter, Tempe Macgowan, after the auction. “I didn’t think it would go for such an amount, there was that deadly silence (at the start of the auction) so it really went above my expectations.” \nAuctioneer Damien Cooley works the crowd gathered outside 5 Darley Place. Photo: Fiona Morris \nThe three-bedroom free standing cottage went well above Darlinghurst’s median house price of $2,002,500, which has risen 23.2 per cent over the past year, according to Domain Group data. \n“We had quite a lot of local buyers who recognised that a free standing cottage in Darlinghurst very rarely comes on to the market,” selling agent Wayne Ihaka, of Raine and Horne Double Bay, said. \n“I’ve always said Darlinghurst is a high demand area, it’s what I call an honest suburb, everyone from all walks of life is happy to take to each other; it’s close to the city but it’s still got a lovely community feel … an original suburb that’s finding its second wind.” \nThe winning bidder embraced her daughter after the hammer fell. Photo: Fiona Morris \nMs Macgowan said that her mother, who was the daughter of Lord (Baron) Richard Casey, the 16th Governor-General of Australia and last Australian to sit in the House of Lords, loved the suburb’s great village atmosphere and proximity to art galleries and cultural attractions. \nThe Darlinghurst local said she was shocked by the end result, which was almost 19 times what the $145,000 her mother paid in 1984. \n“It’s a bit obscene what (houses here) are going for now,” said Tempe. “It’s a bit unrealistic, I can see why people trying to get into the market are finding it very hard.” \nVendor Tempe Macgowen, the daughter of the late Jane Macgowen, was pleased with the $2,750,000 result. Photo: Fiona Morris \nMr Ihaka said the new owner and her daughter were thrilled to have secured one of the suburb’s original homes and planned to move into the property after making some minor changes. \nMr Cooley said that though inner city fringe properties would always be in strong demand due to their location, the result was indicative of a great start to the year. \n“It’s early days, but the market has come back with a lot of strength, last weekend’s clearance rate of about 85 per cent, was a boom time clearance rate,” he said. \n“We’ve got good stock volume early in the year, which is really encouraging for what’s to come in the market,” he added. “People are seeing good results, and we taking more bookings than we ever have in February before.” \n27 Walter Street, Paddington NSW.
