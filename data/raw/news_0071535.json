It shows a hacked computer broadcasting the data through a computerâ€™s LED light, with a drone flying nearby reading the pattern.\nThe researchers designed the scheme to underscore vulnerabilities of air-gapped systems, or computers that have been intentionally disconnected from the internet.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:50.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
