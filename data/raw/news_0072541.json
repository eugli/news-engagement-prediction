Here are a few stylist and client mashups that should prove especially rewarding tomorrow night. Give these folks a follow on Instagram for plenty of candids from the Superbowl of movies. Loading Samantha McMillen for Ryan Gosling \nDashing isn’t a word we use often in 2017 but, with McMillen’s help, Gosling has the market cornered on the vibe when it comes to formalwear. As such, he tends to favor shawl collar tuxedos in unconventional colors and fabrications, never allowing things to get too flashy. Old school details like a floral lapel pin or a swanky vintage tie are often a finishing touch. We wouldn’t be surprised if Gosling wears Gucci tomorrow night—and not the Jared Leto kind. Loading Ilaria Urbinati for Casey Affleck \nUrbinati has a full plate this year, also dressing Chris Evans, Damien Chazelle, Josh Dallas, and Riz Ahmed for the red carpet. But while Affleck is a big name, he tends to keep it simple with his style. Urbinati is known for her impeccable attention to fit, so we’re betting on Affleck wearing a classic, beautifully tailored tuxedo with his now signature long hair and scruffy beard standing in place of any flashy accessories. Loading Petra Flannery for Andrew Garfield \nAndrew Garfield has been keeping a low profile on the red carpet recently, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t looked sharp as ever. Flannery is also stylist for Emma Stone and Amy Adams, so you could say she’s something of an expert on classic sophistication; male or female. When Garfield swerves, it tends to be with a strong color, and we’d love to see the actor go there tomorrow night. Although, truth be told, a classic black tuxedo (and some great hair) will probably land him on our best-dressed list just the same. Loading Michael Fisher for Michael Shannon \nMichael Fisher, the man behind Dan Stevens recent style transformation , will be helping Michael Shannon suit up tomorrow night. Shannon can get rebellious with his clothes, often favoring vintage-inspired details, but when it comes to black-tie events he usually falls in line (and we appreciate that). Where Shannon swerves in a formal setting is with a great pair of sunglasses, be it a small aviator frame or a pair of square shades. We expect nothing less for the Academy Awards. Loading Wendi and Nicole Ferreira for Jeff Bridges \nJeff Bridges might not be new to the red carpet but he’s been looking more dapper than ever recently, with help from good genes, a strong facial hair game, and his stylists, Wendi and Nicole Ferreira. While Bridges isn’t afraid to get weird with a vintage printed shirt or strong-color suit, we’d be surprised if he showed up the Oscars in anything other than a classic black tuxedo. (When you’ve been in the game this long, you don’t need to show off.) If Wendi and Nicole flex the flashy suit muscle tomorrow night, it’ll probably with David Oyelowo, whom they’re also styling.
