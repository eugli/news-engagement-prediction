It just has not worked,” he said.\nMORE: Plan to move Coyotes to Tempe is dead \nSo on Tuesday, the Senate Transportation Committee voted 6-1 to approve Senate Bill 1149 – which, conveniently, could be used by any team to snag a massive tax subsidy, provided they get cracking on their new digs before 2019.\nUnder the bill, the Coyotes are proposing that $225 million in public funds go to help pay for a new $395 million, 16,000-seat arena. The team would kick in $170 million. The state’s portion ($170 million) would come from half of the sales taxes and hotel taxes generated within a 30-acre “community engagement district” that includes the arena, a separate 4,000-seat ice arena, a hotel and retail. The remaining $55 million would come from the host city.\nWhat the Coyotes couldn't explain Senate panel paves way for $225 million subsidy for a new hockey arena somewhere in the Valley.   (Photo: Coyotes) \nThe Coyotes sprinkled rainbows and roses as they pitched the deal, waxing on about vast new streams of revenue that would come washing into the state treasury, if only our leaders approve this bill.\n“There is no use of existing state funds,” the team’s financial adviser, Mitchell Ziets, told the senators.\nCuriously, neither he nor the rest of the Coyotes team could pinpoint how much the state would lose in tax revenues if the team leaves Glendale.\nROBERTS: A(nother) subsidy for the Coyotes? Really? \nOr offer any assurances that the Valley can support three sports arenas.\nOr explain how moving from point A to point B results in masses of “net new revenue.”\nOr explain persuasively why this isn’t a loss to the state’s general fund.\nPossibly because it is, unless you believe that whatever site they select would otherwise be left a perpetual dust bowl in this, the 12th largest metropolitan area in the nation.\nCan't fund schools, but we can build arenas Take away the rainbows and roses and you are left with a project that commits $170 million in future state funds and $55 million in city funds to another hockey arena. This, in a state that can’t adequately fund its schools.\n“Fundamentally, what you are doing is you are going into the state general fund and you are appropriating dollars to a private concern,” said Sean McCarthy of the Arizona Tax Research Association.\nHe’s right, of course, but in the end it didn’t matter. The bill sailed through the committee, 6-1.\nCue Sen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa, who is running the bill: “I feel for this organization, that they have the right to vote with their feet and do what they think is right for them and their fans.”\nMe? I feel for the citizens of Glendale, who are still on the hook for $145 million for a hockey arena.\nNo more white outs.
