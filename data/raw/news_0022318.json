More than 100 emailed or messaged Phil on Facebook. \nNot only did Phil's mum help him pick one girl from all those offers, the one he picked wouldn't have known about him if her own mum hadn't steered her to the story. \nAnd her mum's even helping Codi O'Leary find a dress for the day. \nIt's a pretty special day for her, since the Cambridge lass turns 21 on February 15. She and Phil haven't met in person yet, but she's really looking forward to it. \n\"Actually, I just watched the interview,\" she said with a bit of a giggle. \"I'd read the story, but only just noticed there was a video on it, too. \n\"He seems like a good, genuine guy.\" \nShe actually had stopped looking, she says, even though she's been single since her son was born two years ago. \n\"His name's Mason. He's a little terror, that one. \n\"I have been looking for a guy, but I'd given up. Ad Feedback \n\"I'm at the point now where I want to settle down. \n\"Why not give it a shot? You never know what's out there unless you do. Mr Right's not going to come along just like that. You have to put yourself out there.\" \n​Originally from Matamata, Codi grew up on a farm. \n\"My dad works with horses and I lived on the farm for 18 years.\" \nThese days she works at the Cambridge New World. \n\"But I'm looking for a cafe job, because I'm more into hospitality.\" \nHopefully, working with the public as she does will make the evening with Phil go smoothly. She's a little nervous and hasn't even thought about what movie she'd like to see. \n\"I've never actually been out on a date before.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:20:11.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
