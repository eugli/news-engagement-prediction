Ivanka shared the image on Twitter (Photo: Ivanka Trump/Twitter) \nShe captioned the photo: \"A great discussion with two world leaders about the importance of women having a seat at the table!\" along with emojis of the US and Canadian flags. \nIt was undoubtedly meant to look like a positive tweet supporting women, but outraged social media users immediately began telling her she had no right to sit at that desk. \nThey claimed that, given the fact there has never been a female President, no woman has ever been elected to sit at that desk - and the first woman who does should have rightfully earned it. \nMany pointed out she hadn't earned the seat of the table, and was only there because she has a rich father, and wondered what the reaction would be if Obama had shared similar images of one of his daughters sitting at the desk. \nOthers called her presence at the meeting \"unethical\", considering she doesn't hold a place in the government at all. \nBut there were some who rushed to her defence, excusing it as 'nothing more than a photo opportunity'. \nIvanka has been labelled a 'substitute FLOTUS' - First Lady of the United States - given her prominence during her father's campaign and now he is in the White House. \nIn contrast, Trump's wife Melania, the real FLOTUS, is not moving to Washington DC and will be staying at the couple's property in New York City.

Viewers think they've spotted cause \nOn Inauguration Day, when Melania's face famously dropped from a smile to a frown after her husband turned to talk to her, some suggested the real reason was because Trump had actually turned to talk to Ivanka, and looked right through his wife.
