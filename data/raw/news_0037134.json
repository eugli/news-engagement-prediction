(Consensus: They suck). Since his stint as California governor ended, Arnold Schwarzenegger has managed to stay relevant by riding President Donald Trump’s coattails into the studios of NBC, where he’s the new host of The Celebrity Apprentice . These polar opposites collided Tuesday on Twitter, when Schwarzenegger used the band’s lack of popularity to illustrate a point about gerrymandering. Then it got heated: . @Schwarzenegger big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator. — Nickelback (@Nickelback) February 14, 2017 As The Daily Dot points out, Nickelback used the Governator's own filmography to parry his remarks. The “Batman & Robin” dig referenced the 1997 film of the same name, which saw Schwarzenegger play the villain Mr. Freeze. The movie was a largely derided commercial failure. For his part, the former Mr. Olympia deflected the beef like someone who’s mastered the dark art of politics. @Nickelback That's... ice cold. I hope we can agree that we need a freeze on gerrymandering, guys. Thanks for the reply.
