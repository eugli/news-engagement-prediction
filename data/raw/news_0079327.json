Given that we have a system built around very proven components (engines, boosters, capsule) spending $1 billion-plus on a single test undermines the bolder exploration goals most of us in the space community support,” Autry told Irene Klotz of Space.com . An artist's conception of the Space Launch System \nAutry reportedly resigned his position in the administration last Thursday. \nCurrently, Exploration Mission-1, known as EM-1, is an unmanned missions scheduled to launch in 2018 and orbit the moon before returning to Earth. As the SLS’s first flight, EM-1 was initially planned as a test to shake down the new, unproven system. Given that launches are planned years in advance—especially when new equipment is involved—the suggested addition of crew amounts to a last-minute addition. EM-2, which is currently planned as the first manned mission, isn’t slated to fly for several years after EM-1, most likely between 2021–2023. \nIt’s unclear whether Autry’s statements reflect the current mood within NASA given that he is no longer a part of administration. But they fall in line with what NASA’s acting administrator Richard Lightfoot told employees in a February 15 email: “I know the challenges associated with such a proposition, like reviewing the technical feasibility, additional resources needed, and clearly the extra work would require a different launch date. That said, I also want to hear about the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space.”   Image credit: NASA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:01:39.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
