Inside Hitler's Bunker Friday, 28th October 2016 The inside of the bunker where Hitler spent his final days has been revealed for the first time. 1 / 18 “when he started being given hormone and steroid injections, and the second half of 1944, Hitler hardly enjoyed a sober day” Norman Ohler \nWhen discussing the state of Hitler's veins, he wrote: \"Hitler's veins were so wrecked by late 1944 that even his personal physician could hardly penetrate them. \n\"When he finally did manage to break the skin, it actually made a crunching noise.\" \nNorman adds that the mass-murderer had all of Nazi Germany on a strong form of meth. \nThe pill, Pervitin, which became as regular as modern day cup of coffee, promised to \"integrate shirkers, malingerers, defeatists and whiners\". \nHitler's one true love, Eva Braun, also insisted on taking the same medication as Hitler, which caused her to become addicted to aggressive sex. \nBILD ROUGH SEX: The drugs made Eva very aggressive in bed \nBut it had the opposite effect on the war criminal, making him dependent on a cocktail of strong drugs to get through the day. \nMr Ohler added: \"In his isolation, all pleasure and energy previously received from the attention of a cheering crowd had to be replaced by chemicals. \n\"Between the autumn of 1941, when he started being given hormone and steroid injections, and the second half of 1944, Hitler hardly enjoyed a sober day.\" \n\"Without the drugs to prop him up, all that was left behind was a shell of a man whose uniform was splattered with rice gruel.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:02:15.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
