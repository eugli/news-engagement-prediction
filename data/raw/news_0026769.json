And second, if God did look down, his only thought would've been, 'Wait, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir? Come on, I'm sick of them and I'm God.'\" \nIn addition to those statements, Oliver believes that Trump doesn't seem to know certain things that a president should know, ranging from nuclear weapons to the actual federal unemployment rate. \nSo in an effort to \"educate\" Trump on important facts, Oliver decided to run commercials on Monday morning on several cable news channels , something the host is sure Trump will see. \n\"Until we're shut down,\" Oliver said, \"we are prepared to educate Donald Trump one by one on topics we're pretty sure he doesn't know about.\" \nWatch the episode below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:25:13.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
