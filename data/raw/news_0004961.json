Barkley said he played golf the past two days. \n\"It bothers me when people are like, 'Well, what are you going to say?' I'm like, 'Dude, I'm not 12,'\" Barkley said. \"'Oooh, he said something bad about me, I've got to say something bad about him.' I'm not 12, I'm a 53-year-old man who's going to be 54 in three weeks. This notion that just because somebody insulted me . . . I'm not 12, I'm not back in Leeds (Ala.) as if I'm in projects, if you knock a stick off my shoulder and all hell breaks loose.\" \nBarkley set off James last month when he said the Cavaliers superstar was being \"whiny\" for publicly calling for roster help. James ripped Barkley in response , referencing several of Barkley's infamous off-court actions . Barkley stood by his comments and said he would stick to basketball. \nMORE: J.R. Smith says Chuck not on Bron's level as a person \nThe came an at-times tense segment in the TNT studio Thursday. Panelist Shaquille O'Neal, a former teammate of James' in Cleveland, appeared visibly upset with Barkley, who kept saying James has enough help to win a championship and that Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook would love to have James' all-star supporting cast. O'Neal kept saying that it wasn't about the stars but the role players, which is the type of player James wants. Charles Barkley responds to LeBron James' recent comments. pic.twitter.com/tJQYQzF3Bs â€” NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 3, 2017 \n\"Chuck made it personal when he said LeBron doesn't like to compete,\" O'Neal told panelist Kenny Smith, referring to Barkley's initial criticism. \"Everybody knows, including you, Kenny, when you win a championship and you lose key players like (Matthew) Dellavedova and (Timofey) Mozgov you have to regroup. That's what y'all did in Houston (in 1994-95 after Smith and the Rockets won the championship).\" \nMcCARTHY: Shut up already, LeBron \nSmith seemed to be on the fence. He said he didn't think James was wrong to ask for help, but he also was critical of James and other players for not acknowledging when analysts praise them. Barkley on Thursday repeatedly said James is the best player in the world. \nSmith also tried to compare James' requests to Kevin Durant leaving the Thunder for the Warriors, which led to an indirect discussion of super teams. Again, Shaq brought it the strongest. \n\"Chuck asks a question: Do we (superstar players) want all the best players? You're damn right we do. You're damn right I want all the best players,\" O'Neal said. \"When I kick it out to a guy, I want it to be a D-Scott (Dennis Scott) or a Glen Rice. When I've got a guard going up against Westbrook, I want it to be GP (Gary Payton). So to answer your question, do I want all the great players? Yes. It doesn't matter if you have the highest payroll (as the Cavs do). Do you want to win championships or do you just want to win games and lose in the Eastern Conference finals? You've got to spend money to make money.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:19:12.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
