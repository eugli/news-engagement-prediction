By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 09:18 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nMumbai: There were reports suggesting that Kangana Ranaut was in talks with Sanjay Leela Bhansali for a period-film that would also star Shah Rukh Khan. But according to the latest buzz, the curly-haired beauty might not a part of the project anymore. \nAccording to a report in dnaindia.com originally attributed to Business of cinema, Kangana has apparently lost out on the mega project. \nThe ace filmmaker approached SRK with two scripts and the superstar chose the one which hadn’t been discussed with Kangana. Moreover, according to the report, SLB has decided to look for his leading lady and may not cast the ‘Queen’ of Hindi Cinema. \nInterestingly, Kangana had recently said that she wouldn’t want to work with any of the Khans – Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh – given the fact that women have very little to offer to the films that feature these stars. Moreover, she said, she will only do films that give her character equal importance and sceenspace. \nWell, even if this report of SLB dropping the idea of having Kangana on board turns out to be true, we are sure it wouldn’t upset her at all.
