Here are the 19 orders, actions and memoranda he has signed so far: An order directing the Treasury secretary to review the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law.\n\nA memorandum instructing the Labor Department to delay implementing an Obama rule requiring financial professionals who are giving advice on retirement, and who charge commissions, to put their client's interests first. An order instructing agencies that whenever they introduce a regulation, they must first abolish two others.\nA memorandum to restructure the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council.\n\nA memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to draw up a plan within 30 days to defeat ISIS.\n\nAn order to lengthen the ban on administration officials working as lobbyists. There is now a 5 year-ban on officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government, and a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nAn executive order imposing a 120-day suspension of the refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. from citizens of seven terror hot spots: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan.\n\nTwo multi-pronged orders on border security and immigration enforcement including: the authorization of a U.S.-Mexico border wall; the stripping of federal grant money to sanctuary cities; hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents; ending “catch-and-release” policies for illegal immigrants; and reinstating local and state immigration enforcement partnerships.\nA memorandum calling for a 30-day review of military readiness.\n\nTwo orders reviving the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access piplines. He also signed three other related orders that would: expedite the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects related to the pipelines; direct the Commerce Department to streamline the manufacturing permitting process; and give the Commerce Department 180 days to maximize the use of U.S. steel in the pipeline.\n\nAn order to reinstate the so-called \"Mexico City Policy\" – a ban on federal funds to international groups that perform abortions or lobby to legalize or promote abortion. The policy was instituted in 1984 by President Reagan, but has gone into and out of effect depending on the party in power in the White House.\n\nA notice that the U.S. will begin withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump called the order \"a great thing for the American worker.\"\n\nAn order imposing a hiring freeze for some federal government workers as a way to shrink the size of government. This excludes the military, as Trump noted at the signing.\n\nAn order that directs federal agencies to ease the “regulatory burdens” of ObamaCare. It orders agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement” of ObamaCare that imposes a “fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.” Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:41:32.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
