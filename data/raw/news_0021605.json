The DA has asked for a meeting with Speaker Baleka Mbete on Wednesday to remove the troops before the SONA on Thursday. \nZuma said in his letter to Mbete, revealed in Parliamentary papers, that the army would assist the police to maintain law and order. \nThe EFF has been leading disruptions during Zuma’s appearances in Parliament since 2014. Julius Malema’s party has promised that Zuma will not have it easy each time he rocked up in the Chamber. The first disruption in Parliament was in August 2014 during the question and answer session with Zuma. \nZuma said the army deployment was necessary to keep troublemakers out. Several protests have been planned around the Cape Town CBD on Thursday. \nThis has become a feature during the SONA in the past three years. \nPolitical Bureau ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:43:53.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
