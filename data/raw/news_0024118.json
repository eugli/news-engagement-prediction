Article continues below \nJoyce is the same height as Klitschko and Joshua, and after his silver medal at the Rio Olympic Games, it is surely only a matter of time before he turns professional. \nClarke, on the other hand, went undefeated in the latest World Series of Boxing. Article continues below Marseille's cheeky tweet at West Ham fans after Dimitri Payet's first goal \nJoshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn told Sky Sports : “Obviously we want people to replicate Klitschko’s style, so big, tall heavyweights. We’ll be bringing about three or four in, probably starting about seven weeks out. \n“I think Fraser and Joe Joyce, they have given him a huge amount of rounds. He's not the easiest person to spar with. We need to get those big guys in, who are going to replicate Klitschko's style. \n“I think you've got to mix it up. Someone like a Marius Wach has got great experience anyway, but sometimes you want the younger, fresher guys who are going to try more and put you under more pressure. Then you want the other guys who are going to try and frustrate you and slow the pace down and make you box at their pace as well.” \nJoshua boasts a perfect 18 knockouts from his 18 professional outings, and although he’ll be facing his biggest challenge yet, Hearn doesn’t see him changing his game plan at Wembley. \n“I think he will be looking to stand in front of Klitschko and throw shots and fight like he always does,” Hearn said. \n“He doesn’t jump in, he’s not reckless, but both fighters know each other, they both feel confident about winning. \n“I think he’s looking forward to getting back into camp now. He knows it’s a lot of hard work ahead of him. \n“Just back in Sheffield now from Monday of this week, training up there a couple of times a day, three times a day, getting physio, the rehabilitation. \n“He takes camp very seriously. He prides himself in working with the very best. He’s lucky to be based in Sheffield with [trainer] Rob McCracken and he’s got everything he needs up there.” \nThe size and stature of Joshua’s sparring partners seems ideal for the fight, but only time will tell whether they will be enough to help him overcome the experience of Klitschko’s 64 professional victories. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
