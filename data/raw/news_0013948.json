Taylor then beat Brownlie to the half century mark, racing to the milestone from 44 deliveries with eight boundaries.\nThe recalled Brownlie brought up his maiden half century shortly after with an on-drive off Starc.\nBrownlie's dismissal sparked a middle order collapse with Neil Broom (8), Colin Munro (3) and Jimmy Neesham (1) all dismissed within 11 runs as the hosts slumped to 209-6 in the 41st over.\nTaylor, who had slowed his scoring as wickets fell at the other end, brought up his century with a thick edge to third man for his 12th boundary before he became James Faulkner's third wicket of the innings.\nSantner provided a valuable 38 runs at the end of the innings, which included two fours and a six from the final three deliveries after Starc had bowled Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson with the first two of the 50th over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:43:18.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
