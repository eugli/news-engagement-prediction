Supporters of Sir Edward Heath have dismissed the claims as ludicrous Credit: AP \nO peration Conifer was launched in 2015, ten years after Sir Edward's death and has had a team of more than 20 police officers and staff looking into allegations dating back 50-years. \nBut supporters of the late Tory leader have dismissed the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" insisting Sir Edward did not have the opportunity or inclination to abuse children. \nBut according to the Mail on Sunday, a source has said there are a large number of allegations which are very similar and come from people who were not known to one another. \nThe source said: \"What stands out is that the people giving these accounts are not connected but the stories and the details dovetail. It contains disturbing stuff. Investigators have been shocked by what they have learned.\" More than 30 alleged victims have come forward with complaints against the former Prime Minister Credit: PA \nO ne of the former Prime Minister's former armed protection officers had previously dismissed the idea that Sir Edward could have abused youngsters because he was watched around the clock by police. \nThe allegations were also said to be ludicrous, because the former Prime Minister did not have a car and used a driver to get wherever he went. \nBut police have now obtained photographic evidence, suggesting that Sir Edward did have a car and did occasionally drive unaccompanied. \nThroughout the investigation Mr Veale has defended the force's actions against critics who have said it is a \"witch-hunt\", adding: \"I will not be buckling under pressure to not investigate or to conclude the investigation prematurely.\" \nOperation Conifer was with a television appeal asking for \"victims\" of Sir Edward to come forward. \nPreviously Peter Cracknell, a firearms specialist who spent 29-years with Wiltshire Police, has said Sir Edward would not have had the opportunity to abuse youngsters because security around him was so tight. \nMr Cracknell, who worked at the former Prime Minister's Salisbury home, Arundells, between 1985 and 1990, said the long running police investigation into claims he was a paedophile who took part in satanic abuse was \"ludicrous\".
