He was a Marine who tried to make his way onto the Detroit Tigers through the minor leagues in the 1950s. He was a working-class kid who rose to the absolute heights of wealth and power by striking out on his own, building from just about nothing. \nAnd whether he was starting a pizza business in 1959, buying up sports teams or helping to remake the north end of downtown Detroit, it was that grit that drove his vision and left an indelible mark on this region. \nHis death Friday, at age 87, marks a major chapter-turn in the history of his many holdings and in the history of the city of Detroit itself. \nWhen people die, particularly famous people, the tendency sometimes is to deify or vilify, to reduce a long and rich life to a postcard-like description. Remembering Mike Ilitch Chris Ilitch now in charge of dad's empire under succession plan \nBut Ilitch’s long tenure as a shaper of fortunes and dreams, his elaborate and often difficult relationship with the people and institutions of this city — they really make it impossible to oversimplify. \nNo doubt, he has bettered this community in countless ways big and small. One of my favorite stories about him recalls his paying Rosa Parks’ rent when the civil rights icon fell on hard times. It was a small but enormous gesture — the kind of thing that just exudes goodness. \nBut he also leaves a complex legacy. The strife over some of his projects and the public subsidies for them. The fans who decried the tenure of his ownership of two of the city’s major sports franchises. They are part of who he was, too. \nWithout question, this newspaper’s editorial board had a complicated and, at times, tumultuous relationship with Ilitch. \nHis headstrong approach to seeing his ideas enacted sometimes worked to the unquestioned benefit of the city — think of the Fox Theatre renovation, which took place when there really was no one else making that kind of private investment in downtown Detroit. \nIt took guts to double down on Detroit back then — and Ilitch put his money where others wouldn’t. \nThe payoff for the city would play out over the next few decades, as “Foxtown” was an early vigil for the Detroit development scene, then the predicate for so many of the other investments that have unfolded. \nThere were times, though, when Ilitch’s don’t-look-back approach bumped and bruised sensibilities around the best way to make Detroit better.

(Photo: Mary Schroeder, Detroit Free Press) \nBack in the mid-1990s, when he was building Comerica Park and insisting that Tiger Stadium meet with the wrecking ball, then-editorial page editor Joseph Stroud waged a long battle in print to get the mayor and governor to articulate and guard the difference between what was best for the Ilitch organization and what was best for Detroit. \nThere were undisputed upsides to the plans for Comerica Park, but Stroud wanted more attention paid to the public costs, and the interests asserted by those who believed Tiger Stadium could, and should, be saved. \n“Detroit is in the difficulties it is in today partly because of a past willingness to embrace short-term ‘solutions’ that turn out to be false promises,” Stroud wrote. “The city often has failed to deal thoughtfully and creatively with the possibilities of change for the better.” \nIn the end, it didn’t much matter. Ilitch's gritty and unyielding pursuit of his plans won the day. \nToday, almost no one questions the impact Comerica Park has had on downtown, bringing hundreds of thousands to the central business district each summer, and sparking an economic boom that continues to grow and astound downtown. \nBut it’s also worth remembering how that all came to be, and what was sacrificed in the process. A single-minded focus was what Ilitch used to birth Comerica Park. And, as it was throughout his long career, that focus was both a gift to this city, and a challenge. \nDetroit, undoubtedly, will miss Ilitch — miss his passion for this place, miss his love for our sports legacy, miss his unswerving commitment to stay invested in this city, and to grow that investment in ways that made Detroit shine. \nHe was a tough-ass Detroiter — maybe one of the toughest. \nWhat he leaves behind will ensure no one forgets, any time soon, the tremendous impact he had on this city.
