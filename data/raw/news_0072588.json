Man collapses from being caned for spending time with a woman \nBut TV scientist Brian Cox believes that the particle collider has proved that ghosts don’t exist – because we haven’t detected anything that could carry information about us after death. \nSpeaking on Radio 4, Cox said, ‘We are not here to debate the existence of ghosts because they don’t exist. \n‘If we want some sort of pattern that carries information about our living cells to persist then we must specify precisely what medium carries that pattern and how it interacts with the matter particles out of which our bodies are made. Large Hadron Collider. Picture: (John Von Radowitz/PA) \n‘We must, in other words, invent an extension to the Standard Model of Particle Physics that has escaped detection at the Large Hadron Collider. \n‘That’s almost inconceivable at the energy scales typical of the particle interactions in our bodies.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:54:14.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
