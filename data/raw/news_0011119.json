They’re continuing to rally alongside immigration and civil rights lawyers, even though a federal judge has temporarily stopped the order from being implemented. \n“There is still the capacity for an unscrupulous attorney general to knuckle under and follow orders rather than the law,” Jelf said. \nPolice are keeping an eye on both groups, making sure they don’t disrupt travelers and don’t attack each other. The protests have been peaceful so far. \n“I think the people standing across the street and a lot of us have more in common than we do that divide us,” Diane Morris said. \n“I think this is an amazing country that we can stand here and fight for our cause, they can stand there and fight for their cause, no violence, no hate, just we have an opinion that’s different from theirs and I respect that, Wade said. \nLAX officials said the protests have been peaceful and no arrests have been made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:00:41.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
