Now the documentary Cries From Syria looks at the events that lead the Middle Eastern nation into an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. You can watch the exclusive trailer for the film above. Directed by Evgeny Afineevsky (an Oscar nominee a year ago for Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom ) and narrated by Helen Mirren, the film draws on activist war footage and interviews with people on both sides of the conflict to paint an intimate, devastating portrait of a civil war that has left hundreds of thousands of Syrians dead and caused more than 5 million others to flee the country.\nCries From Syria debuted at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. The film will have a limited theatrical run in Los Angeles starting March 3 and in New York March 10 before it debuts on HBO March 13 at  10 p.m. ET/PT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:55:24.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
