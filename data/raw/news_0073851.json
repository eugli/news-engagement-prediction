After going two games with no technical fouls, the New Orleans Pelicans’ volatile All-Star was assessed his first technical foul with his new team when he and Thunder center Steven Adams, who was also T’d up, got tangled up just 32 seconds into Sunday’s game. Took 32 seconds for Boogie to receive another technical foul. \nHe will be suspended a game unless this is rescinded. pic.twitter.com/4rbcYHRfE1 \n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 27, 2017 \nCousins was suspended one game earlier this month after picking up his 16th technical of the season. If Sunday night’s technical isn’t rescinded, Cousins will be forced to sit out another game. \nCousins is no stranger to drawing the ire of the refs during his career, picking up 109 technicals and being ejected 11 times before Sunday’s game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:52:17.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
