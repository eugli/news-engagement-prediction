On Monday evening, Israel’s parliament passed a law authorizing the government to legalize thousands of homes built in the West Bank, in many cases on land against which there are claims of prior ownership. The measure allows the homes to remain, while compensating the previous owners with their choice of an alternative parcel of land or a payment equal to 125 percent of the land’s value. Advertisement \nThe new law, highly controversial in Israel, is sure to be challenged in court. Many experts predict that Israel’s aggressively independent judiciary will strike the law down. It wouldn’t be the first time Israel’s government has lost a litigation battle — and if it comes to that, the country’s elected officials will bow to the court’s authority. Just days ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following orders from the Supreme Court, sent in security forces to remove hundreds of Jewish residents from Amona, an unauthorized hilltop community in the West Bank. Stories about Israeli settlements invariably generate breathless international headlines, as though there is something uniquely newsworthy about Jews in the Jewish state building homes and schools to accommodate a growing population. When those homes and schools are constructed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem — land Israel seized from Jordan in the Six Day War 50 years ago — there is inevitably much handwringing about the threat they pose to the prospect of peace with the Palestinians and the “two-state solution” on which an end to the conflict supposedly depends.

The explicit goal of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas is the elimination of the Jewish state, not the building-up of a Palestinian counterpart. That is why they have rejected multiple offers of statehood, why they insist that Jews cannot live in any territory claimed by Palestinians, and why the Palestinian Authority regards the sale of land to Jews as a capital crime punishable by death . When Israel relinquished all of Gaza to Palestinian control, the new owners used the territory not to develop a constructive and peaceful new State of Palestine, but to launch rockets and terror raids against the state of Israel next door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:59:48.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
