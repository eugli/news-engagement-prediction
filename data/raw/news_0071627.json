Openers David Warner and Matt Renshaw battled hard against India's spinners. Warner even survived a dismissal off a no-ball from Jayant Yadav and then had a close shave against R Ashwin. \nBut then, just when the dangerous southpaw was settled, he was bowled by Umesh Yadav in his first over of the match. And then, as Steve Smith walked out to the middle, Renshaw jogged past him clutching his stomach.

Renshaw had batted brilliantly up until that point, using his feet smartly against the spin of Ashwin, Jayant and Ravindra Jadeja .

Renshaw had moved to 36 off 89 balls which included a six off Jadeja and it looked like he could offer some resistance to India's hostile spin attack but it came to an end in a rather comical fashion.

He was then asked to leave after being told that he could come in to bat only at the fall of the next wicket. That left Shaun Marsh little time to rush out to the crease. Reuters Photo \nAfter a brief partnership promised to offer some solace to Australia, Marsh perished to Jayant. However, there was still no sign of Renshaw as Peter Handscomb joined Smith in the middle. \nFormer Australian captain Michael Clarke, who was on air for Star Sports commentary duties, was left stunned with the development minutes before lunch. \n\"What is going on here? He's retiring ill,\" former Test skipper Michael Clarke said on Star Sports commentary after watching the unusual situation unfold. \"There's only 15 minutes to lunch. I can't believe Renshaw's retiring. He must be extremely sick with a stomach bug and has to go to the bathroom. \n\"This is unbelievable for Australia. \"Steve Smith didn't know what was going on. He walked onto the field after the dismissal of David Warner and his partner walked straight past him.\" \nAnother former Australian captain, Allan Border, was not happy with Renshaw's decision to go off the field with 15 minutes left for lunch. He expressed his displeasure on Fox Sports. \"It's such a shame, we saw him having to go off 15 minutes before lunch. I hope he is lying on the table there half dead otherwise as a captain I would not be happy.\" \nHowever, Renshaw redeemed himself when he resumed his innings at the fall of Peter Handscomb's wicket and struck his second half-century. He remained firm at one end while Australia kept losing wickets at the other.
