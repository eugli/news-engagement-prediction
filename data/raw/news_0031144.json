Pace has also established itself even more in downtown Manhattan because of a $190 million renovation plan and a new performing arts school . In addition, the law school, in White Plains, recently received the largest gift in its history. But there is also anxiety about the future. In a recent op-ed in The Daily News , Mr. Friedman urged that a recent proposal by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to help cover tuition costs for middle-class students at state and city universities be expanded to include private nonprofit colleges. Undergraduate tuition at Pace for the 2016-17 academic year is $41,120, with the cost for room and board and other fees bringing the total to more than $60,000. Mr. Friedman, 78, announced his plans to retire a year ago, prompting a search for his successor. In an interview, Mark M. Besca, the chairman of Pace’s board of trustees, praised Mr. Krislov as a “perfect fit” for his passion, fund-raising success and credentials. Mr. Besca, a Pace graduate who is now the managing partner of Ernst & Young’s New York office, declined to disclose Mr. Krislov’s salary, saying the figures would be available eventually on the university’s tax returns. But Mr. Friedman made $692,000, according to the most recent filing, while Mr. Krislov’s salary at Oberlin was $577,000. Mr. Krislov was previously a finalist for the presidency of the University of Iowa. He is a native of Kentucky, where his father was an academic and his mother a social worker. After receiving his law degree from Yale, he worked in senior positions at the Department of Labor in the Clinton administration, and also as vice president and general counsel at the University of Michigan. One of the most fervent debates on college campuses has been taking place at Yale where, over the weekend, Peter Salovey, the president, announced that the university would change the name of a residential college commemorating John. C. Calhoun, a 19th-century white supremacist statesman from South Carolina. The decision reversed one made last spring to keep the name, despite vehement opposition. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story When asked about Yale’s decision, Mr. Krislov declined to comment, saying that he did not have enough information to weigh in. He did note, however, that he was a member of another residential college, Jonathan Edwards, which is named after the fiery colonial theologian.
