If you’re Future , you go and release another album. \nThe Atlanta rapper promised and delivered HNDRXX , which features guest spots from The Weeknd ( “ Coming Out Strong”) and Rihanna (\"Selfish\") and arrives just one week after the release of his self-titled studio set. \nFuture is chasing a piece of chart history. As previously reported, his Future LP could debut at No. 1 on the March 11-dated survey with roughly 150,000 equivalent units. If HNDRXX performs just as well, he’ll become the first act to debut at No. 1 in consecutive frames. \nHNDRXX , like Future , was released through A-1/Freebandz/Epic Records and runs to 17 tracks.
