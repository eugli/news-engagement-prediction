Labour is hoping to retain both seats. \nThe Conservatives fancy their chances in Copeland and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall is seen as the main challenger in Stoke. \nThe IMC poll also put Ukip on 13%, the Lib Dems on 8% and the Greens on 4%. \nThe figures mean that even a so-called progressive alliance of Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens would still be six points adrift of the Tories. \nDefeat in either of the by-elections would be a damaging blow to Corbyn. But his close ally Diane Abbott yesterday said it would not affect his leadership. \n“I’m confident Jeremy will lead us into 2020. The point about the polls is you’ve had nearly a year of a sustained campaign against Jeremy and the Labour party, both in the media and sadly a few of our MPs,” she told Sky News. \n“I think, as we move beyond what has been almost a year of misrepresentation of Jeremy’s position, I think if you move beyond that and the more people get to see him and hear him, whether it’s in the media or at campaigning events, I’m confident the polls will improve.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:52:56.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
