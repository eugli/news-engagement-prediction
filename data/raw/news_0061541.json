Article continues below \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan limped off with a hamstring injury 10 minutes after giving United the lead, while Michael Carrick followed him to the treatment room in the second half with a calf problem. United fans targeted \nHowever, the biggest disappointment for the Red Devils and their fans didn't come on the pitch, but up in the stands. \nThe tie was a hostile affair throughout, but one sickening incident involving Saint-Etienne supporters dampened the spirits amongst United fans who had made the 829 mile trip to eastern France. \nAs can be seen in the video below, Saint-Etienne fans, on the lower tier, faced the United end and made aeroplane gestures in reference to the Munich Air Disaster which killed eight Manchester United players. \nThe tragedy, which happened 59 years ago this month, occurred after a plane carrying United's players crashed on its third attempt to take off. Stewards take no action \nBut despite Saint Etienne fans making their sickening gestures directly in front of stewards, they failed to take action against the group of individuals who were clearly going out of their way to anger the away support. \nAnd it's not the only time in recent months that English football fans have faced trouble in France, after Three Lions supporters were mobbed by Russian hooligans during the European Championships. \nUEFA have already opened disciplinary proceedings against Saint-Etienne, after the Ligue 1 outfit's fans threw objects and set off fireworks at Old Trafford last week, but it remains to be seen whether Wednesday night's incidents will be taken into consideration. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
