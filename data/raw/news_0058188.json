MUST READ IND vs AUS: Twitter erupts with jokes seeing India's incredible collapse and Virat Kohli's rare duck \nSteve Smith and Co. came out to bat for the 2nd time in the day and by stumps they were 143/4, with the skipper standing solid at 59 not out. \nSmith, who was expected to struggle against Indian spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin despite being one of the better Aussie players of spin, amused Jadeja in the 2nd innings and the Indian spinner couldn't hold himself from impersonating the Australian batsman. \nHere's a video of the incident:- \nIndian team coach Anil Kumble also gave his views on the Men in Blue's performance on Day 2. \n\"I think he bowled steady. He bowled consistently in good areas. Like I mentioned, there were a couple of soft dismissals, and that pushed us back. It was one of those days where we saw Jadeja bowl in the last session where probably every over he was beating the bat three times. It was one of those days where on another day, that could have all taken the edge.\" \nSecond day was was overly dramatic for India, as Steve O’Keefe pinned India down on to the mat with his career best 6 for 35. The spinner was further helped by sharp-Aussie fielders on pitch, who took almost all of the half chances that came their way. \nAustralia were 143/4 at the end of Day 2 and lead by 298 runs with six wickets remaining and resume Day 3 with a lead of 298 runs and six wickets in their hand.
