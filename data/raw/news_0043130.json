PewDiePie brands media 'insane' over anti-Semitism claims \nToronto police said they were taking the notes \"very seriously\". \n\"Anti-Semitism has no place in Toronto,\" mayor John Tory said in a statement. \"Our Jewish residents should not have to face hatred on their doorsteps.\" \nJewish people across North America have found themselves victims of a wave of discrimination during the 2016 election campaign and so far in 2017. Graphiq \nMore than 50 Jewish community centres received phone-in bomb threats, with four separate days of threats and evacuations recorded so far this year. In January alone, 48 JCCs and one Canadian province received nearly 60 bomb threats. A Jewish cemetery in Missouri was also vandalised, with many headstones toppled over. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was pictured laying a wreath at the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin on 17 February. \nIn contrast, US President Donald Trump was pressured to speak out on the issue after he omitted mentioning the Jewish people from his statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and after he told a Jewish reporter to “sit down” for asking a question about anti-Semitism. \n\"It’s horrible, and it’s going to stop,\" he said in response to a question at the National Museum of African American History.
