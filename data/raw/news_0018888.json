Police are once again focusing their search for the 72-year-old on properties on Penetanguishene Road and in the Shanty Bay area.\n\"You think about the family involved and you really want to find her, for their sake,\" says Barrie police Const. Doug Bosch. \"You are emotionally attached to this at this point.\"\nInvestigators continued to use an OPP helicopter, snowmobiles and K9 units in their search.\nThompson, who has dementia, was reported missing Friday morning from her Laidlaw Drive home in Barrie.\nPolice are appealing to anyone who lives in Oro-Medonte to check their properties for Thompson. Investigators believe she could be in a barn, shed or garage.\nDespite the focus of the search, police are also urging residents of northeast Barrie to give their properties another look as well.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the police tip line at 705-725-7025 ext. 2160.\nRelated Stories Police want to speak with tow truck driver in search for Mandy Thompson Photos Mandy Thompson can be seen in these undated photos provided by Barrie Police Service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:11:53.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
