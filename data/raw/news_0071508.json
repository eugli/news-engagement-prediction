Paul Nuttall's troubled relationship with the truth finally catches up with him Read more \nUkip had assumed the seat was winnable on the basis of the constituency’s 69% leave vote in last year’s EU referendum. “This was an election that we really should have won,” Farage wrote in the Telegraph on Saturday. \nDespite that, Farage, who has become a leading figure on the right since his successful campaign for Brexit, said he was confident that Nuttall was “the right man” to lead Ukip’s campaign for Labour’s heartlands. \nHe argued that the party needed to reclaim its hardline stance on immigration. “My view is that Ukip is a radical party, or it is nothing,” he wrote, pointing to statistics that showed that 74,000 Bulgarians and Romanians had moved to the UK since 2014. \n“Attitudes are hardening across the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union, too. It is the issue in British politics that Ukip needs to own, because once article 50 is triggered, I fear there may be a flood of people rushing to get into our country before – as they see it – the door closes.” \nAccording to Farage, Ukip’s failure in Stoke was down to soft-pedalling on control of the UK’s borders and wasting activists’ time by failing to focus more keenly on Brexit voters. \nThe government’s apparently hardline Brexit stance was also a factor, but one that Farage believes will become less important as “voters may well be disappointed with what they get” as the Tories make concessions to Brussels over free-movement and fishing rights. \nFarage’s comments were published a day after he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) , the biggest conservative conference in the US on Friday, claiming that Brexit and the election victory of Donald Trump were “the beginning of a great global revolution” that would continue on throughout the west. \n“We’ve got some very exciting elections coming up in the Netherlands, in France, in Germany,” he said, referring to the challenge mounted by the far-right leader Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le Pen in France and the Alternative für Deutschland party in Germany. \nSpeaking to the Guardian the day before his speech, Farage backed Trump and his chief strategist Steve Bannon over controversial issues such as the travel ban, attacks on the media and the president’s attitude to Russia. \n“The truth is that too much of the establishment broadcast media in particular has effectively become wedded to this form of global social democracy that we’ve lived through for the last 20 years, and I think there are genuinely questions about impartiality with a series of major broadcasters right across the west,” he said.
