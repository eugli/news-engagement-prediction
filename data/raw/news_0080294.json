In this file photo, Senator Leila de Lima files a case against President Duterte before the Supreme Court. On March 14, the SC will hear another case – this time involving a case filed against her. File photo by Adrian Portugal/Rappler   The Supreme Court set on March 14 oral arguments on the petition of detained Senator Leila de Lima, Rappler learned. The decision to hold oral arguments on the case was reached on Tuesday, February 28, during the High Tribunal’s en banc session, a source said. Through her lawyer, Alex Padilla, De Lima on Monday, February 27, filed with the SC an 82-page petition for certiorari and prohibition, seeking a stop to the ongoing Muntinlupa case against her and the nullification of her arrest. The Philippine National Police arrested De Lima on February 24 on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by Muntinlupa Judge Juanita Guerrero of Regional Trial Court Branch 204. The justice department filed drug charges against the senator based on testimonies of drug convicts, who claimed they paid her off in exchange for their protection inside the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa.
