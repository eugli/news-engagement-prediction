The system also contained 190 images of other lemur species. Using a modified version of human facial recognition software, it was able to correctly identify the 80 individuals.\nDr Jacobs said that the method could be applied to other species such as red pandas and other bears.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1311B/production/_94770187_lemurfacialrecognition.gif", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17B53/production/_94770179_red-belliedlemurs.gif", "http://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-016-0011-9"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:40:33.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
