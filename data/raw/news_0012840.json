Here, 12 of our favorites. Share via Twitter YouTube/Bai Antioxidant Infusions Whether you came to Super Bowl LI for the football or tuned in for the commercials, the sporting event did not disappoint. Not only did the game go into overtime (for the first time in Super Bowl history!), but hilarious advertisements also kept the entertainment going during the commercial breaks, too. While many advertisers sought to send political messages   ad spots, others stuck to a classic strategy—delivering laughs and smiles. Here, 12 of our favorite charming, delightful, and hilarious Super Bowl LI commercials. 1. Buick's football-fueled commercial, starring Cam Newton and Miranda Kerr. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton played pee-wee football, and model Miranda Kerr stepped in to coach the sport. Really, what more could you ask for? 2. Intel's epic day in the life of Tom Brady. Tom Brady 's everyday life might not seem that eventful. He yawns, brushes his teeth, and eats food he's dropped on the floor—just like the rest of it. But Intel's 360-degree technology took Brady's morning from ordinary to extraordinary—and it helped create a pretty funny Super Bowl ad in the process. 3. Honda's celeb-studded yearbook ad. Honda's \"blast from the past\" yearbook commercial might not have been super laugh-worthy, but it was heartwarming nonetheless. I mean, who doesn't love seeing Tina Fey , Viola Davis , and Steve Carell in their high school glory days? 4. Bai's commercial starring Christopher Walken, Justin Timberlake, and some much-needed *NSYNC music. With Christopher Walken doing a dramatic performance of a classic *NSYNC tune and a cameo appearance from Justin Timberlake , Bai's Super Bowl ad was everything we could have asked for and more. All we can say is: Bai, bai, bai. 5. Tide's laundry saga, featuring Jeffrey Tambor and Patriot’s tight end Rob Gronkowski. If Tide's Super Bowl commercial is evidence of anything, it's that no one should take their dry cleaning to NFL player Rob Gronkowski. In a hilarious three-part saga, actor Jeffrey Tambor finds that out the hard way. Watch the first chapter here, and click here to see the rest of the story unfold. 6. Febreze's ode to the half-time bathroom break. Febreze fully understands the importance of the half-time bathroom break—you know, the only time you can really escape the entertainment of the Super Bowl and handle some necessary business. Their ad paid homage to one of the most under-rated—but most important—moments of the Super Bowl experience. 7. Squarespace's take on \"Being John Malkovich.\" Fans of Spike Jonze's 1999 film \"Being John Malkovich\" will especially enjoy Squarespace's Super Bowl ad, which documents the profanity-filled trials and tribulations of securing a website domain. 8. TurboTax's take on the Humpty Dumpty tale. Humpty Dumpty may have fallen off a wall and severely injured himself, but he's having no trouble doing his taxes. (This one's a two-parter, too. See the sequel here .) 9. The NFL's feel-good tribute to future Super Bowl stars. Take an adorable break from the football frenzy with the NFL's \"Who's Next?\" commercial. The ad highlights super cute babies dressed up in a variety of costumes, and directs the focus toward Super Bowl legends to come. (We're not crying—you're crying.) 10. Mr. Clean's sexy spin on household cleaning. Watch as Mr. Clean shakes his butt, cleans the stove, seduces the lady of the house—and then transforms into said lady's boyfriend. Sure, cleaning is sexy—and we'll likely never forget the image of Mr. Clean's gyrating hips. But men doing their part to clean the house? That should be a given. 11. T-Mobile's ad featuring our favorite duo: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. If you've ever wanted to see Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg make a series of marijuana-related puns about a mobile company, T-Mobile just made your dreams come true. 12. Kia's documentation of Melissa McCarthy's attempts to save the world. Melissa McCarthy wants to save the whales—and the trees, and the ice caps, and the rhinos too. But each time she embarks on a new activist effort, hilarity (naturally) ensues. Have a laugh and revel in the ease of driving a Kia in the car company's Super Bowl commercial.
