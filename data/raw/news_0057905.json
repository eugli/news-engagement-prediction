The Burn singer gave her glamorous awards ceremony attire a twist thanks to statement silver accessories to match the chain detailing on the dress. Metal chains snaked down the back of the halterneck number and around her neck, displaying a glimpse of her tattoos. Silk sensation: Ellie's bodyform number clung to her athletic figure in all the right places Rock 'n' roll edge: The statement dress was finished with silver chain detailing at the bust and hanging down her back from the halterneck neckline Strong look: The Burn singer gave her glamorous awards ceremony attire a twist thanks to statement silver accessories to match the chain detailing on the dress Sister act: Ellie was accompanied by her sister at the BRITS, walking the red carpet arm-in-arm The 37th BRIT Awards ceremony features a star-studded line-up with Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, Robbie Williams, Little Mix, Bruno Mars, The 1975, Emeli Sandé and Skepta all taking the stage. Emma Willis and Dermot O'Leary present the show after being drafted in when Michael Buble was forced to pull out due to his son's battle with cancer. 'The BRITs is an iconic show that I've watched and attended many times,' said Dermot about his hosting duties. 'It's a holy grail for a broadcaster, and I'm really looking forward to working with Emma, who I'm a big fan of, and celebrating a brilliant year of British music.' 'To present the BRITs is an honour but to be doing it alongside one of my absolute favourites, Mr Dermot O'Leary is just bonkers. Bring on the BRITs 2017,' added Emma. Natural beauty: The Anything Could Happen singer opted for barely-there make-up including soft pink lipstick Legs for days: The edgy black dress boasted a daring thigh-high split running up the centre of the dress, offering a glimpse of her long legs Little Mix and Grime artist Skepta lead the nominations pack with three apiece - with many critics wondering if the North London-born MC can replicate his prestigious Mercury Music Prize win and scoop the British Album of The Year prize for Konnichiwa. But he has stiff competition from the late David Bowie whose last album Blackstar is up for the gong, as well as fan favourite The 1975 whose memorably titled album I Like It When You Sleep For You Are Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It, topped both the U.S. and UK charts. Skepta will also go up against firm favourite Bowie in the Best British Male category, while fellow nominee Craig David is convinced he won't win the award. Leading ladies: Best British Group nominees Little Mix pulled out all the stops for their second year at the BRITS Thigh's the limit: Jade Thirlwall (left and right) dared to bare in an extremely high thigh=split silk dress, while Perrie (centre) opted for a feather embellished frock Pop princess: The Shout Out To My ex hitmaker looked incredible in her quirky PVC puffball number 'David Bowie's career has been so epic,' he told BBC News . 'He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition.' Little Mix - and bandmember Perrie Edwards - have a battle of their own, with Perrie's ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik both nominated for Best British single - Zayn for R&B style Pillowtalk and Little Mix for their hit Shout Out To My Ex, which fans believe is partly written about the former One Direction star. Interestingly, Beyonce goes against sister Solange for the Best International Female gong, although they both face stiff competition from rising star Christine And The Queens, Rihanna and Sia. Flirty and feminine: Tallia Storm showed off some leg in a green dress worn over a purple ruffled jumper Pearl perfection: The Scottish pop princess completed her attire with layers of pearl necklaces Solange, who considers Beyonce a role model, released her album A Seat At The Table just three days before her thirtieth birthday last year, to critical acclaim. It became her first number-one album in the US, making she and Beyonce the first sisters to have US number-one albums in a calendar year. Meanwhile, Best British Female Solo Artist will be fought out between Anonhni, Ellie Goulding, Emeli Sande, Lianne La Havas and Nao. Man of the hour: Ed Sheeran, who has just made his musical comeback, was suited and booted for the occasion Fancy seeing you here! Ed gave a warm welcome to former X Factor winner James Arthur, who is enjoying huge commercial success with his new album Adele will be hoping to replicate a tiny slice of her recent Grammy success by scooping the British Artist Video Of The Year award for Send My Love (To Your New Lover). However, she faces a tough contest with Calvin Harris Feat. Rihanna, whose video for This Is What You Came For has been a frontrunner with the bookies. Blues Singer Rag 'N' Bone Man has already secured his first BRIT, scooping the Critics Choice gong - one of two awards already announced. The award - given to artists tipped for the top - is held in high regard, having previously been presented to Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine. 'I thought they had made a mistake. I was up against two pop giants. It’s bloody brilliant! I'm crazy happy. Proper massive grin,' he said about his win when it was announced last year. And Robbie Williams will accept the BRITs Icon Award - which provides him with his 18th BRIT award win, either as a solo artist or member of Take That. The singer seemed a little bemused at being selected to receive the prestigious prize, which sees him follow in the footsteps of Elton John and David Bowie. 'There’s so much in my career where I look into the abyss and the abyss looks back and goes: \"I don’t know, I don’t have a f**king clue,\"' he recently told NME . 'How have I got 18 BRITs and Paul McCartney hasn’t? Something weird has happened... Me having 18 BRITs – it’s like there’s a glitch in the Matrix. But, you know I’m not going to give them back and I’m glad it’s happened to me.'
