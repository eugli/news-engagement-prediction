NATO unanimously decided to suspend practical co-operation with the Russian Federation in April of 2014. \nWhile Trump and his team have signaled that they may seek a possible thaw in relations with Moscow, Stoltenberg stressed that any dialogue with Russia should be approached from a position of strength.

And that just underlines that NATO has to continue to develop a ballistic missile defense system,” Stoltenberg said. \n“Our BMD, or ballistic missile defense, is not directed against Russia, it’s directed against threats coming from outside the Euro-Atlantic area,” he added. \nREAD MORE: Germany begins tank deployment to Lithuania as part of NATO commitment to Baltics \nSince the United States officially announced the deployment of BMD in Europe in 2004, Russia has persistently said the project, which is run by NATO, is directed against it. Moscow considers the placement of potentially multipurpose ground-based missile launchers in Europe a clear violation of Russian-American arms treaties, pointing out that the anti-missile facilities can be easily repurposed to fire short and midrange offensive missiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:58:34.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
