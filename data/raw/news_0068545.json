Later in the evening the 19-year-old victim died as a result of his injuries and police say it became a homicide case.\n David Formosa, 45, from Windsor, is charged with one count of first degree murder.\nThe investigation led police to a home at 760 University Ave. E near Louis Ave. Throughout the investigation a suspect was identified and police were able to make an arrest at an address in the 8700 block of Riverside Drive east.\nWindsor police would not confirm the identity of the victim, but friends and neighbours say his name was Dallas Nelson. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with funeral costs. The post says “Dallas was an aspiring musician with a promising future ahead of him.”\nA neighbour tells CTV News Nelson would come by the house frequently because his girlfriend lived there.\nIt is the first homicide in Windsor in 2017.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Windsor police at 519-255-6700 ext. 4830, Crime Stoppers anonymously at 519-258-8477 (TIPS) or online at www.catchcrooks.com \nRelated Stories Key evidence in Windsor nightclub shooting to be excluded due to charter violation Photos Police taped off a house after a shooting at 760 University Ave. E on Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017.
