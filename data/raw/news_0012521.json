Here are 10 ways you may be going wrong… Share Comments By Lynne Hyland 09:00, 5 FEB 2017 Celebs Lynne before and after (Photo: Catherine Harbour) celebs Most women use make-up every day, but as we get older, our skin changes and products can look different. You may not realise it, but sometimes your regime could actually be making you look older.\nBeauty director Lynne, 42, discovered the mistakes that could be adding years to your face.\nOn her before look above: \"Grim, from the granny blush stuck in my pores to the liner dragging my eyes down. And the “ Candice Bake Off ” lippy makes me look older than Mary Berry.\"\nAnd after? \"The elongated smoky eye makes this look like a 'before and after' for eyelid surgery. OK, I’m not going to pass for 20, but I’ve magically lost the resting bitch face without changing my expression.\"\nHere are 10 make-up mistakes to avoid and the new beauty products that can help you look younger.\n1. The wrong base Get your base right Base gets trickier on older skin, because we need it to minimise things like age spots and broken capillaries without emphasising lines. Fuller coverage matte foundations can give a papery look; BBs tick the ‘invisible finish’ box, but don’t offer any anti-ageing coverage. Instead, try ‘halfway house’ formulas, which combine a luminising finish (always good as skin loses its natural lustre) with medium coverage.\n\"For the most youthful finish, apply base then use concealer on any areas that need it,\" says St Tropez make-up artist Emma Kotch. The ‘now with extra glow’ version of Bourjois Healthy Mix foundation, £9.99 , and matching concealer, £7.99 , is perfect for this.\n2. Going bare-eyed Keep rocking a smoky eye, says make-up artist Caroline Barnes .\n\"If you have fabulous eye make-up, people will look at that; if you have bare eyes, they’ll look at your wrinkles instead! For an older eye, I’d recommend doing a soft smoky eye with a stick cream eyeshadow – they don’t crease or drop and they’re easy to blend.\n\"Look straight in the mirror and make sure you can see the colour above the socket line – if it’s just on the lid it shrinks the eye and drags it down. Then blend the colour under the lower lash line too, this makes eyes look bigger.\"\nTry Autograph Ultimate Wear Cream Eyeshadow Stick, £9.50 .\n3. Moisturising lippy Use lip liner to stop colour from bleeding In theory it’s flattering but if you have a lot of lines around your lips, a shiny, slippy lippy will end up in there.\n\"A soft matte formula will give you more control, but anything too flat and dark is ageing,\" says Caroline. \"Whatever lipstick you use, I’d recommend first applying Max Factor Invisible Lip Liner, £4.99 , just outside your natural lip line to stop it bleeding.\"\n4. Blocking out blue under the eyes Use a light reflective concealer A lot of women worry about shadows and veins looking worse as their skin thins, says Caroline.\n\"They’ll cover their undereye area with an opaque product, which dries their skin and makes it look old and lined.\"\nFar better, she says, to use a light reflective liquid concealer and not taking it out past the centre line of the pupils.\n\"This is where the skin moves and where concealer creases and cakes.\"\nLottie Got It Covered, £4.95 , has a nice light touch.\n5. Wearing mascara on the lower lashes Give those lashes a lift This casts a shadow, and can also look too much like crow’s feet, says Emma. She recommends focusing on the top lashes, defining with a black mascara and then adding extra coats to the outer third of the lashes.\n\"This will visually lift a sagging eye,\" she says.\nWe think Maybelline Push Up Angel mascara, £7.99 , is incredible for flicking up corner lashes.\n6. Opting for the hard line Avoid hard-looking eyeliner A classic feline liquid eyeliner can look harsh and ageing on older women but you can fix that with a simple technique tweak.\n\"Use a very slim felt-tip pen liner tight to the lash line, so it looks more like the base of your lashes than a hard line,\" says Emma. \"You still want to thicken the liner and flick it up at the outer edges, but before it dries, blur the edges with a blending brush. This gives a fuzzier outline that’s more flattering on older skin.\"\nEyeko Black Magic Liquid Eyeliner, £16 , also boosts lash growth.\n7. Only blending once Your base will settle into lines if you don’t switch up your blending technique, says Caroline.\n\"When you’ve finished your make-up, use a little cotton bud to pick up any excess base that’s settling into areas where the skin moves and creases, like the forehead, around the eyes, and between the mouth and nose. Then gently go over your whole face with a buffing brush.\"\n8. Sporting bad blush Use a gel or cream blush We’re all told that blusher is extra-important when time is draining colour from our complexion, but just daubing dots on your cheeks looks more muttony than fresh.\n\"You can still start your blusher on the apples of your cheeks, but you need to blend it upwards and outwards for a flattering effect,\" says Emma. \"Use a gel or cream texture rather than a powder that can sit in pores that are enlarged with age.\"\nWe’re impressed by GOSH Lumi Drops Illuminating Blush, £8.99 .\n9. Using a powder brush Invest in a good brush A big, fluffy powder brush will pick up too much product and give you an ageing, floury face.\n\"You need a much smaller brush so you can apply the lightest dusting of powder just where you need it – the T-zone and under the lower lip are the areas that go shiny and make you look like you’re going through sweaty hormonal changes,\" says Caroline.\n\"The rest of your face should be powder free, so it looks radiant and fresh.\"\nShe recommends Real Techniques Setting Brush, £7.99 .\n10. Wearing liner without lashes A huge no, says Caroline.\n\"Lashes get sparser with age anyway and if you just put on a line of kohl without mascara that’ll make your eyelashes seem invisible. Always, always wear mascara – even if you don’t have time to wear any other make-up.\"\nLynne's hair and make-up by Cassie Steward using Armani Beauty and Alterna Haircare.\nRead More Beauty essentials Lash-lengthening mascaras The best hand creams Best primers Best fake tans The best night creams Best Foundation Best Body Lotion The best Anti wrinkle creams Best concealers The best eye-liners Cleansers Best lipsticks Celebs Newsletter Follow @mirrorfashion Subscribe to our Celebs Beauty products Make-up", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://www.asos.com/lottie/lottie-got-it-covered-concealer/prd/7654342", "http://www.very.co.uk/maybelline-maybelline-push-up-angel-mascara-very-black/1600147809.prd?sku=sku19698857&cm_mmc=google-_-PLA+-+Beauty-_-Beauty+-+Make+Up-_-na_85148885098&utm_medium=cpc&k_clickid=5e6c7d26-2477-4543-8f2d-31c37db6593e&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Shopping_Beauty&utm_term=na&utm_content=85148885098&profileid=402&keywordid=na&productgroupid=pg280204&device=c&gclid=CJTNqJa27NECFS677QodVsIGAg", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorCeleb", "https://www.instagram.com/carolinebarnesmakeup/?hl=en", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://www.cassiemakeup.com/", "http://www.spacenk.com/uk/en_GB/brands/e/eyeko/black-magic-liquid-eyeliner-MUK200018569.html", "http://www.marksandspencer.com/ultimate-wear-eye-shadow/p/p22314260?pdpredirect", "http://www.superdrug.com/brandshop/gosh", "http://www.boots.com/bourjois-healthy-mix-concealer-10ml-10100716", "https://www.lookfantastic.com/real-techniques-setting-brush/10644487.html?affil=thggpsad&switchcurrency=GBP&shippingcountry=GB&gclid=CLjD0e627NECFaeT7QodkMkFDg&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CNOI4-627NECFWqg7QodNRQBLg", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfashion", "http://www.boots.com/bourjois-healthy-mix-foundation-10153884", "https://maxfactor.co.uk/make-up-products/lips/lipliner/max-factor-colour-elixir-lip-liner"], "published": "2017-02-05T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:33:15.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
