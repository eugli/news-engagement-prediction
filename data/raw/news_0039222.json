Quick off his line to deny Mertens when he occasionally got in behind Varane.\nInsigne caught Navas out early in the piece (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Carvajal 6 - Sleeping as Insigne's quick movement was found by Hamsik for the opener. His cross for Benzema's goal was super with the outside of his boot. Mixed night.\nRamos 5 - Not comfortable with Napoli's lack of presence in the central areas up top. Limped off in the second half.\nVarane 5 - Struggled to contain Mertens when he dropped deep and pulled him out of position.\nMarcelo 5 - Got forward well but left his side exposed at times with Callejon's movement in behind. Missed a glorious chance to make it four late on.\nKroos 7 - Excellent game, picked out James with a sublime pass and a neat finish from Ronaldo's cut-back put the hosts in front.\nKroos celebrates his strike (Photo: Getty) Modric 6 - Quiet night, few close shots but took a back seat to Kroos and Casemiro for the most part.\nCasemiro 8 MOM - Scored with a thunderbolt of a shot on the volley to ensure a memorable evening.\nJames 5 - Failed to grasp a rare starting opportunity. Failed to beat Reina when put through on goal.\nBenzema 7 - Could have had a couple more, but his header and constant movement caused Napoli big problems.\nRonaldo 6 - Wasteful in front of goal but his assist was excellent for Kroos' goal.\nNapoli Reina 6 - Made one outstanding save to prevent Benzema from giving the hosts an early lead.\nReina floors Benzema (Photo: REUTERS) Hysaj 5 - Got forward well and offers a calm influence in possession when Napoli look to play quick, one-touch passes. But too often was static and exposed by Real.\nAlbiol 6 - Tough night with Benzema's movement causing him real trouble. Last ditch tackle late on pushes his rating up.\nKoulibaly 6 - Brought the ball out well and made a couple of headed clearances to keep Napoli just about alive.\nGhoulam 4 - Ronaldo had his way with him when he was given the return ball in behind.\nZielinski 5 - Lively early on but wilted when Real got themselves in front.\nDiawara 6 - Calm in possession during Napoli's good moments, a tremendous talent, but naturally struggled to impose himself against Real's elite midfield in the second half.\nRonaldo takes on the defence (Photo: REUTERS) Hamsik 5 - Missed a good chance with his left in the first half, failing to hit the target at the near post.\nCallejon 6 - Saw plenty of the ball down the right but failed to expose Marcelo's advanced position. Goal ruled out after he failed to time his run to the back post.\nMertens 5 - Isolated, but dropped in and spun to offer a danger in behind. Missed a glorious chance to make it 3-2. Would have created the second goal had Callejon timed his run to be onside before finishing.\nInsigne 7 - Scored a sumptuous opener from distance with intelligence to spot Navas out of position.\nReal Madrid v Napoli View gallery poll loading Who will progress? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Real Madrid Napoli Real Madrid CF Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Real Madrid CF Real Madrid CF Napoli Champions League", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-15T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:14:21.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
