FAIRFAX NZ \nA steam train travels between Picton and Christchurch. (File photo) \nThe train would run on cruise ship days, and Jackson said he had been speaking to cruise ship agents about the plan. \nREAD MORE: * Rail tour picks up steam after tow start \n\"Passengers will be able to pre-book prior to the ship's arrival,\" he said. \nThe idea was passengers would take the train to Blenheim and spend two or three hours in the town, but local people wanting to see the sights were also welcome on board, Jackson said. \nAt this stage it looked as though the train would be running on 30 days during the tourist season, but how much tickets would cost was still undecided. \nThe train journey could tie into trips around wineries, or to the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre, or passengers could go into the town centre and go shopping or go to a restaurant. \nPassengers could also board the Blenheim Riverside Railway Society mini-train at Beaver Station, on the Taylor River, and go on a trip around Blenheim. Ad Feedback \nThe company first announced its plan in 2016, and Jackson said it was a relief they could still go ahead with the plans after the earthquake. \n\"We are also delighted to hear that there is a clear commitment to open the line to Kaikoura and beyond, which will reconnect communities and get the freight line up and running again,\" he said. \nNorth Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery, which includes NZTA and KiwiRail, aim to repair the rail network between Picton and Christchurch by the end of 2017. \nWhile the passengers were in Blenheim the train itself would travel south to a siding at the Cloudy Bay Business Park, to take on water and coal, and turn around. \nJackson said he was working closely with KiwiRail, and he was also working closely with the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand, and was looking for a crew to run the locomotive. \nOne idea was KiwiRail running a steam engine course, which would lead to more steam train operatives being trained. \n\"Our partners at Steam Incorporated are finalising our overall safety case to be submitted to NZTA,\" Jackson said. \nThe train and its carriages had been secured from Steam Incorporated, and the name of the locomotive was still under wraps. \nWork on installing the train's turntable would begin in March or April, and would be carried out by Simcox Construction. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:05:12.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
