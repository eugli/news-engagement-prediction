However, the lady’s enthusiasm is not shared by her boyfriend who believes that this is a wrong move. The actress is ready to don a not so glamorous look for her next, in fact she will be gaining oodles of weight to get into the skin of her character. It is indeed a challenge that many of her contemporaries have already taken up and succeeded. Unfortunately the babe has only played the quintessential Bollywood heroine. While she had a successful stint so far, her midas touch seems to be slowly fading. Not a critics favourite, the actress has managed to stay amongst the top heroines thanks to her films’ decent performance at the box office. And seems like with her last film being a dud, the actress’ boyfriend feels that she should tread a path more conventional than experiment. \nApparently the beau who is known for his acting prowess and other talents even advised her against signing the project. Ther heroine has however gone against his wish and given the movie her nod. She did manage to impress her fans with the first look, however we will only know once the film releases if she manages to prove her guy wrong and win the audience. Clearly there was some minor tiff between the two love birds due to this one professional decision. \nWhile many suggested that their personal life is affected due to their professional outing, the duo has been going pretty strong according to insiders. Sometime back buzz was that the actress’ parents did not approve of her affair with this hero. The family wants the actress to chose better and settle down, but the actress has rubbished all these speculations and says all’s well between her parents and her. \nHave you guess ed the star s?
