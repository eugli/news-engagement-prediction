(Photo: Frank Maddocks)\nDeftones and Rise Against are joining forces on a very heavy co-headlining summer tour that hits Ak-Chin Pavilion on Sunday, July 9. with Thrice and Frank Iero and the Patience.\nTickets are $30-$69.50, going on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 10, at ticketmaster.com and livenation.com.\nRise Against issued a statement about how thrilled they are to do this tour. “Every once in a while you get to share the stage with a band so powerful they make you work harder,” it reads. “After conspiring for years, we're excited to finally share the road with such an epic band. We can't wait to put Deftones and Rise Against fans under the same roof in 2017.”\nSeventeen years down the road from unleashing “White Pony,” the nu-metal answer to “OK Computer,” Deftones haven’t lost their knack for bringing the aggression with ambition and a sense of drama (which doesn’t rule out the occasional bloodcurdling shriek). They’re touring in support of \"Gore,\" their first release since “Koi No Yokan” hit the streets in 2012, to which the Los Angeles Times responded, “Hard rock thrives on conflict and chaos, and no band has found more beauty and soaring aggression within those ingredients than Deftones.” Their best-known songs include \"Change (In the House of Flies),\" \"Minerva,\" \"Hole in the Earth,\" \"Diamond Eyes\" and \"Tempest.\"\nLed by guitarist Tim McIlrath, Rise Against bring a string of alternative-radio hits to the table, including “Prayer of the Refugee,” “Re-Education (Through Labor),” “Savior,” “Help Is on the Way” and “I Don’t Want to Be Here Anymore.” “A magnificent wakeup call” is how Kerrang! described their latest album, 2014’s “The Black Market,” a cathartic blend of political activism and existential exorcising. Alternative Press responded to the album with a four-star rave that noted, “Whatever meaning you take from them [the songs]…one thing remains solid—the sheer heart with which they were forged and the very visceral emotion they contain.”\n8/19: Sam Hunt (Photo: Scott Gries/Invision/AP)\nSam Hunt is bringing his 15 in a 30 Tour to Ak-Chin Pavilion with special guests Chris Janson, Maren Morris and Ryan Follese on Saturday, Aug. 19.\nTickets are $51.50-$66.50, going on sale at 10 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 10, at livenation.com and ticketmaster.com .\nA former college football quarterback, Hunt has written hits for Kenny Chesney (the country chart-topper \"Come Over\"), Keith Urban (\"Cop Car\") and Billy Currington (\"We Are Tonight\"). His debut album, \"Montevallo,\" topped the country charts and remains the biggest-selling debut album for a country artist since 2011. It helps that it was packed with massive hits – the multi-platinum chart-toppers \"Leave the Night On,\" \"Take Your Time” and “House Party,” the double-platinum “Break Up in a Small Town” and the platinum “Make You Miss Me.”\nHunt explained the name of this year's tour, which is also a line in his new single, \"Body Like a Back Road,\" to Nash Country Daily. “Most of our camp,\" Hunt says, \"and from what I know about the other camps, everybody is kind of laid back, and I think the title of the tour, 15 in a 30, will reflect that,” Hunt explains. “It will still be high energy and a good time.”\n6/30: Santana (Photo: Sony BMG)\nGuitar legend Carlos Santana and the band that bears his name will bring the Transmogrify Tour Ak-Chin Pavilion on Friday, June 30, promising fan favorites from Woodstock to \"Supernatural\" and beyond.\nTickets are $25.50-$150.50, going on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 10, at ticketmaster.com and livenation.com .\nSantana's hits include \"Evil Ways,\" \"Black Magic Woman,\" \"Smooth\" and \"Maria, Maria,\" the last two from the Grammy-sweeping '90s comeback album, \"Supernatural.\" With with the 2014 release of “Corazón,” Santana became one of only two musical artists to land an album in the Top 10 for six consecutive decades.\nLast year’s “Santana IV” debuted at No. 5, their 14th Top 10 album. Santana are currently headlining a multi-year residency at House of Blues at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. In the fall of 2014, the guitarist released a memoir called “The Universal Tone: Bringing My Story to Light.”\n5/24: John Legend John Legend is bringing the Darkness and Light tour with Gallant to Comerica Theatre on Wednesday, May 24.\nThe multi-platinum singer-songwriter has won 10 Grammys in addition to an Oscar and a Golden Globe award. The tour is named for Legend’s fifth studio album, which was meat with much acclaim. USA TODAY hailed it as Legend’s “most personal record,” Time Magazine called it “unflappably classy” and the New York Times said Legend “treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match.”\nThe R&B sensation topped the Billboard Hot 100 with his biggest-selling, highest-charting hit to date, the eight-times-platinum \"All of Me.\" His other hits include the breakthrough single, \"Ordinary People,\" \"Green Light,\" which featured a guest rap from Andre 3000, and last year’s “Love Me Now.”\nLegend also appears as a jazz band leader “La La Land,” which won six Golden Globe Awards and is up for 14 Oscars.\nTickets are $53.50-$129, on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 10.

The only foreign act to sell more albums in the States between the years 2000 and 2009 was the Beatles.\nTheir hits include the chart-topping \"How You Remind Me,\" \"Someday,\" \"Photograph,\" \"Far Away,\" \"Rockstar\" and \"Gotta Be Somebody,\" all of which went Top 10 on the Hot 100. Billboard ranked “How You Remind Me” as the biggest-selling rock song of the decade.\nThey’re currently in the studio putting the finishing touches on their ninth album, “Feed The Machine,” set for release on Friday, June 9.\n8/15: Deep Purple and Alice Cooper Deep Purple and Alice Cooper poster. (Photo: Live Nation)\nDeep Purple’s Long Goodbye Tour is headed to Phoenix with the legendary Alice Cooper and special guests the Edgar Winter Band on Tuesday, Aug. 15.\nTickets are $33-$97.50 at LiveNation.com , ticketmaster.com and on the Live Nation app.\nDeep Purple’s new studio album, “Infinite,” is set for release on April 7. Produced by the legendary Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, Cooper, Kiss), “Infinite” features 10 tracks they say were recorded “in the spirit of the ’70s.” Finally inducted just last year to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after decades of snubs, the metal pioneers have released five studio albums since 1996, augmented by an abundance of solo work and special projects from members Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Steve Morse and Don Airey. But they plan to cover decades of fan favorites for this run.\nAt his controversial, taboo-tweaking peak, Alice Cooper kept the generation gap alive while the punks were still getting their chaos together (taking half their cues from Cooper). Here’s a guy who staged his own beheadings, hung from the gallows and otherwise pushed the theatrical envelope to shocking new extremes. If time has made the memory of those onstage executions seems a little silly, the extent to which his gallows humor terrified the parents of the early ’70s cannot be overstated. Without him, it’s hard to imagine a Slipknot, a Marilyn Manson or a Lady Gaga, much less a Kiss. And the records were brilliant, as adventurous as any music of the era without skimping on the hooks. Even Bob Dylan has called him an overlooked songwriter, while Johnny Rotten swears by “Killer” as “the best rock album ever made” (which isn’t half as far-off the unfamiliar would assume).\nCooper brings a catalog of hits and anthems to the table, from “I’m Eighteen” and “No More Mr Nice Guy” to “School’s Out” and “Elected.” Cooper’s touring band features the three-guitar attack of Nita Strauss, Tommy Henriksen and Ryan Roxie, backed by longtime bassist Chuck Garric and drummer Glen Sobel.\nEdgar Winter has been celebrated across the globe since his 1970 solo debut, “Entrance.” With more than 20 albums, top hits “Frankenstein” and “Free Ride,” and numerous collaborative efforts to his credit, Winter continues to thrill audiences with his live performances.\n5/9: The Chainsmokers The Chainsmokers will bring the 40-city Memories: Do Not Open Tour to Gila River Arena in Glendale on Tuesday, May 9.\nTickets are $21.25-$77.25 at ticketmaster.com .\nThe Grammy-nominated duo also announced that they will be releasing an actual album, having left it to their fans to decide whether or not they should.

There will also be an exclusive pre-sale for Iron Maiden Fan Club members, details of which can also be found on www.ironmaiden.com along with information on how Fan Club members can participate in the draw to be “First To The Barrier”.\nThe tour’s opening night in Fort Lauderdale was hailed in the Sun-Sentinel as “…a full-throttle, devil-may-care performance that thrilled a sold-out BB&T Center” while Revolver raved about how Iron Maiden’s legendary mascot Eddie dominated the Maya-themed stage: “From a walking zombie towering over band members during the set, to being featured on a host of back-drops and huge blow-up figures – the quintessential symbol was omnipresent for the entire show.” There’s even a point in the show where Eddie has his heart ripped out and hurled into the crowd by lead singer Bruce Dickinson.\nFounded in 1975, Iron Maiden emerged at the helm of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, going platinum in the States with four consecutive releases in the their '80s prime -- \"The Number of the Beast,\" \"Piece of Mind,\" \"Powerslave\" and \"Somewhere in Time.\" They've also had four Top 10 singles on the U.S. rock charts -- \"Flight of Icarus,\" \"Can I Play with Madness,\" \"Different World\" and the chart-topping \"Wasted Years.\"\n“The Book Of Souls” is Maiden’s first double studio album and their highest-charting effort, with a No. 1 debut in more than 40 countries.\nAZCENTRAL\nJust announced: 2017 Country Megaticket lineup at Ak-Chin Pavilion in Phoenix\n7/18: Third Eye Blind (Photo: Third Eye Blind)\nIt’s the 20th anniversary of Third Eye Blind, and they intend to celebrate by playing their debut in its entirety (which they’ve never done before now) on the modestly billed Summer Gods Tour.\nThe tour makes its way to Comerica Theatre in Phoenix on Tuesday, July 18, with special guests Silversun Pickups.\nTickets $49.95-$60 at livenation.com and ticketmaster.com .\nThird Eye Blind blew up in 1997 with a six-times-platinum self-titled debut that spawned three massive pop hits — \"Semi-Charmed Life,\" \"How's It Going To Be\" and \"Jumper.\"\nIn addition to blowing the dust off that album, they’re planning on featuring songs from “We Are Drugs,” an EP they released last year. In addition to hitting the festival circuit (Outside Lands, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Leeds and Redding), they made headlines last year with Stephan Jenkins’ hold-nothing-back opinion pieces and trolling of the RNC.\nWith regard to this tour, Jenkins says, “We are all about fostering a feeling of aliveness and connection. That’s why we have the Summer vibes, because our heat comes from being alive and in the moment and you can only get it when you are willing to keep it real. No one can create the vibes we do fronting over a backing track.”\n4/3-4: Social Distortion Social Distortion will return to Tempe’s Marquee Theatre for what’s sure to be a raucous two-night stand on Monday, April 3, and Tuesday, April 4.\nTickets start at $40, plus fees, at luckymanonline.com and 480-829-0607.\nMike Ness formed and fronted the earliest version of Social Distortion in 1978, keeping the name at least somewhat alive through a number of lineup changes, breakups and the death in February 2000 of Dennis Danell, the only other holdout from the “Mommy’s Little Monster” days. But as they proved conclusively on 2011’s “Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes,” their first album since 2004, they still sound like Social Distortion, filtering California punk through old-school rock and roll, the New York Dolls and Johnny Cash. In 2015, they celebrated the 25th anniversary of their self-titled breakthrough by playing the album in its entirety on a tour that also played the Marquee.\n9/3: Idina Menzel Idina Menzel on the cover on \"idina.\" (Photo: Warner Bros.)\nTony-winning actress and chart-rocking singer Idina Menzel will bring her concert tour to Comerica Theatre in Phoenix on Sunday, Sept. 3.\nTickets are $126.50 at livenation.com , the Comerica box office and Ticketmaster.

She earned another Tony nomination for her role in the musical “If/Then\" and turned in a well-received nation anthem when the Super Bowl played Glendale.\n4/21: Mastodon (Photo: Provided by the artist)\nThe Mastodon tour is set to blow the roof off Comerica Theatre with Eagles of Death Metal and Russian Circles on Friday, April 21.\nIt's not for nothing that an article in Rolling Stone once hailed the men of Mastodon as \"America's new kings of metal.\" That was 2009, the year they hit the streets with \"Crack the Skye,\" a towering accomplishment that somehow lived up to the promise of 2004's \"Leviathan,\" a concept album loosely based on Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick.\" As they were touring \"Crack the Skye,\" the website MetalSucks declared \"Leviathan\" the century's best metal album. Meanwhile, \"Crack the Skye\" topped year-end lists at Metal Hammer and Rock Sounds. The love affair continued two years later when \"The Hunter\" finished No. 1 on year-end lists at Metal Hammer, Rock Sounds, Classic Rock and Kerrang! And 2014’s \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" just added to that legacy.\nA new release is on the way, and every pair of tickets purchased online includes your choice of a physical or digital copy of that concept album.\nTickets are $38.50 at ticketmaster.com and livenation.com .\nThe rockers have issued a statement saying, “We couldn't be more excited to pour majestic rock sauce all over your town. Come on down and help us celebrate the season of new beginnings where fresh buds bloom, animals awaken, the earth comes to life and there's a new Mastodon album to melt your face off! See you there!”\nLed by one of modern rock’s most entertaining front men, Jesse Hughes, Eagles of Death Metal are unfortunately best known in the mainstream for having been the band performing when terrorists attacked La Bataclan in Paris, killing 89.\nTheir best-known song remains the modern-rock hit “Wannabe in L.A.”\nTheir latest album, “Zipper Down,” earned raves from the Line of Best Fit and Kerrang!, whose critic noted, “Jesse Hughes and Queens of the Stone Age main man Josh Homme's capacity for throwing out sexy grooves has only improved with age.”\n3/26: The Adrian Belew Power Trio The Adrian Belew Power Trio will play Crescent Ballroom on Sunday, March 26, with an opening set by Saul Zonana.\nTickets are $25-$49 at www.dannyzeliskopresents.com and the venue.\nBelew is a legendary guitarist who may be best remembered for his long stint as front man and second guitarist for King Crimson, signing on in time to play on “Discipline,” a New Wave-flavored 1981 release that Pitchfork ranked among the Top 100 albums of the 1980s.\nHe first made a name for himself in the ’70s, touring with the great Frank Zappa, playing on the “Shiek Yerbouti” album and appearing in a Zappa concert film called “Baby Snakes,” Zappa later crediting Belew with having “reinvented electric guitar.” He then moved on to touring and recording with the late great David Bowie, playing on the live “Stage” album and “Lodger” in the ’70s and returning for the Sound + Vision Tour in 1990.\nHe’s also played with Talking Heads (\"Remain in Light\"), the Tom Tom Club, Paul Simon, Laurie Anderson and Nine Inch Nails, in addition to front his own bands on a series of acclaimed releases.\n8/24: Foreigner and Cheap Trick Foreigner (Photo: Bill Bernstein)\nThe Foreigner 40th anniversary tour will play Ak-Chin Pavilion on Thursday, Aug. 24, with Cheap Trick, who are also celebrating the 40th anniversary of their own self-titled debut.\nTickets are $29.95-$99.95, at livenation.com and ticketmaster.com .\n“I never could have imagined when I set out to create Foreigner 40 years ago, that we’d still be touring around the world and performing the music we love all these years later,” says lead guitarist Mick Jones. “I can’t express the gratitude I feel when fans share stories of how our songs have been woven into their milestones and memories over the years.\"\nThis year also brings an anniversary album titled “40 – Forty Hits From Forty Years” on Rhino. The album is a comprehensive compilation of original hits and several tracks from the current lineup with Kelly Hansen on vocals including “Cant Slow Down,” “Too Late,” and the Top 20 AC hit “When It Comes To Love.” The album also features two new songs, “The Flame Still Burns,” and “Give My Life For Love,” a brand new song by Jones.\nMeanwhile, Rhino is kicking off a year-long catalog promotion with the Jan. 24 picture-disc release of “Head Games.”\nForeigner’s hits include “Feels Like the First Time,” “Cold As Ice,” “Hot Blooded,” “Double Vision,” “Urgent,” “Waiting for a Girl Like You,” “I Want to Know What Love Is,” “Say You Will” and “I Don’t Want to Live Without You.”\n“At Budokan” was Cheap Trick’s moment in the rising sun — Midwestern rockers captured live invading Tokyo, where the Japanese girls were responding to power-pop gems as infectious as “Surrender,” “I Want You to Want Me” and “Clock Strikes Ten” with the kind of enthusiasm Americans wouldn’t show until that album brought the mania back home.\nBut there always was more to Cheap Trick’s story than “At Budokan” — from the power-pop classics that drove all those Japanese girls to go wild in the first place through the more ambitious chamber-pop of “Dream Police” to such oft-forgotten ’80s gems as “Everything Works if You Let It” and “If You Want My Love.” And when they decided to capture the spirit of that first self-titled classic, right down to the black-and-white cover, on 1997’s “Cheap Trick,” they came away with one of that year’s more infectious rock releases.\nCheap Trick took their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year while releasing their 17th studio album, “Bang Zoom Crazy … Hello.”\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Phoenix local music news | Concerts this week | January concert guide | January local music picks\n4/10: A Perfect Circle return A Perfect Circle (Photo: Tim Cadiente)\nMaynard James Keenan of Tool and Puscifer is set to bring A Perfect Circle back to Phoenix for a Comerica Theatre date on Monday, April 10.\nJoining Keenan on the group's first tour in six years will be Billy Howerdel (Ashes Divide), James Iha (Tinted Windows, Smashing Pumpkins), Jeff Friedl (Puscifer, the Beta Machine) and Matt McJunkins (Eagles of Death Metal, the Beta Machine).\nFormed in 1999, A Perfect Circle released three albums -- \"Mer de Noms,\" \"Thirteenth Step\" and an album of covers called \"Emotive\" -- before going on hiatus in 2005. Reuniting in 2010, they did a memorable three-night stand at Tempe's Marquee Theatre, devoting each night to performing one of their three albums front to back. That tour's stop at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was captured on an album called \"A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo.\"\nThe tour news arrives as the members of A Perfect Circle start work on their first new studio release since 2004’s eMOTIVe. “Getting back to writing music with A Perfect Circle is a great way to start the new year,” APC co-founder and guitar player Billy Howerdel says.\nTickets are $45-$69.50 at livenation.com , ticketmaster.com and the box office.

Produced by Jamie Smith and Rodaidh McDonald, \"I See You\" is reportedly \"the xx at their boldest yet, performing with more clarity and ambition than ever before.\"\n3/25: Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers spent 2016 celebrating the 20th anniversary of “Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy” and they're sure to revisit a number of that album's highlights when they play the Pool at Talking Stick Resort on Saturday, March 25. But this year is more about getting the fans some new material in the form of the Peacemakers' first album since \"The Independent\" hit the streets in 2014.\nWhen we spoke to Clyne before his New Year's Eve show, he said, \"We’ve begun our sort of preliminary discussions with a really cool producer – a cat who’s in Los Lobos, Steve Berlin. He’s overseeing our direction right now in terms of production. I love his work. I love his ethos. He came to a couple of shows of ours in Portland, came backstage, hung on the bus and said, ‘Look I only work with what I like and I really like what you’re doing. I want to do your record.”\nThe goal is to record at Wavelab Studio in Tucson.\n“So we’re hoping that our touring schedule, the studio’s availability and his touring schedule allow us to get in there in February and March,” Clyne says, “which means as soon as we’re done with these ’76 songs, we’re gonna start doing pre-production in early January here at home. It’s a pretty ambitious schedule, but we’re hopeful.”\nTickets to the concert at the Pool at Talking Stick Resort are $30-$100 at ticketmaster.com .\nCoachella 2017 Beyonce (Photo: Getty Images)\nRadiohead, Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar will top the bill at this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, taking place on the weekends of April 14-16 and April 21-23 at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, Calif.\nRadiohead tops Friday’s bill, which also features sets by the xx, Travis Scott, Father John Misty, Empire of the Sun, Dillon Francis, Mac Miller, Steve Angello, Glass Animals, Phantogram, Mac DeMarco, Little Dragon, Banks, Bonobo, Richie Hawtin, DJ Shadow, Loco Dice, Dixon, Capital Cities, Big Gigantic, Crystal Castles, Guided By Voices and more.\nBeyonce tops Saturday’s bill, which also brings Bon Iver, Future, DJ Snake, Martin Garrix, Schoolboy Q, Gucci Mane, the Head and the Heart, Two Door Cinema Club, Nicolas Jaar, Bastille, Tycho, Tory Lanez, Royksopp, Local Natives, Majid Jordan, Dreamcar, Four Tet, Roisin Murphy, Moderat, the Avalanches, Mura Masa, Car Seat Headrest and more.\npic.twitter.com/wXYbibjyiP\n— Coachella (@coachella) January 3, 2017 Kendrick Lamar headlines Sunday, which also features, Lorde, Justice, New Order, Porter Robinson, Madeon, Future Islands, Hans Zimmer, DJ Khaled, Marshmello, Lil Uzi Vert, Galantis, Kehlani, Grouplove, Kaytranada, Tale of Us, Toots and the Maytals, Devendra Banhart, Tove Lo, Jai Wolf, Jack Garratt, Sasha, Real Estate and more.\nFestival passes for both weekends go on sale at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Jan. 4, at coachella.com .

Its seventh season features Lynyrd Skynyrd on Saturday, March 4, and Kenny Loggins with Michael McDonald on Saturday, April 8.\nTickets, on sale now at thegoodlifefest.com , are $40-$80 for Skynyrd; $40-$70 for Loggins and McDonald.\nFrom the time they hit the streets with “(pronounced ‘leh-’nérd ‘skin-’nérd),” it was clear that the Florida longhairs who'd chosen the name Lynyrd Skynyrd in mock tribute of a phys-ed teacher were serving a scrappier brand of Southern rock than the Allman Brothers Band — which is weird, because they also did more ballads. Or rockers that start as ballads, in the case of “Free Bird,” their most famous song. A 1977 plane crash claimed the lives of several members, including lead singer and songwriter Ronnie Van Zant, but Skynyrd reformed in 1987 with Van Zant’s little brother Johnny on lead vocals.\nLoggins may be best remembered for his work with Jim Messina and the soundtrack smashes \"Footloose,\" \"I'm Alright\" (from \"Caddyshack\") and \"Danger Zone\" (from \"Top Gun\"). Other hits include a Stevie Nicks duet called \"Whenever I Call You Friend\" and \"This is It.\"\nOver the course of four classic Steely Dan albums, from \"Katy Lied\" to \"Gaucho,\" McDonald became an integral part of their sound, singing background vocals on such FM staples as “Black Friday” and “Peg.” In the mid-‘70s, McDonald joined the Doobie Brothers, helping redefine their funky R&B sound as a singer, keyboardist and songwriter on such Top 40 singles as “Takin’ It To The Streets,” “It Keeps You Runnin’,” “Minute By Minute” and “What A Fool Believes.” The five-time Grammy winner's solo hits include \"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near),\" \"Sweet Freedom,\" \"Yah Mo Be There\" (with James Ingram) and the chart-topping Patti LaBelle duet \"On My Own.\"\n6/11: Chicago and the Doobie Brothers (Photo: David Kadlubowski/The Republic)\nHaving taking their place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, the members of Chicago are hitting the road with another veteran act that ruled the airwaves in the ‘70s – the Doobie Brothers.\nChicago hit the mainstream in the '70s with a string of huge radio staples, including Top 5 singles \"25 or 6 to 4,\" \"Saturday in the Park,\" \"Just You 'n' Me,\" \"Old Days,\" \"If You Leave Me Now\" and \"Baby, What a Big Surprise.\" And the hits kept coming through the '80s, with their first chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry,\" \"Hard Habit to Break,\" \"You're the Inspiration,\" \"Will You Still Love Me,\" \"I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love,\" the chart-topping \"Look Away\" and \"What Kind of Man Would I Be?\"\nThey had 21 Top 10 appearance on the Hot 100 and five consecutive No. 1 albums along the way to becoming the first American rock band to chart Top 40 albums in six decades. Their double-platinum debut, \"Chicago Transit Authority,\" was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014, the same year they made their first appearance as Grammy performers. No fewer than 25 of their 36 albums have gone platinum.\nThe Doobie Brothers' hits include two very different songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 in their prime -- the bluegrass-flavored smash \"Black Water\" in 1975 and the blue-eyed soul of \"What a Fool Believes,\" with Michael McDonald on vocals, in 1979. Other hits include \"Listen to the Music\" and \"Long Train Runnin'.\"\nThe Doobies’ latest album, “Southbound,” features new recordings of their biggest hits with country music’s biggest stars, from Blake Shelton to Zac Brown Band, Brad Paisley and Toby Keith. Beginning with their multi-million-selling sophomore collection Toulouse Street (1972), the Doobies have 3 multi-platinum, 7 platinum and 14 gold albums. Their “Best of the Doobies” collection has sold more than 12 million copies.\nTickets are $25-$125 at www.livenation.com and ticketmaster.com .\n6/10: Julianne and Derek Hough Julianne and Derek Hough.
