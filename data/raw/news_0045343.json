If the plane hit the freeway, it could have been a lot worse. \n\"[It was] probably one of the luckiest days of our lives. For the rest of my life I'll never forget that.\" \nHe said the explosion was only about 20 metres away from the car. \n\"It was a bit surreal, almost like a movie,\" he said. \n\"We actually drove on for about another 200 metres, then we did some deep breathing when we realised we'd sort of come within just a few seconds of it.\" \nThe airport is close to the freeway, one of Melbourne's biggest roads, and borders bustling, everyday suburbs in the city's north-west. \nMichael Howard, 29, was working on a construction site nearby when he saw the crash. \n\"I just saw a blue flash come down past the DFO billboard over there, and then all of a sudden it hit Spotlight and just sort of erupted,\" he said. \n\"It was crazy. I was talking to one of the boys and we were looking out towards that way and all of a sudden I see a flash and then a massive fireball.\" \nTodd Own was standing on a balcony nearby, and said he heard multiple explosions. \n\"There was explosions going off one after the other, so obviously after it hit it blew up and there was cars going off as well,\" he said. \n\"It was pretty intense. We didn't really know what to do. We were all standing on the balcony a bit in shock. \n\"A lot of smoke, a lot of flames.\" Photo: Michael Howard saw the incident unfold while working at a building site. (ABC News: Jane Cowan) 'It definitely wasn't a good sight' \nLocal resident Mickey Cahill told ABC News 24 the aircraft was flying precariously close to houses before the incident, which happened under cloudless skies in seemingly good conditions. \n\"The smoke has cleared now but initially it was really kind of dark-as-midnight smoke rising up,\" he said. \n\"It looked really ominous.\" Photo: John Kelm [L] said planes from Essendon Airport fly over his house all the time. (ABC News: Jane Cowan) \nTalkback caller Michael told ABC Radio Melbourne he was driving on the freeway when he saw the crash happen. \n\"I was merging onto the Calder Freeway from the Tullamarine Freeway and I saw the plane come down over the airport and the impact into the buildings,\" he said. \n\"I saw the plane swoop down and it sort of went over the shopping centre and then there was a big explosion and a black plume of smoke that came out. \n\"It definitely wasn't a good sight.\" \nJohn Kelm saw the aftermath from Alf Pearce Reserve in Strathmore, which backs onto one side of the shopping centre. \n\"It's a little bit scary because it's so close to home. Their flight path comes right over my house,\" he said.​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:04:10.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
