A man living in Saudi Arabia on visit visa asked the imam to issue a fatwa that would allow him to marry his wife to a friend. He said he wanted to do this in order to bring his wife to Saudi Arabia after all other measures had failed. According to Al Arabiya , the man's friend has a resident status in Saudi Arabia which could ease getting a visa for his wife. The request was made by a Syrian national living in Saudi Arabia. He said he would later divorce his wife from his friend. The imam, however, refused to issue the fatwa, warning him of the dangerous consequences of playing such tricks. He added that such a step shall affect his relations with both his wife and friend.
