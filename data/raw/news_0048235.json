As fathers, when any of our sons is in danger we get worried. We are worried (that) he may be set up for attack or assassination,” said Mr. Jaja who is also the Amanyanabo of Opobo Kingdom. \nMr. Jaja told the acting president, “We have no doubt that as a man of God you do uphold the sanctity of life. \n“It is on this basis that we request that you assist us by bringing pressure to bear on the inspector general of police to restore the governor’s security aides to their former position. \n“Under his watch, this state has protected the federal government infrastructure. No case of pipeline vandalisation has been reported in recent years. \n“We believe that having done so well as a governor, he should not be subjected to such torture. Rather, he should be encouraged to do more.” \nWhen it was the turn of Mr. Wike to address the meeting, the governor said he was in support of “all their presentations”. \nThe governor said that the Rivers government was not in contention against the federal government. \nHe enumerated what he said were his administration’s contributions to the federal government, including providing support for the security agencies in the state, the prevention of militant attacks on oil pipelines and the repairs of a section of the East-West Road. \nHe, however, added that the federal government in return wasn’t giving the state a fair treatment. \nMr. Wike said the Port Harcourt International Airport, owned by the federal government, for instance, was a disgrace to the state and the nation, and that most of the federal roads in the states were in dilapidated condition. \nThe governor accused the federal government of not allowing the seventh train of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas, NLNG, project in the state to kick off, as well as doing “political stunts” with the Ogoni clean-up campaign which the federal government flagged off last year. \nThe acting president, Mr. Osinbajo in his response, said Rivers State was important to the country’s economy, and that the federal government was beginning a “new partnership” with the state and the entire Niger Delta region. \n“I am assuring you that this will be the beginning of the narrative that will change the Niger Delta,” Mr. Osinbajo said. \nThe acting president didn’t, however, respond to the issue of Governor Wike’s security details, apart from jokingly asking that the women extend their security protection to him (Mr. Osinbajo) as well. \nWhen PREMIUM TIMES contacted the Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood, he denied that the police had withdrawn Mr. Wike’s security details. \nMr. Moshood said the police officers that were withdrawn from the governor’s security were those “found wanting” during the last legislative re-run election, and that they were dismissed from the police after an administrative trial. \nThe dismissed police officers were awaiting prosecution, he said.
