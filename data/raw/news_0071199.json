When they were successful, a trapdoor in the ball would open, releasing a delicious sugar solution as their reward. To learn the technique, the bees were trained under one of three conditions. Some observed a previously trained bee move the furthest ball to the centre to gain reward, others received a ‘ghost’ demonstration, using a magnet to move the ball, and a third group received no demonstration, where they found the ball already at the centre of the platform with a reward. The bees that observed the technique from a live bee or a plastic one, were more efficient, showing bees can be trained. It builds on previous studies showing they can pull levers and strings to access food, but the new study shows for the first time they can perform behaviour not linked to their natural foraging habits which they normally do not need.

Joint lead author Dr Olli Loukola, from the university’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: ‘This shows an impressive amount of cognitive flexibility, especially for an insect.’ He added: ‘It may be that bumblebees, along with many other animals, have the cognitive capabilities to solve such complex tasks, but will only do so if environmental pressures are applied to necessitate such behaviours.’ Share or comment on this article 20", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:05:01.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
