Read More \"China might not interpret it (the Sunday test) as a provocation, but a call for attention,\" Zhao told CNN. \"Clearly North Korea has been waiting for this new administration to reach out to North Korea.\" That view likely will influence the way China responds to the Sunday launch -- the first since US President Donald Trump's inauguration. \"Fundamentally, from the Chinese perspective, we need to create a situation where the nuclear weapons will be removed from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and from the Korean peninsula,\" said Victor Gao, a Chinese international relations expert and former translator to late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. \"But on the other hand, the fundamental concerns of the government of the DPRK about its own survival should also be well taken care of.\" Gao's last point -- that the concerns about the survival of Kim Jong Un's regime should be respected -- is perhaps the most important difference in the way China and the United States deal with the looming threat of a nuclear North Korea. Kim might not be China's favorite neighbor, but analysts say it's a case of the devil you know versus the devil you don't. \"They're worried about a much more strategic issue, which is if South Korea is the successor state, if US troops are up on the Chinese border, it's a terrible defeat for China and victory for the US,\" said former US Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill. \"I know the Chinese worry that somehow the US will take strategic advantage of it.\" The isolation option China and the US are divided on what to do over North Korea. Both countries are in favor of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, but Trump has said publicly that China isn't doing enough to deter Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.
