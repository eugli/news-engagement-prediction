Mr Justice Cobb (Photo: Photoshot) \nMr Justice Cobb said the couple were in fact \"unaware\" of the hearing and were \"understandably very upset\" when they were told about it. \nA spate of further hearings followed and the baby was finally sent home to his parents about three months after his removal. \nIn the year since then, the judge said the boy had \"continued to thrive in his parents care\". \nHe added: \"There is no doubt in my mind, indeed it is admitted, that Kirklees Council breached the human rights of a baby boy and his parents. \n\"I am satisfied that the breaches were serious...the separation of a baby from his parents represents a very serious interference with family life.\" Read More Mum left cradling baby in her arms after being knocked over by driver who was looking at \"some s**t on Instagram\" \nThe failure to notify the parents of the care hearing was \"particularly egregious\" and involved \"misleading the judge no fewer than three times\". \nAwarding the mother, the father and the little boy £3,750 damages each, the judge said that was \"just and fair satisfaction\" for the wrongs done to them. \nMr Justice Cobb also ordered the council to pay a substantial portion of the £120,000 in legal costs run up in the case.
