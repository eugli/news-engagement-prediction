Image: Shutterstock / BZ.zzz \nAfter claiming that he was \"fundamentally opposed\" to pineapple as a pizza topping, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson went as far to say that he would ban it, if he were allowed. \nHis controversial opinion spread like wildfire on social media, with everybody weighing in on the foodie debate. \nEventually, Guðni was forced to clarify his position, saying he liked pineapple, just not on pizzas. \n\"I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza. I am glad that I do not hold such power,\" he said on a Facebook statement . \"I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don't like. I would not want to live in such a country.\" \nThen, he made a personal suggestion: \n\"For pizzas, I recommend seafood,\" he said. \nHowever, as noticed by Iceland Magazine , Guðni used the word \"fiskmeti\" in the Icelandic version of his post, which translates as fish-products, rather then seafood.
