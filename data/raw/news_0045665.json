This video was taken last Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017, when winds at the top of the mountain at Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows hit 90 mph. Today, Feb. 18, 2017, the Sierra ski resort reports cloudy, some snow falling and only light winds. The resort also predicts skiing lasting into June, perhaps even the Fourth of July. Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows i \nBy Mary Lynne Vellinga \nHigh winds are expected to hit the Sacramento area Monday night, the National Weather Service warns. \nThe weather service said strong wind gusts will continue for several days, likely downing trees and knocking out power for extended periods. \nMany large trees in the Sacramento area already have come tumbling down this winter. In January, the City of Sacramento responded to more than 600 tree-related calls, including reports of 182 downed trees that were either on city property or had fallen into the public right of way. \nExperts say saturated soil and the shallow root systems of trees dependent on sprinklers are to blame, along with the drought, which weakened treesâ€™ roots and branches.
