If you’ve read the books, then you know more or less what’s going to happen in Fifty Shades Darker , but if you didn’t, then you’ve spent the better part of two years wondering what the hell was up with those scars on Christian’s chest. And even if you did read the books, you still don’t know for sure whether or not Christian’s infamous fuck jeans will make an appearance. Below, 10 questions that Fifty Shades Darker must answer if it doesn’t want to make a trip to the Red Room that ends with it not being able to sit down for a week.\n 1. Do Christian and Ana get back together? This might seem obvious given that the two of them are back together in the trailers, attending masquerade balls and having extremely unrealistic shower sex , but who knows what could happen during the movie’s two-hour run time? They could get back together for a little while, then break up again, on and on forever. Remember too that there’s still a third movie to come, so the likelihood that Darker ties everything up nicely (with cable ties) seems small.\n2. Does Ana ever sign the contract? Probably not, since Christian stopped caring about it the minute they had sex for the first time, but I wouldn’t hate it if he drafted up a revised edition featuring things like “piano sex” and “one date night in public per week.”\n3. What’s up with all those scars on Christian’s chest? You definitely know the answer to this if you read the book, but if you didn’t, Christian’s dark past is still somewhat of a mystery. He touched on it in one scene in the first movie, but other than the fact that his birth mother was a crack addict, there’s a lot we still don’t know. As my non-book-reading friend asked upon her first viewing, “Is he, like, into hooks or something?” Stay tuned!\n4. Why doesn’t Christian ever let Ana touch him? This is somewhat related to question no. 3, but it’s a big enough deal that it deserves its own entry. The terms of the contract are clearly irrelevant at this point, so why is this the rule that Christian refuses to let Ana break? (Seriously, do not tweet me that I would know this if I read the book, because I did read the books, and I’m afraid they’re not going to solve this mystery for movie viewers until Freed . I’m just looking out for you, OK?)\n5. Will Rita Ora get more lines? Mia Grey needs something to do, and something to say while she’s doing it. By \"it,\" I mean José, because that guy could really use some love.\n6. What’s happening with Kate and Elliot’s relationship? Speaking from experience, I can definitively say that most women do not like it when their BFF sleeps with their boyfriend’s best friend (or in this case, brother, but whatever, Christian doesn’t have any friends). If Anastasia were a normal woman, she’d be drunk-dialing Kate from Coachella and screaming at her to leave Elliot’s apartment right this fucking second or she’ll never speak to her again. All of which is to say, they better get engaged immediately.\n 7. How’s the hardware store doing? Aren’t you the least bit curious about what happened to Clayton’s after Ana graduated? No? Just me? Fine, you can cut your own goddamn rope.\n8. Will they do butt stuff? This is an open question for readers and non-readers alike, because even if you think you know what happens in the books (and to be honest, I don’t remember and can’t look it up because my copy of the book is covered in raw chicken, which is a story for another time), there’s no guarantee that will make it to the screen. This is America, after all, where the children who sneak into R-rated movies must be protected from dangerous images like “full frontal penises” and “stuff going into butts.”\n9. Will Christian wear his fuck jeans again? Honestly, they could kill off everyone in this movie and I would not care, but if the fuck jeans don’t make it out alive, I will riot.\n10. Does Christian ever wash his fuck jeans? Well? Does he?\nFollow Eliza on Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid"], "published": "2017-02-07T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:08:15.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
