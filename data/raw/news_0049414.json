(Getty Images) \nDanny Welbeck has revealed that he will miss Arsenal’s FA Cup tie with Sutton United because the game is being played on a plastic pitch. \nThe 26-year-old has suffered two serious knee injuries in the past 20 months and only made his first-team return last month. \nWelbeck was a surprise inclusion for Arsenal Under-23s’ clash with Leicester City on Sunday afternoon and played 70 minutes as the Gunners fell to a 2-1 defeat. \nAnd after the match, the England international revealed that he will not be facing the non-league side due to their artificial surface. Glad to get 70 minutes today to build up my match fitness. Plastic pitch at Sutton isn't the best idea at the moment. #COYG \n— Danny Welbeck (@DannyWelbeck) February 19, 2017 \nWelbeck hasn’t started a game for Arsenal since he scored twice in the 5-0 win over Southampton in the last round of the FA Cup and was an unused substitute in the 5-1 loss to Bayern Munich on Wednesday evening. \nLast month, Arsene Wenger admitted he needed to be cautious over Welbeck’s injury. \n‘Danny’s very sharp but we’re still not out of it completely,’ said the Arsenal manager.
