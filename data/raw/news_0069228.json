Enlarge Image \nApril is expecting. The world awaits. Animal Adventure Park/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nSo this, children, is how animals have babies. \nNo! No! Don't show that! It's dirty! \nThis was the sequence of events on Wednesday night when the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York began to livestream what was scheduled to be a giraffe birth on YouTube . \nIt was supposed to be educational. It seems that someone -- or some machine -- at YouTube didn't agree. The livestream was taken down, before April the giraffe had given birth. \nThe park's Facebook page reported that the \"live giraffe cam\" saw as many as 30 million views in about 12 hours. This online popularity, however, may have brought with it opposing factions. \n\"There's a handful of extremists and animal rights activists that may not agree with us,\" he wrote, adding they had \"unfortunately reported our YouTube cam as a sexually or nude content.\" \nThe park didn't immediately respond to a request for information as to how it knows the complaints were made by extremists. YouTube, however, acknowledged it had taken the livestream down.
