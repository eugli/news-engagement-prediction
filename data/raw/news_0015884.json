In the caption, The Chainsmokers revealed they were so impressed by Tony Ann’s cover and another he has done in the past that they will be taking him along on their North American tour. A video posted by The Chainsmokers (@thechainsmokers) on Feb 6, 2017 at 3:35pm PST \n\nWhat makes this collaboration particularly exciting is that Tony Ann’s talent has thus far been under the radar publicly. He has about 8,000 YouTube subscribers and almost 2,000 Instagram followers. \nThe single he covered, “Paris,” had The Chainsmokers’ highest first-week entrance on the Billboard Hot 100 to date, hitting No. 7 at the end of January. The duo announced on Jan. 30 that they will be releasing a debut album this year via Columbia Records. \nTickets for the Memories Do Not Open Tour go on sale Feb. 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:24:51.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
