This year, the work will take place from M-53 to Garfield Road. Next year, the work on M-59 will stretch from Garfield to Romeo Plank. \nThe $60 million undertaking includes replacing all concrete with new asphalt, improving drainage, and fixing ramps and sidewalks. According to MDOT, the project will extend the life of the roadway and allow for better traffic flow along what they call the “Golden Corridor.” \nWork is planned to begin in March, although no exact date has yet been announced. \nThree lanes will be open in each direction between east of M-53 and Romeo Plank Road daily from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., except for the M-59 bridge over M-53, which will have only two lanes open in each direction from March through mid-summer 2017. Work will occur day and night. \nBusinesses will always have access, MDOT says, although entry may need to be adjusted during the project. Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout the project. \nFor updates and more details, visit www.MovingMacomb.org . \nTo check for backups on Hall Road and across metro Detroit, stay with WWJ Newsradio 950 during Traffic and Weather on the 8s, 24-hours a day.
