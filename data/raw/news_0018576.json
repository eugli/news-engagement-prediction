Elizabeth Warren ’s personal attacks on Jeff Sessions caused her to be silenced on the Senate floor. But she immediately took the attacks to Twitter on Wednesday night. \nIn a series of tweets, Mrs. Warren called the newly-confirmed attorney-general a bigot and a purveyor of “racial hatred,” rhetoric far stronger than her Democratic colleagues used overtly to justify voting against the Alabama Republican. \n“If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism & bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he’ll hear from all of us,” Mrs. Warren warned. \nShe then ramped up her attacks to threaten the 51 Republican senators who voted to confirm Mr. Sessions and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the only Democrat to do so. \n“And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too,” she vowed . \nMrs. Warren even made it explicit that she was saying things that she thought but had been constrained from saying on the Senate floor, where decorum rules bar personal attacks on other members. Mr. Sessions was still a sitting senator at the time of the debate and vote. \n“There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly & clearly: This is just the beginning,” she thundered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:41:42.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
