Enlarge Image \nTo the point. Audible/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nEveryone feared -- or, depending on their bent, hoped -- that there would be politics infused into the Oscars. \nOne unexpected moment was delivered by \"Star Trek\" actor Zachary Quinto. \nSpock was suddenly seen with a bushy beard and a reminder of the power of fear. \nIn an Oscars ad for the Audible audiobooks company , Quinto read a very short piece from George Orwell's \"1984.\" \n\"If he were allowed contact with foreigners, he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most that had been told about them is lies,\" read Quinto. \nNow why might this passage have been chosen? Perhaps as a commentary on the president's immigration order, one opposed by so many tech companies ? \n\"The sealed world in which he lives would be broken the fear, hatred and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate,\" continued Quinto.
