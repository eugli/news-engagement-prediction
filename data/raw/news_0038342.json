If approved Harvard law educated Alexander Acosta would also be the first Hispanic American in cabinet. \nHe was previously successfully vetted by the Bush administration for various roles so his confirmation should be a little easier than Mr Pudzer's. Where's Bernie? \nThrowing out some stern words to Mr Puzder on his way out: External Link: @BernieSanders:We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage & pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate. \nThere was letter writing too — although it wasn't of the affectionate kind. \nFirst, the Government of Office Ethics urged the White House to punish senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway for spruiking Ivanka Trump's fashion label on TV last week: \nThe second piece of mail pertaining to the White House was penned by Republican Jason Chaffetz of the House Oversight Committee . \nHe wanted to know what the security protocols were surrounding sensitive information after it was revealed that members of the public were nearby while Mr Trump discussed policy (and a North Korean nuclear test) while al-fresco dining with the Japanese Prime Minister last weekend at Mar-a-Lago: \nDon't feel neglected, you can find out who your White House romantic match is thanks to Samantha Bee , if you dare. Whispers within the White House \nOn the topic of White House staff — rumours of a rift between Ms Conway and Sean Spicer continue. Credit to Mr Spicer who continues to scrap his way through daily press briefings against the odds. \nAfter CNN last week said they refused Ms Conway on their network, MSNBC's Morning Joe is planning to take a similar route . \nMorning Joe may run out of representatives of Team Trump to talk too soon, with Joe Scarborough himself going after senior adviser Stephen Miller in this 1984-esque video: External Link: @JoeNBC: Ripped from the pages of 1984: The powers of the president will not be questioned. \nMeanwhile, Breitbart reported that there are whispers White House chief of staff Reince Priebus may be next to be shown the door. \nAccording to Axios , chief strategist Steve Bannon, who ran the right-wing news website before joining the Trump team, was not impressed. \nWe find it hard to believe after the President lauded his COS in his press conference, but hey, it's an unpredictable world we're living in folks. 18 holes \nThe President is planning to head to the \"Winter White House\" again this weekend — for the third week in a row . \nThe avid golfer works while he's in Florida but it's an interesting look for a President who was repeatedly critical of Mr Obama when he took to the links: External Link: @BradJaffy:More Trump tweets a photo of his 3rd golf course trip since becoming POTUS. (This time w/ Japanese PM) And here are some of his previous tweets Life Imitates Art \nAfter months of refining his impersonation of Mr Trump, Alec Baldwin seems to have officially acquired the identity of the President — at least this Dominican Republic newspaper thinks so after mistakenly printing Baldwin and not Mr Trump on its front page. \nWhoops : External Link: @terrence_mccoy: When a Dominican newspaper accidentally uses Alec Baldwin for Donald Trump. \nMr Trump is holding a rally in Melbourne ( the one in Florida as opposed to the city of my birth) this weekend. \nWe expect a large crowd and a lot of the kind of shouty showmanship that only the Donald can deliver. \nNext week (he says) he'll deliver a new executive order. \nIt's expected to supersede his stalled order on immigration banning people from seven Muslim-majority nations that's stuck in the courts. \nBy the way, did you know 2020 is already in the President's sights? In one of his press conferences this week he referred to how much better he plans to make things in the next three, four or eight years. \nThere's also this. \nIt's a long weekend in America for... drum roll...
