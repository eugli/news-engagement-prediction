Credit: ITV Border Police are appealing for witnesses after a \"shocking\" robbery at a post office in Galashiels.\nAt around 7:30am this morning, a man armed with a weapon (not a firearm), threatened and then assaulted a staff member at the Post Office in Balmoral Place.\nA 61-year-old man came into the shop as the robbery was happening, and intervened, however the suspect escaped with money and cigarettes from the shop, as well as the other customer's wallet and mobile phone.\nThe suspect is described as white, in his early 20s, and was wearing black trousers, a black top, light pink trainers and a black scarf covering his face.\nThis was a shocking attack. It was vicious and the member of staff sustained a serious head injury during the attack. He was taken by ambulance to the Borders General Hospital where he was treated and has since been released.\nThe Post Office is a busy place, as is Gala Park where the suspect made off towards, so I would appeal to anyone who saw the attack and who hasn’t already spoken to police, or anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to contact Scottish Borders CID via 101 or alternatively, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where details can be given in confidence.\n– Detective Constable Andrew Hope, Borders CID Last updated Sun 12 Feb 2017 Scottish Borders Galashiels", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:32:20.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
