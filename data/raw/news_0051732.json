(Kevin Richardson/Baltimore Sun video) (Carrie Wells) \nA proposal to move the academy to better quarters on the campus of Baltimore City Community College fell through because possible changes in the management of the college made officials reluctant to enter into a lease agreement, Perkins-Cohen said. \nSeveral dozen members of the academy community — students, teachers, parents, volunteers and neighborhood leaders — gathered at the academy after classes Friday for the update on plans for its future from Perkins-Cohen and other district officials. \nWhile most were relieved that the recommendation to close was rescinded, they remain worried about the school's future — because of its low enrollment of 262 students, and the limitations of its location in the middle school. Perkins-Cohen said high schools generally need about 500 students to get enough funding to offer a full range of activities. (Erica L. Green) \nPrincipal Nikkia Rowe said the school, which offers intensive mentoring and other services, had been on a trajectory to increase its enrollment and at one point had 326 students. But the uncertainty about its future, and lingering fears following the stabbing death of Ananias Jolley, 17, took a toll. \nOne student spoke passionately about the family atmosphere at the school, and his fear of losing that. Another student, an aspiring engineer, spoke wistfully about attending a resume workshop and hearing other students talk about classes in robotics and other programs that he wished Renaissance offered. \nSeveral at the meeting sought assurances from district officials that the school wouldn't find itself back on the chopping block in a year. Perkins-Cohen said the $1 million investment should mean the school would stay open at least two or three years. \nOthers at the meeting demanded to know why there were no other locations the academy might move to, which would allow the school to offer more programs, clubs and sports that could help increase enrollment. And most simply wanted assurance that they could continue working intensely with kids who often come from impoverished homes and neighborhoods. \n\"It's been a strain for our kids,\" said Tayler Williams, an English teacher, after the meeting. \"They are really afraid to lose what they built here.\" \nAtiba Nkrumah, who heads the Marble Hill Community Association, volunteers at the school and was thrilled that the students had made such a persuasive case for keeping the academy open, and that they'd received so much support from faculty and neighbors. \n\"They wouldn't let it go,\" he said of the kids. \"The love in this room, you can feel that.\" \nCouncilman Eric Costello, who represents the area, assured the crowd that district officials understood how important the school was to the students and the surrounding community. Saying he's had differences with school officials in the past, Costello said the district did extensive due diligence to try to find locations for the school and its community to stay together. \n\"Because that was the No. 1 thing we heard,\" he said. \"We cannot tear these students apart after what they have been through and endured and are recovering from and now growing from. That is the last thing we can let happen.\" \nSome favored moving to a new location because potential students and their parents will always link the current location to the death of Jolley in 2015. A jury found his classmate, Donte Crawford, 18, not guilty of first-degree murder. \nShawn Nelson, 19, graduated from Renaissance last year and now mentors current students. Despite all that his and other classes had been through, the school remains a vital part of their lives, he said. \n\"If they had to go somewhere else,\" he said, \"I don't think other people would care as much about them as we do.\" \ntwitter.com/jean_marbella", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:44:30.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
