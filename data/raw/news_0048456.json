Knopf on Oct. 24, publisher Sonny Mehta announced Tuesday. \nThe 17 stories in the book all revolve around typewriters — Hanks is a noted collector — and range from stories about an immigrant just arriving in New York City after leaving his civil war-torn country to a man who bowls a perfect game to an eccentric billionaire. \nHanks, who turned 60 in July, has been working on the stories since 2015. “In the two years of working on the stories,” said Hanks in a statement, “I made movies in New York, Berlin, Budapest, and Atlanta and wrote in all of them. I wrote in hotels during press tours. I wrote on vacation. I wrote on planes, at home, and in the office. When I could actually make a schedule, and keep to it, I wrote in the mornings from nine to one.” \nMehta praised the book as “an accomplished debut” in a statement. He added, “I am thrilled by the narrative range on display in this collection, and by the humor and humanity Tom brings to his work. This is an accomplished debut.” \nEditor-at-Large Peter Gethers is editing the book. Hanks was represented on the deal by Esther Newberg at ICM Partners.
