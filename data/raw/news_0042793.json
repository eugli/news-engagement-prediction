Apps that tell you to walk 10,000 steps a day could be doing more harm than good \nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference yesterday, he said it’s hard to imagine a catastrophe of that scale, but reminded people it happened almost one hundred years ago. \nHe said: ‘Whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or at the hand of a terrorist, epidemiologists say a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.’ \nAnd it could happen in 10 to 15 years’ time, he added.

Donald Trump state visit 'should and will happen' MPs told during debate \n‘It’s hard to get your mind around a catastrophe of that scale, but it happened not that long ago. In 1918, a particularly virulent and deadly strain of flu killed between 50 million and 100 million people,’ he said. \nHe also pointed out that even if the next global pandemic isn’t on the same scale, we should consider the social and economic affects it could have if spread to urban areas. What was the flu pandemic of 1918? \nThe Influenza pandemic of 1918, also known as the Spanish Flu, caused more people than all the wars of the 20th century combined – and it is believed to have killed 25 million in its first 25 weeks. \nThe virus spread to every continent across the globe. \nIn the UK, experts believe the virus was spread by soldiers returning home from the trenches in northern France. \nSymptoms included sore throat, headache and a loss of appetite. \nThe death toll was 228,000 in Britain alone. \nBy the end of pandemic in 1919, only one region in the entire world had not reported an outbreak – an isolated island called Marajo, located in Brazil’s Amazon River Delta.
