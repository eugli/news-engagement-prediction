He began his banking career as a graduate at NAB in 1989. \nNAB made the announcement on Tuesday morning , saying Baird would return to the bank with “invaluable experience”. \n“His time as treasurer and premier of New South Wales means he returns to banking and NAB with invaluable experience in leading economic and financial reform to grow the economy,” NAB’s chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, said. New South Wales premier Mike Baird announces retirement Read more \n“Mike has outstanding leadership and a determination to drive change and make a difference by building relationships with customers and the community.” \nBaird resigned from politics in mid-January, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family . He said he wanted more time with his wife and children, as well as his elderly parents and unwell sister. \n“My father has gone through open-heart surgery, he’s got a long road back to recovery,” Baird said. “He had become the primary carer for my mother, she’s just gone to 24 hours care, she’s got muscular dystrophy disorder, so basically she’s losing function in everything. That’s very tough to watch as a son. \n“My sister’s had a recurrence of cancer. I was in hospital with her last week. Those personal things obviously impact you. And the nature of this job makes it tough to be able to support as much as you want.” \nBaird follows a string of former state premiers who have worked in banking after politics. The former NSW premier Bob Carr joined Maquarie Bank in October 2005 as a part-time consultant only two months after he left state politics. \nThe former Labor Queensland premier Anna Bligh was recently appointed chief executive of the Australian Bankers’ Association. Thorburn also made that appointment. \nBaird spent 17 years in banking in Australia, London and New Zealand. He also worked with Deutsche Bank and HSBC before entering politics. \nNAB said that Baird would start in mid-April, subject to regulatory approval.
