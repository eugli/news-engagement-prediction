For instance, the capital gains tax arising on redemption of SGB to an individual has been exempted.

For instance, the capital gains tax arising on redemption of SGB to an individual has been exempted. However, in case of long-term capital gains (LTCGs), the indexation benefits will be provided to any person on transfer of bond. These bonds can also be used as security while taking loans against them.\nThe bonds will be open for subscription from February 27, 2017 to March 03 2017. These bonds will be available in both demat and paper form. If you are meeting the eligibility criteria, then by providing a valid identification document and also sending the application money on time, you will be able to receive the allotment.\nHere are ten things which you must know before investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds:\n1. What is Sovereign Gold Bond?\nSovereign Gold Bond (SGBs) are government securities which are denominated in grams of gold. They are, in fact, issued as a substitute for holding physical gold. Here investors have to pay the issue price in cash and the bonds will be redeemed in cash on maturity. The bond is issued by the RBI on behalf of the Government of India.\n2. Why should you buy SGB rather than physical gold?\nThe quantity of gold for which the investor pays is protected, unlike physical gold which you need to protect by yourself. Therefore, the risks and costs of storage are eliminated in case of investing in SGB. You also receive the ongoing market price at the time of redemption/ premature redemption. Despite holding in the demat form, the SGB offers a superior alternative to holding gold in the physical form. Investors are assured of the market value of gold at the time of maturity and periodical interest. Since it is bond, SGB is free from issues like making charges and purity in the case of gold in jewellery form. The bonds are held in the books of the RBI or in the demat form, eliminating the risk of loss of scrip etc.\nIf you want to earn returns which are linked to gold price, then get ready to buy sovereign gold bonds. The Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, has decided to issue Sovereign Gold Bonds 2016-17–Series IV.\nThere is no change as such. KYC norms are the same as that for the purchase of physical form of gold. You need to provide identification documents such as Aadhaar card/PAN /Passport / Voter ID card. KYC will be done by any of the following – issuing banks, SHCIL offices, Post Offices or agents. No separate KYC will be needed for receiving the bank’s own customers.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:14:50.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
