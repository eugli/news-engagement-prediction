(J. Scott Applewhite / AP) Brady Dennis The Washington Post \nAn Oklahoma judge on Thursday ordered Scott Pruitt , the state's attorney general and President Donald Trump 's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency , to turn over thousands of emails related to his communication with the oil, gas and coal industry. \nThe Center for Media and Democracy has been seeking the release of Pruitt's correspondence with fossil-fuel representatives under public records laws for more than two years. The group filed suit over Pruitt's refusal to turn over the documents and requested the expedited hearing that led to the judge's decision, which was first reported by E&E News. \nThe ruling by District Court Judge Aletia Timmons, who said there had been \"an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested,\" came a day before the Senate is expected to vote on confirming Pruitt to head the EPA, an agency that he has sued repeatedly during former President Barack Obama 's years in the White House. \nTimmons gave the attorney general's office until Tuesday to release the records, meaning they likely won't come to light until after he is sworn in to his new position. \n\"It should never have come to this,\" Nick Surgey, the advocacy group's director of research, said in an interview. \"We shouldn't have had to go to court to force the release of emails that were requested more than two years ago. . . . It makes it pretty difficult for people to vet his record.\" \nThe ruling led environmental groups and some Senate Democrats to immediately call for a delay of Pruitt's confirmation vote until lawmakers and the public have a chance to review the emails. \n\"A rushed Senate vote to confirm Pruitt as EPA Administrator right now would be a travesty,\" Elizabeth Thompson, president of climate and political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund , said in a statement. \"The documents in question are related to Pruitt's fitness to serve as head of EPA. Senators should exercise due diligence when confirming nominees, and they can't do that when they've been denied access to relevant information.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:14:59.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
