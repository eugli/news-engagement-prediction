No hooting, no hollering. Be polite and approachable, but let the lady advance to you if she chooses,” state the house rules of Maple Bar, a new cocktail bar inside the popular Treehouse venue, which opened two weeks ago. \n“Best manners and temperament are expected at all times. Leave your attitude with your hat at the door. Remember, nothing is on the house but the roof,” the rules say. \nThere is also a “semi formal” dress code, which requires men to wear a jacket and tie, a smart shirt and pants and leather dress shoes or loafers. Women must either wear an elegant cocktail dress or “dressy separates” and heels or dress shoes. Maple Bar's house rules.

I have been assaulted in Treehouse and my husband owns the bar. We just wanted to create a low-pressure environment.” Maple Bar at Treehouse.

It was meant to be in good humour,” Mrs Kadinski said. \n“We’ve had some snarky responses about the dress code. They argue they feel well dressed enough to come in. \n“So we’re really trying to encourage people to try and check it out for themselves. It’s not feminist, it’s not sexist. We’re trying to encourage a pressure-free environment for people to enjoy a drink.” \nrebecca.sullivan@news.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:25:28.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
