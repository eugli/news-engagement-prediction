The woman had been at the El Paso County Courthouse on Feb. 9 seeking protection from her boyfriend when the ICE agents detained and arrested her. ICE had received a tip about the woman’s immigration status, the El Paso Times reports.\n“This is really unprecedented,” Jo Anne Bernal, El Paso County Attorney, told the Washington Post . “It has an incredible chilling effect for all undocumented victims of any crime in our community.”\nAn ICE spokesperson declined to comment to the El Paso Times.
