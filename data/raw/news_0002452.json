It was clearly just prudency and managing taxpayers money than leaving it to us to go to the external markets,\" Mr Morrow said. Concerns raised over NBN's value \nMr Morrow said concerns about the final sale price of the NBN were understandable given the size and scope of the project amid reports that its value might have to be significantly written-down to attract buyers after 2020. \nLast year, consultancy KMPG estimated the NBN value might need to be written-down by as much as $25 billion to attract private interest. \n\"It is the biggest [project] that the country has seen. There is a lot of money involved so it's natural to be sceptical and to be concerned,\" Mr Morrow said. \n\"There's a lot of people that will speculate about what the value is and what will happen if it ever does come to selling. I think we should worry about that when the time comes.\" \nThe Federal Government expects a future privatisation of the NBN and that the $19.5 billion loan will be refinanced on external markets in 2020-21. \nIn a statement last year, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the NBN had obtained strong credit ratings, \"which show that the NBN's business case is strong.\" \nMr Morrow's defence of the NBN rollout coincides with the release of a report which says Australia will be the world's most connected continent after the rollout is complete in 2020. \nThe report by the University of Western Sydney predicts \"gen NBN\" will have life changing opportunities, with flexible working arrangement and access to world leading education and healthcare services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:18:03.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
