I think they're looking for alternatives.\"\nU of A waives application fees for students affected by U.S. travel ban\nSFU waives admission application fees for students affected by U.S. travel ban\nTrump's travel ban is a gift to jihadi recruiters: Mohamed Fahmy\nAt the beginning of the month, the U of A announced it would waive admission fees for affected students. Applying for admission at the U of A can cost more than $125.\nPresident David Turpin provided assurances that the university would remain an open and welcoming community to all nations and religions. \"We will do everything we can to support you during this period of uncertainty,\" Turpin said.\nThe move came just days after Trump issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban has since been suspended in court but the Trump administration has vowed to introduce a revised version.\nIn total, the ban affects 534 students at the U of A, the majority in engineering, science and medicine and dentistry.\nStudents hesitant to attend U.S. conferences\nWeir said he is aware of 27 affected graduate students who had been accepted to attend U.S. conferences, or hoped to go. Some cancelled flights in the days following the ban. Despite the court injunction, \"many will still hesitate [to travel] given the continued uncertainty of what might develop,\" he said.\nOn Friday afternoon, a student used virtual technology to present to a conference at Columbia University. Weir said the university is working on creating similar opportunities for other students, but they will still be at a disadvantage to peers.\n\"Obviously it's not the same experience for that student to be at the conference and establish their academic network or advance their network,\" said Weir, explaining networking is key to advancing academically and getting research published and recognized.\nAlthough seven countries were named in the U.S. travel ban — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — the U of A's surge in applications has mostly come from Iranian students at both the undergraduate and graduate level.\nAs of Friday, the total number of Iranian applicants was 930 compared to 329 at this time last year.\nVice-provost Britta Baron said the university's popularity among Iranian students began after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when they could no longer study in the U.S.\nBaron said the university has a number of professors of Iranian heritage, including some who are high profile and influential. Through them, she said, the faculty of engineering has built strong, informal relations with a top engineering school in Iran.\n\"Once we started seeing a lot of Iranian students, that very fact attracted more of them,\" said Baron. \"We hear that U of A is very well known in Iran.\"\nandrea.huncar@cbc.ca @andreahuncar", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/andreahuncar"], "published": "2017-02-27T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:20:07.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
