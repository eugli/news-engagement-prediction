Brandon Jennings (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:48 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:48 a.m. ET \nThe Knicks plan to waive Brandon Jennings, according to multiple reports. Knicks are waiving Brandon Jennings a day after Charley Rosen called him a \"profound disappointment\" who \"resists the triangle.\" â€” Stefan Bondy (@SBondyNYDN) February 27, 2017 \nThe point guard, who was averaging 8.6 points this season, asked to be released by the team, according to ESPN . The reason he asked for a release is because he hopes to play for a playoff-contending team instead of the 24-35 Knicks. \nMORE: JaVale McGee's mom says Shaq 'is bullying men of color' \nAccording to The Vertical , New York plans to sign Chasson Randle to replace Jennings. Randle was recently waived by the 76ers as a result of the team's trade with Dallas. \nJennings was once a promising player in Milwaukee, averaging over 19 points during the 2011-12 season. Recently, however, he's been bounced around a few teams, and eventually spent some time in the Development League. \nHe still has some flashes of great play, scoring 32 in a December game for New York. He probably won't go anywhere as a starter, but he can be a solid backup guard for a team looking to add depth in a postseason run.
