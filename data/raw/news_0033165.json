He said that from his reading of the 145-page judgment by Justice Odunga, it would have “huge implications for next elections”. \n“Basically, what (the) Odunga judgment means is that all decisions made by IEBC in the last three months were null and void,” Mr Chiloba tweeted, adding that this would affect decisions made by the commission from October 4, 2016 — on by-elections, ballot papers, audit, staffing, the integrated election management system, registration, information and communication technology regulations, and others. All these, he said, were effectively null and void. \nThere is already another case against the award of the contract to audit the voters’ register to KPMG, while the procurement of the election management system was allowed by the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board. \nThe case against the award of the ballots contract to Dubai’s Al-Ghurair had been filed by the Opposition coalition on the basis that the action was contrary to the Election Laws (Amendment) Act. \nSLIDING INTO ANARCHY \n“It was unreasonable for IEBC to proceed with the award of tender without taking into account the new regulations,” Justice Odunga ruled. \nMr Chiloba appeared to criticise the basis of the Odunga judgment, saying that “fundamental departure from public sector governance practice is the idea that board members should be engaged in procurement activities”. \nBut in the judgment Mr Odunga defended himself, saying courts have a responsibility to rescue the country from sliding to anarchy again, “so where it is brought to the attention of the court that certain electoral processes are being undertaken which are not in accordance with the Constitution and the law, the court must give appropriate directions and ought not to wait until the country goes into flames before undertaking its mandate”. \n“Unless Kenyans are assured that their will in the ballot box will be upheld,” explained Mr Odunga, “they are likely to be disillusioned with the electoral process.”He argued that IEBC ought to have converted to a new legal regime that came into force from October 4, 2016, adding that procurement of ballot papers should have been abandoned after new laws came into place. \n“This is even so taking into account the fact that by the time the formal contract was being entered into, the Amendment Act had already commenced on October 4, 2016. It was therefore unreasonable on the part of the IEBC to have proceeded with the contract in light of the new legal developments,” he stated. \nIn effect, Justice Odunga’s judgment implies that any decisions the IEBC made after President Uhuru Kenyatta declared commissioners’ seats vacant late last year cannot be taken to be constitutional and legally binding. \n“The presidential declaration of vacancy was made October 5, 2016, 13 days before the letter to the first interested party was drafted. In my view, section 134(1) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act only empowers the accounting officer to prepare and execute the contract,” said Justice Odunga. \nDuring the period in question, the former commission approved several critical assignments, including the ongoing vote listing exercise which was due to end yesterday and procurement of a number of strategic polling day materials", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:27:22.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
