New stipulations aimed at slowing the defections of franchise-type players are expected to alter free agency significantly. \nThe Bulls are projected to enter the 2017 offseason with $29 million to $53 million of salary-cap space, depending on whether Wade exercises his $23.8 million option. They own their own first-round pick and need the Kings to fall outside the 10 worst teams to acquire theirs, a byproduct of the January 2014 trade of Luol Deng to the Cavaliers. \nPaxson succeeded Jerry Krause as general manager in April 2003. He moved into his executive vice president role when Forman was promoted to general manager in May 2009. \nTwitter @kcjhoop", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:07:23.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
