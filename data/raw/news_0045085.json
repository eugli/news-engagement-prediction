The judge didn't understand what drove the couple to undertake their campaign of deception given they were both in respected and well-paying jobs, particularly Lean who was a director of her department. \"You had a great deal going for you,\" he said. \"Generally those who commit offences of this nature do so for financial gain. \"This is not immediately apparent in this case.\" Lean was offered home detention in court on Tuesday, while Peisley (pictured) will serve his time behind bars As well as receiving time off and paid accommodation and medical bills, the couple also made a worker's compensation claim. The state government had agreed to pay a $580,000 settlement before Lean and Peisley were caught when police became suspicious and devised a plot of their own. They were arrested after police covertly broke into their flat and marked envelopes and paper with \"invisible ink\". The next threat the couple handed over to police was tested with a UV light to reveal the markings the officers had made. \"The evidence at trial was overwhelming and the jury's verdicts were inevitable,\" Judge Beazley said. During sentencing submissions, Peisley offered to take the fall and serve jail time in the hope this would keep his wife out of prison. The father was sentenced to six years and six months in prison with a non-parole period of three years. Lean was sentenced to six years and eight months of home detention with a non-parole period of three years, along with strict conditions including that she wear an electronic monitoring device.
