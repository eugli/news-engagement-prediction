Also returning to their original roles are Martine McCutcheon, Andrew Lincoln, Lucia Moniz, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Olivia Olson, Marcus Brigstocke, and Rowan Atkinson. Notable absences include Emma Thompson, Martin Freeman and Chiwetel Ejiofor. \n“I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to “Love Actually,” but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,” added Curtis. “We’ve been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part and it’ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later.” \nThe film will screen as part of Comic Relief’s “Red Nose Day 2017” charity telethon on March 24 on BBC One.
