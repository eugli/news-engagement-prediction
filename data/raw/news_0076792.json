(AFP/Getty Images) \nGary Neville admits Southampton forward Manolo Gabbiadini reminds him of former Italy striker Filippo Inzaghi. \nGabbiadini has made an immediate impact since his £15 million transfer from Napoli with five goals in his first three appearances for the Saints. \nTwo of which came in an impressive performance in Sunday’s EFL Cup final defeat to Manchester United at Wemley. \nAnd Neville believes Gabbiadini has the same qualities as one of the best striker’s in Serie A history. \n‘His movement in the box was absolutely sensational,’ Neville told Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. Gabbiadini has scored five goals in his first three appearances for Southampton. (Getty Images) Filippo Inzaghi scored 126 goals in 300 games for AC Milan. (Getty Images) \n‘Very rarely have I seen move across the box so many times in a game. \n‘We always like to compare players and find out who they remind us of, he reminds me so much of Filippo Inzaghi – player who used to play for Juventus, AC Milan, Italy.
