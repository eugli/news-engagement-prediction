Photo: Mark Mulligan, Houston Chronicle Image 21 of 21 First look: The Pearl Restaurant & Bar 1 / 21 Back to Gallery \nFor years the bar and restaurant at the Sam Houston Hotel felt underutilized and underpopulated -- a sad state of affairs given that the separate spaces had such great potential to entertain, especially the bar that commands the corner of Prairie and San Jacinto. \nThat's all changed. \nThe hotel, 1117 Prairie, is now home to the Pearl Restaurant & Bar occupying the former 17 restaurant and Sam Bar. Both rooms now have the look and authority they probably always deserved as essential players in downtown's growing hospitality nexus. \nMARGARITA DAY: Where to celebrate in Houston \nWith a seafood-forward menu from executive chef Chris Loftis and a posh redesign by Candice Schiller of H3D Hospitality Design collaborating with architect Craig Schuster of Schuster Inc., the Pearl is a gem. Hotel owner American Liberty Hospitality has invested handsomely to make the deserving Sam not just a great place to sleep but a fabulous new space to eat and drink. \nThe 30-year-old Loftis, former chef de cuisine of Killen's Steakhouse in Pearland, has devised a menu that makes the most of our Gulf seafood riches. Starters include Gulf fried oysters with house-cured bacon and pickled jalapeno; mussels simmered in Riesling and garlic butter; pickled shrimp; a composed salad of jumbo lump crab, avocado puree and grapefruit; octopus with grilled potatoes, blood orange and chorizo; and crab and charred corn chowder. Other appetizers: pork belly with sunny side up egg; bone marrow with fried mushrooms; heirloom tomato and burrito salad; roasted beets and honey goat cheese with apple butter; and steak tartare with white anchovy. \nThe entrees: bouillabaisse; shrimp and grits with malt vinegar jus; snapper with romesco sauce; roasted half chicken with collards and seared mushrooms; seared sea scallop carbonara; grouper with curried corn and lentils; Dr Pepper braised short ribs with Brussels sprouts and spaetzle; and a grill menu of steaks, pork chop or fish. \nThose dishes arrive in a dining room that Schiller says was inspired by the hotel's namesake, the first president of the Republic of Texas. \"Every project beings with a story and that story determines the content of the design,\" said Schiller whose design work is evident in Café Annie and the Grove (she is also a partner in the Schiller-Del Grande Restaurant Group). \nGood thing she had a great story to work with. Motifs inspired by Houston's life and design themes taken from the time the hotel was built in 1924 can be seen throughout the dining room that has been overhauled top to bottom. Support columns have been wrapped in period-looking structural steel; expanses of antique brick suggest the building's oldest foundations; walls of rough-edged panels of knotted cedar offer warm texture; and vintage brass lights and caramel-colored leather Chesterfield sofas are elegant accessories. Banquettes covered in a totemic, tribal-like pattern suggest old Indian arrowheads – a nod to Houston's Cherokee affiliations. A wall of glass (holding a fetching wine closet) now offers the lobby a visual link to the restaurant. \nMany of these design elements help bridge the restaurant and bar, across the foyer. The Pearl Bar has been completely rethought: a new bar top; pressed tin bar back; new zinc-topped tables and custom chairs; generous tufted sofas; more brick; and shutters that lend sophistication to the windows looking out on Prairie and San Jacinto. The bar that once seemed like an afterthought is now among the most inviting, sophisticated places downtown to hold court. (And a place to try Loftis' raw bar menu of oysters and crudo, as well as a bar-only menu of bites including pork belly cheese fries; house pickles; grouper or shrimp tacos; and the Pearl Burger.) \nAnd then there's that logo. A lovely script – both deliberately formal and proudly territorial – that is beautifully antiqued and painted on the windows of Sam's new reason to show off. The logo proudly stamps the hotel as a new – well, wonderfully old – place to make your own bit of Houston history. \nThe Pearl Restaurant & Bar, The Sam Houston Hotel, 1117 Prairie, 832-200-8800.
