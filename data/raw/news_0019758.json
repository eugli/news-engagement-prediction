Authorities believe Rachid Kassim inspired the killing of a French priest in the town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray in July and a failed gas canister attack on Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in September. Kassim, 29, was previously based in Syria where officials have said he stage-managed plots by radicals in France by communicating with them through the encrypted Telegram messaging app. He was also linked to the killing of a French police commander and his partner in Magnanville, France. French security sources told CNN in November that Kassim had been offline for weeks.
