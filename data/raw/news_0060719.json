More videos Woolworths earnings report \nSupermarket chain Woolworths has beaten rival Coles in sales growth for the first time in over 7 years. \nThe hot-shot retailer, Sally Macdonald, who had been employed to turn the business around left mysteriously in November after only a year in the job. She had a fix-it plan that Woolworths said would remain after she left but it now says the business will be the subject of a new strategic review - about which it would furnish no detail. \nChairman Gordon Cairns has demonstrated a pretty clear appetite for radical solutions to problem brands and underperforming executives.

It noted the first in-house designed ranges in apparel and homewares had arrived and an interim boss had been put in place.

Its earnings fell by $58 million to $16 million, with revenue down 17.7 per cent as the department store chain battles to revive its fortunes.

Kmart boss Guy Russo is now in charge but there are no signs yet on any financial improvement. \nThe extent of the resolve of the two majors, Coles and Woolworths, to win the supermarket market share war could now start to worry investors. Their war chests are getting larger and their profits are falling. SHARE Share on Twitter Link Big W is now barely profitable with earnings falling around 89 per cent in the first half of the 2017 financial year. Photo: Brendan Esposito \nWoolworths scored a victory on Wednesday, beating Coles in the first half of financial year 2017 on the much-watched measure of sales growth. But it was a costly win. EBIT margins were shredded and profits went backwards. \nWesfarmers' supermarket brand, Coles, also sustained a fall in profit as it ploughed money into lowering prices at the checkout - a strategy Woolworths has now been employing for more than a year.
