It follows three high school quarterbacks: Jake Fromm, Tate Martell, and Tayvon Bowers during their senior seasons. \nThe trailer, at least, takes viewers through the normal storylines that make series like these interesting: The tension between being an elite athlete and going to high school, the pressure, the backstories of their families and the chance of making it to the highest level. \n“We’re going very deeply into their lives before they go off to college,” Berg told USA TODAY Sports’ Erik Brady. “These are young men who have an incredible amount of pressure that they’re carrying. And we have received really great access to their lives and their families and their coaches and their teams. I think for anyone who found anything inspirational in Friday Night Lights, I think there is quite a lot to like in this show.” \nIt premieres on February 15 on Go90.com. More Friday Night Lights!
