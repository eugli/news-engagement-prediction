As such, the security forces will act against any form of provocation by irresponsible people. \n\"I hope PAS supporters will attend so as to fulfill our objective to support the amendments to Act 355 to empower the status of the Syariah Courts in the country's legal system,\" he was quoted as saying by Bernama . \nHadi also said that more than 200,000 people were expected to attend the gathering, including non-Muslims who supported the Bill. \n\"We invite all to attend. We are open for all of us to express our support to empower Islam and, at the same time, give non-Muslims the freedom to practise their beliefs. \n\"As of now, I can confirm that there will be government representatives at the gathering,\" he said. \nThe gathering is expected to begin at 2.30pm and end at 11pm, and will have several activities such as Q & A with speakers and speeches by NGO and government representatives, as well as Abdul Hadi himself. \nMeanwhile, DAP said its central executive committee has decided against participating in tomorrow's rally. \n“PAS is exercising its constitutional right to assemble peacefully. That is entirely up to them. \n“We have made our stand clear. We do not support the proposed amendments to the bill be it in its original or amended form. We have and will continue to oppose it in Parliament,” said DAP lawmakers Gobind Singh and Zairil Khir Johari in a joint statement. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:44:47.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
