The Patriots, of course, continued down the field and tied up the game, eventually winning it in the first overtime in Super Bowl history. On Monday night, Julian and his head coach, Bill Belichick, stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon as part of their victory tour, and Julian told everyone what he said to Tom Brady after the miraculous play. Julian said, “I looked at him and I said, ‘Hey, we gotta peter, peter, peter’ … which means, ‘Let’s get to the ball and snap it so they can’t review it.'” While there is no debating his talent, Julian did admit that “It was probably, like, 70 percent luck.” The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on NBC.
