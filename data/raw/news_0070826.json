Atheism is nothing more or less than the absence of belief in gods. There are only two options available for everyone: either a belief in the existence of some sort of god is present, or no such belief is present . That exhausts all the logical possibilities. This means that everyone is either a theist or an atheist. There is no \"middle ground\" where a belief in the existence of some god is a \"little bit\" there or a \"little bit\" absent. It's either there or its not. \nHow you arrive at not believing in any gods may be difficult and will certainly vary from person to person. For many people, religion and theism have played such central roles in their lives and families that abandoning these things may appear impossible. It may require a great deal of study, research, and contemplation. Many people don't have the time or inclination. Others may be afraid of what they could find if they start. \nWhat you do after you arrive at not believing in any gods may also be difficult, especially if you are surrounded by religion and theistic belief. You don't have to do anything more to be an atheist, but this doesn't mean that there is nothing at all left to do. You will have to decide whether you inform others about this and, if so, how you present it . Many people may start treating you differently simply because you don't believe in their gods anymore. You may have to be concerned about whether knowledge of your atheism will lead to discrimination against you at work, for example. \nBeing an atheist is easy — all that it requires is not believing in any gods. Existing as an atheist, though, isn’t always easy because so many people think so poorly of atheists . In more secular societies where lots of people are atheists, existing as an atheist will be easier because there is less pressure telling them that being an atheist is immoral, unpatriotic, or dangerous. In more religious societies, the increased pressure will make existing as an atheist very difficult for some.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:44:14.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
