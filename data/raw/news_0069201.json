Supplied \nUnpolluted waterways are an important part of our sales pitch to overseas visitors. \n\"Without a sense of urgency pollution of our waterways will continue to worsen for the foreseeable future – something the tourism industry cannot afford. \nREAD MORE \n\"We have to be seen to be doing all we can to live up to the 100% Pure New Zealand promise\". DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nOverseas visitors are not impressed to find warning signs like this one at Canterbury's Coes Ford. \nImmink​ said tourism businesses tended to operate in pristine areas but there was anecdotal evidence that overseas visitors were aware of the worsening pollution problem. \n\"Today's visitors are environmentally aware and clean water is an essential aspect for New Zealand's tourism and primary exports future. \n\"Self drive visitors around the country are noticing all these \"toxic\" signs and the small waterways that look horrible\". \nThe Government's new measure for freshwater to be safe to drink or swim now effectively allowed E Coli readings at levels that meant there was a one in 20 chance of getting sick from swimming in rivers and streams, Immink​ said. Ad Feedback \nThis was vastly different to what most New Zealanders would consider swimmable, she said. \n\"Quite simply the goalposts have been widened to ensure more rivers and streams fall within the govt's threshold of swimmable. \nLast year the Tourism Export Council, which represents 1300 inbound tour operators, supported the Choose Clean Water Campaign and presented a 13,000-signature petition to Parliament calling for better freshwater quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:00:55.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
