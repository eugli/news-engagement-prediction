Today, we explore   life expectancy. \nThe results are depressingly unsurprising. Africa is the only continent that contains nations where the average life expectancy is below 60. And there are 28 of them. The lowest life expectancy of all is found in Sierra Leone, where it is a staggering 46, followed by Lesotho, Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Demoncratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Swaziland. There are a few notable exceptions, such as Namibia (where life expectancy is 67), Morocco (71), Egypt (71), Algeria (72), Libya (75) and Tunisia (76). \nJapan is where residents live the longest - 84, on average, according to the World Health Organisation data, published this year. It is closely followed by six countries on 83 years: Andorra, Australia, Switzerland, Italy, Singapore and San Marino. \nEurope generally fares well, but the life expectancy falls as you travel east, from 81 in Germany, to 77 in Poland, to 71 in Ukraine and Belarus ( the world's booziest nation , we recently revealed), and finally to 69 in Russia. \nCanadians live three years longer than their neighbours to the south, the US, while there are some notable differences between the South American states - Chileans live to a healthy 80 years, on average, but over the border in Bolivia it's just 69. Six holidays to help you live longer Okinawa Archipelago, Japan \nA group of 161 islands in the East China Sea, the Okinawa Archipelago is home to ruins, rare cats, extensive limestone caves and coral reefs. The residents here also live longer than anywhere else in the world. There are 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, five times more than the rest of Japan. Explanations have included diet (low-fat, low-salt foods, such as fish, tofu and seaweed are popular here), low-stress lifestyle, and the spirituality of the inhabitants. Head there and some of it might rub off on you. BA flies (indirect) from Gatwick and Glasgow to Okinawa Naha. Residents in Okinawa live longer than anyone Campodimele, Italy \nThe hilltop town of Campodimele lies in the Italian province of Latina, halfway between Naples and Rome. Its residents live to an average age of 95, with the mountain air, relaxed lifestyle and diet - basil, anchovies, spaghetti, tomatoes - said to be responsible. Take the train from Rome or Naples to Formia, the nearest major settlement to Campodimele, and hire a Vespa. See trenitalia.com . Symi, Greece \nThe inhabitants of Symi in Greece often live into their nineties, with diet (olive oil, fish, tomatoes, and only a little meat) again thought to be the key factor. There's no airport, so you'll need to fly to Rhodes and take a ferry. The Mediterranean diet is a favourite of doctors Credit: PHOTOINKE / Alamy Loma Linda, California \nThe town of Loma Linda, set on the outskirts of Los Angeles, has been cited as another place where residents live unusually long lives. A number are Seventh-day Adventists, who refrain from eating meat and drinking alcohol, which probably explains why. Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica \nThe region in Costa Rica is known for its beaches and is a popular tourist destination. Its residents also frequently live beyond 100 years of age. The simple lifestyle - Nicoyans usually make a living farming or on cattle ranches - is said to be responsible. The beaches probably help.

Scientists have come here attempting to unravel the mystery and one businessman even developed and marketed a \"miracle\" drink made from locally grown fruit and vegetables.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:40:49.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
