Kentucky is a traditionally “red state” that has a healthy margin of supporters for conservatives and the GOP. \nMcConnell stated multiple times how he supported the right to peaceful protest, yet failed to address the concerns expressed by those constituents who had traveled there to make their voices heard. Those few critical voters who managed to get tickets to the event didn’t fare much better in getting their concerns addressed. One Attendee Confronts McConnell Over Coal Jobs \nAccording to the Associated Press , one of the protesters who managed to get inside the gathering was 54-year-old Rose Perkins of Georgetown. Perkins asked McConnell about the coal jobs being lost in Eastern Kentucky, wagging her finger at McConnell.

McConnell’s Silencing Of Elizabeth Warren has Not Been Forgotten \nElizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) attempted to read a critical letter by Coretta Scott King regarding former Senator Jeff Sessions during his nomination hearings for U.S. Attorney General. McConnell invoked a rule that prohibits members of the senate from making personal attacks on fellow senators, but Warren was simply trying to read King’s letter in regard to the character of Sessions for his nomination hearing. McConnell led the rebuke officially barring the Massachusetts senator from speaking for the rest of the confirmation hearing and stated that the action had to be taken because he had warned Warren several times not to read King’s remarks, but “nevertheless, she persisted.” \nHis words became a rallying cry and the text of memes everywhere, highlighting women who have fought for women’s rights in the past and present. \nUnfortunately for Perkins, while she was able to voice her question, McConnell’s response didn’t address or even acknowledge her concerns. \n“I hope you feel better now.” Kentucky residents gather outside the American Legion Post 34 to protest the appearance of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky., and the policies of the Trump administration Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017, in Lawrenceburg, Ky.

Easley] Kentucky Residents Angry About ACA Repeal And Inability To Communicate With Senators \nAnother Kentucky resident at the event, 32-year-old Robert Brown, came to protest McConnell’s and the Republicans’ plans to repeal the ACA, or “Obamacare.” Brown uses a wheelchair for mobility because he has spina bifida and is afraid that he won’t be able to get health insurance. He was also upset that McConnell, like many Republican senators trying to avoid hostile town hall meetings, had created a private event requiring paid tickets instead of an open forum. \n“Senator McConnell is not holding town hall meetings. He’s holding private meetings with people that will pay to see him and that largely agree with him.” \nIn addition to protesting many of the policies supported by McConnell and the new administration, the crowd gathered outside the event Tuesday was upset about not being able to call and leave messages for the senator, as contact number voicemails have been full, cutting off their ability to let McConnell and other senators know their opinions on important issues. \n[Featured Image byMark Wilson/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:22:52.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
