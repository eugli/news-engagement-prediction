Seo Taiji and Boys \nSeo Taiji and Boys , a 90s trio that are often considered one of the founding fathers of K-pop, had their 20th debut anniversary in 2012. In honor of that, Taiji Mania, the group‚Äôs fan club, raised almost $35,000 to donate to the World Land Trust. All of the money went into making the ‚ÄúSeotaiji Forest‚Äù, a 5-hectare section in Brazil‚Äôs Gaupi Assu rainforest. Seo Taiji later donated himself, forming the ‚ÄúSeo Taiji Mania Forest‚Äù, which is located right next to the forest his fans made earlier. Seotaiji Forest on Google Maps 2. Shinhwa \nPrior to 2007, fans usually would have flowers and banners arranged at concerts. However, during Shin Hyesung ‚Äòs solo concert, fans sent hundreds of kilograms of rice for charity. After this, fans from all different K-pop fandoms started donating rice in honor of their groups. Fans have also donated 1,130 trees to Seoul City Park to mark Shinhwa‚Äôs 15th anniversary.
