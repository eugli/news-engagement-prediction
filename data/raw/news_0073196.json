His unique personality with its unrelenting warmth in a cold-hearted industry made him a perfect front man for football's most extraordinary title win. In a brutal sporting environment, his sheer decency stands out and a similar outpouring of empathy had accompanied his departure from Chelsea in 2004. And yet Chelsea players who talk lovingly of the man now were also aghast at the tactical changes he made in the Champions League semi-final against Monaco in 2004. 'What the f*** was that about?' one player texted to a friend within minutes of Chelsea having lost the first leg 3-1 against 10-man Monaco. Players were perplexed and angry with him, yet they also genuinely liked him. Last season Ranieri joked about going from Tinkerman to Superman, but he earned his former nickname for a reason. Players do respond to his generosity and the silliness of the 'Dilly Ding, Dilly Dong' interjections into everyday training. But he can also struggle to communicate his ideas. As news of his departure broke, Ranieri continued to smile as he arrived at his home One fan presented Ranieri with a bottle of wine in a Leicester City carrier bag Fans, young and old alike, wanted to meet Ranieri after his sacking was announced In any fairy tale, there has to be a wicked witch. At present the players have been given that role, while assistant coach Craig Shakespeare said he felt like a 'pantomime villain' taking over from Ranieri. And Rudkin must feel like the man who shot Bambi's mother. But the owners should also share culpability. Since taking over at the club, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his son, Aiyawatt, have enjoyed close relationships with many players and regularly take them to lunch. In theory, it sounds enlightened but it is hard for any manager to impose himself if players have direct input to the decision-makers. And this is a strong group forged in lower leagues, most of whom were brought in by former manager Nigel Pearson. Kasper Schmeichel, Andy King and captain Wes Morgan represent the squad when issues have to be raised with the manager. Jamie Vardy's rise in recent years also gives him enormous status in the dressing room. Sources at the club insist that the players would never have told the owners that Ranieri needed to be sacked, and on Saturday Schmeichel was adamant they had 'no influence over the decision' while also admitting they had regular conversations with the owners. But equally it would have been hard to hide the problems when meetings or social events did take place. ARE THESE THE GAMES THAT COST RANIERI HIS JOB? C openhagen 0 Leicester 0 - Nov 2, 2016 Luis Hernandez was drafted in to form a back three. The tactic, which had not been tried before, didn't work. Copenhagen were miles better and the formation was ditched after 40 minutes. Leicester 0 Chelsea 3 - Jan 14, 2017 Ranieri went back to the failed experiment of a back three to try to mirror Chelsea's formation. The team flopped, with wing-backs Marc Albrighton and Ben Chilwell anonymous. S outhampton 3 Leicester 0 - Jan 22, 2017 A week later and Ranieri shuffled his pack again, this time opting for a diamond. Shinji Okazaki (right), playing at the tip, looked lost and the Foxes manager apologised after the game. Swansea 2 Leicester 0 - Feb 12, 2017 With his side 2-0 down, two of Ranieri's three second-half substiutes were a left-back and a holding midfielder. As the game slipped away, Okazaki and Ahmed Musa remained on the bench. Ranieri looks dejected during his side's 2-0 defeat away at relegation rivals Swansea And there were clear issues. It has been said that the full extent of the dressing-room problems will never be revealed, as everyone recognises how important Ranieri was in their title win and there is no desire to badmouth him now. But even that assertion confirms how difficult the situation had become. The start to the season was mixed, with the defeat by Hull in the first game an early wake-up call, though wins against Swansea, Burnley and Crystal Palace and good Champions League form suggested this could yet to be a season to relish. The earliest signs of discord came in November in Copenhagen in the Champions League, ironically the city where Leicester players had travelled for their famous 2015 fancy-dress Christmas party. The back three played by Ranieri clearly had players puzzled and was abandoned after 40 minutes. Ranieri insisted they had worked on the formation in training but some players felt not enough time had been spent. When Chelsea came to the King Power in January, the back three was used again and Leicester, though hardly great, worked the system better than many clubs have against the champions-elect. However when, at 2-0 down after an hour, they reverted to a back four, the sight of baffled players looking at the bench for further guidance did not inspire. They lost 3-0. The following week came the bizarre diamond formation at Southampton which pretty much had the game lost by half-time and for which Ranieri publicly apologised. Meanwhile, the continued use of summer signing Ahmed Musa over Demarai Gray perplexed many. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was visibly unimpressed after Leicester's loss at Swansea His players became confused by tactical changes ahead of and during important matches But the game which killed Ranieri was the 2-0 loss at Swansea. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was visibly unimpressed. Ranieri again made bold substitutions, bringing off one full-back, Christian Fuchs at half-time and another, Danny Simpson, on 70 minutes. Club insiders insist that the players were bewildered at times but that Ranieri had not lost their support and that they were ready to work with him to turn the situation around. It is equally clear it didn't take the arrival of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha before the Derby FA Cup game in February for dressing-room issues to be communicated. The owner's son is a regular visitor and would have kept his father abreast of the situation. On inheriting the job, Ranieri had held back from tactical changes as the players respectfully made it clear they struggled with them and understood the template laid down by Pearson better. Ranieri merely tweaked that system and the subsequent success and his affability meant that superficially all seemed well. Yet when a downturn came and Ranieri made his own tactical adjustments, tensions emerged. That said, there is no single reason why the fairy tale turned into something darker. Just as last season, when scores of situations serendipitously worked in Leicester's favour, this season circumstances have conspired against them. No one at the club, Ranieri apart, had experience of managing success. So everyone knew there would be some kind of after-shock after such a seismic victory; it's just that no one saw it being this powerful. The Leicester players were all bought BMW sports cars to celebrate their title victory Riyad Mahrez accepts the gift from chairman Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha If one picture encapsulated the misjudgments made in the wake of their success, it would be a parade of BMW i8 sports cars lined up outside the stadium at the start of the season, bonuses presented to players and staff by the owners. It jarred horribly with the workmanlike spirit of the club. Shakespeare, though, dismissed the notion that the gifts had caused friction, given that some staff received a car while others, less senior, did not. The majority of players have undeniably reached their pinnacle. It cannot get any better for most. Even for hardened winners, that is an awkward career phase to negotiate. That parade of cars reminded some of a story Graham Taylor would tell. In his second spell at Watford, he had once again taken a team from the third tier into the top flight in two years. 'I knew we were in trouble when I drove into the training ground on the first day of pre-season training,' said Taylor. Where previously the car park had a relatively-modest range of vehicles, there was now an array of top-of-the-range sports cars. Taylor feared certain players might be resting on their laurels. That season they finished bottom of the Premier League. Now it is for Leicester to avoid a similar fate; though they'll always have memories. And a BMW i8. Ranieri will always be remembered as the man who brought the title to Leicester RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:38:37.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
