SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link In its submission, CommInsure said it found no evidence to substantiate any of the allegations of wilful misconduct or any systemic issues regarding inappropriate decline of claims. Photo: Michael Clayton-Jones \nMr Rugerrio, who has held Total and Permanent Disablement (TPD) Benefit Insurance through his superannuation policy with AMP since 1997, said he feared for his future after he had no contact from the insurer since he lodged a claim in 2014. \n\"I can no longer use my insurance funds to buy a home to live in and at least have some place to live in my later years,\" he said. \n\"I would rather have an overdose than end up living on the street.\" \nIn its submission, law firm Maurice Blackburn said the most pervasive change across the industry was the substitution of the legal test of \"unlikely\" with the more onerous \"unable\" on the impact of a medical condition on a claimant's ability to work. \n\"For instance, it is possible to argue that even a quadriplegic is theoretically capable of work and may not satisfy an \"unable\" definition, notwithstanding that their actual employment prospects in a competitive employment market are negligible,\" it said. \n\"As a consequence, the insurance effectively becomes junk insurance\" \nGeoff Derrick, the National Assistant Secretary of the Finance Sector Union of Australia, said insurance employees have consistently provided feedback on the pressure they are under to see each customer as a sales opportunity to be exploited. \nIn his submission, John Berrill of Berrill & Watson Lawyers said some of these may constitute systemic problems although it is unclear whether there is evidence of widespread unethical practices to avoid meeting claims. \nThe hearing will continue in Sydney on Friday.
