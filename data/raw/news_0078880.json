The winter sky was slate gray on Monday afternoon as the great and the good of the industry gathered in the Duomo, the city’s massive Gothic cathedral, for a service in Ms. Sozzani’s memory. Crowds thronged behind safety barriers outside as hundreds of mourners filed in. Photo Inside the Duomo.

Alber Elbaz, Bruno Frisoni, Sidney Toledano and François-Henri Pinault came from Paris. Pierpaolo Piccioli, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Giorgio Armani, Miuccia Prada and Valentino Garavani were there; so, too, were the supermodels Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Eva Herzigova, and the photographers Mario Testino, Peter Lindbergh and Mario Sorrenti. Members of the Fendi, Versace, Pucci, Missoni and Ferretti families were in attendance, as was Matteo Renzi, the former Italian prime minister, and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the former first lady of France.

Before the memorial, Ms. Sozzani’s family had invited some of the attendees to a light lunch, held across the piazza from the Duomo.

Credit Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times Ms. Sozzani, once described by this newspaper as “ a daring and often impious iconoclast on the newsstand ,” was widely respected for reshaping the job of a fashion editor during her 28 years at the helm of Italian Vogue. She often used the magazine as a platform for activism, tackling controversial topics like race, domestic violence, plastic surgery and drug addiction. She also made a point of championing young and emerging talents, particularly in her home country, where the industry has often proved resistant to change. Her niece Sara Maino , head of talent at Italian Vogue, gave one of two readings during the service. The other came from Ms. Sozzani’s only child, Francesco Carrozzini, a film director, whose documentary on his mother’s life made its debut at the Venice Film Festival in September.

But for that moment, gathered in memoriam of one woman, fashion was united.
