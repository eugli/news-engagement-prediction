Sure, we all know that muscle weighs more than fat and the number on the scale isn’t really a good indicator of health — but society remains focused on weight. It’s easy to get caught up in that mindset. For all the skeptics out there, a mom posted a before-and-after Instagram photo to remind us that the number on a scale doesn’t mean anything . Adrienne Osuna, a fitness blogger based in Santa Maria, California, spent years yo-yo dieting and struggling with her weight. It was only when the mother of four decided to focus on exercise and ditch the scale obsession that Osuna saw effective, lasting results — and (spoiler alert!) they had nothing to do with her weight. Many may expect that her before-and-after is due to weight loss — but Osuna only lost two pounds, and her transformation came from sweating it out at the gym and lifting heavy weights. On her blog , Osuna says she “fell in love” with heavy lifting, and currently lifts about four times each week. Since she began her fitness journey, Osuna writes that she dropped three dress sizes — but the scale still hasn’t moved. Lifting weights is one of the healthiest, most empowering forms of exercise. And, as Osuna’s photos prove, it transforms the body in a beautiful way that has nothing to do with the number on the scale.
