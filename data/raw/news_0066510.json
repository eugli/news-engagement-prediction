I complete four laps while keeping the Stinger pitched sideways, before I apply too much power abruptly, upset the car and spin out. The mountains in the distance blur by us three times before the car comes to halt, and we begin to laugh hysterically. \nIt's hard to believe that a little more than a month prior, I stood in front of the Stinger at the Detroit Auto Show for the Kia's world debut, eagerly anticipating the opportunity to drive this new sport sedan. I didn't imagine my first crack at it would happen so soon -- or on a giant block of ice 460 miles north of Stockholm -- but here I am and I'm not complaining, even though it's only for a short time in very slippery conditions.\nBefore the really sideways antics, my session on the ice circle began with Markus walking me through the Stinger's various stability control modes starting with Comfort, which dials back power at the first sign of wheel spin for maximum slick weather safety. Sport allows for a little more slip before cutting power and a second Sport setting doesn't cork thrust and allows for nice controlled drifts, requiring little driver skill. \nEnlarge Image Stability control tuning for the Stinger is on point.\nKia The majority of my allotted 7 minutes on the course is spent with stability control completely off, only the limited-slip differential and the additional traction from the studded Continental winter tires helping me around. The rear-wheel-drive car feels balanced and forgiving in a drift, the chassis reacting predictably to throttle and steering inputs. I manage opposite lock drifting without too much trouble, which is always a lot of fun. \n\"Fun\" is the keyword here, as no Kia vehicle to date has featured a drive dynamic that could truly get enthusiasts excited. Sure, the Optima drives well for a front-wheel-drive family sedan, but it doesn't knock your socks off. After a brief sampling of the Stinger on ice, I'm feeling confident Kia will have a purebred performance machine in its stable shortly, thanks in large part to the arrival of Albert Biermann. \nFollowing a 32-year stint at BMW , where he spearheaded the development of the company's high-performance M vehicles , Biermann joined Kia to oversee vehicle testing and high-performance development. In his position, Biermann also directs handling development of all Hyundai and Genesis vehicles.\n2018 Kia Stinger is a balanced drifting...
