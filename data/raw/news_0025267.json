Burakovsky showed Nicolas some photos on his phone. Then Nicolas noticed Burakovsky’s right hand, which was in a cast , the result of a slap shot by Detroit’s Brendan Smith last week. \n“I saw his hand, and I was like, ‘It is you!’ ” Nicolas recalled. “He was a very cool guy.” A photo posted by Emmanuel Nicolas (@manny4prez) on Feb 12, 2017 at 12:13pm PST \nNicolas lives in Silver Spring, but he and his friend agreed to drive Burakovsky and his two buddies back to Burakovsky’s apartment in Northern Virginia. They also took a selfie, which Nicolas, who is on the left with no hat in the photo, posted to Instagram later that day and was picked up by NHL.com and other outlets. \nNicolas said he and Burakovsky exchanged numbers and that Burakovsky texted him Monday to say, “You’re famous now.” Nicolas told Burakovsky to let him know when he’s back on the ice. (Barry Trotz said it will be until mid- to late March.) \n“It went viral fast,” Nicolas said of his Instagram photo. “I was amazed.” \nLast week, the Wall Street Journal published a story about people climbing into late-model sedans after mistaking them for Ubers. Nicolas said his car, which his friend was driving Sunday, has been mistaken for an Uber before. \n“I can see why,” he said. “I’m assuming [Burakovsky] ordered an UberBLACK, which are the nicer cars.” sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:50:49.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
