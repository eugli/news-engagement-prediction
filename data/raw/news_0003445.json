Bulk aid or bulk subsidy results in much leakage and injustice. \n\"Who benefits from oil subsidy? Those who own big cars benefit more, the tourists benefit, the migrant workers benefit,\" he said. \nUrban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Minister and Selangor Barisan Nasional chairperson Noh Omar, Education Minister Mahdzir Khalid and Kuala Selangor MP Irmohizam Ibrahim were also present at the event. \nNajib said that if the government could save on oil subsidy, it would be able to use the savings to provide other targeted subsidies for the people. \nOn the second approach, the BN chairperson said the government opted for its leaders to interact with the people without being bound by strict protocol as in the past. \n\"Even today (during the visit to Sekolah Kebangsaan Ijok), I was welcomed by the people, not with the red carpet and 'bunga manggar' protocol but the sincere enthusiasm of the people. \n\"This is what I prefer, the sincere welcome of the people,\" he said. \nNajib hit out at the opposition for criticising the government every time fuel prices went up when the rise was actually determined by market forces, but remained silent when the government was able to help raise the palm oil price to RM3,300 per tonne. \nHe said the rise in the palm oil price resulted from his visit to China in October last year, when China agreed to increase the purchase of the commodity from Malaysia. \n\"The price of palm oil rose to RM3,300 per tonne, the price of rubber also tripled. I enquired from a retired teacher who has four hectares of oil palm. He is now earning RM4,000 net a month,\" he said. \nNajib also announced an allocation of RM1.5million to develop the Malaysian Fisheries Development Authority of Malaysia jetty in Kampung Sungai Sembilang as a major agro-tourism hub for the country. \nKuala Selangor had huge potential in agro-tourism which could greatly benefit not only the fishermen there but all the constituents, he said. \n\"We have to change our mindset to rejuvenate our area. For example, I have provided an allocation of RM1.5 million to develop the Sungai Sembilang jetty as a fishermen's hub. The fishermen can sell their catch instead of going through middlemen. \n\"This will double the income of the fishermen.\" \nAt the event, Najib also launched a National Transformation 2050 (TN50) monument at Sekolah Kebangsaan Ijok as a gesture symbolising the government's vision for the next 30 years. \nThe prime minister also visited a single mother, Mariamah Haji Yaakob, 70, at her home in Kampung Jalan Kemajuan, Batu 8, Ijok, and presented essential goods. \nHe said he had instructed Irmohizam to look into other forms of aid, including replacing the old zinc roof of Mariamah's house. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:26:55.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
