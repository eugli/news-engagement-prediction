Credit: PA \nToday is in some ways without consequence. \nNo policy is being decided today and nothing irrevocable is happening. \nBut in other ways it is hugely important, once again opening up fault lines in the Church of England. \nIt is a hideously complex constitutional process, and looking for change in the Church of England is like watching paint dry. A delegate walks past activists outside the General Synod at Church House in London. Credit: PA \nBut today's debate about the bishops' report comes down to whether the Church's attitude towards same sex relationships - both in the clergy and in the LGBT community generally - is changing fast enough. \nThe LGBT community within and outside the church has been angered by the bishops' report. \nFor them, it doesnâ€™t even start to go far enough. \nThe tone towards LBGT people may have changed, but essentially they believe that the discrimination against them remains with no proposal for same sex marriage, and not enough acceptance of gay clergy.

It tends to creep up incrementally on those who are busy discussing how much they are opposed to it.
