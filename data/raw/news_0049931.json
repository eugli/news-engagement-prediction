Malaysian police \"pinned the suspicion on us and targeted the investigation against it.\" A still image taken from security footage appears to show a man purported to be Kim Jong Nam (circled in red) being accosted by a woman in a white shirt at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia on Feb. 13. FUJITV / via Reuters TV \nThe entire investigation has been \"politicized by Malaysia in collusion\" with North Korea's bitter enemy, South Korea, he said. \nMalaysia then responded with its own fury, with a foreign ministry statement saying the ambassador's allegations were \"culled from delusions, lies and half-truths\" and denying any collusion with Seoul. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the investigation had proceeded properly. \nMalaysia has no reason to \"want to do something that would paint North Koreans in a bad light,\" he told reporters. \"But we will be objective and we expect them to understand that we apply the rule of law in Malaysia.\" \nExperts remained unsure about the diplomatic fallout from the killing and the increasingly incendiary language. \nIn the short run things are clearly rocky. Malaysia has recalled its ambassador from Pyongyang \"for consultations,\" and called in the North Korean ambassador to explain his comments about the investigation.

While trade between North Korea and Malaysia totaled just $5.1 million in 2015, that's a serious number in a country that exported just $3.1 billion in goods in 2014, and imported just $3.9 billion.
