Congress,' she teased, linking to an editorial from the Kansas City Star that said just that .\n'Representing the people means showing up, even when the exchange may not be among friends,' the paper's editorial board said.\nDuring the campaign, now President Donald Trump had made his raucous rallies a positive talking point, while mocking the poor attendance of Clinton's events.\nNow, he was grumbling over the widely-attended town halls, tweeting about them yesterday and questioning their legitimacy, as activists' antics at the meet-and-greets have been pre-planned.\n'The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists,' he wrote on Twitter Tuesday night, finishing the statement off with his trademark, 'Sad!'\nMany Republican lawmakers have seen their congressional town halls swarmed by protesters in recent weeks, with anti-Trump activists urging people especially to make their voices heard this week when members of Congress are in their home districts.\nFor example, Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, had to be escorted by police out of an event the last time he appeared before constituents.\nYesterday, he encountered protesters at a town hall event again. And tired were found slashed on cars parked outside his rowdy Q&A session, after the fact, according to Politico's account .\nScroll down for video\nHillary Clinton resurfaced today to tweet in support of protesters taking over congressional town hall - and shame members of Congress unwilling to face constituents\nHillary Clinton, seen at an Oscar de la Renta last week in New York, pointed to an editorial by the Kansas City Star, which advocated for members of Congress to attend town halls\nRep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, needed a police escort to escape his last town hall. He tried again Tuesday and stood before a combative audience, while someone slashed the tires of attendees outside the venue\nPresident Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the protests taking place all over the country this week by pointing out they were 'planned out by liberal activists'\nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter yesterday and called the protests 'Sad!' and the crowds 'so-called angry'\nToday during the White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested that town hall attendees are people, coming from the grass roots, who are upset with the president, but also protesters paid to be there by special interests, what's called 'astro-turfing' in the political world.\n'Some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there,' Spicer said. 'But obviously there are people who are upset, but I also think that when you look at some of these districts and some of these things, that it is not representative of a member's district.'\nThe protests' planners haven't been shy about the fact that they're organized, but pushed back against any astro-turfing allegations.\nA new group made up of former Congressional staffers, called Indivisible Guide, launched in December and is providing activists with 'training manuals,' such as how to have a 'successful' town hall, what questions to ask lawmakers and how to track 'missing' members of Congress down.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer acknowledged that the town halls were being attended by some authentically angry constituents, though suggested there were 'professional' protesters coming to yell at Republican members of Congress too\nLOUISIANA: Sen. Bill Cassidy faced an angry crowd Wednesday, with one man being escorted out of the room\n'The overwhelming thing that we've heard is that this is the first time so many Indivisible group members have been politically active â€“ up until the election of Donald Trump they had never called their member of Congress or attended a town hall,' Sarah Dohl, a board member for the group, told DailyMail.com.\n'What we've seen over the past several weeks is Americans showing up to make their voices heard on issues we should all be concerned about,' she added.\nIndivisible's guides are happily being shared by other groups on the left, including President Barack Obama's Organizing for Action and Priorities USA Action, the Democrats' biggest super PAC, which benefited losing nominee Hillary Clinton in the last cycle.\nThis week's efforts are being labeled #ReclaimRecess, with President Bill Clinton's former labor secretary, Robert Reich, even filming a PSA explaining what to do.\n'This is your chance to show Trump's agenda faces a powerful resistance,' Reich said in the spot. 'The resistance has already begun and has serious momentum.'\nYesterday protesters also overwhelmed a veterans town hall with Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.\nIOWA: Sen. Joni Ernst, a rising Republican star, was told by constituents out a crowded town hall meeting that this was her 'last term!'\nVIRGINIA: Republican Rep. Scott Taylor's town hall in Virginia Beach was attended by several hundred constituents who asked him questions about President Donald Trump\nKENTUCKY: While Sen. Mitch McConnell was at a Chamber of Commerce lunch, 1,000 people gathered outside with signs (pictured) - while inside, some asked him questions\nThey shouted 'your last term!' as she entered the room, according to Twitter accounts , and asked questions about Russia's interference in the U.S. election.\nIn Virginia, Rep. Scott Taylor's town hall in Virginia Beach attracted numbers in the hundreds as constituents asked the Republican lawmaker questions about Russia as well.\nHe also took queries about the president's unreleased tax returns and the swift dismissal of national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\n'I'm frustrated, I'm angry, I'd rather be at home with my children doing the family thing, but I'm here because this is important,' one constituent, Chelsea Ballard, told the local ABC affiliate 13News .\nAn even bigger crowd of about 1,000 greeted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as he attended an Anderson County Chamber of Commerce luncheon held at an American Legion post.\nThe Senate's top Republican delivered a curt, 'thank you for your speech,' after being asked about a mission in Yemen, which left one Navy Seal dead, and whether the new president should face impeachment for it, according to the account in the Louisville Courier-Journal .\nEven members of Congress who decided against holding a town hall this week weren't spared.\nTEXAS: While Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, was attending a closed-door meeting at a restaurant, protesters gathered outside and unfurled a giant banner\nActivists decorated milk jugs with the visage of their 'MISSING' Republican lawmaker, Rep. Paul Cook, who they say hasn't held a town hall meeting since 2013\nFor instance, Indivisible members shamed Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, by showing up outside a private event where he was speaking and chanted, 'a phone call, is not a town hall.'\nThey unfurled a giant banner that read: 'Please Meet with Us.'\nA Twitter account was created to track down Rep. Paul Cook, R-Calif., who activists said hadn't attended a public town hall since 2013.\nYesterday, they posted a picture of milk jugs with his 'MISSING' picture on the side of it, for greater effect.\nIn Reich's PSA for Indivisible he encouraged these kinds of attention-getting tactics.\n'If they refuse to hold a town hall, hold your own and invite them,' he said. 'If your representative doesn't attend, bring a cardboard cut-out or an empty chair and let your local media know that your member of Congress didn't have the courage to show up and face constituents,' he stated.\nUsing Trump's favorite adjective, it's the town hall no-shows, that Dohl, a member of Indivisible's leadership team, called 'sad.'\n'The only thing that's sad about the local activism we're seeing is that so many members of Congress refuse to meet with their constituents face to face,' she said.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://twitter.com/IAStartingLine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/WhereIsPaulCook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/mitch-mcconnell/2017/02/21/protesters-greet-sen-mitch-mcconnell-heated-questions/98188380/", "http://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2017/02/while-many-republicans-duck-protesters-mcclintock-keeps-asking-for-more-109768?cmpid=sf", "https://kansascity.relaymedia.com/amp/opinion/editorials/article134098414.html", "http://www.13newsnow.com/news/politics/rep-scott-taylor-hosts-packed-town-hall-in-va-beach/409773813"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:20:10.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
