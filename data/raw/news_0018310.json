The centre-left Social Democratic Party has a parliamentary majority with a junior partner. President Klaus Iohannis then needs to sign off on the legislation.\nThis protester near the presidential residence on Sunday holds a placard that reads: 'Iohannis, don't forget, Romania is not your country,' in reference to centre-right President Klaus Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 on an anti-graft platform. (Daniel Mihailescu/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe country's Constitutional Court is still scheduled to rule on the legality of the original decree. It decriminalized official misconduct if the funds involved were worth less than 200,000 leu ($62,000 Cdn), which critics said would just encourage officials to steal on the job up to that point.\nGrindeanu said the draft should respect the court's rulings, European directives and Romania's criminal code.\nRomania rocked by protests over new graft law Protesters demonstrated over the ordinance for a sixth straight day Sunday in the capital, Bucharest. The vast majority have expressed anger that the measure watered down the country's fight against corrupt officials, including the leader of the ruling Social Democrats' party.\nFor the first time, several hundred people rallied Sunday in support of the government outside the presidential palace.\nIn an abrupt about-face, Grindeanu said Saturday he would repeal the decree at an emergency meeting because he didn't want to \"divide Romania ... Romania in this moment seems broken in two.\"\nLiviu Dragnea, head of the ruling Social Democrats, is one of those who could have benefited from the decree. He is banned by law from serving as prime minister because he was handed a two-year prison sentence in April 2016 for vote-rigging.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-05T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:48:30.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
