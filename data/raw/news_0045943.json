US special operations forces are embedded with some Iraqi units and thousands of US troops are in Iraq providing logistical and other support.\nMeanwhile, US defence secretary Jim Mattis was holding discussions with US and Iraqi officials, a week before he is expected to present a new strategy to President Donald Trump for defeating the Islamic State group.\n\"We're going to make certain that we've got good situational awareness of what we face as we work together and fight alongside each other,\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him.\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to eliminate the group but has provided few details about how his approach might differ from that of the Obama administration, which had partnered with Syrian and Iraqi forces to drive ISIL, also known as ISIS, out of several towns and cities.\nThe battle for western Mosul, the group's last major urban bastion in Iraq, is expected to be the most daunting yet.\nThe streets are older and narrower in that sector of the city, which stretches west from the Tigris River, forcing Iraqi soldiers to leave the relative safety of their armoured vehicles.\nWATCH: Will latest Iraqi offensive mean end of ISIL in Mosul? \nThe presence of up to 750,000 civilians also poses a challenge.\nTwo suicide car bombers struck army and paramilitary forces west of Mosul on Monday, killing and wounding a number of troops, two army officers said, without specifying the number of casualties.\nA third suicide car bomber was blown up before reaching the troops, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media.\nISIL claimed responsibility for two attacks in an online statement, saying the attackers were British and Iraqi.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:07:23.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
