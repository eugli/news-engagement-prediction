Party threatening thousands of job losses, threatening unpaid days off for people across our province,\" said Wotherspoon.\nPremier Brad Wall says cuts to revenue sharing, urban parks on table when dealing with $1.2B deficit Mandatory unpaid days off 'more palatable' than layoffs for public employees, says Sask. finance minister​ \"If the numbers were ready to be released, we would release [the update] tomorrow,\" Finance Minister Kevin Doherty said. \"We're not hiding anything.\"\nDoherty said that the update is just not ready yet, as numbers are still being compiled and consolidated.\nDoherty said the $1.2-billion deficit estimate is likely close to what will be released next month. (Trent Peppler/CBC)\nCrop insurance claims, totalling approximately $500,000, have been a factor in the delay as the numbers weren't available at the mid-year point, he added. About 1.2 million acres of crops remain unharvested, Doherty estimated.\nAs of right now, the $1.2-billion deficit that was estimated earlier in the year is still where the government stands, but the numbers aren't finalized yet.\nPolitical Panel: Trial balloons and tribulations as budget nears Could Sask. tax its way out of a $1.2B deficit? (Yes, but you will pay and pay) Doherty said the current estimate includes the Workers' Compensation Board payments and federal funds for the dam transfer and maintenance compensation, which have not yet been received by the provincial government.\nThe government said it will provide those numbers when it releases its new budget, next month.\nIt said now that it has changed its public accounting — from a narrow look at the general revenue fund to much broader summary statements — it is impractical to provide a third-quarter update just a month ahead of its March budget.\nThe budget is set to be tabled in the legislature on March 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:53:15.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
