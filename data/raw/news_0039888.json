Reuters \nThe Finnish government has announced that it will boost its wartime troops by 20% amid heightened tensions with Russia. \nA defence report said its force will grow from 230,000 to 280,000 troops in a bid to \"improve the capability to defend the entire territory of the country\" at a time when the security \"in Finland’s vicinity has deteriorated.\" \nFinland will also increase its annual military spending by €55 million (£47 million) over the next three years and by €150 million from 2021 onwards. \nThe report details how, over the past year following the conflict in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, military tension in the Baltic Sea region has meant \"insecurity has grown far and wide.\" \nIt also expressed particular concerns about Russia's increasingly threatening stance. Finland shares a 1,340-kilometres-long border with Russia. \n\"Russia aims to strengthen its great-power status, and it has expressed the goal of a sphere-of-influence based security regime,\" it said. \"It has demonstrated the ability to take swift strategic decisions and to employ coordinated military force and a wide range of other instruments in pursuing its objectives.\" \nFinland stressed that EU member states and the military alliance would \"intensify and deepen their defence cooperation.\" Finland and Sweden have increased cross-country military cooperation, as well as cooperation with NATO over the past few months as east-west tensions flared up and NATO’s presence in the Baltic Sea region increased. \nIn October 2016, Finland and the United States signed a bilateral defence cooperation pact pledging closer military collaboration as Finland grew increasingly worried of Russia's activities in the Baltic Sea region. \nRelations between Russia and Europe have been increasingly deteriorating since the Ukraine crisis and, according to the New York Times, Moscow also secretly deployed an operational ground-launched cruise missile unit of a type that contravenes a 1987 US-Russia arms control treaty, which could lead to a new arms race in Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:43:54.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
