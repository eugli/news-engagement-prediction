The series was slated to arrive on Apple Music this year, but the trailer doesn’t give an exact date, specifying only that it’s coming soon. The company ordered 16 episodes of the show last year, spinning the concept off from the wildly successful segment originally featured on the Late Late Show with James Corden . Corden appears in several scene in the trailer, shown singing along with Will Smith, but he won’t be hosting every episode of the Apple Music-bound show. Instead, each episode will feature a new host paired with another celebrity, joining odd couples like Shaquille O’Neal and John Cena, and Metallica and Billy Eichner. As the trailer shows, the action will also step outside of the car, taking music, movie, and sports stars into bakeries, laundromats, and basketball courts.
