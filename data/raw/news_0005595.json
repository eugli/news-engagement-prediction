And, since Apple lumps the Apple Watch lumped into its “Other Products” category when it reports earnings, there hasn’t been much transparency around unit sales to date. \nIt’s also worth noting that revenue from this “Other Products” category, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and accessories (dongles!), was down 8 percent year over year, to around $4 billion. \nLate last year, research firm IDC estimated a decline in year-over-year sales for Apple Watch , prompting Cook to refute the report in an email to Reuters . \nThat said, even if Apple Watch is just the “ billion dollar business” that Apple has said it is, it’s still doing better than many of its wearable tech competitors at the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:57:31.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
