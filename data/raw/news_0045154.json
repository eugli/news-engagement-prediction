He was 73. \nStubblefield, a session drummer best known for his work with James Brown, held down the beat on dozens of iconic songs such as “Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud),” “I Got The Feelin’” and “Funky Drummer,” the last of which fueled a musical revolution. \nStubblefield’s breakbeat on “Funky Drummer” resonated across decades, and generations. \nSharon Jones, Grammy-nominated soul and funk singer, dead at 60 \nRecorded in 1969, the song contains a deceptively simple drum solo featuring an eight-beat rhythm. \nMore than five minutes into the recording, James Brown tells his band that he wants “to give the drummer some of this funky soul we got going here.” Clyde Stubblefield (Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Guitar Center) \nHe tells Stubblefield, “You don’t have to do no soloing, brother, just keep what you got … don’t turn it loose, ’cause it’s a mother.” \nThe other players drop out and Stubblefield lays into the beat. \nButch Trucks, Allman Brothers Band drummer, dead at 69 \nThe break was rediscovered in the mid-’80s by hip hop heads, and used as the underlying, head-bobbing base for tracks from the likes of Run DMC, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, L.L. Cool J and others. \nThe snare pop is instantly recognizable in songs such as “Run’s House,” “Fight The Power,” “Shadrach,” “F*** Tha Police,” “Freedom! ’90,” “Mama Said Knock You Out” and hundreds of others. \nStubblefield’s wife, Jody Hannon, said the drummer died of kidney failure at a Madison, Wis., hospital on Saturday. She said he had been suffering from kidney disease for 10 years, and had been hospitalized for a few days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:05:23.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
