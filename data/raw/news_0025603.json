Today's top news stories - February 10 \nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the snub came complete with a crying emoji. \nMegan Dixon, 18, applied for a part-time waitressing job at Miller & Carter in Enderby, Leicester, in the UK. \nAfter her interview, she says assistant manager Shantel Wesson told her to expect an email response within a few days. \nInstead, she received a text message immediately after leaving the interview, abruptly worded: “It’s a no x”. \nWhen the A-grade student asked for feedback, she was told: “Just not engaging. And answers were ‘like’ basic” – followed by the emoji. \n“She didn’t even shake my hand, didn’t have my CV out and was just sat drinking a coffee,” Megan told The Sun. \n“Maybe because I’m 18 she thinks it’s OK not to be professional with me? I don’t know.” \"Fire-nado\" caught on video in outback WA \nA spokeswoman for Miller & Carter said: “We can’t apologise enough to Megan. \n“It was never our intention to be disrespectful or upset her in any way. The texts were sent in error and were intended for our manager, not the candidate. \n“We are taking this extremely seriously and will be investigating to ensure it never happens again.” Megan Dixon said she was shocked to receive the flippant response to her interview.
