That’s how much I love Rihanna. \nWhich is why I’ll be tuning in to the new season of “Bates Motel” this month, which premiered February 20 on A&E. \nFans of the show will already know Rihanna is set to star in this fifth and final season as Marion Crane, the character Norman Bates kills in the infamous shower scene from the 1960 film, “Psycho.” \nIn the original, actress Janet Leigh played Marion and Anthony Perkins played Norman. Giphy \nThe first four seasons of “Bates Motel” were a prequel to the 1960 classic, but with Rihanna entering the picture as Marion in this new trailer for the upcoming season released Tuesday, it seems like we’re looking at some crossover from the original plot. Rihanna appears in racy scene in upcoming episode of Bates Motel To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In the trailer, Rihanna shows up at the Bates Motel. Mistake number one. A&E She tells Norman (Freddie Highmore) while checking in that she’s been to the motel before. A&E That’s a deviation from the original plot, so maybe RihRih has a chance to live after all. A&E Apparently, she was there with her boyfriend Sam Loomis. And they did normal girlfriend ‘n boyfriend stuff in the room. A&E As it turns out, Norman was watching them. A&E Oh, and he also dresses up and pretends to be his mother now. A&E \nSo yeah, this final season of “Bates Motel” is going to be hella creepy, but undoubtedly worth it. Because if all else fails, it has Rihanna. \nOnly the first episode of season five is out so far, and no sign of Rihanna yet. But we also got a glimpse of the 29-year-old singer in an earlier teaser for the season. Rihanna needs to get a room in trailer for Bates Motel season 5 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nI think there’s one thing we know with certainty: Drake is somewhere right now suddenly feeling the urge to catch up on “Bates Motel.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:46:06.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
