It’s all part of a $60 million transformation.\n“We'll be welcoming first-to-market exclusive food market, as well as the addition of a 65,000 square foot Sportchek location,” says Bri-Ann Stuart, general manager of the mall.\nTaking up almost half of the 130,000 square feet of renovated space, the mall hopes to offer something similar to Toronto’s St. Lawrence Market.\nThe market will include specialty cheeses, fresh produce, a bakery, a juice bar, a butcher and fish monger.\nThe goal is to keep loyal customers and reel in new ones by offering everyone a fresh chance to explore.\n“We really want to understand the trends and the customer has spoken and it's food and beverage. It’s going to be best-in-class with a focus on quality,” she says.\nLong-time shoppers say it's about time.\n“It's very exciting to know that I might be able to buy a head of lettuce, some apples, some good healthy food and not wait till my weekend grocery trip,” says Lisa Heckbert.\n“I'm glad to see it going back to the way it should so hallelujah,” says Helen Woodhead.\nThe market area will face Yonge Street and include restaurants. Construction work is ahead of schedule.\nThe ownership group say they expect to have things ready for 2018.\nPhotos Construction is underway at Upper Canada Mall on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017 in Newmarket, Ont. as the mall looks to welcome a food market.
