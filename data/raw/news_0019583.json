It was not an accident. It was not a technicality,” the prosecutor said.\n“The entire police department carried a black eye because of his actions.”\nIn opting not to give the 21-year CPD veteran jail time for perjury, official misconduct and obstruction of justice, Coghlan noted that losing his job and pension was punishment in itself.\nThe judge also took into consideration the kind words of Pruente’s fiancee, relatives and colleagues who described the 55-year-old as a devoted father of four who rescued residents from burning buildings and stood by his friend’s side as he battles a rare blood cancer.\nIn asking for leniency, that friend —Tom Benson — told Coghlan, “Bill needs to be free and back out helping others.”\nPruente, Chicago Police Sgt. James Padar, Chicago Police Officer Vince Morgan and James Horn, then a Glenview officer, testified at a March 31, 2014 hearing that Sperling was handcuffed after he retrieved his driver’s license, they smelled marijuana in his car and they found drugs inside, prosecutors said.\nBut video footage from a squad car at the scene contradicted that testimony, showing that Sperling, of Glenview, was arrested before his car was searched, prosecutors said.\nThe video footage later prompted a Cook County judge to dismiss charges against Sperling.\nCoghlan cleared Padar and Horn of any wrongdoing in December, saying the pair had limited interaction with Sperling that day.\nMorgan pleaded to a misdemeanor attempted obstruction of justice charge in September and was sentenced to a year of probation, court records show.\nMorgan has since retired and Horn was fired from his department.\nPruente is currently on administrative duties, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Friday. But Pruente’s lawyer Colleen Daly noted in court that he would be losing the job he loved.\nPruente declined comment following his sentencing hearing.\nIn September, Sperling was charged in a deadly hit-and-run crash in Morton Grove that claimed the life of 48-year-old Denise Cavada, according to reports.\nSperling, now 26, is awaiting trial in Skokie on charges of aggravated DUI, reckless homicide and failure to report an accident.\nPreviously from Chicago News Unarmed man shot by Amtrak police now paralyzed, family says Man charged with sending more than 1M spam emails # chicago-police William Pruente glenview", "external_links": ["http://wp.me/p7fJAs-22V8", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gavel1.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/unnamed9-e1486757945501.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/northcentershootingfatal.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/torturemugshots010517.jpg?w=100"], "published": "2017-02-11T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:09:50.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
