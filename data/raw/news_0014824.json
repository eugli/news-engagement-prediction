A crestfallen Shapovalov, tipped as future Grand Slam champion due to his athletic all court game, was shepherded off the court by his captain Martin Laurendeau with a towel over his head. The incident was slightly comparable to that early in Tim Henman's career, when he was defaulted from Wimbledon after accidentally pole-axing a ballgirl when he smashed a ball away in the heat of the moment. The celebrations among the 250 travelling British fans were distinctly muted while the home crowd of around 6,000 melted away. There were a few boos but there could be no argument. Shapovalov rushed across to Gabas to check that he was ok after the ball hit him in the face After Gabas was hit in the eye, the tie was defaulted meaning Britain beat Canada 3-2 The 17-year-old Shapovalov was visibly stunned by his mistake, which cost Canada the tie Shapovalov is the reigning junior Wimbledon champion and tipped as a star of the future Shapovalov (left) had his match with Kyle Edmund defaulted, handing Britain a 3-2 win Edmund had admirably stared down the ordeal that can be playing a deciding rubber in the Davis Cup and it already looked like he would carry Great Britain through to this year's quarter finals. Great Britain now face an away trip to neighbouring tennis powerhouse France in early April with the hope that Andy Murray, who absented himself after the disappointment of the Australian Open, will be back. Earlier Dan Evans's recent run of pulling through tight situations had been brought to a halt by the hugely determined Pospisil, who seemed to have miraculously recovered from the knee problems he had been complaining about. The Canadian repeatedly pulled out big serves when he needed them and was able to come back from 3-1 down in both the first and fourth sets, having looked spent in the latter. Shapovalov allowed his frustrations to get the better of him in the tie As the anger boiled over, Shapovalov decided to hit the tennis ball away in anger The Canadian lashes the ball away, unintentionally in the direction of the umpire It was more a case of Pospisil playing above himself than the other way round, although Evans did tend to feed his stronger forehand side too often. And so a month which has seen him play Roger Federer in Perth, reach the ATP final in Sydney and the fourth round of the Australian Open ended in disappointment. Evans, who missed a break point at 4-4 in the fourth and went on to lose the last tiebreak 7-5, afterwards said he would be pulling out of his next scheduled tournament, in Montpellier, to rest after his recent exertions. 'I'm going to withdraw, it's too much tennis for now. I'll play in Dubai (later this month) and then I'm in the draw for Masters events at Indian Wells and Miami. It's better to be fresh for them. I'm pretty sore right now. 'I've come through a lot of close matches lately but I couldn't today. He served so well on the big points, my conversion rate must have been diabolical. 'He has been playing terribly recently but that's as well as I've seen him play. The court suited him down to the ground but they can do what they want.'
