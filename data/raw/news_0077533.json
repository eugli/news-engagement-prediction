They killed an animal that only entertained us.” \nZoo director Vladan Henriquez said at a news conference that the hippo was covered with bruises and puncture wounds after apparently being attacked with metal bars, knives and rocks. 'We fear soldiers more than gangsters': El Salvador's 'iron fist' policy turns deadly Read more \nThe attack occurred last week, sometime Tuesday night. But zookeepers did not discover the hippo’s injuries until Thursday because he did not leave his pool. Gustavito died of the injuries late Sunday. \nJustice minister Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde said an investigation had been opened. \nEl Salvador is one of the world’s most violent countries , recording 5,278 homicides last year, or an average of 14 people killed per day. Most of the killings have been blamed on powerful street gangs. \nGustavito was born and raised in Guatemala, but was brought to El Salvador 13 years ago. \n“We’re angry,” said Carmen Rogel, who often brings her grandson to the zoo. “We didn’t know they had killed Gustavito and were surprised when we arrived and the gate was closed.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:10:51.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
