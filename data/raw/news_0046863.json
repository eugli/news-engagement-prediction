Emma Watson, who will play Belle in the live-action version of hit 1991 Disney animated film by the same name, is the star of the video as she sings the classic song Belle. \nShe dons the same blue dress the animated princess wore in the original song, with the same gorgeous brown hair as she greets the baker and wonders if there is ‘something more than this provincial life’. \nThe look and feel of the scene is much like the old film itself. Emma, however, does bring a flavour of teenage carefreeness and a more human body language rather than the perfect grace of the animated Belle.

See full cast here \nThe opening number shows Belle walk through her small French village, buying bread and on her way to the library. She is met by the many watchful eyes of the village folk who find her behaviour peculiar. She is the only one who reads in the village and dreams of a better life beyond what is being offered to her. \nIn the original Beauty And The Beast, Belle is abducted by a beast who is a prince under a curse. Slowly, as she gets to know him better, they fall in love with each other. \nWatch the original song here: tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:59:54.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
