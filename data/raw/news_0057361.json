Those are the prospective winners at the Takhini Hot Pools hair-freezing contest that have captured the attention of many through the Internet.\nAndrew Umbrich, owner of the hot pools just outside of Whitehorse, says the competition started off in 2011 as a small event that took place over a few weeks every February during the annual Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous Festival. But things got a bit hairy in 2015 when a few people from France and one person from Quebec submitted a video of some fantastic frozen hair.\nBefore then, the coiffure competition would only see about 10 contestants a year, but so far this year they’ve had 35 photo submissions and Umbrich said they expect many more.\nConditions need to be just right, he said. While the hot springs are always around 42 Celsius, the air has to get at least minus 20 to get the right ice sculpt.\n  “It’s still possible to freeze your hair at (warmer) temperatures, but it just takes a lot longer.”\nBeards and long locks are best for sculpting, he said, because they allow for ice-covered hair styles that can resemble anything from a Mohawk to Medusa with a frosted coating.\nGetting the exact coif take some skill and a bit of experimentation, Umbrich said.\n“When you’re sitting in 42-degree water, there’s a lot of steam coming up. And when it’s minus 20, 30, 40, the steam is even more pronounced.\n“First you wet your hair and all that steam gathers on your wet hair and it freezes very quickly when it meets the minus-40 air.”\nThe contest runs all winter, on any day it’s cold enough, and the winner is announced about mid-March. ( Manuel Sidler/THE CANADIAN PRESS ) In the right conditions it takes from 10 to 15 minutes for hair to freeze.\n“Some people even use a bit of snow to accelerate it,” he added.\nUmbrich said he’s never heard complaints of hair breaking or getting damaged, and the frosty coating disappears the moment it’s dunked back in the water.\nOf course, the disadvantages are that it can be cold out of the water, especially for your ears, he said.\n“But all they do is just dip their ear in the water. Other than that, you’re in 42-degree water. If anything, you might be too hot.”\nThe first-place winner gets $750 and a complementary 30-soak membership, while second and third place get $200 and $100 respectively, along with complementary passes.\nThe contest runs all winter, on any day it’s cold enough, and the winner is announced about mid-March.\nUmbrich and his wife decide the winners, based on the most inventive frozen bouffant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:59:06.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
