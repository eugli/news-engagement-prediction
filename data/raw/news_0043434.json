PUBLISHED: 12:36, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 12:59, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 GETTY/AFP Emmanuel Macron will use his anti-Brexit speech to win the vote of French people living in the UK \nEmmanuel Macron's tough anti-Brexit message to be delivered in London today is part of an offensive that he hopes will win over some 300,000 plus French voters living in Britain. \nMany fear the future after UK withdrawal, and will pack Westminster Central Hall this afternoon to seek reassurances from the 39-year-old independent. \nMr Macron said last week: “If your government decides to organise a Brexit, I will be pretty tough on it.” Related articles Macron brings his campaign to LONDON as he eyes up French expat votes \nThe former investment banker told Channel 4 News: “We have to preserve the rest of the European Union , and not convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequences.” \nLondon has attracted huge numbers of French workers in recent years, including many working in the financial sector. \nMr Macron has pledged to ensure that they are not turned into pawns by Britain as it negotiates its way out of the EU. GETTY Macron is the favourite to become the new president of France \nHe is particularly insistent that there will be no EU passport and 'no access to the single market' for the British after a hard Brexit , adding: “It is not a matter of punishing but of being consistent with such a decision.” It is not a matter of punishing but of being consistent Emmanuel Macron \nThe latest IFOP opinion poll in France has Mr Macron coming second to far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of the presidential elections in April, and then crushing her by 61.5 per cent to 38.5 in the second round in May. \nFrench people registered to vote abroad can cast their ballot in the presidential poll, and most in London are members of France's northern Europe parliamentary constituency. \nMr Macron has raised millions of pounds worth of campaign funds from overseas events, and is set to meet some 'big names' today, so as to boost his profile, according to aides.

(On the move!), Macron's new progressive movement said: “Emmanuel has a huge number of supporters in France. \n“He is offering a dynamic, pro-Europe outlook aimed to appeal to those who have had enough of the cynicism of other politicians.” \nMs Le Pen is currently at the centre of a corruption enquiry involving alleged fake jobs, as is the conservative Republican candidate Francois Fillon, who employed his Wales born wife, Penelope, on a lucrative taxpayer-funded contract while she allegedly did nothing at all. GETTY Marine Le Pen has become embroiled in a corruption scandal \nBoth are facing criminal charges before the election, and are also extremely close to Russia, which is said to be launching cyber attacks against Mr Macron Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's foreign minister, said at the weekend: “It's enough just to look at the candidates - Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon - for whom Russia is expressing preferences, while Emmanuel Macron, who has a very pro-European stance, is undergoing cyber attacks. \n'This form of interference in French democratic life is unacceptable and I condemn it.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:06:07.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
