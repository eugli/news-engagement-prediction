I CAN’T EVEN BELIEVE WHAT I JUST WATCHED. \nThe 2017 Oscars had one of the craziest endings to an award show I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m still shaking because I can’t get over what just went down. \nAt the end of the 89th Academy Awards, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway (the stars of “Bonnie and Clyde”) presented the award for Best Picture. \nThe nominees included “Arrival,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Hidden Figures,” “Lion,” “Moonlight,” “Fences,” “Hell or High Water,” “La La Land” and “Manchester by the Sea,” with “La La Land” predicted by many to win most of the awards for the night. \nWhile Beatty was presenting, he ended up reading the incorrect envelope and dubbed “La La Land” the winner of the night. \nThe only problem was “Moonlight” actually won. \nBelow, you can see one of the most awkward and uncomfortable moments in awards show history. I am literally cringing because it is so painful to watch. \nHalfway through the acceptance speech for “La La Land,” Warren Beatty explained the card he was given was actually Emma Stone’s Best Actress Award. The moment La La Land realizes Beatty read the wrong winner To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nHe told the audience, \nI opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny. \nThe teleprompter was also incorrect, so the poor man completely messed up, even though it sounds like it wasn’t totally his fault. \nAs Jimmy Kimmel put it, he basically pulled a Steve Harvey. Poor guy. The host joked, \nWarren, what did you do?! \nPOOR WARREN A24 \nCongratulations to the cast and crew of “Moonlight,” by the way. The film was incredible and they are extremely deserving of the award. \nBe sure to check out the full list of nominations here and Elite Daily’s Awards Season page for all Oscars coverage.
