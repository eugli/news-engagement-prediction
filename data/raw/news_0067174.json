A separate tender will be issued for design work on a Topsail Road overpass.\nThe seven-kilometre stretch will allow drivers to complete a route in mere minutes that currently takes much longer.\nWhen the full Team Gushue Highway is completed, it will connect the Outer Ring Road to Pitts Memorial Drive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:58:35.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
