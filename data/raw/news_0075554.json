WhatsApp recently rolled out its ‘Status’ feature allowing users to put images, videos and GIFs as their status. The new update replaced the text form of status with the new Stories-like format.\nHowever, a leaked beta update suggests that the company might bring back the text status form to its application with the next update. A known WhatsApp tipster WABeta Info shared some screenshots on Twitter that indicate WhatsApp might bring the old text statuses back with a new feature dubbed as ‘Tagline’. This feature will enable users to put text and emojis as their status, just like the previous version.\nimage: Twitter @WABeta Info\nThe leaked screengrabs don’t indicate a major change to the app but the new feature will seemingly exist alongside the new Status feature that allows users to post small videos or GIFs as their status. The feature was first seen on Snapchat.\nThe Tagline feature has been spotted by WABetaInfo on the beta version for iPhone, and Windows Phone. The tipster also claims that the feature will also be rolled out for Android. The feature is still hidden in the beta version and there is a possibility that the feature might or might not make it to the app ultimately.\nConsidering that many users were left surprised and disappointed after the company chose to replace the text form of status with a Stories-like feature, the Tagline feature will be a welcome addition. However, users will have to wait for the company to make an official roll out of the new feature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:36:38.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
