As it was, he made the club a profit of £30m - including the £13m sale of Townsend to Palace - and believed he would have that money to reinvest in January.\nBut not a single player arrived last month, despite Benitez handing a list of targets to managing director Lee Charnley as far back as November.\nBenitez is angry with Mike Ashley (right) after believing he would have money to spend\nIf the football's on, it's on Live tables Fixtures Scores Championship Premier League Championship League One League Two Scottish Premiership Scottish Div 1 Scottish Div 2 Scottish Div 3 Ligue 1 Serie A La Liga Bundesliga More tables More fixtures More scores Indeed, Benitez thought they would have been ready to announce a signing on January 1 and he wanted to add both a winger and central midfielder to a squad he believes is still short in key areas.\nIn the end he entered deadline day clinging to the hope of Ashley agreeing to pay the £13m which Palace were asking for Townsend.\nThat he did not has infuriated the 56-year-old - who does not know what has happened to the £30m he generated - and there is a fear that Ashley's mindset has changed in recent months.\nTellingly, chief scout Graham Carr is back on the scene and the 72-year-old sat alongside Ashley at the recent FA Cup tie at Birmingham.\nBenitez, it would appear, is wary of Carr's presence and would prefer to work with his own network of scouts, rather than the man who Ashley employs primarily to sign players under the age of 25 and with sell-on value.\nAll parties, it seems, are on a collision course and supporters are rightly anxious about the possibility of losing Benitez.\nMatt Ritchie and Jonjo Shelvey were on the scoresheet for Newcastle as they drew with QPR\nHe wants to stay and take the club into the top half of the Premier League but he will need promises from Ashley over financial backing if that is to happen.\nBenitez believes he can still win promotion with his current squad - they are second in the table and four points clear of third-placed Reading - but he would want a major overhaul to get them ready for the top-flight.\nWednesday night's 2-2 home draw with QPR exposed their need for fresh blood and Benitez feels they have taken an unnecessary gamble by not strengthening last month.\nFor now, though, he is asking fans to get behind the team and does not want the disappointment of the transfer-window debacle to derail their bid for promotion.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=92172392&iu=/5765/dailymail.uk", "https://pixel.adsafeprotected.com/rfw/st/60025/9852880/skeleton.gif", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/ad/N33505.2292307MAILONLINE_UK_DAW/B9964859.134304502;sz=1x1;ord=", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/js/footballtable-29.0.0-0.min.js", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/306947776;134304502;g", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/css/football_at_glance-29.0.0-0.min.css"], "published": "2017-02-03T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:52:30.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
