(Sports Illustrated) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, February 15, 2017, 12:47 AM \nKate Upton is showing off all her attributes as the new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl. \nThe blond bombshell covers three different versions of the magazine, photographed by Yu Tsai in Fiji. \nOne cover shows Upton in white bikini bottoms with a metallic jacket. Another shows her in a strappy one-piece and the third features gypsy-style bikini bottoms and an elaborate necklace. \nUpton debuted in the magazine in 2011, then graced the cover in both 2012 and 2013. \nIn 2016, Sports Illustrated featured three cover models: Ashley Graham, Ronda Rousey and Hailey Clauson. \n\"I was very excited when (editor MJ Day) asked me to be back in the issue. Especially when this year's theme is about every woman of every age and every body type being accepted. It was inspiring to be asked to be a part of that issue,\" Upton said . The 2017 SI Swimsuit Covers have been revealed. Welcome back, @KateUpton !

Those are the campaigns I want to do and the career I want to have — to inspire women to love themselves. That’s a balance of working hard and eating healthy but also enjoying life and having cheat days and for the emphasis not to be on the ideal perfect body. It makes me proud to be asked back.\" \nShe found out about her cover just a day before the announcement, she told Kimmel. Upton also covered the magazine in 2012 and 2013. (Jordan Strauss/Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \n“It's a full circle moment for us,” Day said . \n“We started Kate in her career, and you know, we watched her grow and become not only this worldwide, superstar phenomenon; she changed the direction of the modeling industry. Kate Upton was really this trailblazer that lead the way for the Ashley Grahams of the world and everything you're seeing happen that's different in fashion right now.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:23:37.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
