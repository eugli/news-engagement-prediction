As seen in the following tweet, the 48-year-old veteran believes such an event would have the fight world buzzing: Roy Jones Jr. @RealRoyJonesJr Roy Jones vs Anderson Silva and Mayweather vs McGregor double headline card UFC invasion. Would be biggest event of all time period 2/23/2017, 12:14:57 AM According to Jack Bezants of the Daily Mail , Jones has long wanted the bout with Silva and believes there is a greater chance of it happening now than in the past: \nIt was so big when it was talked about back then with me, it would have been the biggest fight of my career by far. [UFC President] Dana [White] didn't want to do it, but he's not the owner now. People make decisions usually try to make money for their decisions. These two fighting [Mayweather and McGregor], like me and Silva fighting in a boxing match, will not diminish the UFC brand. Mayweather and McGregor have flirted publicly with boxing each other for much of the past year, and the rumor mill has heated up in recent weeks. Per ESPN.com , McGregor revealed in January that the two sides have been working to make the fight happen: \"That fight is being more than explored. That fight has been in the works for a while now. It's a fight the people want. It's the fight I want.\" Mayweather made it clear that he wants the bout to occur as well: \"The fans want this fight. The fans have been asking for this fight. It's all about entertainment. He's very entertaining. He's very outspoken like myself. So let's give the fans what they want to see.\" While there has been talk of the fight being agreed upon, Mayweather tweeted on Feb. 14 that there is still no deal in place: Floyd Mayweather @FloydMayweather 2/14/2017, 11:27:40 PM Although Mayweather versus McGregor is the big prize, Jones versus Silva is a potential undercard bout that could also generate plenty of interest. Jones was once the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, and he boasts a 65-9 record after knocking out Bobby Gunn on Feb. 17. The 41-year-old Silva is a UFC legend with a career record of 34-8. He recently defeated Derek Brunson at UFC 208 after a five-fight streak that saw him lose four times and take one no-contest. While a fight between Jones and Silva would have been much bigger a decade ago, it would be a natural fit on a card predicated on boxing-MMA crossover.
