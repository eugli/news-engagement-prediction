Rec Super Bowl tickets are expensive. If you’re lucky enough to buy them at face value from an NFL team, they’re expensive. And if you’re not, and you’re buying them on the secondary market, they’re even more expensive. And either way, it’s hard to guarantee a perfect view of the field. Here’s a case in point, from a fan who paid $2,200 to watch the Falcons and Patriots at NRG Stadium in Houston on Sunday: View from the worst seat in the house pic.twitter.com/uUx92AncNJ — Louis Bien (@louisbien) February 5, 2017 The cost of a Super Bowl ticket that only affords you a view of about one-third of the Falcons’ end zone? At least $2,500, in some cases. It’s not clear if that price would’ve gone up slightly if the entire end zone were visible, but it sure could’ve. “At least I’m here,” the fan who held the seat told SB Nation’s Louis Bien. In large part, he’s paying for the atmosphere, not the view of the game. A whole lot of tickets don’t offer better views than the ones provided by Fox’s broadcast cameras, but for some fans, that’s not the point at all.
