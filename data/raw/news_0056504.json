Veronica said:\n“I was elated and angry at the same time when I finally found out.My daughter’s final resting place had been a short bus journey away all this time. I could have grieved properly for my baby at her grave, Instead, I had to fight to find where my baby’s body was. I’m sure there must be other women in my position.”\n– Veronica Thompson.

Veronica, aged 60, said she was led to believe the hospital “disposed” of her remains, she added:\n“It was something you didn’t question, it was a different era back then,” she said. I saw my daughter in the morgue, I had her christened in the hospital and then I was discharged. I was led to believe the hospital disposed of her body, I thought her remains had been incinerated.\"\n– Veronica Thompson.

In December 2012 I got the call from the Women’s Hospital to say they had found my baby 39 years after I lost her. My message to other women who have gone through similar situations is to never give up.”\n– Veronica Thompson.
