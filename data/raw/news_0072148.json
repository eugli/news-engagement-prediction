Since that broadcast, Yiannopoulos — who has been repeatedly accused of peddling in racism and sexism — was barred from speaking at a conservative event, lost a book deal and got fired from his editor post at the far right-wing website Breitbart News after he was exposed of having once defended pedophilia. \nIn an apparent attempt to save face, Maher on Friday night claimed people are overreacting to his decision to put Yiannopoulos on the late night show. \n“This poor guy, this week lost more jobs than Ohio during the recession,” Maher said while conducting an interview with author Fran Lebowitz. Bill Maher and panel member Fran Lebowitz discuss the ongoing drama surrounding Milo Yiannopoulos on Friday. (HBO) \nWhen Lebowitz asked why Yiannopoulos got the boot, Maher tried to change the subject. \n“Let’s not get into it,” he said. “(Yiannopoulos) crossed a line.” \nThe line Yiannopoulos crossed was that he during a radio podcast last year championed pedophilia as something that can give boys as young as 13 “security and safety.” He also said the illegal sexual conduct can provide children with “love and a reliable rock” when they’re unable to talk to their parents. Maher referred to Yiannopoulos as \"this poor guy.\" (Janet Van Ham/AP) \nEarlier this week, Maher was widely rebuked after it became known that he also once defended pedophilia while on his “Politically Incorrect” talk show in 1998, discussing the case of 34-year-old school teacher Mary Letourneau. \nLarry Wilmore tells Milo Yiannopoulos to ‘go f--k' himself \nLetourneau, of Washington, was sentenced to jail after pleading guilty to raping her 12-year-old male student. \n“(Letourneau) is in jail because she is in love. That’s how I view it,” Maher said at the time. “Raped? C’mon, how can a woman rape a man?” Yiannopoulos was fired after a recording revealed he once made light of pedophilia. (Real Time with Bill Maher) \nMaher’s reps have yet to return a request for comment on those remarks. \nAfter declining to go into detail about why Yiannopoulos’ got fired from Breitbart, Maher on Friday claimed that the ex-Breitbart editor is just a “provocateur,” even though he was permanently banned from Twitter for spearheading a racist campaign against an African-American actress, and has become synonymous with the white supremacy-connected alt right movement. \nBill Maher defends booking Milo Yiannopoulos amid backlash \n“What do you think about this whole thing where liberals get so upset?” Maher said. “Yiannopoulos, he’s just a provocateur, he’s just the little brother who puts the spider in his big sister’s tent…That’s all he is and this is hurting us, this is why liberals lose elections.” \nAfter the show, Maher bashed the mainstream media over Twitter for supposedly focusing too much time on unnecessary stories — a move most commonly associated with President Trump, a man Maher usually revels in reproaching. \n\"The news media lost the trust of the American people because they became eyeball-chasing, clickbait wh---s,\" he tweeted .
