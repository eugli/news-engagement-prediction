Actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan who were last seen together in R. Balki's Ki & Ka, will now be seen once again in upcoming Gujarati film Carry On Kesar. The movie has Supriya Pathak and Darshan Jariwala in leads and is directed by Vipul Mehta.\nAn elated Vipul Mehta shares, \"Both Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan plays pivotal role in the film. Supriya Pathak's character Kesar, is a huge fan of Big B and after her marriage to Drashan Jariwala, they go to Mumbai for their honeymoon, only to see Big B, but to no avail. However, when the news of Kesar and her husband having a baby in their 50s' goes viral, Big B and Jaya Bachchan sends them their best wishes through a video, fulfilling Kesar's dream. The couple has also spoken few lines in Gujarati and the audiences will surely remember it for a long time.\"\nQuiz Vipul if it was difficult to get both on board, he quickly chips in, \"Not really. I have worked with Jayaji in many plays. While she agreed to come on board immediately, Amitabhji confirmed in three working days. Both were happy to come on board because they were really touched by the subject and script of the movie.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:29:57.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
