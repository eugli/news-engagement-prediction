There has been so much anticipation over the new restaurant that the word \"PROMISE\" was spray-painted over the \"Coming Soon\" sign on the front of the three-story building.\n\"I came here when it was Monroe's, and fell in love with the basement,\" Cornish Pasty owner Dean Thomas said. \"I took my friends here and told them it was the best bar in Phoenix, and then a couple weeks later, it closed.\"\nCornish Pasty Co. What: Opening first week of March.\nWhere: 3 W. Monroe St., Phoenix.\nDetails: cornishpastyco.com .\nExisting Valley locations: \nMesa: 1941 W. Guadalupe Road. 480-838-3586\nTempe: 960 W. University Drive. 480-894-6261\nScottsdale: 3800 N. Goldwater Blvd. 480-945-1220.\nFrom England to Tempe to Vegas Thomas is a native of Cornwall, England, and founded Cornish Pasty in 2005 with a tiny storefront in Tempe. He has since expanded that location and opened branches in Mesa, Scottsdale and Las Vegas.\nThe restaurant is known for its hand-made pasties, an English dish featuring a flaky pastry pocket filled with meat and vegetables. The eatery features more than 40 kinds of pasties, including vegetarian and vegan options.\n  (Photo: John Samora/The Republic) \nThomas had hoped to introduce downtown Phoenix diners to his signature pasties much sooner than March 2017.\nHe received the keys to the building seven years ago, and signed the lease four years ago. But a seemingly never-ending series of expensive repairs and unexpected obstacles set his team back again and again. Thomas said they only got one loan over the years, and would fund any renovations and construction — three floors, with bars and seating on each — with money made at the other restaurants.\nThe basement seating at Cornish Pasty Co., opening in downtown Phoenix in March.   (Photo: Kellie Hwang) \n\"In the meantime, we opened the Scottsdale and Vegas store, and expanded the Tempe and Mesa stores, so we couldn't keep going with Phoenix,\" he said. \"We've got expensive taste, but not a lot of money.\"\nOriginally, Cornish Pasty was only supposed to take up the basement, formerly Monroe's Food & Fine Spirits, and the small kitchen. But then they decided to take over the small space occupied by a T-shirt shop too. After tearing down the shop and the ceiling, they encountered the rafters that led up to the second story.\nAn aerial view of the main room at Cornish Pasty Co. in downtown Phoenix.   (Photo: Kellie Hwang) \nWhen they got upstairs to look around, there were a series of rooms. One area had old Charlie Chaplain posters, and they were told it was once a movie theater.\n\"There was no existing plumbing, no electricity, and structurally, the city said there was no way they would let 100 people upstairs,\" Thomas recalled. \"We had to reinforce the structure with columns that go down to the basement.\"\nThey also replaced the rafters and added a double layer of flooring. A friend crafted the massive L-shaped bar that snakes around on the top floor. Wooden pub stools, chairs and tables provide plenty of seating upstairs.\nUpstairs of Cornish Pasty Co. in downtown Phoenix.   (Photo: Kellie Hwang) \n'No bad seat in the house' Couches and coffee tables are lined up against the fence overlooking the action on the main floor. Two pool tables and dart boards are further in the back, and more church pews offer booth seating and a view of Central Avenue.\n“There’s no bad seat in the house, so no one is stuck in a corner away from everything,” said Jimmy Downey, Thomas’ business partner.\nDown on the main floor, the airy room overlooks Monroe Street and the small patio. A seating area by the entrance features old church pews converted to booths. The main kitchen is in this space, with ovens in the back and pasty prep stations behind the bar, so customers can watch the savory pastries being made. There's also a to-go window with a limited menu.\nA rail behind the bar provides additional seating, which is up against the staircase leading down to the basement. Throughout the three floors, mismatched antique chandeliers and casino carpet add a vintage feel to the space.\nUpstairs seating area at Cornish Pasty Co. in downtown Phoenix.   (Photo: Kellie Hwang) \nHeading downstairs, visitors will first encounter the cold storage that features a dumbwaiter. It used to be operated with a crank, and is now electrical so employees can prep ingredients and send them up to the main kitchen.\nAround the corner is the original Monroe's bar with weathered wood paneling and copper top. New taps have been installed, and an old wooden refrigerator box is being restored. Black tufted leather booths and banquettes line the main room, and a stained-glass window and exposed brick walls have been salvaged from the old bar.\n\"We wanted to hold onto as much of the original bar as we could,\" Thomas said.\nDetails: Opening at 3 W.
