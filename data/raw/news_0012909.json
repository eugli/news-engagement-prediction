I’m not going to open a door and I’m not going to close a door. All doors are open.” \nSenator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is up for re-election in 2018 but has not announced if he’ll run again after holding the office for 40 years. \n“I’m not looking forward to anything political at the national level,” he added. “We’ve got some races coming up here in Utah that are going to be interesting. We’ll see what happens on that front.” \nRomney had a lot to say about the new president, all of it positive. \nWe’re all watching with interest. He’s obviously gotten off to a very strong start in terms of making a series of executive orders and making the changes that he promised during the campaign. \nHe applauded Trump for proving his critics wrong by staying true to his campaign promises, especially the nomination of a conservative, Judge Gorsuch, to the Supreme Court. He also talked about being passed over for the Secretary of State position in the administration. \n“I had very good meetings with, at that point, President-elect Trump,” Romney said, adding that he was encouraged that Trump “was willing to talk to me, given the fact that I had been so critical.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:46:34.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
