Simon White PerthNow Share on Twitter \nWARNNG: Graphic content may upset some readers. \nDisturbing footage has emerged of a man kicking out twice at a quokka in the courtyard of Rottnest Island accommodation in Western Australia. \nThe video shows the man initially appearing to miss as he swings a boot at a startled quokka, then connecting with a second go â€” sending the animal flying into the front wall of the property. \nAnother man can be heard laughing in the background during the incident which was captured in the nine-second video. \nWA Police have confirmed they are aware of the vision and are seeking more details. It is not clear when the video was filmed. \nIn April 2015, two French tourists spent time in jail after pleading guilty to trying to set a quokka alight at Rottnest. \nThibaud Jean Leon Vallete and Jean Mickael Batrikian were fined $4000 and told they would stay in prison for seven days or until the fine was paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:23:47.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
