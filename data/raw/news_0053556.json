Really, would you expect anything less from the “All About That Bass” and “NO” songstress? No. \nTrainor has been busy teasing “I’m A Lady,” the song she wrote for the upcoming Smurfs: The Lost Village soundtrack. She previously mentioned it at KIISFM’s Jingle Ball in December, saying , “It’s of course a Meghan Trianor, upbeat, love-yourself woman anthem, like I do!” She further described it as a saxophone-driven “banger” that’s “pretty fire,” and it looks like that’s definitely the case, judging by the hints she’s been dropping on Instagram. \nIn one pic, Trainor presides over a boardroom, dressed in a slick business suit. In another, she wears a white top hat while someone from behind the camera observes, “Wow... she looks amazing.” No argument there. \nLook out for Trainor’s “I’m A Lady” when it drops this Friday (February 24).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:11:05.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
