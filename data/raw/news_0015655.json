Obviously, he played the same position I played. I always tried to copy him and do the same in my own game. \n\"I think just the character he had ... he had a massive fighting spirit and a never-say-die attitude. \n\"He would never surrender and that is something that I also strive for ... not just in my playing career but in my personal life as well. \n\"He’s one of the biggest that will ever wear the green and gold. \n\"He’s one of those players where you have him in your team you know he’s going to at least get you some points on the board scoring tries or even in defending he was just feisty. He didn’t care how big the guys were, he’d just make his tackles. \n\"He was an unbelievable rugby player and a legend of the game that will be remembered forever.\" Blitzboks coach Neil Powell and wife Tanya on their way to Joost's memorial service in Pretoria from CT #joostfuneral pic.twitter.com/m2QI8LTiMQ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:01:00.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
