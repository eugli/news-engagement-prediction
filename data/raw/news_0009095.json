What followed was unbridled ecstasy for everyone involved. \nHere’s how everyone reacted to the long-awaited rematch. \nANTHONY MUNDINE Robbed? Source: Getty Images \nAnthony Mundine broke down after losing to his old rival, shedding tears in his dressing room immediately after departing the ring. The 41-year-old, like many others, was convinced he won the fight, slamming scorers before claiming he “deserved” the win. \n“I thought I’d done more than enough to win the fight. I thought in my head it was seven rounds to three, at best six rounds to four. \n“I had him beat up. He was bleeding, his eyes were puffy. \n“My passion got the better of me, but I still won the fight hands down. It hurts. \nWhen asked what he thought about the controversial 98-90 result, Mundine was incredulous. “That guy (scorer) must have been four-eyes, wearing two sets of glasses or something. I hit him (Green) with the cleanest shots. My jabs controlled him. I countered well. I don’t know, man. \n“I thought I won that fight, to me it’s two-nil, I deserved it.” \nMundine took to Twitter soon after leaving the ring, retweeting a post saying “history books will forever tell the story of how Anthony Mundine was robbed”, before sending out his own message of thanks to fans who supported him throughout the night. Wanna thank everybody for there support ! Ain't got nothin but love for ya ! Do your thing boy ✊🏾 — Anthony Mundine (@Anthony_Mundine) February 3, 2017 History books will forever tell the story of how @Anthony_Mundine was robbed!!! #MundineGreen2 pic.twitter.com/mtE9TIrjpf — Adam Houda (@LawyerAdamHouda) February 3, 2017 \nDANNY GREEN ‘Just pure elation.’ Source: News Corp Australia \nDanny Green opened up on the controversial fight immediately after leaving the ring, revealing his overwhelming joy at levelling his rivalry with Mundine. \n“Elated,” he said. “Just pure elation. It was close, it was tough, it was a hard fight.” \nGreen said the referee wanted to call off the fight after Mundine concussed him with an illegal shot to the back of his head in the first round. \n“It wasn’t the ear, it was right here (to the back of his head),” he said. “It was tough to come back from that. The referee was going to call the fight off. My legs were gone, I was seeing double. I thought ‘oh man, this is a bad start.’ But it wasn’t a clean punch. It was a foul. It is what it is. \n“I don’t take it personally but it made it difficult to get back into the fight. I had to really dig deep. The ref should have given me some time to recover for that. He took off a point (from Mundine) and he didn’t give me any time to recover. But I still think I won three of the first four rounds which got me off to a good start.” \nGreen said he wasn’t keeping track of how many rounds he had won during the fight but never felt like he was trailing — not even after being docked a point himself in the seventh. “I was throwing more shots,” he said. “I was throwing harder shots. I was throwing the more aggressive shots and landing some clean shots.” \nEven Green himself was surprised with the scorers’ decision. \n“I didn’t win by eight points. No chance,” Green said. “It was a close fight.” \nBIG NAMES There were a lot of big names backing Mundine to win via decision. Source: Getty Images \nAustralian boxer Barry Michael wasn’t impressed with the outcome of the hyped superfight, slamming the result immediately after Green was crowned the winner. \n“I had Choc winning quite comfortably, to be honest,” he said. “Danny was hurt badly in the first round — it was a cheap shot, basically and Mundine lost a point for it and Greeny fought back valiantly. \n“But sitting here, (Green) wasn’t landing clean shots, he was throwing punches that were hitting the shoulder, whereas Mundine was constantly landing with the jab. \n“I don’t see the decision was correct, I’m sorry.” \nDaily Telegraph reporter Paul Kent was astonished with the result, sparing no time in crowning Mundine the winner after the match. \n“Anthony Mundine won that fight, let’s be clear about that,” Kent said. \n“Danny barely landed a clean blow the whole fight. He would go in behind a couple of ineffective jabs, throw a right hand and miss and then grab — that was essentially the fight. \n“Then Mundine, after the foul, his whole body language changed. He suddenly got brave and started stalking. He was the one pushing the fight for the rest of the fight. \n“Mundine knows he won the fight.” \nRing announced Michael Buffer admitted he was surprised at Mundine’s loss. \n“Without a doubt it was a close fight and maybe could’ve gone either way, I don’t know how other people scored it. But the one score of 98-90. I don’t know what he was looking at,” he said. \n“It wasn’t a pretty fight, but it was a real fight.” \nTennis legend Roger Rasheed was even more angry with the result, backing Mundine for the win and calling the score “disgraceful”. Disgraceful decision tonight - Shame Boxing just hurt itself. I respect Danny Green but wow @Anthony_Mundine owned that fight. — roger rasheed (@roger_rasheed) February 3, 2017 @Anthony_Mundine @dannygreenboxer It wasn't pretty because it was REAL! A REAL GUTS &GLORY WAR! 2 MEN in the ring! #LetsGetReadyToRumble 🥊🇦🇺 — Michael Buffer (@Michael_Buffer) February 3, 2017 Anthony Mundine absolutely robbed. — Adam Saad (@adamsaad__1) February 3, 2017 I can cop on the chin Mundine loosing. You can't win them all but one judge scoring 98-90 is a absolute joke. He needs to go to specsavers — Nathan Peats (@peats05) February 3, 2017 \nOUTRAGED FANS Will we ever see Mundine v Green 3? Who knows. Source: Getty Images \nEveryone had an opinion on Australia’s fight of the decade. Fans and journalists flooded Twitter with their take on the highly controversial finish, slamming the result and decrying the fight as a blow to boxing’s reputation. \nSome fans were eagre for a “Mundine v Green 3” to settle the debate once and for all. @mattturner1986 @reecehomfray I'm outraged. I'm no expert but to my mind Mundine was the better fighter - plain and simple. — Greg Barila (@GregBarila) February 3, 2017 So Green fought while concussed, Mundine suckered him with cheap shot, Mundine probably won, Green was awarded fight. Boxing must be proud — Jon Ralph (@RalphyHeraldSun) February 3, 2017 Choc was robbed last night!
