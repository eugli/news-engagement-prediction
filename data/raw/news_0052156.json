Competitors FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service offer similar services. \nUPS made the announcement at the company's investor conference Tuesday in New York City. The new service is already rolling out in the \"largest metropolitan areas,\" UPS said. \nUPS U.S. operations president Myron Gray told investors that the Saturday ground service will reach more than 50% of U.S. residents in 2017. \"We'll add more in 2018,\" Gray said. \nThe move is also expected to \"free up more ground capacity during the first half of the week,\" CEO David Abney told investors Tuesday, according to a transcript. \"That expands our delivery capacity with no incremental capital investment. It also maintains the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities that come our way.\" \nThe Saturday delivery expansion will add an additional $100 million to $200 million in annual operating costs. \nThe company also announced that it was testing delivery of packages from a truck-launched drone . \nMeanwhile, UPS also told investors Tuesday that about 40% of \"eligible\" U.S. packages currently flow through sites with \"high\" levels of automation. That will transition to \"every\" site by 2021 as automation presents a significant cost savings opportunity. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .
