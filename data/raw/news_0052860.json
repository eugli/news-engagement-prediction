We were heartened to see that what Weatherford claimed was true: “The coverage isn’t particularly heavy, but that’s also what makes the cream so special. It hides imperfections while still making your skin look like skin,” she wrote. Now’s a particularly good time to partake in the joys of this face cream, which Weatherford also described as “a Valentine’s Day present to my face,” as it (and all Bare Minerals products) is 25 percent off at Dermstore. Note that it comes in a wide array of shades, including opal , buttercream , suede , chestnut , and sienna .\nOriginal Price: $30\nBuy BareMinerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream Sale Price: $22 (25 percent off) , DermStore The Strategist is a new site designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
