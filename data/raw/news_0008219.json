That’s what makes us special.” \nIn addition to its public condemnation of the travel ban, Cook added that Apple will be matching all donations by employees to refugees on a two-to-one basis, which will triple the value of all employee contributions. \nIn spite of the outcry, the president remains adamant about his decision: Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2017 \nApple is hardly the only company to have taken a stance against Trump’s inhumane order. \nOn Monday, thousands of Googlers across the country took it to the streets to speak up against the immigration ban, including founders Sergey Brin and Sundar Pichai. Microsoft and Amazon also expressed readiness to stand up to the Trump administration, supporting a lawsuit against the executive order filed by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:43:44.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
