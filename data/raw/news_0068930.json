Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp 2017-02-25 19:45:09 UTC \nDonald Trump's obsession with live-tweeting his morning cable news binges has made his erratic timeline...incredibly, disconcertingly, comically predictable. \nOne Boston journalist proved it on Saturday morning, with his own impressively prophetic tweet. SEE ALSO: The president is literally tweeting what he sees on TV \nDavid Bernstein was watching Fox and Friends when he saw guest Hermain Cain ( Remember him? The Hermainator? ) regurgitate a bogus statâ€”one clearly too tantalizing for our Twitter-egg-in-chief to resist amplifying. \nCain claimed, somewhat misleadingly , that the national debt decreased $12 billion during Trump's first month in office, compared to a $200 billion jump in the same time on Barack Obama's watch. The talking point can be traced back to a sketchy right-wing blog known for peddling conspiracies . \n\"If Trump tweets that stat this morning you know where he got it,\" Bernstein tweeted early on Saturday. On FOX & Friends Herman Cain just said that the media isn't telling you that Trump reduced the debt $12b in his 1st month. ðŸ¤” \nâ€” David S. Bernstein (@dbernstein) February 25, 2017 ...but if Trump tweets that stat this morning, you know where he got it. \nâ€” David S. Bernstein (@dbernstein) February 25, 2017 \nSure enough, about half an hour later, there was the president furiously completing the game of telephone. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. \nâ€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nThose numbers actually check out, but PolitiFact still rates the boast \" mostly false ,\" considering the government's debt is constantly fluctuating for all sorts of mundane reasons. Trump has also yet to sign a law that would have any bearing on that number , so it's a stretch for him to take any credit for it, at all. \nTrump's penchant for virtually berating his television is well-documented . Tweets that seem to come out of nowhere or indicate that Trump might be digging into obscure blogs can usually be explained by matching up his timeline to various cable news broadcasts. Lesson, learned: If you ever wanna know what Trump's gonna Tweet before he gets around to it, well, just watch what he watches. Maybe you can even beat him to the punch with your own logistically reductive tweet about what you just saw on television. After all: Presidentsâ€”they're just like us!
