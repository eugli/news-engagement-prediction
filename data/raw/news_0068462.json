April 25, 2016 \nAs the planet warms, one way for plants and animals to find their way to cooler territory is to move up higher into the mountains. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on April 25 have found ... Role of animals in mitigating climate change varies across tropical forests April 25, 2016 \nLarge animals play a key role in mitigating climate change in tropical forests across the world by spreading the seeds of large trees that have a high capacity to store carbon, new research co-led by the University of Leeds ... Iguanas partner with the plants of the Galápagos Islands December 7, 2016 \nThe isolation of ocean islands like the Galápagos prevents the arrival of large mammals, which disperse the seeds of many plants by ingesting them. In the absence of mammals, this function is filled by birds, tortoises, ... The guardians of the genome protect DNA to increase seed lifespan September 26, 2016 \nNew research has identified crucial biological sensors that determine seed longevity and control germination. ATM and ATR proteins sense DNA damage in seeds and are essential factors that help plants retain correct genetic ... Airborne gut action primes wild chili pepper seeds June 21, 2013 \nScientists have long known that seeds gobbled by birds and dispersed across the landscape tend to fare better than those that fall near parent plants where seed-hungry predators and pathogens are more concentrated. Research pair find plants on islands produce bigger seeds May 22, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —A pair of biological researchers with Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, has found that plants that grow on islands tend to produce bigger seeds than similar plants on the mainland. In their paper ... Recommended for you Neanderthal DNA contributes to human gene expression February 23, 2017 \nThe last Neanderthal died 40,000 years ago, but much of their genome lives on, in bits and pieces, through modern humans. The impact of Neanderthals' genetic contribution has been uncertain: Do these snippets affect our genome's ... Research shows secondary seed dispersal by predator animals is important for recolonization of plants February 23, 2017 \nIn the middle of Alberta's boreal forest, a bird eats a wild chokecherry. During his scavenging, the bird is caught and eaten by a fox. The cherry seed, now inside the belly of the bird within the belly of fox, is transported ... New link found between sex and viruses February 23, 2017 \nSexual reproduction and viral infections actually have a lot in common. According to new research, both processes rely on a single protein that enables the seamless fusion of two cells, such as a sperm cell and egg cell, ... Tiny cavefish may help humans evolve to require very little sleep February 23, 2017 \nWe all do it; we all need it—humans and animals alike. Sleep is an essential behavior shared by nearly all animals and disruption of this process is associated with an array of physiological and behavioral deficits. Although ... Mathematics supports a new way to classify viruses based on structure February 23, 2017 \nProfessor Robert Sinclair at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and Professor Dennis Bamford and Dr. Janne Ravantti from the University of Helsinki have found new evidence to support ... Common roundworm found to farm the bacteria it eats February 23, 2017 \nA common roundworm widely studied for its developmental biology and neuroscience, also might be one of the most surprising examples of the eat-local movement. Princeton University researchers have found that the organisms ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:37:13.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
