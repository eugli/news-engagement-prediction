Here we list some of the more unsavoury characters she has had to entertain. President BASHAR AL-ASSAD of Syria – December 2002 He and his British-born wife Asma dined with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. While not a formal state occasion, the UK rolled out the red carpet after then-PM Tony Blair extended an invitation. The visit was mired in controversy due to the president’s alleged support of Palestinian and Islamic terror groups. Assad now stands accused of killing civilians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs during Syria’s brutal civil war. Assad and his British-born wife Asma dined with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. While not a formal state occasion, the UK rolled out the red carpet after then-PM Tony Blair extended an invitation VLADIMIR PUTIN – June 2003 The Russian president’s only state visit to Britain in 2003 was marked by protests against his continued repression of separatists in Chechnya. The visit was organised by Mr Blair, who admired Putin as a ‘moderniser’. It happened three years before the murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London – allegedly by Russian agents - which resulted in a hardening of relations between Britain and Moscow. As well as Chechnya, demonstrators were unhappy about his regime’s treatment of minority groups, along with Russia’s poor prison conditions and high occurrence of domestic violence. The Russian president’s only state visit to Britain in 2003 was marked by protests against his continued repression of separatists in Chechnya President XI JINPING of China – October 2015 Protesters turned out in force for the visit of Xi Jinping – and there were even rumours of royal unrest about his arrival. Members of Amnesty International, pro-Tibet campaigners and followers of the Falun Gong spiritual practice, banned in mainland China, were present on The Mall in central London. But they were outmuscled by hordes of people wearing bright red who shouted the president’s name as he was driven past in a gilded carriage. Protesters turned out in force for the visit of Xi Jinping – and there were even rumours of royal unrest about his arrival in 2015 President ROBERT MUGABE of Zimbabwe – May 1994 He had already been blamed for the deaths of 10,000 people during crackdowns on rebel groups in the 1980s – long before his visit to Britain. But, with the full horror of the Zimbabwean leader’s regime yet to emerge, he was welcomed as a trading partner and for his ‘influence on peace’ in southern Africa. He was welcomed by Princess Margaret at Heathrow and taken by Rolls Royce to meet a delegation including the Queen and then Prime Minister John Major. He then accompanied the Queen for a five-minute procession by carriage to Buckingham Palace. Mugabe was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Bath during the visit. But he was later stripped of the honour amid concern about the brutality meted out by his supporters and his chronic mismanagement of the country. With the full horror of the Zimbabwean leader’s regime yet to emerge, Mugabe was welcomed as a trading partner and for his ‘influence on peace’ in southern Africa President SUHARTO of Indonesia – November 1979 With his regime blamed for up to one million deaths after the bloody invasion of East Timor five years earlier, President Suharto’s visit stirred up controversy. But the Indonesian despot’s arrival was hailed by some commentators as an ‘excellent opportunity’ for the UK defence industry. He was confronted on arrival in Downing Street by demonstrators carrying placards with slogans about Indonesian brutality. Romanian President NICOLAE CEAUSESCU – June 1978 Dissidents from Romania who had fled their homeland’s Communist regime were outraged at the state visit. Jim Callaghan’s Labour government wanted to broker a deal with Romania to co-produce aeroplanes. Shortly before their arrival, French President Valery Giscard D’Estaing had telephoned the Queen to warn that Ceausescu and his wife Elena had walked off with valuables from their state rooms on a visit to Paris. Dissidents from Romania who had fled their homeland’s Communist regime were outraged at the state visit from Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu President MOBUTO SESE SEKO of Zaire – December 1973 The former son of a cook presided over the collapse of his country’s economy and locked up dissidents. He was later found to have embezzled £12billion, and blamed for the deaths of 230,000 people.
