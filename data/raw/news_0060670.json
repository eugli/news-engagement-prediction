By Carly Ledbetter \nIt seems President Trump’s Twitter rants aren’t quite as powerful as he thinks they are. \nEarlier this month, after Nordstrom announced it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s line because of poor sales , President Trump attacked the retail chain on Twitter for treating his daughter “unfairly.” My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nIt appears the company escaped the political controversy relatively unscathed, according to a call Nordstrom co-president Peter Nordstrom had with analysts and investors on Thursday. When an analyst asked whether the president’s tweet had an impact on the company’s business, Peter said the effect was “negligible” and “not really discernible one way or the other,” according to CNBC. \nDespite the lack of impact, shopping (or not shopping) at Nordstrom has become quite political. After Trump’s tweet about the retail chain, celebrities Rosie O’Donnell, Michael Moore, Kristen Davis, Aisha Tylor and Chelsea Handler all shared photos of their shopping sprees at the store in support of its decision to drop Ivanka. A post shared by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Feb 9, 2017 at 9:14am PST \nSupporters of the president, like Scott Baio, announced that they would be boycotting the store. — Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) February 11, 2017 \nA video made by a group of women even went viral after they filmed themselves canceling their Nordstrom accounts in a fit of rage, over the store’s decision to “cave” and drop Ivanka’s line. \nSince Nordstrom dropped Ivanka’s line, many retailers ― like Sears, Kmart , Neiman Marcus, TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Belk ― have dropped Ivanka’s lines, as well as other Trump products.
