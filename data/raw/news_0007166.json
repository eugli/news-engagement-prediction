The body was formed after the passage of the Majlis Amanah Rakyat Act.\nA council comprising a chairman, a deputy chairman and nine other members form Mara’s top management.\nMara is answerable to the Rural and Regional Development Minis­ter, a position currently held by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. \nAll Mara Council members are appointed by the minister. \nThe idea to set up Mara was raised in the first Bumiputra Economic Congress held in 1965 in Kuala Lumpur. \nThe congress issued a resolution calling on the Rural and Industrial Development Authority (Rida) to be restructured. \nRida was formed in 1953 to develop the livelihoods of the rural poor. \nThe congress argued that Rida was ineffective and it was eventually restructured to become Mara. \nWith the formation of Mara, Rida’s training arm was also restructured, becoming the Mara College.\nThe college later developed into Institut Teknologi Mara and then became Universiti Teknologi Mara. \nMara has also set up Mara Junior Science Colleges in nearly every state in the country to meet Mara’s goals for Bumiputra education. \nApart from its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Mara has offices in every state and many districts. It also has operations in London and Washington. \nMara has no less than 20 subsidiaries involved in an extensive range of businesses, including transport and property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:09:30.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
