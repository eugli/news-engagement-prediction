They found people with higher levels of the hormone in their hair tended to have larger waist circumference measurements. While they were also heavier and had a higher body mass index, according to the researchers. Having high levels of cortisol - dubbed the stress hormone - causes people to reach out for comfort foods, experts believe Those classified as obese also had particularly high levels of cortisol, the study published in the journal Obesity found. DON'T FAT SHAME CHILDREN Singling out children for their puppy fat can leave them 'psychologically scarred' and likely to get even fatter in future, a study found last month. So-called 'fat shaming' may lead to feelings of stigma that result in comfort eating, researchers from Liverpool University said. Children labelled as being too heavy by their parents went on to weigh more as adults than children of similar weight whose parents did not label them as fat. Being told they were overweight also led the children to make ultimately unsuccessful attempts to diet. Study author Dr Sarah Jackson said: 'These results provide consistent evidence that chronic stress is associated with higher levels of obesity. 'People who had higher hair cortisol levels also tended to have larger waist measurements, which is important because carrying excess fat around the abdomen is a risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and premature death. 'Hair cortisol is a relatively new measure which offers a suitable and easily obtainable method for assessing chronically high levels of cortisol concentrations in weight research and may therefore aid in further advancing understanding in this area.' But she added that the participants were older and their levels of cortisol may differ to younger adults. It is not currently known whether chronically elevated cortisol levels are a cause or a consequence of obesity. More research is needed and if causation is proved, then targeting cortisol levels may offer a new method for treating obesity.
