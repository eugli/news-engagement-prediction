This book sets out to challenge this by establishing the historical context that resulted in humanism’s eclipse, critiquing anti-humanism, and exploring alternative, neglected traditions and possible new directions. Humanism is a diverse and complex tradition that may facilitate the renewal of progressive theory through the championing of human subjectivity, agency and freedom. Across four extended essays, David Alderson, Kevin Anderson, Barbara Epstein and Robert Spencer engage critically with the Marxist tradition, recent developments in poststructuralism, postcolonialism and queer theory. Review Quotes Neil Lazarus, University of Warwick \"'A major intervention into contemporary discussions about the resources of political hope, this volume insists upon the continuing indispensability and, indeed, radicalness of humanism as both a critical philosophy and a moral-political template. Each of the individual chapters – on socialist humanism, political philosophy, postcolonialism, and queer theory – is noteworthy for the ways in which it conjoins scholarly rigour with passionate political commitment. Humanism is approached here not merely as a field of thought and action with long historico-philosophical roots, and requiring contemporary renewal, but as a social optic foundational to any project that aims at human freedom.\" For more information, or to order this book, please visit http://www.press.uchicago.edu Google preview here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:35:26.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
