Naturally, there were upgraded hoodies and J.E. signature bleached-out, washed-down jeans you won't find anywhere else. There were neon-hued jackets and new knitwear silhouettes. There were suits!. But it's safe to say the sneakerheads in attendance or streaming at home were only focused on one thingâ€”the John Elliott x Nike Vandals walking in the show. After all, the high-top, strapped-up style is a certified classic Nike sneaker. But other than a limited-edition NikeLab release in 2015, the sneaker has rarely been re-released by the brand. It's not surprising, though, that one of our favorite designers is the only man who could get the sports juggernaut to dust off one of their most in-demand sneakers and let him have his creative way with them. \nWhile the Vandal may not be all over the city streets (yet) or seemingly everywhere on people's Instagram flexes, the silhouette's influence on the sneaker world today is well-documented. It's no secret Raf Simons drew inspiration from the Vandal for one of his most popular high-top designs, and that Jerry Lorenzo's Fear Of God \"Military Sneaker\" also draws from the '80s-era Nike. For Elliott, the sneaker was as influential in its design as it was essential to his sneaker collection growing up in the San Francisco area in the '90s. \"As any kid growing up who didn't have the disposable income to just get every single drop, you kind of had to invest in stuff that was versatile,\" he told us yesterday . \"So that's why I grew up in the Nike Vandal because...it was an off-court sneaker that had basketball roots but that I could also skate in.\" \nElliott and Nike were hardly strangers prior to their Vandal collaboration. In addition to being a life-long Nike devotee, the designer had used the brand's kicks in previous runway shows. And while other athletic brands have approached him in hopes of getting a little J.E. magic added to their own wares, the two-time BNMDA was always holding out for the Swoosh. \nWhen it came time to make a Vandal of his own, John Elliott brought his signature muted color palette to the table in a dark gray and of-the-moment off-white hue, emphasizing the sneakers' understated, classic appeal. As the sneaker world has become increasingly more populated with out-there color schemes and crazy hybrid silhouettes, it's almost refreshing to see an of-the-moment designer showing restraint on what is such a minimalist sneaker silhouette already. Like all of Elliott's designs, these sneakers aren't about a logo, but about the overall feel and look. And though they won't officially stores for a few months, we're glad to say the Vandal making a glorious return in the right hands.
