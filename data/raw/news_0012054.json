Asking about tomato ketchup and whether it should be kept in the fridge or in the cupboard? \nWell, we're asking it again, because it's all kicking off. Asda is to blame, stoking the saucy flames. \nThe supermarket just carried out an interesting survey that found that 53 per cent of Brits prefer to store their ketchup in the fridge. That's one per cent higher than the percentage of Brits who voted for Brexit . Let's contemplate a while Ketchup is nice (Photo: Getty) Read More Woman slices into Morrisons pepper – what she found inside was truly inspiring \nOn the back of the research, Asda has decided that it might be good for business to start stocking red sauce in the fridge. These are unopened bottles, by the way, contravening any storage protocol that's gone before. \nPrevious investigations by Mirror Online found that refrigeration was the choice before, too. In 2014, a poll revealed that 54 per cent of readers believed that the cupboards were an upsetting place for the condiment to reside. But it was far from conclusive. The discussion is rolling on \nAsda is trialling its new half-and-half storage method at a superstore in Clapham, London. Half of its stock – of its own brand range – will line fridges. The remainder will go where it always has done, on the shelves next to the mustard and the mayonnaise. \nWe know that for years social media has been the stomping ground for tomato-based hostility. But the seemingly perpetual debate had recently cooled, in fairness. Conversation has recently been more focused on lettuce , and potato wedges . But Asda has enlivened the public once more. \nVictoria Williams, category manager for cooking and condiments at Asda, said: “Tomato Ketchup is a staple of many of our customers weekly shop but recent debate has prompted us to trial two areas to stock our great value own brand tomato ketchup sauces, so we can end the debate once and for all and give everyone what they want.” \nI did a quick straw poll on Twitter. My results went the other way, with the majority (59 per cent) opting choosing the cupboard. Ultimately, it really is getting quite out of hand We're starting to think this issue is never going to be settled. But, while we're here, we may as well ask you all what you think... poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:10:17.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
