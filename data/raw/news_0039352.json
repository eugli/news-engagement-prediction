The economy is biting harder on the workers, particularly in Lagos State. \n“We will not call off the strike until the management pay us our money, all academic activities will remain suspended,’’ Aromolaran told NAN. \nHe recalled that the union had similar experience in August 2016, but that after a protest, the Minister of Education intervened by directing that the allowance be paid. \n“This time around, we will remain on strike until our full salary is paid. The management is trying to play pranks with the union.’’ \nHe said that if it warrant waiting for President Muhammadu Buhari to return from vacation, the union would not suspend the strike.
