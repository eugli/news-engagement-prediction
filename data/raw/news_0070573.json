K.C. Johnson didn't trade Jimmy Butler .\nThe Bulls did agree to trade one of the most identifiable players in franchise history in Taj Gibson along with Doug McDermott to the Thunder. \nIn exchange, the Bulls will receive point guard Cameron Payne, center Joffrey Lauvergne and swingman Anthony Morrow , a team source confirmed. \nThe Bulls, who a source said pushed for Andre Roberson in the deal, also agreed to send a 2018 second-round pick to the Thunder. \nGibson, who is set to be an unrestricted free agent, was spotted hugging coaches and executives as he left the Advocate Center. \nThe Bulls traded up to snag McDermott in the lottery of the 2014 NBA draft and is the team's best 3-point shooter. \nMorrow is a career 41.7 percent 3-point shooter. He has an expiring contract. \nLauvergne is averaging 5.7 points and 3.7 rebounds in 50 games for the Thunder. He's also on the last year of his deal and will be a restricted free agent.

(Getty, AP photos) \nThe deal basically turns into McDermott for Payne since Gibson likely would've commanded a deal too rich for the Bulls' blood this summer. It also opens up a starting power forward spot for 2015 first-round pick Bobby Portis. \nPayne, the 14th overall pick in 2015, averaged 5.1 points and 1.9 assists in 77 games over two seasons with the Thunder. The organization valued him, but playing behind Russell Westbrook, he only averaged 13.1 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:44:20.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
