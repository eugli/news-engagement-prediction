Caroline Foskett, 31, was shopping in the Aldi branch in Dartford, Kent, on Friday February 10, when she spotted the man ‘awkwardly’ wandering the aisles with a trolley. Wearing what appeared to be a Domino’s coat and cap, the man was reportedly waiting for Aldi staff to restock the freezer after he had emptied it of chicken wings and dippers. It comes only a week after a Domino’s worker was spotted buying cheap potato wedges at an Asda store, which were later sold to customers at a huge mark-up of £3.99 a portion. Caroline, a teacher from London, claims that the man already had six or seven tubs of coleslaw, eight or nine boxes of chicken strips, and the same amount in chicken wings. The mum-of-two sent the image to Domino’s after noticing that the store had hit the headlines only a week previously – when staff were spotted bulk buying wedges in Asda.

(Picture: Caters) More Domino’s hit the headlines last week after they admitted to buying cheap supermarket wedges from Asda for £1 a bag before selling them to customers. The pizza giant claimed that the surplus stock was needed after a ‘big sporting weekend’ caused some stores to run out of products.
