Dim the cabin lights and get ready to sleep.”\nAccording to various crew members, the routes the plane is operating on can dictate quite how pushy the business or first class passengers might be.\nFor instance, one Reddit user called Emmadilemma said: “I normally love working as the first class flight attendant, except for LA flights.\n“Everyone on the plane to LAX airport is a princess and deserves to be treated like a celebrity — in their own minds.”\nFor other airlines, business class passengers are the rudest when travelling between New York and London, or New York to Miami.\nA flight attendant called Brad told The Independent : “[On an] NYC-Florida flight, everyone thinks they’re the most important person in the world.\n“I once had a forty-something male passenger who said he was a picky eater and asked me to remove the almonds from his mixed nuts, the shaved Parmesan from his salad and the cilantro (coriander) from his tabouleh.”\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun and was reproduced with permission.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/flight-attendants-hate-business-first-class-passengers-cabin-crew-secrets-horror-stories-a7589246.html", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2917937/why-many-flight-attendants-actually-prefer-working-in-economy-to-business-class/", "https://www.quora.com/Assuming-there-is-no-difference-in-pay-and-prestige-would-flight-attendants-prefer-to-work-in-the-economy-business-class-or-first-class-section-of-the-plane", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1546dadcee1626c34b36db79598409fb"], "published": "2017-02-23T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:48:02.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
