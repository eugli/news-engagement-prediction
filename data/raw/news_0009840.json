(Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON - Bill Belichick had two weeks to prepare for the Falcons' league-leading offense. He'd needed a few more hours to finally solve that daunting Atlanta puzzle, which he did in the second half of the Patriots' thrilling 34-28 overtime win in Super Bowl LI. \nAnd it's the first time he's managed to figure out an historically great offense on the sports' biggest stage. \nBelichick was behind two of the greatest defensive gameplans in Super Bowl history. First as the defensive coordinator for the Giants, when his team successfully thwarted the Bills' K-Gun offense. Then, a decade later, his first Patriots Super Bowl team did the unthinkable and slowed the Rams' Greatest Show on Turf team. While this gameplan he designed won't being going to the Hall of Fame like the others, this coaching job may be the greates of Belichick's career. \nAll season long, teams tried and failed to figure out this Falcons offense, which was held to fewer than 20 points only once all season. There just isn't a gameplan - not even one put together by Belichick - a defense can employ to stop Atlanta. The Bills and Rams, on the other hand, had a single player Belichick could fix his attention on. Against Buffalo, it was Jim Kelly . Against St. Louis, it was Marshall Faulk . Try focusing on one Falcon, and the other five weapons they have on the offense will gash you. \nThat's exactly what happened in the first half at NRG Stadium. Belichick's defensive gameplan was very clearly focused on not letting Julio Jones have a big game. The Patriots consistently had two - and sometimes even three - defenders on the big receiver. That left the other Falcons receivers with plenty of space to work. Three different Falcons have scored offensive TDs today, and none of them are Julio Jones. That's why this offense is so scary. — Lindsay Jones (@bylindsayhjones) February 6, 2017 \nAtlanta's second touchdown was the perfect illustration of Jones' \"gravity\" and how much stress he puts on a defense.

He eventually figured it out, but it did take some trial and error. \nIn order to prevent Jones and guys like Mohamad Sanu and Taylor Gabriel from doing serious damage, Belichick was forced to play two safeties back deep, leaving New England a man short in the box. That's not ideal against the Falcons' run game, with Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman in the backfield. \nAtlanta took advantage of the light run box, running for 56 yards on just five first-quarter carries. Matt Ryan attempted only two passes. This was very clearly a case of the Falcons taking whatever Belichick gave them. \nAfter the Falcons dominated on the ground during the first 15 minutes, Belichick made an adjustment, dropping a safety into the box, which left Matt Ryan with one-on-one opportunities all over the field. And he responded as you'd expect the league's MVP to respond, by thrashing New England's overmatched secondary. Ryan completed five-of-six passes in the second quarter for 103 yards and a touchdown. \nBelichick wasn't done adjusting. He put Eric Rowe in for Logan Ryan and had the lone deep safety cheat over to Jones side. That's when Gabriel started doing damage. \nBut after the teams went into halftime with Atlanta leading 21-3, Belichick seemed to have things figured out. And that's the message he gave his team in the locker room. \n\"Do your job. Finish,\" Patriots LB Dont'a Hightower said was the instruction at the break. \"We knew what they had, we drew up what they were doing. We had to come out and execute. And we did just that.\" \nStill not wanting Jones to go off in the second half, the Patriots started playing a true double-team on him, which rarely happens in the NFL. At one point in the third quarter, Jones went in motion and two Patriots followed him across the field. \nThat strategy still didn't stop Jones from hauling in one of the most ridiculous catches in Super Bowl history. Julio Jones makes an insane tip toeing catch for a first down! #Superbowl #Riseup pic.twitter.com/GyxBOoUKiN — Today'sLoop (@TodaysLoop) February 6, 2017 \nHe was actually doubled at the start of the play, but lost his primary defender with a nasty double move before putting Rowe on a poster. \nUndeterred by Jones' brilliant grab, Belichick settled on the double-Julio Jones strategy. And then the Patriots started getting pressure on Ryan, coming up with two huge sacks in the fourth quarter. The first a strip sack that changed the game. The second sack pushed the Falcons out of field goal range. \nAll of Belichick's tinkering had finally paid off. After scoring 28 points over the first 36 minutes of the game, the Falcons were shut out the rest of the way. \nSo that's what it required to stop the Falcons offense: The greatest defensive mind this league has ever seen, reaching deep down for any strategy he could think up.
