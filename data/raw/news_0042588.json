You may have to take 3 more \nThe letter said these students were used to the semester system — under which pupils are examined every six months — and so, they should be assessed only for one semester in their Class 10 exams for two years. \nThis effectively meant a halving of the syllabus as the board examinations assess a candidate on the entire year’s learning. \nThe CBSE hasn’t taken a call on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s request but sources told HT it might be difficult for the board to change the rule for a union territory or a state because the decision was applicable to affiliated schools. \nBoard officials also said a semester-based assessment couldn’t be called a board examination, which had to be based on an annual syllabus. \nOfficials in the city department of education said they didn’t ask for an exemption. \n“We want the semester system to continue for Class 9 and 10 students for an interim of two years… as they had to go through various experiments of no-detention policy, CCE (continuous and comprehensive evaluation) among others, and will find it (board exams) difficult to adjust,” said a senior DoE official. \n“We fully support board exams but currently the students are used to the semester system so they should be assessed using that. The board exam for these students can be based on a semester rather than judging them on the full syllabus, that too for a period of two years,” added the official. The government also said this could be replicated throughout the country so that sudden decisions don’t adversely affect the children. \nRead | CBSE admit card for board exams 2017 released, download them here \nLast December, CBSE made Class 10 exam compulsory in its schools, doing away with a policy formed five years ago that offered a choice to students to opt for the board-conducted finals or let the institution assess their performance. The previous policy was roundly criticised for lower performance levels among children and blamed for falling test scores. \nThe decision was taken by the governing body of the CBSE, which runs more than 18,000 schools in the country including government schools, Kendriya Vidyalayas and private ones. \nA CBSE notification earlier this month said students appearing for the Class 10 exam will have to study the complete year’s syllabus and score 33% in both theory and internal assessment to pass. \nTo roll out compulsory Class 10 board examination in 2018, schools will have to start internal assessment from this year itself. “Delhi government wrote to us recently pointing out that the graded system which was in practice so far should continue for Delhi government schools. However, at this juncture, we can’t give them exemption as this is the decision of the governing body,” said a CBSE official. \nRead | CBSE scraps open text book based assessment for classes 9 and 11 \nUnlike other states, Delhi does not have its own education board and is affiliated to the CBSE. In 2015, education minister Manish Sisodia had said the government would work on creating a board of its own on the lines of the CBSE with its own syllabus, keeping the demand of Delhi in mind. However, no timeline was given for the rollout of the proposal. \nPrivate schools in the capital had performed better than government-run and aided schools in the CBSE Class 10 exam last year. According to CBSE officials, the pass percentage of private schools was 11% higher than that of government schools. Government schools in Delhi had a pass percentage of 89.13%, which is more than the national average of 86.61%. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:16:55.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
