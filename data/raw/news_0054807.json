He was a peaceful and gentle person,\" it continued. \n\"Whatever he may or may not have done since then they believe from their own experience he was utterly changed by the physical and mental cruelty and the inhuman treatment he endured for two years at Guantanamo.\" \nHis relatives insisted he did not receive £1m in compensation, adding: \"The family last heard from him in 2014 and have since then been desperately worried about his fate.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:28:21.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
