(Photo courtesy: Sampurn) NEW DELHI: The Shahid Kapoor-Vishal Bhardwaj duo has always created a spark on screen- be it in ‘Kaminey’ or ‘Haider.’ Now, they are all set to come up with another memorable work for the third time on screen, with ‘Rangoon’. \nWhile speaking about Bhardwaj with film critic Anupama Chopra, Sasha said that the 51-year-old director is the one who brought out the ‘good actor’ in him. \n“He is definitely the most relevant filmmaker in my career. He is actually responsible for me knowing that I am a good actor, if I may say so by myself. He has helped me to find a side in me, which I think, I did not know existed,” he said. \nExplaining his statement, the 35-year-old actor further said Vishal encouraged him to do something different and \"to be bold and brave and fearless of all the trappings that comes with the want to be a hero.” \n“The need to rediscover myself and to do something new in every film, the need to play a character which is not driven by looks or by dancing quality- just to play a character, to play a new silhouette, to surprise the audience, to do something different and to be bold and brave and fearless of all the trappings that comes with the want to be a hero. So, he brought that out from me in ‘Kaminey,’ which helped me completely assimilate and process it when I did ‘Haider’ and then there was ‘Udta Punjab,’ now ‘Rangoon’ and then ‘Padmavati.’ The journey is kind of now taken off for me. But he was the one who helped me to recognise it,” he said. \nOn the same note, Shahid even mentioned that he is proud to have worked with the director for three times and get into the lit which has names like father- Pankaj Kapur and Tabu. \nHe said, \"I have worked with Vishal sir three times, and so has my dad and so has Tabu. Wow, I am finally in a list. A list that has Tabu and my dad.\" \nBhardwaj directed ‘Rangoon,’ which stars Saif Ali Khan, Kangana Ranaut and Shahid Kapoor, is all set to hit the theatres on February 24.
