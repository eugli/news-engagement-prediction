In the Peruvian zoo before her transfer Dominga was sedated for the move \n“We know that an environment more natural for her species and having the company of other spectacled bears will make a huge difference to her physical and psychological health.” \nThanks to the work of Animal Defenders International, Dominga will finally live happily as a wild animal after her traumatic kidnap. \nAfter a gruelling 500-mile journey over the Andes, 14-year-old Dominga has been transported to her new home in a lush jungle in the Amazon – the natural habitat for spectacled bears. The rescue party are checked over by the army \nAnimal Defenders International came to her aid and launched an emergency appeal to fund her complex four-day relocation after finding her so sick in the enclosure. \nThe team had to sedate her before the trip, in order to trim her overgrown claws with huge clippers and an industrial file. She also received a complete body massage with specialist creams to treat the fungus and soothe her cracked skin.

Her new place not only has natural vegetation, but boasts a cave, a pool and some platforms for climbing. Rescuers kept the bear happy by feeding her grapes during the boat trip Dominga being carried into the forest at the end of her journey Read More Cholita the real-life Paddington bear gets a safe forest home after a life of circus torture \nJan recalls seeing Dominga in her natural habitat for the first time. “She immediately climbed to the top of her enclosure and climbed along the top of the fence, before coming down to inspect all the platforms, toys and her cave,” she says. \n“She is very inquisitive and perhaps a little bit naughty – she has already pulled up some plants by the roots, dug a couple of holes, and tried chewing a water pipe. She expects everyone who walks by to be carrying grapes for her!
