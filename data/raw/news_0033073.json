That’s for kids,” as the music changes from chirpy to something more seductive. \n“Burger King presents the Adult’s Meal, with an adult toy inside. Only on Valentine’s Day, and only from 6pm,” the ad continues. \nThe ad, which also features on Burger King Israel’s Facebook page, has been watched more than 750,000 times. \nThe adult toys pictured include an eye mask, mini feather duster and head massager, next to an Adult’s Meal box design featuring a neon hamburger and an 18+ sign. \nCNBC.com contacted Burger King Israel but no-one was available to comment. \nIn the U.K. meanwhile, adult goods are set to see an increase in sales online around Valentine’s Day, according to new figures from performance marketing company Webgains. The Fifty Shades of Grey franchise has caused an increase in online sales of bondage products, according to an emailed report. \nWebgains predicts a 50 per cent increase in online sales of such goods around the Valentine’s release of Fifty Shades Darker. Sex shop Ann Summers saw a 43 per cent increase in sales of bondage products online between 2015 and 2016, using the Webgains affiliate network, and the report claims other adult retailers including Lovehoney and Bondara are also likely to see a surge in popularity. \nOther brands have focused on different aspects of the feast of St Valentine, and have given away products. Snickers has replaced its strapline: “You’re not you when you’re hungry,” with “You’re forgetful when you’re hungry,” attaching free Valentine’s cards to billboards at London’s Waterloo station. It will also give away 3,000 cards on February 15, for those who forgot the saint’s day. \nAnd sandwich chain Subway is giving away a free six-inch sub to customers who buy a large drink, as part of its “Customer Appreciation Day” in the U.K. \nMeanwhile, the U.K.’s National Health Service is running a Valentine’s Day campaign to encourage people to give away a kidney – while they are living. \nAn ad, set in a working men’s club, features comedian Alex Smith singing: “I’d give you my heart, but I’d have to be dead, and I just got a free trial on Amazon Prime, so please have my kidney instead.” It will run on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram and was created by agency Aesop for NHS Blood and Transplant. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:15:34.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
