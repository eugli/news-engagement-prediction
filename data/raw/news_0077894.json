Trump . \nHis constant bragging can seem pretty one-note at times, but not when it’s matched to the music of bassist Dywane “MonoNeon” Thomas Jr. \nThe Memphis, Tennessee, musician previously collaborated with Prince and Ne-Yo. In his latest project, he’s put music to 24 of Trump’s most outrageous brags. \nThe 26-year-old musician is playing bass to each of Trump’s brags and matching the president’s rhythm and cadence. \n“I’m not a fan of his, but his brags sound like today’s mumble hip-hop,” Thomas told The Huffington Post. “I heard them and put musical pitches and notes to them.” \nAlthough Thomas’ masterful playing makes Trump sound, well, musical, he has no plans of collaborating for reals. \n“It’s a satire of how ridiculous he is,” Thomas said.
