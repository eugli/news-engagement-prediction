The message reads: \"Immigrants make America great (they also cooked your food and served you today).\" \nSimmons said the message was a political statement. \"I just wanted to remind ourselves and our customers that basically immigrants are the backbone of the hospitality industry. It was only 10 years ago I came here myself and started from scratch,\" he said. FACEBOOK/KIWIANA \nSimmons says this picture shows what his NewYork restuarant Kiwiana is all about. Dressed in a black apron with a silver fern, he's about to prepare a table full of New Zealand lamb. \n\"I wanted to let my friends and customers know that's my stand, my silent protest. That's what I love about America, it's a place where freedom of speech is valued and respected.\" \nREAD MORE: \nSimmons said he found President Donald Trump's immigration executive order, which temporarily banned travel to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries, \"just a little alarming\".

GOOGLE EARTH \nSimmons' Kiwiana restaurant in Union St, Brooklyn, New York. \nOpening Kiwiana five years ago was scary and exciting. \"It really galvanised my view on what I wanted to do. Ad Feedback \n\"Because a lot of people haven't heard of New Zealand you have to stand on that soapbox,\" Simmons said. \n\"We do it by pouring some of the best wine in the world, having some of the best beer in the world, having tonnes of lamb and a hell of a lot of pavlovas.\" KIWIANA \nChef Mark Simmons: \"very proud to fly the New Zealand flag\". \nSmoked and pickled green lip mussels were one of the most popular items on the menu. \"That was just a comfort food I grew up with,\" Simmons said. \n\"We love what we do and we're very proud to fly the New Zealand flag.\" \nDespite his enjoyment of New York, he is interested in the idea of retiring to New Zealand and is a staunch champion of Invercargill, describing it as the \"most underrated city in the world\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:27:42.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
