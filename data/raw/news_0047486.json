Now, the show boss Iain MacLeod has dropped even more hints on what viewers can expect from the storyline. \nExplaining his vision for the wedding, he told Metro.co.uk at a recent event: ‘You will see it inferred that it’s not an “official wedding” so a little sneaky part of me thought we could have two bites of the cherry here if possible. Although there are no firm plans for part two in place, it feels like, in time, they will want to sign and seal the deal legally. \n‘We thought we could have some fun with this one, make it Dingle-tastic. It also gets quite intimate and heartfelt and the chaos makes way for a very intimate, very delicate and very honest improvisation that’s super heartfelt. (Picture: ITV) \n‘The vision was to go quite bonkers with it and inflict something on them that they’d never choose. There is this big spectacle that gets more and more tasteless as it goes on but we also find room over a couple of episodes to do something in keeping with their personalities and true to the origins of their relationship.’ \nViewers can watch the episodes on Monday 20th and Tuesday 21st February on ITV at 7pm. All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:39:59.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
