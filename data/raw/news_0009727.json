The oldest theatrical organization in the United States, which was established in 1795, has been presenting The Man of the Year award annually since 1963 (and The Woman of the Year award annually since 1951). \nThis year, the comedy troupe selected Reynolds because he's a \"talented and diverse actor, whose seamless transition across multiple genres captures audiences and keeps them coming back to see what's next.\" \nOn Friday, before being handed his Pudding Pot, Reynolds took part in all of the traditional festivities â€” including a tour of Farkas Hall, and having the highs-and-lows of his acting career roasted by the Hasty Pudding actors. He also performed in skits in which he wore a Deadpool -inspired bra, auditioned for Deadpool 2 by reluctantly insulting Tom Brady and Meryl Streep, and was forced to retrieve an actual green lantern (symbolising his disastrous 2011 comic book movie) from the trash and smash it with a sledgehammer. \nCheck out some of the highlights in the video above! \nDeadpool 's Holiday Blu-ray package is now available and retails for $25.99. Deadpool 2 is expected to begin filming next year and is due out January 12, 2018.
