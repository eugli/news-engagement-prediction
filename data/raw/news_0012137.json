PA:Press Association 5 Jurgen Klopp has publicly confessed Liverpool have issues with their No 1 spot \nBut after another humiliation at Hull, Klopp finally confessed the dire displays of Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius are “causing problems.” \nThe German now knows he cannot keep covering for their cock-ups. \nMignolet was embarrassed when David Luiz caught him napping with his free-kick for Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday. \nAnd on Saturday, under pressure from Hull’s Abel Hernandez, he pathetically palmed down Harry Maguire’s header for Alfred N’Diaye to tap in. \nOf course, the Belgian’s blunders are nothing new. \nYou could compile a whole DVD of goalkeeping gaffes just from Mignolet ’s 3½ years at Liverpool . Yet Klopp’s only alternative is to resort back to Karius . \nAnd the German’s own horror highlights reel comes with an 18 certificate. \nStill, Klopp has in the past been nothing but supportive of his stoppers. PA:Press Association Simon Mignolet blunders again, enabling Alfred N’Diaye to poach the first Hull goal Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet drops a corner which leads to a Hull goal \nHe memorably attacked Gary and Phil Neville after the pundits criticised Karius in December. \nBut the Anfield boss is seemingly no longer prepared to tell the world and his wife that they have got it wrong about his men between the sticks. \nAsked about Mignolet ’s mistake at Hull, Klopp said: “That’s another thing where we have to show a reaction. That’s causing problems. That’s how it is. \n“For sure, he was not alone around the goal. But he nearly had the ball in his hands. \n“We cannot ignore this is true and we will not — we do not lie to ourselves. Putting ourselves under pressure is a hobby of ours. Now we have to show a reaction, but I cannot show it here now.” \nThis was not the same clippity Klopp who bounced into England 16 months ago with his endless energy and loveable laugh. \nEven after a defeat, the German usually comes out fighting in his post-match press duties. Reuters German Loris Karius has struggled to impress during his first season at Anfield Hull 2-0 Liverpool : Bottom-of-the-table Tigers stun drab Reds as Jurgen Klopp’s horror 2017 continues \nBut on Saturday night, as he propped himself against the wall in a tight corridor of the KCOM Stadium, Klopp was like a boxer on the ropes. Gloves up, just taking the punches. \nHe was asked why it is that Liverpool have not lost once against any team in the top ten, but have now been beaten four times by sides in the bottom half. \nKlopp was questioned if, in hindsight, he regrets not making any signings in last month’s transfer window when it was clear they needed fresh faces. \nAnd he was quizzed on just how he was going to turn things around given his lack of strength in depth. \nBut Klopp had no answers, only insisting that his search for solutions would start right away. Getty Images 5 Oumar Niasse grabs the late Hull clincher on Saturday after visiting keeper Mignolet had been left unprotected by poor defending \nHe said: “I think what is very important is to never blame anybody else for your own mistakes. \n“I cannot say, ‘Yes it would have been fantastic if the club could have given me new players’. We had opportunities for doing something but we didn’t find the right players. \n“It’s not because we were blind, it’s because the players were not available. We tried different things — it was not a money issue, there were different reasons.” \nKlopp continued: “But I take everything. If you say now, ‘Not enough players, not good enough players’. I have to take it. \nRELATED STORIES GOING NOWHERE Man City move quickly to deny that striker Sergio Aguero could be sold this summer after he hints at Etihad exit Eagles in a flap Crystal Palace could face FA charge for failing to control fans after attack on Damien Delaney TOO EASY Eden Hazard has revealed Chelsea could have scored more against Arsenal but 'saved them for next week' ALan shearer Arsenal's DNA has drastically changed from Invincible era compared to side that lost to Chelsea ugly scenes Violent clashes between fans of heated rivals Swindon and Oxford overshadow League One match Real Deal Real Madrid 'look into forming European Super League' after fall out with La Liga over match postponement RON TO A WINNER Cristiano Ronaldo poses for gleeful cake photo with mum on 32nd birthday as Real clash is called off CATS GET APPLE David Moyes to take Sunderland on team bonding holiday to New York City Simply juan-derful Juventus 1 Inter Milan 0: Juan Cuadrado scored a first half wonder goal to send Juve six points clear DERBY VIOLENCE Man punched and woman hit by cone as bystanders snigger - marring Huddersfield clash with Leeds LIONS ROAR Cameroon 2 Egypt 1: Vincent Aboubakar scores dramatic late winner as Indomitable Lions secure first trophy since 2002 'EMBARRASSING' Gary Neville lays into Arsenal Fan TV and claims Gunners fans should be careful what they wish for \n“I respect all your questions. You have been pretty polite and nice when you could have been much more aggressive, and even that I would have accepted. \n“I don’t think I’m perfect. I feel 100 per cent responsible for defeats, much more than I feel for wins. It has been like this my whole life. \n“That doesn’t mean it’s for me to feel sorry for myself, to have self-pity, I’m not like this. When I get up on Sunday I will only be solution orientated. \n“And there are solutions, 100 per cent. But I cannot do it here now, that’s the problem.” \nThe Reds might have enjoyed 72 per cent of possession and had 22 shots and 15 corners. But sometimes the stats do lie because against Marco Silva’s much- improved side deserved the three points. PA:Press Association Former Germany U-21 keeper Karius will be hoping to justify the £4.7m summer fee paid to Mainz 05 after his shaky start to life in the Premier League \nLiverpool never really recovered after debutant N’Diaye capitalised on Mignolet ’s mess in the 44th minute. \nAnd Oumar Niasse added a second from Andrea Ranocchia’s long ball six minutes from time, slotting through minging Mignolet ’s legs. \nKlopp added: “Many teams have already made mistakes and changed things. For this you have to do the right things and I’m quite confident we can do the right things. \n“We will see what happens in the week and how players react. \n“We don’t look for excuses, it’s not that we are trying to blame somebody. \n“We are responsible, the squad, myself especially. \n“We have to work on a solution and we will.” \nGood luck with that, Jurgen.
