That didn’t end up happening of course, but I’m still giving the sim points for calling a Falcons’ Super Bowl berth, because it’s something none of the experts here at CBSSports.com predicted at the time. \nSo, after the Super Bowl matchup was set and we were done properly freaking out about that first “Madden” sim (it took some time), we ran another one, which we published with a “Patriots’ second-half explosion downs Falcons in ‘Madden 17’ sim” headline. Days later, the New England Patriots overcame a 25-point second-half deficit to win Super Bowl LI. \nThe point being, EA Sports’ “Madden 17” is onto something. So with that in mind, we’re testing its powers once again. This time, we’re hoping the game can tell us which team should trade for Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo , who is expected to depart New England this offseason in exchange for draft ammunition. \nIf you think that’s an absurd idea, I won’t disagree. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a fitting method to pick Garoppolo’s next team, because the very idea of a team giving up as much as a first-round pick for a player with two career starts and fewer than 100 passes under his belt is equally absurd. \nYet here we are: There’s a decent chance either the Cleveland Browns , Chicago Bears , San Francisco 49ers or Houston Texans (all four have been linked to him) will try to land Garoppolo. For what it’s worth, Garoppolo has no idea where he’ll be next season. \nTo figure out which one should trade for him, I started franchises with the suitors listed above, traded for Garoppolo, and then simulated the next three seasons. Here’s what “Madden” found ... Chicago Bears \nThe price: The Patriots trade Garoppolo for a second-round pick and a fourth-round pick. \nThe results \nNote: “W-L” and “playoffs” are team stats. The remaining categories are Garoppolo’s individual stats. \nW-L", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:40:15.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
