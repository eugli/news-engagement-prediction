Martinelli | February 22, 2017 5:36 pm Follow @MMartinelli4 \nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Denny Hamlin poked a pretty big hole in Cleveland Cavaliers star Kyrie Irving’s theory about the Earth being flat. \nFrom one champion to another, last year’s Daytona 500 winner is an NBA fan who, of course, read about Irving’s comments last week declaring that the Earth is not round, as we’ve all been taught in school. \nIn case you forgot, on the Road Trippin’ podcast , among other things, Irving said: \n“For what I’ve known for as many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but I mean, if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that can you really think of us rotating around the sun and all planets aligned, rotating in specific dates being perpendicular with what’s going on with these planets and stuff like this … It doesn’t come back. There is no concrete information except for the information that they’re giving us.” \nBut Hamlin has a question for the Cavs’ point guard – one that doesn’t appear to have been asked in response. \n“How can he explain when planes both travel east and west to get to the same country in Asia?” Hamlin questioned Wednesday at the Daytona International Speedway just days ahead of the Daytona 500 . “How can two planes head in opposite directions and end up in the same place if it’s not round?” \nHamlin added he assumes Irving was being sarcastic, and he agrees with NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who noted that although he and Irving both went to Duke, they probably weren’t in the same classes . All-Star guard Kyrie Irving got defensive with reporters over his beliefs that the Earth is flat. pic.twitter.com/END2Eni6bD \n— USA TODAY Sports (@USATODAYsports) February 18, 2017 More NASCAR!
