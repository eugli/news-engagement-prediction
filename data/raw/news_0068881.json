Or, perhaps a better question is: did you make time to read last year? Amidst the hustle and bustle of living in the 21st century, reading for leisure has fallen woefully by the wayside. Many people find reading to be a luxury they can’t afford . For some, it is a question of time for others, money, and for many it is simply that they have fallen out of the habit of reading. Whatever the reason, reading for the sake of reading is not as common a practice as it used to be. Luckily, communities around the world have taken action to prevent this departure from the world of literature in the form of Little Free Libraries (LFL), and now they have come to Armenia. What Is a Little Free Library? A Little Free Library is exactly what it sounds like: a small library which belongs to the community and which people are able to use- for free. The way it works is that a library is placed in a public space where it is easily accessible, and members of the community are encouraged to take and leave books at their convenience. Ideally, you should leave a book every time you take a book, but of course there is no one policing the libraries. The concept is based on trust and a shared economy model in which members of a community share their goods and products with one another with the understanding that the return is not monetary, but valuable nonetheless.

T here are over 50,000 official Little Free Libraries in the world, spread over 70 countries- and yet Armenia wasn’t one of them, that is until two Birthright Armenia alumni decided to do something about it. Laurie Alvandian and Nina Romá Agvanian brought Little Free Libraries to Armenia with the mission to “promote literacy and a love of reading among people of all ages, backgrounds, and economic conditions.” With funding from the Birthright Next Step Alumni Fund, they were able to hire Four Peaks Landscape + Architecture to build the first fifteen Little Free Libraries in Armenia. So far, three of the libraries have been installed in Lover’s Park, Arami Street and outside of Aeon anti-cafe . Each library has an official “Little Free Library” plaque and can be found on their map of libraries around the world.

T he purpose of having the libraries in public places is to serve as a constant reminder to people that they always have the opportunity to pick up a book and start reading. The hope is that people will also start to read more in public, on the metro or in parks or wherever they happen to land, putting further emphasis on the fact that reading should be a social norm, not an activity reserved for academics. When a book is dropped off or picked up, a connection is formed between two complete strangers. They may never meet in person, but they have shared something- a story. There is an opportunity for the reader to pick up a book they might never have read otherwise. There is an opportunity for growth and personal development that is unique to the experience of discovering a life changing book. In a country with a 99% literacy rate combined with a high rate of unemployment, Little Free Libraries are the perfect mechanism for preserving and encouraging the act of reading, as well as the love we have for our communities. p/c: LFL taken at HAYP Pop Up Gallery “New Illuminations” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:37:42.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
