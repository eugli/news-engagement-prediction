Donald Trump introduced another alternative fact on Saturday. While speaking at a campaign-style rally in Florida, the president addressed the refugee situation in Europe, listing all the European countries that have suffered violent incidents related to migration. “You look at what’s happening,” he said, per The New York Times . “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” “Sweden,” Trump continued. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We’ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we’re going to keep our country safe.” To be fair, Trump never said specifically that Sweden has suffered a terrorist attack—but by the context of his remarks, it seems that he thinks the nation did. Compounding the issue, nearly all of the men involved in the attacks on Paris in 2015, as well as those in Brussels and Nice last year, were citizens of France or Belgium—not refugees or migrants. Swedes were quick to ridicule Trump’s remarks on social media, with even the former prime minister Carl Bildt tweeting his bafflement. \nhttps://twitter.com/carlbildt/status/833219648044855296 The Times reports that some posit Trump may have mentioned Sweden because of an interview that Fox News aired Friday, during which filmmaker Ami Horowitz told host Tucker Carlson that Sweden is suffering from a wave of crimes committed by migrants, which are then covered up. “Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago,” Horowitz said, “so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already.” A suicide bomber did injure two people in Stockholm in 2010, but that was before and unassociated with the current refugee crisis.
