ICE picked up Hector Suarez, 44, of the Dominican Republic. (Bryan Cox/AP)  17 PM \nFederal immigration agents this week collared a Dominican national ex-con released by the city a day after the feds asked that he be detained, officials said Monday. \nHector Suarez, 44, has a record that includes drug possession and attempted assault going back 20 years. He was most recently arrested on charges of biting a woman. \nDeported three times, he’s returned to the U.S. each time. He was busted in November on a misdemeanor assault charge in Upper Manhattan. \nA criminal complaint states that a woman alleged Suarez did “bite her on her hand, causing a small laceration, swelling and substantial pain.” \nOn Dec. 29, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) asked the city to detain him for deportation, but the next day he was released on bail following his arraignment in Manhattan criminal court. He was released on $2,000 bail with $1,000 cash down. \nICE agents picked him up last week and are now moving to deport him. \n“This is the case of another criminal alien, a felon, who was released back into the streets,” said Thomas Decker, head of ICE’s New York office. \nThe city refuses to honor federal detention requests for what they call low-level crimes, including misdemeanors, and they don’t consider past convictions when deciding who to turn over to the feds. Inmates convicted of 170 serious or violent crimes will be turned over. \nSuarez’s history includes felony convictions in 1997 for attempted drug possession conviction, in 2002 for drug possession and in 2006 for attempted assault. \nDe Blasio defends the city’s non-cooperation policy, saying it’s cruel to separate families over minor infractions. He has said he might expand the list of charges eligible for transfer but has offered no specifics. \nHe’s also said the crackdown on non-residents has made the NYPD’s job tougher by discouraging immigrants from cooperating with police. \nOn Monday Decker said he would “welcome” expansion of the list “in the interests of public safety and national security.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:38:31.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
