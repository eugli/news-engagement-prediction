Tom McClintock, and things got intense Julie Westfall \nThe scene inside and outside Rep. Tom McClintock's town hall meeting Saturday morning was at times raucous, and the California congressman ultimately was escorted out by police, according to multiple reports. \nKQED's Katie Orr reported that the 200 seats for the town hall set up by the Republican in Roseville, Calif. were filled, and hundreds more people remained outside. \nMcClintock is one of many members of Congress who have been encountering protests at their district offices or town hall meetings   took office just over two weeks ago. Most protesters have been asking members to fight the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Trump's cabinet nominees and Trump's temporary entry ban on immigrants from certain countries and all refugees. \nThe discussion grew raucous at times, according to Orr and other reports, and the many people left outside the venue shouted to be let in or for McClintock to come outside. \nAfterward, McClintock was escorted from the building by police. \nBefore the meeting, McClintock told The Times' Sarah Wire that he was expecting a big crowd. \n\"There’s obviously a great deal of political ferment and I suspect we’ll see a much higher percentage of left-leaning people at this one than we have in the past because the times are different, but I’m kind of curious to hear what they have to say,” McClintock said. \nHe couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
