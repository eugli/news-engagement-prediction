And they have experienced dehydration, extreme heat and cold. It is not a good situation,” said Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency Kota Kinabalu director Laksamana Pertama Adam Aziz.\nHe said if any of the six had died, their bodies would sink initially but would eventually surface again.\nHe said the MMEA was holding a solat hajat to seek divine intervention in its efforts to find the missing six. \nMMEA has also asked all fishermen along Sabah’s east coast to be on the lookout for the missing.\nAdam said the search involved 350 personnel of various agencies using 22 vessels and aircraft but inclement weather conditions in the evenings are hampering efforts, he said.\nOn Jan 28, the catamaran with 31 people on board comprising 28 Chinese nationals and three crew members sank at about 10am after departing from the Tanjung Aru jetty an hour earlier.\nThe search effort began immediately after the company operating the vessel reported the mishap to the authorities 12 hours after the incident.\nTwenty of the Chinese nationals survived their 30-hour ordeal at sea, while three died. Six are still missing.\nThe missing six are crewman Absoy Kasim, 26, and China’s Sheng Jiang Jiang, 50 (male), Luo Hong Yuan, 51 (male), Dong Mei (female), a woman in her 30s and a child believed to be aged 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:18:48.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
