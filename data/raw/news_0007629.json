Rihanna was cast as Marion Crane, the shower victim originally played by Janet Leigh, and Entertainment Weekly just shared the first two photos of Rihanna's Marion with Freddie Highmore's Norman Bates, plus a promo for the new season: \nExecutive producer Kerry Ehrin told EW that TV viewers will see a more fleshed-out version of Marion Crane than in Hitchcock's fillm. \"We're taking threads of that story and definitely using them so it's recognizable, it's just where we go with it is very different,\" Ehrin said. Season 5 picks up about 18 months after the death of Norman's mother, Norma Bates (Vera Fermiga), and since a boy's best friend is his mother, we know this is going to put Norman in an especially delicate mental state. \nThe final season premieres Feb. 20 at 10 p.m. on A&E.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:16:15.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
