He doesn’t shy away from voicing it, either. “We understand the situation that we’re in,” the sophomore forward said on Monday. “We understand that we’re right there in terms of tournament games and tournament play. We understand that these four games are very important. And that February was our most important month. “Right now we just take it one game at a time, but we understand we have to win out in these four games for sure to be in the (NCAA) tournament at the end of the year.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Tennessee (15-12, 7-7 SEC) enters the final two weeks of the regular season squarely on the NCAA Tournament bubble. USA Today has the Vols in the field as an 11-seed playing in the First Four. ESPN has Tennessee second among the “First Four Out” of the 68-team field. CBS Sports has the Vols out of the field and still off the bubble. “The biggest thing for us is we’re here,” Schofield said. “Everything we’ve worked for we have right here in our grasp. It’s just who wants it. I think we want it enough.” The Vols can prove it starting Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.) against Vanderbilt (14-13, 7-7) and again Saturday against South Carolina (20-7, 10-4). Tennessee enters the most important week of its basketball season with an RPI of 50. Vanderbilt is 49. South Carolina is 30. “At the end of the day, it’s all about what we do when we get on the floor,” Schofield said. “That’s what we’re trying to understand. “Every night, every possession is very important. We have to prove on every possession that we’re ready to take that next step at an elite level.” The Vols will travel to LSU (9-17, 1-13) and host Alabama (16-10, 9-5) next week. The Tigers have an RPI of 155. It's 74 for the Crimson Tide. “These next four games,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said, “determines a lot for all of us.” That’s an open discussion this time of year for the Vols. While it's business as usual preparing for games, they don’t hide from what could or couldn’t be on the horizon depending on how they close the season. “We talk about it, obviously,” Barnes said. “We get together every week and talk about it. “(The players) know where we are. They know. I don’t have to mention it anymore. They’re in tune, they know what’s out there.” The Vols know their public perception, too. Both how it works against them and how they have to fight to change it. “We’re still a Tennessee basketball team that they picked 13th (in the SEC),” Schofield said, “and we’re still not a team expected to make it to the tournament, we’re still the team that’s considered young and can’t play with anybody.\" That young team has blown five leads of at least 13 points this season. Schofield said Tennessee is still growing in the “mental aspect,” still embracing the idea that every possession is more valuable than the last. Buying into that mindset over the final four games of the regular season can get this team closer to their goals, ones they’re not afraid to talk about. They know there’s still plenty to play for. There’s still plenty to lose, too. “We do have something to lose in the tournament,” Schofield said. “That was our goal all season, to make it here. But at the same time, we’re still nobody in this country. “We’ve made a little bit of noise and we have one of the toughest schedules, but at the end of the day, the games we were supposed to win and finish, we didn’t do, we didn’t get them done.” Tennessee has two weeks, and whatever happens in the SEC tournament, to decide its postseason fate. To get it done and see what's next. “They know where we are, they know what we need to do,” Barnes said. “What they know is we need to work hard and try to win games.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
