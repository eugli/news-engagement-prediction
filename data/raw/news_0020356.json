With Kelly” star remarked that she probably shouldn’t share this tidbit about the couple’s sex life, before continuing: “When there’s special married couple time in our house — do you know what I’m talking about?” Ripa asked the audience. “’Cause there’s kids watching so I’m just going to say let’s call it special grownup time.” \n“He’s immediately mean to me afterwards and I don’t like that. I think it’s bizarre. He becomes short with me, you know what I mean? Like, irritated,” the host said. \n“Is that true?” Consuelos interjected. \n“I’m like, ‘Oh, now you’re irritated? You were so loving three minutes ago!” Ripa said, while her shocked husband burst into laughter. \nConsidering these two lovebirds have been married since 1996 , we’re confident they’ll find a way to weather the awkward admission.
