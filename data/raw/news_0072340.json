Case of mumps confirmed in Halifax day after 3 cases of measles reported \nMumps is an extremely contagious viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include low level fever, headache and swollen facial glands. It takes between nine and 25 days for symptoms to show, Suttorp said. She added people are extremely contagious before symptoms appear. \n“I don’t have a crystal ball but just like other diseases we’ve managed here, like whooping cough, and knowing histories of exposure and activity, I am expecting more,” Suttorp said. \nREAD MORE: Mumps outbreak confirmed in Toronto, may have originated in west-end bars: officials \nWHL teams play across Canada as well as the northwest United States. The Tigers played in Calgary on Feb. 10; they’ve traveled to 11 cities between Jan. 24 and Feb. 21. Players are being asked to stay home if they show any symptoms. \nA spokesperson for the Calgary Hitmen said no players on the team have been infected and there was no consideration of postponing the Feb. 23 game against the Tigers. \nThe WHL said it has been working with all of its teams and their medical staff to minimize the spread since they were notified of the mumps diagnosis in early February. \nMeasures include sanitation, early detection and quarantines. \nClubs are checking with families of players to determine vaccination histories. \n“My concern is that we have not had an outbreak of mumps in southern Alberta for 10 years,” Suttorp said. “So there are a lot of individuals who may choose not to immunize their children, (meaning) we have 10 years of age of kids who are not immune.” \nIn 2016, there were eight mumps cases in Alberta. There were nine in 2015, but as they were isolated cases, it was not considered an outbreak. \nThe overall vaccination rate for Medicine Hat is 89.4 per cent, Suttorp said. \nWith files from Brendan Parker © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
