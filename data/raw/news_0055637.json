Furniture and some office equipment at the office were damaged, they said. \nAsked about the incident, Pasha said government has been silent over the issue, “resulting in the drivers losing their patience, reflected in the ransacking of the Uber office.” \nTo a query, Pasha said both the government and aggregators were responsible for the present dilemma. \n“The government should prevail over the aggregators in asking them to adhere to the provisions under Karnataka On-Demand Transportation Technology Aggregators Rules, 2016.” \nAs per rules,rates for AC and non-AC taxis are fixed at Rs 19.50 per km and 14.50 per km for non-AC cabs, but drivers are given between Rs 4 to Rs 5, which amounts to exploitation, Pasha said. \nThe drivers also want Ola and Uber to stop attachment of new cabs as it affects their bookings, as also immediate stoppage of penalising drivers, based on customer ratings. \n“The cab aggregator penalises drivers for bad behaviour after the rider had given a low rating for them on the app,” Tanveer said. \nOn February 19, hundreds of drivers had staged a protest here against the Transport Department, asking for enforcement of the rules. \nThe pricing strategies adopted by Ola and Uber have not only affected their drivers, but also those from other unions, Pasha said. \n“A driver used to earn up to Rs 80,000, but is now able to earn Rs 15,000 only due to increasing number of cabs, which is causing traffic hazards, resulting in cut down of trips,” Pasha said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:42.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
