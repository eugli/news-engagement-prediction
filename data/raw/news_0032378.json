Changes in 2002 limited that to 25 return flights a year and further changes in 2012 limited it to 10 return flights. \nThe Gillard government scrapped it for any MPs elected after 2012. \nUnder Mr Turnbull's plan it will now be fully abolished for all but former prime ministers and their spouses. Mr Turnbull says he will not use it. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:20:11.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
