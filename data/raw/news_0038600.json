And for those hours-long spacewalks, NASA equips astronauts with special adult diapers to mop up any leaks. But what if they're stuck in a spacesuit for days on end? Not so easy.

MUST WATCH \nWhat happens to your body in space? 04:58 NASA has taken steps to address the problem and recently announced the winner of the Space Poop Challenge , a competition organized by its NASA Tournament Lab (NTL), hosted by the HeroX crowdsourcing initiative. The winner of the prize was Thatcher Cardon, a family physician, Air Force officer and flight surgeon, whose system \"MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System (M-PATS),\" who utilized his knowledge of keyhole surgery to develop his design.

Veteran astronaut Richard Mastracchio outlined the issue even more succinctly. \"As humans push beyond low Earth orbit, travel to the moon and Mars, we will have many problems to solve -- most of them complex technical problems,\" he says in an introduction video for the project. \"But some are as simple as, 'How do we go to the bathroom in space?'\" The Kelly twins: Revealing the secrets of the human body in space Longer-term solution needed Currently, if there's an emergency, crews can return to Earth fairly quickly, mainly because they don't currently go that far from the planet's surface.

More than 5,000 proposed solutions from a total of 19,000 registered competitors from over 150 teams from \"every country and continent on Earth (including Antarctica) participated, according to a press release. \"I never thought that keeping the waste in the suit would be any good,\" the winner Cardon, told NPR . \"So I thought, 'How can we get in and out of the suit easily?' \"I mean, they can even replace heart valves now through catheters in an artery. So it should be able to handle a little bit of poop!\" His design features a tiny airlock in the suit's crotch, through which items such as catheters and inflatable bedpans could be passed through. \"The Space Poop Challenge was a great opportunity to combine his love of solving problems and creating things with his background in aerospace medicine,\" his HeroX profile page says. Explosive, stinky star death captured by Hubble telescope Relief for winners Three winners will receive a combined total of $30,000, with Cardon taking home half of the total prize money.
