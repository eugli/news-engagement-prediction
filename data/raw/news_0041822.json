Knack was recently canvassing a neighbourhood just west of Starling where residents had similar concerns.\n“It’s definitely frustrating, and I hear it from time to time in different communities,” Knack said.\nWhile some residents in the Starling neighbourhood are concerned over the mess left behind, Siffledeen is not sure if it is an issue worth reporting to the city.\n“We do tend to see a lot of construction equipment left behind and garbage, debris flying all over,” Siffledeen said. “But not sure if that’s the norm, of if that’s poor housekeeping.”\nCouncillor Knack encourages concerned residents to file a complaint.\n“If somebody is sort of on the fence – ‘is it that bad that I should do something about this?’ If you’re at that point, I would suggest that the answer is yes and it’s time to call 311 to put in a formal complaint.”\nA bylaw officer will visit a property after a complaint is filed, and Knack is working with the bylaw office to make it easier for residents in neighbourhoods like this one to report multiple violations.\nWith files from Taylor Oseen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:11:26.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
