Joshi was evading arrest for his alleged role in murder of Congress leader Pyarsingh Ninama in Manpur.\nDewas' Industrial Area police registered a case against five persons - Pragya Bharti , Ramcharan Patel , Vasudev Parmar, Anandraj Kataria and Harshad Solanki. The matter was moved before a Dewas court.\nIn 2011, the National Investigating Agency (NIA), which was investigating the role of Pragya and others in Malegaon and Samjhauta bomb blasts, had taken over the investigation into the Joshi murder case in the wake of allegations that it was linked to the larger saffron terror conspiracy.\nThe NIA produced a charge sheet against eight persons in 2014. Apart from those by Dewas police, the NIA booked Lokesh Sharma, Jitendra Sharma and Rajendra Choudhary for Joshi's murder.\nHowever, the NIA special court in Bhopal found that the case of was 'plain murder' and does not fall under the NIA schedule of offences. The case was again shifted to Dewas.\nIn September 2014, a fresh charge sheet was produced before the Dewas court against the accused for murder (302 of IPC), destroying evidence (201 of IPC) and possessing and using fire arms (25 and 27 of Arms Act).\nRaghuveer Yardi, the defence lawyer, told reporters that the court found that the prosecution could not establish the chain of events and prove beyond doubt that the accused were involved in conspiring or executing the crime.\n\"The accused were acquitted on all counts,\" he said.\nThe court had recorded statements of 35 witnesses, including that of NIA officers and accused turned approver Dilip Jagtap, before pronouncing the verdict.\nFour of the accused were present in the court during pronouncement of verdict, he said adding the rest, including Pragya, were in judicial custody.\nPragya, who is undergoing treatment in a Bhopal hospital, did not travel to Dewas citing health reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:00:11.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
