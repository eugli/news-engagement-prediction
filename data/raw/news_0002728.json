A video of a child‚Äôs walk to school, a grandfather‚Äôs letter about what had changed during his lifetime and the obligatory Blue Peter badge were also enclosed. \nThe capsule was damaged when it was dug up but the contents are intact and will be reburied, possibly with more items added.

The first, including a Blue Peter annual and a set of decimal coins, was buried in 1971 by then-presenters Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves. It was dug up, along with another planted in 1984, in 2000. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:20:57.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
