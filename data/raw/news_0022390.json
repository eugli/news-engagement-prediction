Thanks for clarifying.\"\n\"Smail Ayad — the French man being held on suspicion of my daughter’s murder — is not an Islamic fundamentalist, he has never set foot in a mosque,\" she continued.\nEventually, the police also ruled out terrorism: While Ayad yelled \"Allahu Akbar\" during the attack, The Washington Post notes he was also reportedly \"infatuated\" with Ayliffe's daughter, had been rambling incoherently, and had stabbed a dog.\nOver time, the number of stories about her daughter's murder died down, and Ayliffe was able to grieve in peace — until this week.\nIn an attempt to justify President Donald Trump's immigration and refugee ban, the White House released a list of \"underreported\" terrorist attacks on Tuesday , arguing that if they'd received more media coverage, the public would believe the ban were necessary. Included on the list was Mia Ayliffe-Chung's murder and the murder of the man who tried to save her, Tom Jackson.\nOutraged that he would use their deaths to advance a political agenda, both Ayliffe-Chung and Jackson's parents took to social media to call Trump out on his false claims.\n. @realDonaldTrump An open letter regarding the deaths of the heroic Tom Jackson and my daughter, Mia Ayliffe-Chung: pic.twitter.com/e4oK5eey0H\n— Rosie Ayliffe (@RosieAyliffe) February 7, 2017\n\"The possibility of Mia and Tom's deaths being consequent to an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation through international collaboration on the parts of [the] Queensland police department and the French anti-terrorist force,\" she wrote in an open letter to the president, tagging him on Twitter.\nAyliffe went on to point out that none of the backpackers traveling with Ayad ever saw him pray, despite salat or prayer being one of the five pillars of Islam — pointing out that \"an Islamic fundamentalist by definition must respect the five pillars of Islam.\" She then went on to state that one of the reasons she had decided to write for The Independent after her daughter's murder was precisely \"to discount this myth of a connection between my daughter's death and Islamic fundamentalism\"\n \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred,\" she wrote.\n\"My daughter's death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,\" she continued . \"The circumstances of Mia and Tom's deaths prove that those with the strength of character to travel the world and learn about other cultures should be cherished as brave, resilient characters who have so much to offer if they are nurtured and given opportunities rather than defeated by adverse circumstances. Treating immigrants as disposable commodities and disregarding their safety causes deaths throughout our so-called civilized world, and my daughter was not just a victim of a lone wolf attacker with a possible predisposition for schizophrenia but of this disregard.\"\n@realDonaldTrump wake up this morning to see you've used my Son murder to further your campaign of hate, how dare you. You are a disgrace.\n— Sandra Jackson (@sandrajackson11) February 7, 2017 Jackson's parents expressed similar horror over the White House's inclusion of their child's death on their list of terrorist acts.\n “I’m pretty sure he and his advisors know full well — or could very easily verify — that Tom and Mia died not as the result of an act of terror but rather through the actions of a disturbed individual,” Les Jackson wrote on Facebook, according to The Washington Post . \"Of course, that doesn’t suit his agenda.\"\nIn a tweet to Trump, his mother Sandra Jackson added, \"Wake up this morning to see you've used my [son's] murder to further your campaign of hate, how dare you. You are a disgrace.\"\nFollow Gina on Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/WOTIfilm/status/828910643126398976", "https://twitter.com/RosieAyliffe/status/828912495205240832", "https://twitter.com/sandrajackson11/status/828915677620760576", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/mia-ayliffe-chung-mother-queensland-stabbing-backpacker-a7213821.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/the-white-house-list-of-terror-attacks-underreported-by-media.html?_r=0", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://t.co/e4oK5eey0H", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/07/my-daughters-death-will-not-be-used-parents-furious-over-trumps-false-terror-claims/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wv-terrorlist815p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.4aa1718cc280", "http://twitter.com/ginamei"], "published": "2017-02-09T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:30:33.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
