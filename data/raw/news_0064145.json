The charity found itself in the center of a scandal after a social media user saw its Facebook page and said that the name “Negerball” is offensive and “extremely racist” as it includes the word “Neger.” It is a German equivalent for the English word “Negro” and is considered by some as neutral or mildly negative in connotation.

Facebook promptly deleted the event page. \nThe controversy also provoked a heated debate in the social media that lasted for several weeks. The negative publicity forced the organizers of the event that to take a decision to rename it starting next year. \nThe next fancy-dress ball that is scheduled to be held in 2018 will have another name, Klaus Lesche, a spokesman of the KiRiKi Initiative – the charity group that organizes the event – told Bavarian Radio broadcaster. \nAccording to Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, the name of the event in the social media has been changed to “Negaball” so far. Lesche confirmed that the organizers regard it as a possible new name but said others are also under consideration.

This event has taken place 36 times already. It is well-known under its current name and from a marketing perspective it would be stupid to change it now. It is not about defaming anyone or spreading racist language, it is about raising money to help people in Africa. Our project provides 1,300 children in Africa with schooling and we also give out free meals to motivate children to go to school,” Lesche told RT. \nThis year the ball that was held on February 18 and, was very successful, according to the organizers, who said it was attended by some 600 people. Some of the participants told RT that the allegations of racism were absurd. \n“It’s ridiculous. The woman, who raised the complaint, should have learned more about the event first. The event organizers are collecting money for charity,” one participant said, while another one suggested that “the people who are complaining about our event just do not know anything about it.” \n“It is sad to hear such absurd comments and for event like this to be receiving negative publicity,” another man attending the ball told RT. \n“Negerball” started back in the 1981 as a charity event aimed at supporting the African people and was initially named “Youth dancing for Africa,” but soon the name was changed to “Negerball” as it was commonly used by participants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:16:52.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
