And sometimes that means chicken. In January, one very lucky young woman got a chicken nugget bouquet from her boyfriend because she doesn’t like flowers. Needless to say, the Twitterverse collectively swooned. \nAnnika Aguinaldo and Rico Villanueva, both 19 and living in Manila in the Philippines, have known each other since they were children. Last week, Villanueva put together a romantic surprise for Aguinaldo, who had once joked that she’d prefer nuggets over flowers: He gave her a bouquet made of McDonald’s chicken nuggets. “I was ecstatic!” Aguinaldo tells Bustle. “I didn't expect him to give me a chicken nugget bouquet since I had only been joking about receiving one, but more than the nuggets, I appreciated the effort he put into crafting a bouquet all by himself.” \nThis wasn’t the first time that the couple has bonded over fast food . According to BuzzFeed, they first hung out at McDonald’s, and have brought each other chicken nuggets in the past. Aguinaldo tells Bustle, “[Villanueva’s] whole gesture was absolutely sweet, but nothing that surprised me! It's very much like Rico to perform crazy antics since, according to him, he likes seeing me happy.” \nThey had their friend Eia on hand to take photos. Is this not face of a happy human? \nI told him I didn't like flowers, so he got me a bouquet of chicken nuggets, and I pretty much became the happiest girl on the planet pic.twitter.com/H6zLpud8wW — Annika Aguinaldo (@AnnikaAgs) January 22, 2017 \nSeriously, how adorable is this? Fortunately, the bouquet didn’t go to waste; Aguinaldo, Villanueva, and Eia snacked on the “flowers” after taking pictures. \nAguinaldo later tweeted the photos with the caption , “I told him I didn't like flowers, so he got me a bouquet of chicken nuggets, and I pretty much became the happiest girl on the planet.” \nAguinaldo and Villanueva didn’t expect the post to go viral, but nearly 40,000 “likes” and 10,000 retweets later, the chicken nugget bouquet is officially trending. McDonald’s Philippines even invited the couple to one of its locations for a date. \nWho would've known that a Chicken McNugget bouquet would lead to this? Thanks @McDo_PH for treating @RicocoPops and I to a McDate! ❤ pic.twitter.com/DqXYI26AE5 — Annika Aguinaldo (@AnnikaAgs) January 26, 2017 \n“The whole virality of the situation is something that [Villanueva] and I never saw coming,” Aguinaldo tells Bustle. “To us, what he did wasn't anything completely out of the ordinary for us, as we enjoy performing random acts of kindness for the other. Seeing all the lovely comments are great, though! I'm glad so many people get to see how lucky I am to have Rico.” \nAll together, now: A . Read the original article on Bustle .
