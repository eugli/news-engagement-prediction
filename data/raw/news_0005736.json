President Donald Trump signs executive orders as his senior team looks on (Getty Images) \nAnd it wasn’t covered because, well, there was nothing to cover. \nCritics on social media quickly poured scorn and ridicule on the advisor, who has frequently challenged the media as an outspoken apologist for her boss. \nFinally, the \"massacre\" was being discussed in the media, just not in the way that Ms Conway may have wanted. \nThe White House didn’t return a call for clarification early today, but it’s thought that Ms Conway may have been referring to two Iraqis - Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, and Waad Ramadan Alwan, 41 - who were jailed for taking part in attacks against US troops in their homeland. \nBoth men did live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, when they were arrested in 2011 - but there’s no evidence of them carrying a \"massacre\" or any other violent offence on US soil. \nMs Conway’s comparison between Mr Trump’s controversial executive order temporarily banning entry to the US to people from specific Muslim nations and a \"six-month ban\" on Iraqis allegedly instituted by President Obama was also debunked. \nMr Obama did order a review of vetting procedures for Iraqi citizens in the wake of the capture of Hammadi and Alwan, but it wasn’t a ban on travel to the US. \nThe debacle comes less than a fortnight after Ms Conway defended false claims made about the size of the crowd at Mr Trump’s inauguration as \"alternative facts\". \nShe said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave \"alternative facts\" when he described the Washington crowd on January 20 as \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.\" \nMeanwhile, Angelina Jolie claimed the president was \"playing with fire\" and risked making the nation less safe with his travel ban.
