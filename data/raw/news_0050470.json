Sydney FC’s unbeaten streak and are about to embark on another AFC Champions League campaign. \nYet the conversation has been poisoned by a portion of supporters in the Red and Black Bloc who decided to unfurl a homophobic banner aimed at Sydney FC boss Graham Arnold and expose the sport to another round of poor coverage across the country. \nThe club have kept decidedly mum so far, with Tony Popovic deflecting questions about the incident in his pre-Champions League press conference, and have until Thursday to answer Football Federation Australia’s “show cause notice” . \nThe RBB’s clear lack of remorse, via a social media post retaliating at FFA, as well as former Socceroo Robbie Slater for a News Corp column he wrote on Monday , sparked a passionate, concerned debate on this week’s Fox Football Podcast about the juvenile behaviour that continues to give the code a bad name. media_camera Wanderers fans cheer. \n“That is the greatest tragedy of all this: I’d love to be sitting here, on a Tuesday, we should be talking about Mitch Nichols and his wonderful performance (or) Milos Ninkovic’s opening 20 minutes, and how Western Sydney stopped him,” Fox Sports football host Adam Peacock said. \n“But instead, and on the day Western Sydney open their Champions League campaign against the biggest club in Japan … we’re talking about someone who held up a sign at the other end and the other morons (members of The Cove) down the other end playing seat Frisbee.” media_camera The banner in question, cropped. \nFootball fans often bemoan incendiary mainstream media coverage focusing on off-field football issues, or paying extra attention in reporting the behaviour of A-League supporters compared to other codes. \nSadly, behaviour like this simply opens the door to that type of criticism. \nDaniel Garb, who was on the sideline at ANZ Stadium on Saturday night, praised the atmosphere generated from the 45,000 supporters, declaring the “supporters’ group” atmosphere as good as anywhere in the world. media_camera Wanderers fans, known as the RBB celebrate after defeating Sydney FC. \nBut, he added: “I don’t blame mainstream media one bit because these supporters continue to let the game down with this nonsense. \n“Why they think it’s appropriate to put a banner like that up, in a family friendly environment, in a major arena, being beamed around the nation in prime time, is beyond me. \n“How (do) they think it’s acceptable to plaster that around the stadium like that ... and if you’re a father with a young child you wouldn’t want to subject them to that. \n“And the seat throwing at the end is the height of stupidity, ignorance and selfishness, because it ruins it for everyone. \n“The lack of remorse afterwards is alarming as well.” \nSimon Hill, a long-time advocate for more objective coverage and treatment of football in Australia, also bemoaned the doors such behaviour opens for criticism of the game, labelling it hypocritical for football supporters to use language often found offensive when used against the code. \nThe Fox Sports football commentator also challenged the juvenile behaviour of the supporters, demanding “can we please grow up” for the sake of game. \n“Let’s strip away the outrage of the misbehaviour … on a more basic adult level than that: it’s just not funny,” he said. \n“It’s basic, childish, behaviour. If you’re going to have a bit of banter with the opposition coach and get under his skin, how about a bit of word play or wit. Otherwise, this reduces us to the basic level of conversation that we abhor from other people. \n“Case in point, yesterday in the Daily Telegraph … we get yet another columnist writing an opinion piece … these are the people who we abhor for calling us sheilas, wogs and poofters , and this is what we’re doing in the stands! \n“Can we please grow up. media_camera Brendon Santalab of the Wanderers celebrates victory in front of supporters. \n“If you want to have some banter about Arnie, make it witty. Football fans are supposed to be above all that crap. \n“Come on, be creative, and stop giving us a bad name.” \nWestern Sydney’s supporters have become an iconic part of the A-League since the club’s inception. But in recent years, tension with authority and head office has seen the RBB become a more polarising group. \nAfter showing no contrition on Monday night, and pointing to other behaviour from other supporters rather than owning up to the criticism of their conduct, Peacock added that it is pivotal the supporters group does not continue to think they are bigger than the club itself. \n“The active support are a massive part of the football club; key word in the sentence is they are a part. \n“They are not the football club. You are a massive part of it. No one denies that. But don’t take that word ‘part’ out of it.” \nThe full podcast will be out on Tuesday afternoon.
