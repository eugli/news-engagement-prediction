(Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) Monique Garcia and John Byrne warned members of the largest state employee union to be \"careful\" about \"crossing\" the Republican governor by going on strike, suggesting that individual jobs are more important than the group's political standing in Springfield.\nThe comments by House Republican leader Jim Durkin come as members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 are voting on whether to authorize a walkout amid a prolonged contract battle with Rauner. \n\"They are dealing with a person who's a very determined individual, and he's a tough person. And he drives a bargain,\" Durkin said during a Friday taping of WLS-AM 890's \"Connected to Chicago\" that airs at 7 p.m. Sunday. \n\"But the fact is, if you cross him, I think you have to be careful. That's a situation, if you do that, you're crossing a governor who's, I think he's going to do what he thinks is best at the end of the day, which is not going to be in the best interests of AFSCME members and their families and loved ones,\" Durkin said. \nRauner's office issued a memo last week laying out potential consequences should workers decide to walk off the job, noting they would go without pay and health insurance subsidies. Their pensions also would not grow during that time, and replacement workers used during a strike could be hired permanently. \nDurkin said Rauner \"would have no problem replacing those men and women on the job.\" \n\"And I think it's a very, very risky proposition for them to take,\" Durkin said. \"I know their leadership is going to do what they're going to do, but their rank-and-file members need to realize that their jobs are important, we support them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:45:04.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
