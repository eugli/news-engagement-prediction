Article continues below \nFerrari's letter to the authorities inquired about Article 3.15 of the law, which states \"any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance must remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car\". \nThis stipulation, which effectively bans all movable aerodynamic devices in the car, has brought Mercedes' system into question following Ferrari's appeal. Article continues below Wayne Shaw reveals the real reason he ate a pie during the Arsenal game \nHowever, a technical directive is expected to only be advisory in nature and Green thinks any issues would need to be brought to the stewards to arrive at a proper resolution. \nGreen believes that the controversy could have easily been avoided and could now flow into the race in Melbourne on March 26, saying : \"Yep. I definitely can see it happening.\" \nHe also confirmed that Force India would not be part of any action and would wait to see what the stewards' decision regarding the matter is before responding. \nGreen added: \"I think I would have liked more clarity on the suspension side, that really has muddied the waters and it's unnecessary. I think it's under the skin, I don't think [the controversy] is great for the show, the fans don't know any difference, but it can be incredibly complicated, the systems being run, and expensive. \n\"For us there are marginal gains for quite substantial expense, so I would have liked to have seen all that nipped in the bud and not been allowed to develop to where it's got to now.\" \nThe query has come at an awkward stage for the teams on the eve of the new campaign when they are close to finalising their cars' designs for 2017. \nForce India has contemplated implementing a system similar to that of Mercedes, but will wait until the issue at hand has been resolved, according to Green. \nHe further commented: \"We've been testing various concepts for a while now, each has got some merits. \n\"For us we really wanted to see how the tyres performed and how the balance of the tyres.. Where the weakness of the tyres was. So that we can then attack that with a mechanical solution or try to help it with a mechanical solution. \n\"For us, we can't have all the options on the table ready and waiting based on what the Pirelli tyres perform like. So we have to wait, we're going to wait until we run the car so that we understand what the tyres are doing. \n\"And hopefully in that time, the FIA will give everybody some guidance to what is and isn't allowed. That's what we need at the moment.\" \nWith just days to go before preseason begins on February 27, any ruling by the FIA could have significant consequences for the teams. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
