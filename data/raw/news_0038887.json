But, as Vanity Fair pointed out , Murphy might have had to publicize the presidential theme prematurely this week thanks to reports Tuesday about Mark Boal and Megan Ellison's plans to tackle the 2016 election with their own political project. The writer stayed tight-lipped about other reveals Wednesday night, giving flabbergasted host Andy Cohen a \"maybe\" when asked if there would be a Trump character and not even addressing whether there would be an episode devoted to the horror of CNN's daily push notifications .
