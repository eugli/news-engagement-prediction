She walked out about three hours later with a new check-in date set for August, her attorneys said.\nSantos has received similar reprieves before, but she and her attorneys said they feared this check-in — the first under the Trump administration — might turn out differently. Trump has pushed policies to expand deportations, including of individuals previously deemed a low priority for deportation by immigration officials under the Obama administration. \n\"There was just a sense in the air that people just weren't sure what was going to happen,\" said Nick Katz, senior manager of legal services at the advocacy organization CASA and one of Santos' attorneys, of the atmosphere in Baltimore's ICE offices Monday. \"We were prepared to argue her case.\" \nSantos' attorneys also organized a rally outside of the ICE offices to show officials that she had support. Her employer wrote a letter vouching for her, Katz said. \nSantos has a 16-year-old son who is a permanent legal resident and a 9-year-old son and 4-year-old twin daughters who are U.S. citizens, putting her in a category of undocumented parents that the Obama administration said would not be prioritized for deportation.

Cuevas Ingram, another one of her attorneys, said Santos also would be subjected to domestic abuse by her father if she is returned to El Salvador, and is listed as a beneficiary on her husband's pending asylum claim. \nThen there is her pending lawsuit in Frederick, where she is \"a critical witness\" who must be allowed to remain in the United States in order to testify, Ingram said. \nThe case has attracted increasing attention as the Trump administration looks to bolster partnerships allowing local law enforcement agencies to assist ICE in immigration enforcement and lawmakers in Annapolis consider legislation barring law enforcement agencies in Maryland from entering into such partnerships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:26:00.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
