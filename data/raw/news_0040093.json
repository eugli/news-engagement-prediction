I have done a little for my agent, but I’d like to do something a bit more serious. I’d love to go back to work at Chelsea somewhere, somehow. \n“When you win the Champions League as I did with Chelsea, it is the ultimate. \n\"Just the feeling to know I have played in a team and won a trophy that a lot of teams would want to win.
