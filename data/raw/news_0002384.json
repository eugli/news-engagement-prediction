Credit for last night’s negotiation go to @miapetrakumpula — S&D Group (@TheProgressives) February 1, 2017 \nThe European Commission - the EU executive - will review the wholesale caps every two years and propose new ones if necessary. \nToday's deal still needs to be confirmed by the full European Parliament and member states. \nThe battle against roaming charges took on an added significance after Britain voted to quit the bloc last year in a surge of anti-EU sentiment and Brussels has sought to show it works for ordinary citizens. \n\"Today we deliver on our promise,\" said Andrus Ansip, European Commission vice president. \nBut after the agreement to abolish retail roaming charges in June this year, policymakers grappled with the challenge of who would foot the bill as telecom operators still need to pay each other to keep their customers connected abroad. \nThe quandary was compounded by wide differences in domestic prices and consumption patterns across the bloc, making a wholesale cap that suited all national markets extremely hard to find. \nCountries in northern and eastern Europe where consumers gobble up mobile data at low prices favoured lower wholesale caps to avoid companies raising prices in their home markets, effectively making poorer customers subsidise frequent travellers. \nHowever countries in the tourist-magnet south worried that their operators could be forced to hike domestic prices to recover the costs of accommodating the extra tourist traffic. \nDigital Minister Emmanuel Mallia said: \"Reaching a quick agreement on wholesale roaming prices was a top priority for the Maltese presidency. The decision is the final step in a process that started 10 years ago. From next summer, wherever they are travelling in Europe, our citizens will be able to make calls, send texts, surf and stay connected.
