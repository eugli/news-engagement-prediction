Deliveroo insists its riders can work when they want to.

Other than that it's up to you how many you want to do.\" Deliveroo claims its riders have flexibility over working hours but we uncovered evidence to the contrary. Credit: ITV News \nJason Moyer-Lee, from the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), told ITV News: \"The fact that they tell them when to work and they tell them how to do their job and they wear Deliveroo uniforms and they're under instruction from Deliveroo - all of that is evidence that they are not independent contractors, they are workers. \n\"And as such they should be entitled to holidays, minimum wage and all the other employment rights that accrue to workers.\" \nThe IWGB union is threatening strike action unless the company increases commission and freezes rider recruitment. ITV News went undercover to investigate what life is like as a Deliveroo rider. Credit: ITV News \nFrank Field, the Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: \"It doesn't get much worse than this, if you are about making profits but in the process exploiting the worker. \n\"What we've got here is the now-common ingredients of the gig economy.\" \nThe British boss of Deliveroo, however, insists its riders are self-employed. \nDan Warne, Managing Director of Deliveroo UK, told ITV News: \"The way that it works is they will provide us with their availability. We'll take that availability and we'll match that with consumer demand.\" \nThe company added that the majority of its riders are happy, but the evidence suggests many are not.
