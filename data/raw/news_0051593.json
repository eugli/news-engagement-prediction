As Kumar and Vijesh tried to get out, police nabbed them. \nTheir lawyers alleged that they were pulled out of the chamber by policemen in plain clothes. \nRead| Malayalam actor molestation: Rivals may have hired criminals to ruin career \nKumar, said sources, was taken away to an undisclosed destination for questioning in the case that again raised questions about the safety of women in the country. \nThe 30-year-old actor, who has worked in more than 75 movies, was allegedly abducted on the way from Thrissur to Kochi on February 17 and molested by a seven-member gang. \nIn her complaint, the actor said Sunil Kumar told her to “co-operate” as they were doing a “quotation work”. He also threatened to inject her with drugs and take her to a secret hideout, she said. \nThe “quotation mafia” is the Kerala equivalent of “supari” gangs – criminals for hire. It is unclear who hired the gang but accusations are that the motive was to derail the actor’s career. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:57:06.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
