And they kept them quiet.\nThe Gophers likely sealed their first NCAA tournament bid since 2013 with a sixth straight victory and ninth Big Ten win this year Wednesday in a 89-75 victory over No. 24 Maryland at the XFNITY Center.\nSprings, a senior captain, finished with 16 points on 4-for-7 shooting from three-point range for the Gophers, who won win their fifth conference road game for the first time since 1981-82.\nIt was the second victory this season for Minnesota (21-7, 9-6) against a ranked Big Ten opponent on the road, which had only happened once in the program’s history in 1996-97.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nFourth-year coach Richard Pitino’s team defeated No. 15 Purdue 91-82 in overtime Jan. 1 in West Lafayette, Ind. That still might be his best win this season, but this was definitely more important.\nThe Gophers entered Wednesday’s game with a Rating Percentage Index (RPI) rank No. 21 and No. 15 Strength of Schedule.\nThe Terrapins (22-6, 10-5), who likely fall out of the Big Ten title race with Purdue and Wisconsin, had a No. 18 RPI. That gives Minnesota a 6-5 record against teams in the RPI top-50.\nDupree McBrayer and Nate Mason led the way with 18 and 17 points, respectively, for the Gophers, who scored 55 points in the second half on 54 percent shooting. Jordan Murphy had all of his 15 points in the second half, to go with eight rebounds.\nMinnesota used 10-0 run in the first half to take a 27-21 lead after consecutive three-pointers from McBrayer and Mason.\nIn the first meeting, the Gophers led by 12 points in the first half, but they couldn’t stop the Terrapins three-point shooting barrage in the second half in a 85-78 loss Jan. 28 at Williams Arena.\nGophers coach Richard Pitino couldn’t get his team to figure out Maryland’s screen and roll action in the first half Wednesday to fall behind 35-34 at halftime.\nBut just like the Gophers did in wins at Purdue, Northwestern, Illinois and Rutgers, they withstood an early push from the home team and took control.\nMason’s layup midway through the second half made it 61-56. Pitino had to bench his rim protector Reggie Lynch after a fourth foul with 9:43 remaining. But the Gophers were able to play without Lynch for the last 9:46 and overtime in an 83-78 win Sunday against Michigan.\nEric Curry played well replacing Lynch at center against the Wolverines. The 6-foot-9 freshman made a clutch play Wednesday with a steal to set up a three-pointer from McBrayer for a 70-60 lead with 6:21 left.\nJordan Murphy, who was averaging 18 points and 15 rebounds in his previous four games, went scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting with one rebound in the first half. But Murphy’s second-half dunk fueled a 9-0 run.\nFour minutes later, Murphy drew contact after a pump fake. He finished the basket and converted a free throw for a 75-62 lead, which was the exclamation point.\nThe Gophers blew an eight-point lead with 2 &frac12; minutes left Sunday and needed a fifth overtime game of the season to defeat Michigan. But they wouldn’t make the same mistake against the Terrapins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:40:45.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
