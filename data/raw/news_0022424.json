The short-film nominees are often unsung awards-season highlights, too easily overlooked except for office-pool balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch “ Arrival ” three times or “ Toni Erdmann ” twice, you could take a remarkably wide-ranging tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as child-friendly charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful real-world material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Photo A scene from “Piper,” an Oscar-nominated short, directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer. Credit Shorts HD Animation Before it was a mighty fief within Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful start-up, and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year’s, “Piper” (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer), is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like “Moana” in reverse.) The parent-child relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou Hamou-Lhadj’s “Borrowed Time,” about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne’s “Pearl” ( now on YouTube ), about a rock ’n’ roll dad and his rock ’n’ roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual celebrity-voice-driven cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. “Blind Vaysha,” a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator’s voice accompanying eerie, woodcut-like images. “Pear Cider and Cigarettes,” the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses voice-over narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a self-destructive childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It’s available on Vimeo for a fee .) If I were voting, I’d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I’d never bet against Pixar.

The first, directed by Sélim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of “La Republique,” issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:11:49.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
