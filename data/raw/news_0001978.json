Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman who was raped by a man who even got his DOG to sexually assault her has told how the horrific ordeal drove her to the brink of suicide. \nThe victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, considered taking her own life after becoming depressed as she was left feeling so \"disgusted\" by the attack. \nHer attacker, James Aaron Laity, has now been jailed for 13 years . \nStafford Crown Court heard the victim was attacked while she was drunk and semi-conscious after she had been on a night out and been taken back to Laity's Burton home as a place of refuge. \nLaity, 34, filmed the sick attacks, including encouraging his pet Staffordshire bull terrier to commit a sex act, unbeknown to the victim at the time. \nIn her victim impact statement the woman said she was unable to put into words how she felt about such a degrading crime and was disgusted by the incident with the dog which she had later viewed. \nShe said she felt violated and had considered suicide and suffered depression, and most days cried herself to sleep. \nThis week she has bravely spoken to the Burton Mail and told how at first she had felt too embarrassed to report his attack, but she found the courage to go to the police, who she said treated her very well.

The trial was heard at Stafford Crown Court (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nOn the third day of a trial at Stafford Crown Court in November last year he had changed his pleas to guilty in relation to the attacks in 2014 and the indecent images offences. \nIn light of the pleas the Crown Prosecution Service did not seek a retrial in relation to the other victim, who had earlier given evidence to the jury, with Judge Eades ruling that the two rape charges should lay on the file. \nAt court Daniel White, prosecuting, said the woman raped by Laity at his home had been drunk and been sick in nightclub toilets. In the early hours she was taken by another woman by taxi to Laity's home as a place of refuge where she was sick again. \nMr White said the victim was disheveled, had vomit in her hair and had passed out and was taken upstairs by the defendant. The victim's friend had stayed in the lounge and did not leave until 4am. \nThe court heard Laity had been aggressive towards the victim and pushed her on the bed and raped her, and had filmed part of the incident. \nMr White said Laity had also encouraged his Staffordshire bull terrier named Warrior to commit a sex act which he also filmed. \nHe said it was clear from one of the videos that the victim had shown no response or movement during the incidents. \nWhen arrested Laity claimed he had been acting as a \"good Samaritan\" having looked after the woman and helped her wash and sober up and the subsequent sex had been consensual. \nHe had suggested the woman had instigated the dog incident herself and had also claimed she had made it all up to destroy him. \nAt court Laity was made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order and will be on the sex offenders' register for life. \nSpeaking after the sentencing, his victim said: \"I felt bad going to the police but if it stops it happening to more people then it was worth it. \n\"He is so convincing and looks like a nice person and doting dad that I was worried I would not be believed but I just want the truth to be out there. \n\"He tried to prey on vulnerable people. It's disgusting. I keep getting threats since reporting him but I came forward to help other people but I have been shot in the foot for it. I wasn't going to tell as I was embarrassed but he told people I was accusing him.\" \nShe went on to praise the police for how they dealt with the case and for the support she was given throughout.
