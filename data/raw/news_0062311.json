Barrington's Markus Hartman squares off with Naperville Central's Jake Keating at 145 pounds on Friday in Champaign. (Brian O'Mahoney / Daily Southtown) Michael Garofola Pioneer Press \nIt was a match that seemed bound to happen. \nTop-seeded Will Lewan of Montini and No. 2 Markus Hartman of Barrington eased their way through the 145-pound bracket at the Class 3A state meet. On Saturday, they squared off for a state title in the final bout of the tournament. \nHartman had not yielded a point in his three previous state matches, but Lewan prevailed 3-1. \nBoth juniors, Lewan (40-2) handed Hartman (44-2) his only other loss of the season at the Berman Holiday Classic in Palatine. \nBroncos coach Dave Udchik figured Hartman would concede a couple points to Lewan, the seventh-best 145-pounder in the nation, according to InterMat. Yet Hartman held Lewan off the scoreboard in the first period. \n\"Lewan is so tough, but Markus has been just as tough in peak form the last month of the season,\" Udchik said. \"But we couldn't get to his legs, didn't expect Lewan to sit back like he did, and that early second ankle pick and takedown was all that was needed.\" \nHartman could not fight back from the 3-1 deficit, though he came close with a takedown attempt with eight seconds remaining. \nIt was a tough ending to what was a brilliant junior season for Hartman, who two years ago broke a growth plate in his arm to end his freshman season before the state series. \n\"We found out just before regionals of the injury, but we still came down to Champaign to cheer for my teammates and get the feel of the experience of being in the arena,\" Hartman said. \"It really helped me a lot.\" \nLast season, Hartman finished fifth at 126 pounds, then got to work in the offseason as he bumped up to 145. He thrived at the Junior Cadet Nationals in July in Fargo, N.D. \n\"I knew when Markus came home from nationals at Fargo with a second-place and third-place finish in freestyle and (Greco-Roman) he was ready to make a serious run at a state title this year,\" Udchik said. \"The bigger the stage, the bigger the response we've seen from him, and it's been an incredible year whether he won a state title or not.\" \nHartman said he received interest from the service academies, and after he and his family took a visit to West Point, it didn't take long for him to decide he wanted to be an Army Black Knight come fall 2018. \n\"I loved the place immediately: The campus, the area, everything,\" Hartman said. \"It's what I am all about: Serving my country, and when I'm done, maybe I'll do something in the field of engineering or stay in the military. There's plenty of time to figure it out.\" \nBarrington junior Jarit Shinhoster (40-7) earned a fifth-place medal in a highly regarded 132-pound field. He beat Lyons senior Elias Garcia 5-2 in his final match. \nShinhoster beat Marian Catholic junior Carlos Champagne, the Class 2A runner-up at 126 a year ago, in his first match to jump-start his run. \nSt. Viator's Valentino barely misses medal \nJames \"Tony\" Valentino fell just short of adding his name to the list of St. Viator wrestlers who have won a medal at the state meet. \nIn his third trip to Champaign, Valentino came within one victory of a medal in Class 2A. He was eliminated by eventual third-place finisher Myles Ruffin of Brother Rice. \nValentino (37-2) entered the state meet undefeated and was the No. 3 heavyweight in 2A, according to IllinoisMatmen.com. \n\"I don't know what it is about this place,\" coach Jason Churak said. \"A dark cloud appears over James each time we've come here. \n\"We came in believing he could compete for a state title, and after his start on Thursday, it looked as though he was ready to challenge for a spot on the podium.\" \nHis quest for a title was derailed in the quarterfinals by Bloomington senior John Ridgeway, the second-ranked heavyweight and the eventual state champion. Ridgeway pinned Valentino in the second period. \n\"It's important to know that this weekend didn't define what James accomplished,\" Churak said. \"He broke or set countless records, helped rebuild our program and made everyone associated with Lions wrestling and St. Viator itself very proud.\" \nMichael Garofola is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:37:12.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
