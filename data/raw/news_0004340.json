Real cold.\nSwarms of people who showed up to Discovery Green downtown, where all the NFL pre-Super Bowl action is taking place, were decked out in the faux fur gloves, scarves, puffy jackets, and winter beanies that one might typically see in late January, during a particularly frigid night game at Gillette Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nTo visitors from the Boston area, it seemed unusual. But for locals, the layers were required attire.\n“Houston gets so hot here, so anytime it falls below 65 degrees, this is a must,” said Sal Ingrande, pointing to the Houston Texans winter hat pulled down tightly over his ears. “It’ll come out, and then a few days later we won’t see it for a couple of weeks. Until it drops below 65 again.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Ingrande, who was visiting the Discovery Green with his son, Vince, said they’re so used to the warmth, that whenever they get cool weather, they take advantage of wearing long sleeve shirts and winter garb.\nSteve Annear/Globe staff\nA fan wore gloves on a 57-degree day in Houston.\nAccording to VisitHoustonTexas.com, a website run by the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, the area’s temperate climate “sustains tropical vegetation and allows the city’s residents and visitors an enviable outdoor lifestyle.”\nThe temperature average for the month of February is a high of 67 degrees, with a low of 44. As for snow? The city has only seen 14 measurable snowfalls since 1939, the bureau’s website claims.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Alma Tamborello needed to wear a puffy jacket and a scarf wrapped around her neck to attend the Super Bowl LIVE event at Discovery Green.\n“We get some cold air, but not usually,” she said. “We’ve got to bundle up.”\nWhen a reporter told her that it was in the 30s in Boston Friday, and the city was hit with snow earlier in the week, she shook her head.\n“I would probably die,” she said.\nNatalia Rojas, of Houston, tried to explain the science behind why Texans are so quick to pull out the gear as soon as the temperatures dip slightly.\n“Our bodies get adapted to, like, 85 degree weather. The next day it’s, like, 40, and our bodies are like, ‘What’s going on,’” she said. “The wind I feel makes it colder.”\nRojas used her fandom for the Texans as an excuse for why she was wearing a winter hat bearing the team’s logo.\n“I’m just representing,” she said, trying to fool an un-foolable Globe reporter who was walking around in a t-shirt, unfazed by the weather.\nSherril Adams was more straight-forward about the whole thing. She wasn’t ashamed about wearing a jacket in what many from New England would consider a perfect day for a walk along the Esplanade.\n“I’ve got my coat on that I haven’t had on in two years,” said Adams, who is also from Houston.\n“I’m cold. I’m pretty cool, because I’m a cold-natured person,” her friend, Mary Stucey, added.\nThey were hoping for the weather to reach the 70s Friday, as they spent time outdoors. And they blamed the influx of New Englanders who arrived this week ahead of Super Bowl LI for bringing Boston’s chilly temperatures along with them.\nAlthough, in Boston, 57 degrees — even with a slight windchill and overcast skies — feels more like a spring day.\nJust ask Ethan Blanchette, who traveled to Texas from Lynnfield. He was walking around in shorts and a Patriots jersey, oblivious to the breeze.\nWhile riding on the Metro, Houston’s above-ground light-rail service, he said he saw people cocooned by scarves, hats, and full winter jackets. The scene seemed absurd.\n“This is like, April, March, — April weather, probably — for us,” he said. “It’s cooler than I was expecting. But it’s not bad.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
