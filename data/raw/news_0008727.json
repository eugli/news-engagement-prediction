This marks the highest disapproval rating of any new commander in chief in recent history.\nOnly 10 percent self-identified Democrats approve of the president's performance, while a full 90 percent of Republicans believe he is on the right track. For comparison, former President George W. Bush held a 57 percent approval rating at this point during his first term, with only a quarter of Americans disapproving.\nWhile other polls have shown Trump garnering wide support for his decision to halt immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the CNN/ORC survey found that 53 oppose the executive order. Another 60 percent oppose the president's pledge to build a wall along the southern border.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.
