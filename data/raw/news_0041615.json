Enter Song to Song , which stars Gosling as a struggling indie songwriter navigating the Austin music scene. Think of it like La La Land for hipsters. \nIn the first, frenzied trailer for the Terrence Malick-directed (read: very artsy) drama, we see music and love collide, as Gosling, Rooney Mara , Michael Fassbender , and Natalie Portman get entangled in a love rectangle of sorts. As is typical for a Malick project, the trailer is heavy on vibes and light on plot, but we do see tears, fights, and a lot of contemplative close-ups as Mara’s character wistfully muses, “We thought we could just roll and tumble. Live from song to song, kiss to kiss.” \nAlso, Gosling sings a song that is not “City of Stars.” \nSong to Song debuts at Austin music festival SXSW on March 10, and hits theaters on March 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:18:04.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
