Col. J.B. Brindle told The Washington Post the DoD is “working through appropriate channels … to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower.” \nAccording to the newspaper, the space would be separate from the Secret Service detail that is already based at Trump Tower in New York City. Melania Trump and their son Barron still call Trump Tower home. \nThe possible move could raise ethical questions about a government agency paying rent to a company owned by Trump. The asking price for the department’s space hasn’t been released, but renting a floor at Trump Tower could reportedly cost nearly $1.5 million per year. \n“I have never heard of a president charging rent to the DOD or any other part of the government so they can be near him on his travels,” former chief White House ethics counsel under George W. Bush told The Washington Post. “He should give them for free a very limited amount of space and they can rent nearby if needed.” \nBarack Obama made similar arrangements during his presidency. Defense officials offered to support for Obama and his staff at his Chicago home. \nTrump has already stepped down from several key roles in his businesses and left some of the operations of his firms to his children. He has yet to divest his financial stakes in his business interests.
