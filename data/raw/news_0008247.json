Maryland QB signee Kasim Hill. (Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports) \nHere’s some bad news for those teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision not named Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State or Florida State, to name a few: Those teams that win on signing day – as in consistently sign classes inside the top 10 nationally – end up winning national championships. \nThanks for playing, right? Not really. Across the FBS, teams are still putting together the sort of classes that may lead to championship contention, or at least compiling enough talent to challenge for an eventual berth in a New Year’s Six bowl. \nThese teams are working somewhat under the radar, overshadowed by those high-profile rivals standing atop the team rankings on national signing day. But for five major-conference teams, Wednesday was a surprising success: 1. Maryland \nTop signees: CB Deon Jones, QB Kasim Hill, RB Anthony McFarland Jr. \nD.J. Durkin and his assistant coaches worked tirelessly to sign perhaps the nation’s most surprisingly effective recruiting class. Need to rebuild your roster? The Terrapins did just that in signing more than two dozen prospects from their own backyard — Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey — and as far away as California. It’s a hard road to the top of the Big Ten East Division, but Maryland took a drastic step forward. \nMORE SIGNING DAY NEWS 2. Baylor \nTop signees: WR Gavin Holmes, OL Xavier Newman, WR R.J. Sneed \nBaylor had just one verbal commitment when Matt Rhule was hired away from Temple in early December. Two months later, the Bears will sign a full allotment of 25 or more prospects, closing with a flourish despite Rhule’s newcomer status to Texas’ recruiting circles. It wasn’t the best class in the Big 12, but the past two months proved that Rhule and his staff have what it takes to match wits with the conference’s best. 3. South Carolina \nTop signees: WR OrTre Smith, WR Shi Smith, DE Javon Kinlaw \nThe Gamecocks won battles with some of the region’s elite programs to sign a class that should finish inside the top 25 nationally. With help coming on the offensive line, at wide receiver and throughout the defense, this group will provide a strong foundation for a possible run at the SEC East Division title. It also puts to rest any questions the coaching staff’s recruiting ability. 4. Pittsburgh \nTop signees: OL Jerry Drake Jr., S Paris Ford, TE Charles Reeves \nPat Narduzzi built his program in Michigan State’s image, so it’s not surprising to see the Panthers’ recruiting efforts mirror the same style used to such effectiveness by Mark Dantonio and the Spartans. While not necessarily brimming with top-100 talent, Pittsburgh’s class includes a nice blend of immediate assistance and prospects who should develop very nicely in Narduzzi’s system. 5. Mississippi State \nTop signees: LB Willie Gay, QB Keytaon Thompson, DT Deion Pope \nTake the Bulldogs’ class and compare it the group put together by rival Mississippi. That makes MSU’s group look even better, doesn’t it? While Hugh Freeze and his staff scuffled, the Bulldogs signed a borderline top-25 class, according to 247Sports.com. Heavy on junior-college help, MSU also inked in-state standouts in linebacker Willie Gay and running back Kylin Hill. \nHIGHLIGHTS FROM SIGNING DAY Posted!
