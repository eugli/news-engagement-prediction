But Jazz wasn’t a normal girl – she was born a boy. She is one of the youngest people to be documented as transgender, and it has garnered her a following. The latest installment of this appreciative fandom is a doll version of the teen.\nThe Tonner Doll Company, which specializes in adult collectibles and high fashion dolls, is releasing a Jazz Jennings doll that was designed and sculpted by the founder of the company, Robert Tonner.\nThe doll will come with a pink shirt and jean shorts, mirroring the outfit that Jazz wears on the cover of her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen. It debuted at the New York Toy Fair over the weekend.\nJennings was cast into the transgender spotlight after being interviewed by ABC about her fifth birthday party where she wore a once-piece bathing suit. She has since appeared on several TV shows, including those hosted by Oprah Winfrey, Katie Couric and Barbara Walters.\nAnd now she’s a doll.\nThe transgender movement has suffered a heavy setback after the Trump administration rescinded guidelines set in place by the previous Obama administration for schools to accommodate transgender students in public schools.\nPrevious to that they celebrated a string of victories, including the Boy Scouts of America allowing gender to be by choice for new members , the NFL challenging Texas on their transgender bathroom rules , and the U.S. military offering transgender “safe space” training for millennials.", "external_links": ["http://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Teen-inspires-first-transgender-doll-414643833.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yD0zQ-CeDmM"], "published": "2017-02-24T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:49:24.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
