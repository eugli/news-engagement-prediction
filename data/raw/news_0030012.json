He was returning home after completing his shift at a store where he worked part-time.\nVamshi’s parents, Sanjeeva Reddy and Rama Devi, who live in Vangapahad, in Hasanparthy mandal of Warangal Urban district , were informed about the death by Vamshi’s friends. The parents were told that Vamshi was shot by a person who was trying to carjack a woman at gun point in the parking lot of the apartment.\nWe wanted him to come back: Vamshi’s family\n“Vamshi’s friends called me on Saturday saying that my son is missing and an incident had taken place where a person was shot. They later informed me that it was Vamshi who was killed,” father Sanjeeva Reddy told Deccan Chronicle.\n“He spoke to me on the phone just two days ago. He was worried about finding a job there. I asked him to come back and find a job here. We wanted to get him married. He said he would be back soon. We did not expect such a thing to happen,” said the father breaking into tears.\nVamshi studied at a local private school, completed his intermediate in Vijayawada and B.Tech in Bhongir. He left for the US three years ago for higher studies. He completed his MS at the Silicon Valley University a month ago. He was looking for a job while working part time at a local store.\nVillagers reached Vamshi’s home in large numbers to condole with the family. One of the neighbours, Vijay Kumar, said, “It is unbelievable that such a thing has happened to Vamshi. He was a good-natured boy and the only son. He overcame all obstacles and studied hard to go to that country.”\nLocal MLA Aroori Ramesh visited the family and assured them that the state government would do everything to bring back the mortal remains of Vamshi at the earliest.\nWorried parents plan action\nThe Telangana NRI Parents Association on Sunday expressed concern over the safety of their children in the US under the Donald Trump administration, and said it would take up the issue with the state government and the Centre.\nThe murder of Warangal student Mamidala Vamshi Reddy in Milpitas, California, has compounded their worries. Association president M. Rajkumar said they would meet minister K.T. Rama Rao, TRS MP K. Kavitha and, if possible, Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao to seek their intervention. He said the association was trying for an appointment with external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj.\nSome of the parents gathered at the Somajiguda press club on Sunday to discuss their future course of action. The association is trying to reach parents with children in the US to get them on to a common platform, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:26:55.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
