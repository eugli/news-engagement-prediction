Known for its southwest flavors and guitar-picking celebrity chef Dean Fearing, the restaurant will soon play host to one of the country’s best chefs. Announced via release, Fearing will team up with Chef Marcus Samuelsson of Top Chef & Iron Chef USA fame for a brunch that celebrates Black History Month. The brunch event is part of Samuelsson’s tour across the country in support of his new cookbook, The Red Rooster Cookbook: The Story of Food and Hustle in Harlem. This isn’t Samuelsson’s first visit to Dallas. When Pecan Lodge kicked open its doors in Deep Ellum, the James Beard Award-winning chef popped by for barbecue & beer. He’s also appeared at Addison’s Fork & Cork festival , and battled former The Mansion chef Bruno Davaillion in a Plano culinary competition in 2011, among other visits. The brunch, held on February 19, will feature selections from Samuelsson’s cookbook prepped by the celebrity chef himself. Seatings are available at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., and can be reserved by calling the restaurant.
