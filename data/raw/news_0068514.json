PHOTO: AFP \nFormer fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said on Wednesday that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has saved provisionally suspended batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif from possible imprisonment over corruption allegations. \nThe Islamabad United pair was provisionally suspended from the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) due to allegations of fixing. They were subsequently sent back to Pakistan from the United Arab Emirates. \nAddressing the media, Akhtar said that the method with which the board conducted the investigation has saved the batsmen from imprisonment. \nSharjeel maintains innocence, says bookie disguised himself as fan \n“PCB has saved both players [Sharjeel and Latif] from imprisonment,” he said, adding that the duo should be thankful to the board. \n“PSL fixing case should be resolved as per the law and should be investigated thoroughly [for future as well],” he added. \nShahid Afridi announces retirement from international cricket \nMeanwhile, the former pacer also said that Shahid Afridi does deserve some sort of acknowledgement from the board since the all-rounder retired this week following a 20-year career for Pakistan. \n“Even though as a player no one gives you a farewell, I can request the PCB to give him some sort of acknowledgement such as a dinner or a ceremonious function,” he said. “After all, he served the country for 20 years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:37:17.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
