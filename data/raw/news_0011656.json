She had the necklace shortened and the largest stone made into a pendant.\nThe photograph was taken and first issued in 2014 after being commissioned for the government’s “Great” campaign, which aims to promote the UK abroad.\nBailey took a number of portraits of the monarch, and when the Duke of Cambridge saw them during a visit to a “Great” event in Shanghai the following year, he said: “I love them”.\nThe photographer, whose famous sitters include the Kray twins, Diana, Princess of Wales and the Beatles, said at the time of the commission: “I’ve always been a huge fan of the Queen. She has very kind eyes with a mischievous glint. I’ve always liked strong women, and she is a very strong woman.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:11:35.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
