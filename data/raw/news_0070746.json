Canadian winters are so bitterly cold and snowy! What the hell can frost-fatigued, wind-weary, drift-dodging Canucks do to get some relief? \nWell, damn! Now, they can check out the “Winter Swear Jar” from Hotels.com. \nThe social media push from J. Walter Thompson Canada helps turn people’s profane tweets about icy, inclement weather into money so they can book vacations in milder climes. \n“We are monitoring Canadian tweets and filtering them for certain keywords,” such as snow, shoveling and slush, along with obscenity-laced expressions of seasonal exasperation and fatigue, associate creative director Denise Cole tells AdFreak. “We are aggregating the frustration Canadians are having with winter in a fun way.” \nEach approved tweet adds a quarter to the campaign’s virtual swear jar, and every time the jar fills up with change, a Canadian wins a $1,000 Hotels.com gift card that can be used for booking a getaway. \n“Social media provides us with the most culturally relevant environment to engage our consumer beyond a more traditional one-way dialogue,” says Laurent Abesdris, also an associate cd at JWT. “We plan to measure the shift in brand sentiment over the course of the campaign.” \nShit, this goofy video explains the whole thing: \nWhat, no shirtless Justin Trudeau? That would have heated things up nicely. \nAnyway, those $1,000 prizes can be used for booking accommodations almost anywhere, including balmy Lexington, Ky., home of creative director Whit Hiler and his Cornett agency. Hiler, the brains behind another notably jarring promotion from a while back, gives the Winter Swear Jar his seal of approval. \n“That’s pretty damn funny,” he says. “It’s not as funny as the buzzword jar, but it’s funny.” \nSo, come on, Canadians. Unleash those angry, anguished, obscenity-laced tweets about the slush and ice and falling temperatures (which look even worse on the Celsius scale). What the fuck are you waiting for? \nCREDITS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:18:18.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
