could imagine Naomie Harris as the perfect Girl Scout. Teachers doubtless would have said she had a good head on her shoulders. Over lunch in London, she drinks only sparkling water, having been a teetotaler for all of her 40 years. “I’m so Miss Control Freak,” she admits. “I could never imagine being drunk or losing control like that. That’s my worst nightmare.”\nThis makes her performance in Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight even more extraordinary. Harris plays Paula, the crack-addicted mother of Chiron, a bullied gay boy growing up in Liberty City, Miami.\nShe shows us Paula both as a woman trying to hold down a job and as someone in the grip of disease, the tendons in her neck straining as she screams at her son. She did plenty of research into crack addiction and worked with an accent coach over Skype. But first she had to let go of “a lot of judgment” about Paula. And to be convinced that this wasn’t going to be another portrayal of a black woman crushed by forces beyond her control.\nBlouse by Gucci, at 725 Fifth Ave.; 212-826-2600. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck Harris has always been determined not to fall into stereotyping. Her back catalogue bears this out — she played the survivor of a viral apocalypse in Danny Boyle’s dystopian 28 Days Later, Winnie Mandela in the film adaptation of Long Walk to Freedom, and the wink-wink-nudge-nudge Eve Moneyp­enny to Daniel Craig’s 007 (Harris was the only Money­penny ever to be bestowed the privilege of a first name).\nIt was Jenkins who convinced her, explaining that both his own mother and the mother of Moonlight ’s original playwright, Tarell Alvin McCraney, had been crack addicts. “During the time that I was shooting, Barry said that that was the hardest period, because he had to really relive aspects of his childhood that he wanted to forget,” Harris recalls. As Jenkins told the Daily Beast last year, “When you have this amazingly well-trained thespian performing so well that she starts to look like your mom … at that point it became this different thing. We were living out this therapy session I did not want to have.”\nJumpsuit by Emilio Pucci, at 855 Madison Ave.; 212-752-4777. Shoe by Mansur Gavriel at mansurgavriel.com. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck Susanna White, who directed Harris in the 2016 adaptation of John le Carré’s Our Kind of Traitor, thinks the acclaim she has garnered for her role in Moonlight is long overdue. “In Moonlight, you can really see her raw ability as an actress because you’re not distracted by her appearance,” she says. “I think in the past, her beauty may in some ways have distracted people from what a talented actress she is … I completely lost Naomie in that role. I totally forgot it was her. I was transfixed.”\nAs it happens, the day after Harris and I have lunch, Moonlight will scoop up eight Oscar nominations , including hers for Best Supporting Actress. There will also be a lot of media chatter about how refreshing it is to see so many people of color among the nominees after last year’s #OscarsSoWhite campaign.\nBlouse by Dries Van Noten, at Bergdorf Goodman, 754 Fifth Ave.; 212-753-7300. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck “I know that everyone thinks this year is a response to that whole campaign,” Harris says carefully. “When, in fact, these films were in production or preproduction for years before all of this. So they aren’t actually a response to that whole argument. So I don’t like the way that they’re used as a response to that. And people are saying, you know, ‘Isn’t it amazing in a year how things have changed as a result of that campaign?’ ”\nShe cautions against such complacency. As the child of immigrants (Harris’s mother came to Britain from Jamaica at the age of 5; her father hails from Trinidad), she is “massively” worried by the anti-immigrant rhetoric of politicians in both America and Britain: “Because the whole foundation of these countries — America in particular — is based on immigration. Britain wouldn’t be the country it is without immigration. So it’s madness. It just seems so retrograde to talk about these ideas now, at a time when the world is just becoming smaller and more interconnected. And now, to want to take a step backward, almost to the dark ages, where, you know, ‘We want monocultures and mono-races,’ it just seems really … yeah, regressive. And very sad.”\nI ask about her own experiences with racism. “The only time I’ve ever experienced racism — I’m talking about blatant racism — was in France when I was called a ‘nigger’ by a bunch of kids and hit on the head.” She was 16 and on a student exchange. “It was really shocking. I had never heard that word. I mean, I had heard it, but not used against me … I just thought, What idiots. I didn’t even feel afraid.”\nValentino fuchsia light cady dress, at 693 Fifth Ave.; 212-355-5811. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck Such fortitude comes in no small measure from her mother, Lisselle Kayla, who was 18 when she had her. Harris’s father left before she was born. So for a long time, it was just the two of them in their modest council flat in North London’s Finsbury Park. Starting when Harris was 5, her mother put herself through university. She couldn’t afford a babysitter, and one of Harris’s earliest memories is of sitting quietly with coloring books while her mother took notes during a sociology lecture.\n“I remember being so inspired by her work ethic, the vision she had for herself,” Harris says. “My mum used to collect these plates because she always said, ‘One day, we’re going to live in a really nice house and we’re going to be able to use these plates.’ ”\nFor years, her mother stacked them, unused, in the kitchen cupboards. “And then,” Harris recalls, “at 15, we got our house. And my mum finally pulled out these plates.”\nShe wells up at the memory, waving her hand in front of her face until the tears recede.\nBalenciaga red spandex dress, and Prussian blue pantashoes, at 148 Mercer St.; 212-206-0872. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck Harris always wanted to be an actress but doesn’t have a clear idea of where the ambition came from. By the age of 9, she was getting parts in children’s-television dramas. When she went to an all-girls school in Marylebone, she already bore the sheen of fame.\n“There was a lot of jealousy. I was a weird child because I was sort of well known,” she says, “but then I was very shy and very introverted, so I think that just wasn’t a good combination … It made me a target for bullying. Just no one wanting to be my friend. The head bully saying, ‘Nobody’s allowed to speak to Naomie today.’ ”\nThis is said without any self-pity. “I think she has an internal confidence, however insecure she might be, like us all,” says Danny Boyle. “ She knows she’s worth it. And she is! I’d cast her in a heartbeat as anything, really.” Boyle remembers Harris filming one scene in 28 Days Later in which she was required to hack an infected man to pieces. “And it’s merciless! And then she’s kind of elegant again in the next moment.”\nMarc Jacobs flocked denim jacket, at 113 Prince St.; 212 343-1490; Givenchy by Ricardo Tisci orange thin jersey crepe dress, at 747 Madison Ave.; 212-650-0180. Photo: Erik Madigan Heck I ask Harris how she feels about the Academy Awards. She gives an apprehensive smile.\n“It’s not going to happen. It’s Viola [Davis]’s year, you know?”\nBut will she write a speech, just in case?\nShe laughs. Harris recently witnessed another British actor, Tom Hiddleston, tie himself in earnest knots with his Golden Globes acceptance speech, in which he told a garbled story about his humanitarian work in South Sudan. A shot of Harris’s seemingly unimpressed face became an internet meme. Hiddleston later apologized. \n“I really sympathize with Tom,” she says, “because I think it’s so easy, under the pressure of those moments … to find yourself going down the path of telling a story and as you’re telling it, think, This is not what I want to say, it’s not how I mean it to go, but you’re kind of trapped on that train and you can’t stop … And then ridiculing a person for that … I just think it’s so mean!”\nAfter a bit more prodding, Harris concedes that she will be writing a speech. Like all the best Girl Scouts, she wants to be prepared for every eventuality.\nStyling by Rebecca Ramsey; Hair by Peter Lux using Oribe at Frank Agency; Makeup by Fiona Stiles using Fiona Stiles Beauty at Starworks Artists. \n*This article appears in the February 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine. \nTags: cut homepage lede spring fashion 2017 naomie harris moonlight oscars 2017 new york magazine   Most Viewed Stories Ivanka Trump’s Brand Issues an Even Longer Response to Nordstrom News Sean Spicer Chews and Swallows 35 Pieces of Gum Every Day Before Noon Chelsea   Neiman Marcus Has Also Dropped Ivanka Trump’s Line Something About This Photo Sure Feels Familiar People Are Taking to Twitter to Show Trump What It Really Means to Dress Like a Woman Sorry, There Are Actually Only Six Sex Positions Someone   Kristen Stewart Makes Pizza Rolls Sexy in This Saturday Night Live Sketch Trump Is Reportedly Obsessed With How the People Who Work For Him Dress   The Cut These Cats Behave Like Melodramatic Humans The Latest on the Cut 13 mins ago Naomie  \n28 mins ago The Married Woman Contemplating Sperm Donors This week’s sex diary.\n8:30 p.m. The Tenth-Grader Who Says ’80s Fashion Is ‘Extremely In’ “Patches, pins, and embroidery are huge — I recently embroidered an eye onto the back pocket of my jeans.”\n8:15 p.m. Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin Appear in This Striking New Book Photographer James O’Mara shot 1960s rock stars and fashion models.\n8:00 p.m. Drake’s Streetwear Store, Sculptural Vases for Valentine’s Flowers, and More What’s new in New York stores.\n4:32 p.m. Beyoncé Is Still Planning to Headline Coachella Twirling on haters well into her third trimester.\n12:48 p.m. Watch Taylor Swift Get Acoustic at What Might Be Her Only Concert of the Year Soak her in while you can.\n11:08 a.m. Ivanka Trump’s Brand Issues an Even Longer Response to Nordstrom News The beef continues.\n9:53 a.m. Chelsea   Beyoncé, shmoncé.\n9:13 a.m. Melissa McCarthy Debuts Her Incredible Sean Spicer Impression on SNL “I’m not here to be your buddy.
