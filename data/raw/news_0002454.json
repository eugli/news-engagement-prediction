Let the dreaming commence.\nThe 'Special Wishes' Porsche: Just 14 of these 911 Turbo Cabriolets were created by the German carmaker's Exclusive Department at a time when it wasn't even producing turbocharged 911 convertibles\nThe car featured in the sale has covered 11,000 miles since new and has the additions of 17-inch 'Cup' wheels, red brake caliper kit and upgraded stereo system\n1995 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet - Estimate: £728K-£850K\nThis is one of just 14 special-order 993 Turbo Cabriolets ever produced by Porsche's Exclusive Department, formerly known as the 'Special Wishes' office.\nThis 1995 car came at a time when the German carmaker was in a period where turbocharged 911 convertibles were no longer on the agenda, with the last production turbo cabriolet model before it available in 1989. So if you wanted Porsche's flagship sports car without a roof in the mid-nineties you had to make a special request and pay a significantly thicker wedge of cash to get them to build one - almost double the price of the coupe, in fact.\nThat's what German distributor MAHAG Porsche did, with owner Kaspar Haberl initially ordering 10 of the exclusive cars.\nAll featured the 3.6-litre turbocharged six-cylinder motor packing 360bhp, widened Turbo bodywork and rear spoiler from the 964. This particular one also had the additions of 17-inch 'Cup' alloy wheels, red brake caliper kit, stiffer suspension and an upgraded stereo.\nIn 22 years it has covered just over 11,000 miles. Incredibly rare and barely used, it's no surprise RM Sotheby's expects it to sell for as much as £850,000.\nJust 13 901 Cabriolet prototypes were ever made, all of which were a test bed to see how Porsche could reconfigure the coupe into a convertible\nThe interior and exterior are untouched from when it was made at the Porsche factory. The only modification made by the second private owner was the installation of a period-correct 2.0-litre six-cylinder engine\n1964 Porsche 901 Cabriolet Prototype - Estimate: £728K-£850K In the world of collectible classics four individual words can have a huge impact on value: 'first', 'last', 'only' and 'original'. That makes this prototype 901 Cabriolet a bingo car, as it ticks all four terms.\nIt's the oldest Porsche 901 on record and the only Cabriolet prototype in existence. Most of the 13 factory-produced test models built between 1963 and 1964 went to the crusher soon after the project was dropped in favour of the easier-to-build Targa, making this a very special car indeed.\nIt was saved by German collector and racing driver Manfred Freisinger who struck a deal with Porsche to take the prototype off their hands in 1967. He held it in his collection until 2001 when an American fanatic stumbled across it and offered a 356 B Carrera GS in exchange.\nAfter being fitted with a period-correct 2.0-litre flat-six engine it was sold just a year later to a British sports car enthusiast, where it has remained unmodified with the original interior, paintwork and components.\nNot just rare, this is a unique Porsche that set a precedent for all roofless 911s that have followed.\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Can you find cheaper car insurance? Compare with our MoneySupermarket-powered search\nThis two-owner F40 is a highly desirable spec without catalytic converters and fitted with non-adjustable suspension\nThe first owner kept the car for 25 years until his death.

In that time it was stolen and quickly recovered undamaged, though the collector's mechanic was mistakenly held in prison for a night after being stopped by police returning the vehicle to its rightful keeper. 'Of course you're the owner's mechanic, sir, Come with us, please...'\nRecently inspected and certified by Ferrari's Classiche department in Modena, this should be in high demand.\nJust 72 OSCA MT4s were known to be produced, designed specifically for lightweight race series and hill climbs\nThe car has been restored in recent years, as you can tell from the tear-free leather seats (left). It has also been competing well into its half-century life, taking part in the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed (pictured right)\n1954 OSCA MT4 - Estimate: £835K-£1M If modern-classic supercars aren't your bag, how about a vintage lightweight racer, like this OSCA (standing for Officine Specializzate Costruzioni Automobili) MT4?\nIt was the brainchild of the Maserati brothers who wanted to focus on creating featherweight race cars with tube-frame chassis. Earlier models were powered by twin-cam 750cc inline four-cylinder engines, though later versions like this one had more potent 1.5-litre motors.\nThis example competed in its heyday, entering a variety of circuit and hill-climb events as one of just 72 known examples to be built.\nAnd the veteran has still got the bug today, with the latest owner racing it in the 2009 and 2010 Mille Miglia, 2009 Nürburgring OGP classic and 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed (as pictured above).\nIf RM Sotheby's prediction is right, it should break the £1m barrier at Wednesday's sale.\nGentleman's GT car: This Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet is number 199 out of 200 Series II models built\nThe car has had owners around the world, though it's been in the UK for the last 22 years. The engine was recently rebuilt, while the interior looks to be in stunning condition\n1962 Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet - Estimate: £835K-£1.03M Just 200 Series II 250 GT Cabriolets came off the production line, and this 1962 example is the second-to-last to emerge.\nPowered by a 3.0-litre V12 engine with 240bhp, the cabriolet was far from the race-ready 250GT coupes, instead using a 12-cylinder lump to provide a gentleman's driving tool.\nAfter spells in Italy, America and Belgium, this car came to the UK in 1995 and has resided here since. Sold with a factory-made hardtop, it has the essential addition to withstand winter in the UK.\nIt has certainly been used by the current holder - the consignor has driven it to Spain and back a number of times, which might explain the engine rebuild in 2014.\nRM Sotheby's say it is a 'highly interesting example of one of Ferrari's true open-top GT cars'. We say 'Cha-Ching' - this one is going for big bucks.\nJust 27 Porsche 959 Sports were ever made. This one available at the auction is number 11\nIn the engine bay is a 515bhp, 2.8-litre, twin-turbocharged six-cylinder motor. The 959 was way ahead of its time, featuring adjustable suspension and four wheel drive never seen before on a production car of this type\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video If your fiver does this when rubbed it could be worth £50,000\nWatch video How to profit from property in the world's best cities\nWatch video Investing Show: Where to invest for the best dividends\nWatch video Investing Show: Will 2017 be a good year for investors?\nWatch video Why has the FTSE 100 risen and can it continue?\nWatch video Investing Show: Can the FTSE 100 continue its run in 2017?\nWatch video Ford Mustang scores low in Euro NCAP safety test\nWatch video The Volvo S90 scores high in Euro NCAP safety test\nWatch video Man wins Bentley a decade after bet with businessman\nWatch video Investing Show: Is gold set to rise again?\nWatch video Investing Show: Are supermarkets back on the up?\nWatch video We strike a new 12-sided £1 coin at the Royal Mint\n1988 Porsche 959 Sport - Estimate: £1.3M-£1.7M While the Ferrari F40 took its top speed crown, the Porsche 959 certainly hasn't been defeated in the rising value race, as this 1988 version exemplifies.\nThe 959 is deservedly an icon. Way ahead of its time, it pioneered adjustable suspension, intelligent four-wheel-drive, tyre-pressure sensors and super-lightweight hollow-spoke magnesium wheels in a production sports car that could be used on the road.\nThis isn't a standard 959, either - this is one of just 29 Sport models made. That means it has a leather-wrapped roll cage with four-point racing harnesses, more conventional coil-over suspension and is stripped of air conditioning and a stereo to save around 100kg.\nThis is chassis number 011 using an unmodified 515bhp, 2.8-litre, twin-turbocharged six-cylinder powerplant. Even the original paintwork remains in incredible condition.\nThe auction house says this one is arguably 'the finest example of its breed' and 'worthy of the best Porsche collections in the world'.\nVerde Pino is a rarely seen Ferrari colour, though it was the factory tone of this particular 275 GTB\nShort-nosed 275 GTBs are tougher to get hold of, with just 250 produced between 1964 and 1965. This example comes with Ferrari Classiche verification and the original drivetrain\n1965 Ferrari 275 GTB by Scaglietti - Estimate: £1.5M-£1.9M There's no question that 275 GTBs are in limited supply these days, and earlier short-nose versions are more sought after than their beakier successors. With just 250 made, they're undoubtedly hard to come across today.\nWhich makes the availability of this 1965 version a rare opportunity for any collector.\nChassis number 07341 has been verified by Ferrari Classiche as one of these rampaging unicorns. Powered by a 3.3-litre V12 engine, it produced 280bhp when it broke cover for the first time at the 1964 Paris Motor Show.\nOfficial paperwork says it left the factory in 'Verde Pino' green with a beige leather interior, though an extensive file on the car shows it has previously been red with a yellow stripe and entirely 'Rosso' for some periods of its life.\nThe latest owner - another UK-based Ferrari collector - returned it to the original colour combination as it has remained today. Rare is certainly the operative word for this one.\nJust 121 Ferrari 365 GTB Daytona Spiders were ever produced, and this is number 88\nAn extensive history file shows the car has been maintained and restored to factory standards throughout its life. It was originally ordered for the US market with the additions of air-con, a radio and an instrument cluster converted to miles\n1973 Ferrari 365 GTB Daytona Spider - Estimate: £1.5M-£2M You get the way this list is going - small production convertibles with dedicated owners and all the original parts in their right places. Guess what? This '70s Ferrari is no different.\nIt's one of 121 365 GTB Daytona Spiders made, featuring a 353bhp 4.4-litre V12 motor and one of the sveltest bodies ever chiselled by Pininfarina. The pointed shark nose, the impossibly long bonnet, the slab-back rear deck - it's hard to predict where your eyes will want to navigate first.\nThis is number 88 of the limited run that was originally ordered for the US market and specified with factory air conditioning, radio and an instrument cluster in miles.\nDuring its existence it has called Nevada, Miami, Pennsylvania and most recently Switzerland home, in which time it has been fully restored and resprayed in the same 'Rosso Chiaro' red paintwork the Modena factory graced it with in 1973.\nThis is the first time it's been made available for sale in 15 years and it will be sold with just 20,314 miles on the odometer.\nJust seven wide-bodied second-generation Alfa Romeo Tipo racers were produced for the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix team to campaign in 1934 and 1935. This was number six in that limited run\nThe other end of that side-mounted exhaust is linked to a 2.9-litre inline eight-cylinder engine producing 255bhp. As seen in the picture, right, it has recently appeared at the Goodwood Revival event\n1934 Alfa Romeo Tipo B P3 - Estimate: £3.2M-£4.25M Seven. That's how many second-series wide-body Alfa Romeo Tipo Grand Prix racers were made. This beauty is number six.\nMuch of its value is determined by the enormous impact the model had on the GP scene. That's because the single-seat Tipo, the first of its kind in Grand Prix, defeated Ferrari's own 8C Monza in a race in 1933 - a result that saw the official Scuderia squad dump their own car in favour of the monoposto Alfa, winning three races that season.\nIn 1934, formula rules changed to demand wider and heavier cars, and Alfa complied by widening the bodywork to produce seven models with an upgraded 2.9-litre inline eight-cylinder engine under a never-ending hood. Linked to a three-speed manual gearbox, it produced 255bhp of visceral power. This is one of those examples.\nThe expansive documentation file confirms that chassis number 50006 has ‘a substantially unbroken provenance line extending from the Scuderia Ferrari to the present owner’, confirming its authenticity as a true Scuderia Ferrari-campaigned vehicle and a true piece of motorsport history. The car is further documented by an FIA Heritage Certificate, issued in 2007.\nThis is chassis number 001 - the first Porsche 917 Can-Am Spyder to be produced. Used extensively for testing and raced in numerous championships, it has iconic race car heritage\nTest drivers spent hours at the wheel in on skidpans and circuits to fine-tuned the 917 Spyder. RM Sotheby's says this 001 car used a number of different nose designs through its development period, which might go some way to explain why the Gulf front end doesn't match the rest of the car and the panel is scattered with tape\n1970 Porsche 917 Spyder Prototype - Estimate: £3.9M-£4.7M Remember the 1971 film Le Mans featuring Steve McQueen? The Porsche 917 was his weapon of choice. This is one of the prototype cars that spearheaded the development of that car, which is considered one of Porsche's most important racers of all time.\nWhy is it so highly regarded? The 917 was the car that won the Stuttgart manufacturer its maiden 24-hour Le Mans race win with back-to-back victories at the French circuit in 1970 and 1971. It went on to dominate the Can-Am Championship a year later. To make that happen this vehicle was tallying up the miles in the wind-tunnel and at test-tracks to help technicians fine-tune the roofless competition cars.\nThis chassis also served as the test-bed for the turbocharged flat-12s that dominated Group 7 Prototype racing. A variety of other engine configurations - including a 4.5-litre Turbo, a 5-litre naturally aspirated to a 5-litre Turbo - have graced the rear engine bay in its early years.\nThe powerplant fitted today is a 600bhp-plus 5.0-litre opposed 12-cylinder unit. Translated to simple English that means loud and fast.\nJust 13 917/10 chassis were ever made, this being number 001. A staple of motor racing history, the next owner will have to conjure up around £4 million to take it home, mis-matched panels, duct tape and all.\nVarious engine layouts were tested in this prototype car. The current engine is a 600bhp-plus 5.0-litre opposed 12-cylinder unit", "external_links": ["http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/car-insurance-finder", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-02T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:52:30.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
