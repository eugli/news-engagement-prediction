"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Feb 27, 2017 at 1:07p ET 0Shares 1950: Alfa Romeo 158 \nGiuseppe Farina won the first ever Formula One World Championship race and the championship behind the wheel of the Alfa Romeo 158, a car that won each race that it entered in 1950. LAT Photographic 1951: Alfa Romeo 159 \nWith three race wins, Juan Manuel Fangio picked off his first of five championships behind the wheel of the Alfa Romeo 159, which was an upgraded version of the Alfa Romeo 158 that had dominated in 1950. LAT Photographic 1952: Ferrari 500 \nF1 was run to F2 regulations in 1952 and 1953, and the Ferrari 500 became the top car. Alberto Ascari dominated the 1952 World Championship in his Ferrari 500, winning six out of the eight races that season. He did not enter the Swiss GP and retired in a Ferrari 375 at the Indy 500. LAT Photographic 1953: Ferrari 500 \nAlberto Ascari became Formula One’s first two-time World Champion, again behind the wheel of the Ferrari 500, in 1953. LAT Photographic 1954: Maserati 250F/Mercedes-Benz W196 \nJuan Manuel Fangio started the 1954 season winning races in the Maserati 250F (pictured) during the 2.5 liter of F1, that was until the Mercedes-Benz W196 came along, in which he switched to and won a further four more races. LAT Photographic 1955: Mercedes-Benz W196 \nJuan Manuel Fangio and Mercedes continued to be a winning combination in 1955. However, following the 1955 Le Mans tragedy, Mercedes withdrew from motorsports. The Mercedes-Benz W196 won both World Championships it competed in. LAT Photographic 1956: Lancia-Ferrari D50 \nThe Lancia-Ferrari D50 featured many innovative features from its day including an off-centered engine to help give it an aerodynamic advantage. Adding further proof that he could win the World Championship behind the wheel of anything, Juan Manuel Fangio moved to Ferrari in 1956 and won his fourth championship. LAT Photographic 1957: Maserati 250F \nBack in the same car that he had taken to two race wins in 1954, Juan Manuel Fangio sealed his fifth and final World Championship with his final win at the 1957 German Grand Prix, considered one of the greatest motor racing victories ever. LAT Photographic 1958: Ferrari Dino 246 \nThe Ferrari Dino 246 was the first V6-powered car to win a Grand Prix and, in 1960, the last front-engined F1 car to win a Grand Prix. Mike Hawthorn became Great Britain’s first World Champion behind the wheel of the Ferrari Dino 246 in 1958. After winning the World Championship, he retired from the sport, and was killed in a road traffic accident just a few months later. LAT Photographic 1959: Cooper T51 \nJack Brabham won the 1959 World Championship by pushing his Cooper T51 across the finishing line at Sebring in the finale after it had ran out of fuel. It was the first rear-engined car to win the World Championship. LAT Photographic 1960: Cooper T53 \nJack Brabham competed in a Cooper T51 at the season-opener, but it was the Cooper T53 that got him five consecutive victories during the season en route to his second World Championship. It was the last World Championship to be held in the 2.5-liter era. LAT Photographic 1961: Ferrari 156 \nFor 1961, F1’s new regulations reduced engine displacement from 2.5 to 1.5 liters. Ferrari’s 156 helped get Phil Hill his only World Championship. Phil Hill is currently the only U.S.-born driver to win the World Championship. LAT Photographic 1962: BRM P57 \nBRM had been caught off-guard with the shift from 2.5 to 1.5-liter engines in 1961, but by 1962 they had got their act together. Unrelated to Phil Hill, Graham Hill won the World Championship behind the wheel of a BRM P57 in 1962, taking four wins in nine races. LAT Photographic 1963: Lotus 25 \nJim Clark raced for Lotus during his entire F1 career, which spanned from 1960-1968. His first World Championship came behind the wheel of the Lotus 25 in 1963, when he took seven wins in 10 races. The car was revolutionary in that it featured the first fully-stressed monocoque chassis to appear in F1. LAT Photographic 1964: Ferrari 158 \nJohn Surtees remains the only racer to have ever won the World Championship on two wheels and four. He won the 500cc motorcycle World Championship in 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1960 before winning the Formula One World Championship in 1964 in the Ferrari 158, the successor to the championship-winning Ferrari 156. LAT Photographic 1965: Lotus 33 \nJim Clark won six races during the 1965 Formula One World Championship, five of which came behind the wheel of the Lotus 33. He also won the French GP in the Lotus 25. The Lotus 33 was very similar to its predecessor. LAT Photographic 1966: Brabham BT19 \nIn 1966, Jack Brabham picked up his third and final Formula One World Championship but, more significantly, became the first and only driver to win the World Championship in a car that bore his name. Only one BT19 was ever built. LAT Photographic 1967: Brabham BT24 \nDenny Hulme drove the Brabham BT20, BT19 and BT24 during the 1967 season, the latter of which he drove to six podium finishes, with the car’s reliability helping them defeat Lotus. LAT Photographic 1968: Lotus 49B \nThe Lotus 49 competed in Formula One from 1967-1970, with the team never finishing worse than third in the constructor’s standings. The car was revolutionary in its chassis configuration and was the first F1 car to feature mounted wings. Graham Hill’s 1968 title was his second and final title, and gave Lotus a boost following the death of their driver Jim Clark earlier in the year. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1969: Matra MS80 \nLike the Lotus 49, the Matra MS80 was one of the first F1 cars to feature wings. Built in France, the car is the only non-Ferrari to be built outside of England and go on to win the Constructors’ Championship. Jackie Stewart won five races in the Matra MS80 in 1969, and one in the Matra MS10. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1970: Lotus 72C \nThe Lotus 72 was innovative in that it brought the wedge-shape to F1. However, Jochen Rindt, who also won the Monaco GP in a Lotus 49 this year, had doubts about the car, and won the World Championship posthumously after a fatal crash at Monza. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1971: Tyrrell 003 \nEssentially an upgraded Tyrrell 001, the Tyrrell 003 won in the hands of Jackie Stewart in its first race at the 1971 Spanish GP. Stewart went on to win five more races that season. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1972: Lotus 72D \nEmerson Fittipaldi became the youngest Formula One World Champion in 1972 with the dominant Lotus 72D, which took him to five wins that season. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1973: Tyrrell 006 \nJackie Stewart started the 1973 season behind the wheel of the Tyrrell 005, but it was the 006 that took him to five wins en route to his third and final title. His teammate Francois Cevert was killed ahead of the season-ending United States Grand Prix behind the wheel of a Tyrrell 006, causing Stewart to withdraw ahead of what would’ve been his 100th GP. However, he still won the title. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1974: McLaren M23 \nThe McLaren M23 was a hit for the McLaren F1 team, winning races each year from 1973-1976 and taking its drivers to two World Championship titles. Fittipaldi’s 1974 title was the second and last of his career. LAT Photographic 1975: Ferrari 312T \nThe 1975 championship didn’t start off on the right foot for Niki Lauda, but once the Ferrari 312T came along things began to look up as the Austrian took the car to five race wins. A simple design helped various renditions of the car take the World Championship four times in a span of five years. LAT Photographic 1976: McLaren M23 \nJames Hunt won the much-documented and controversial 1976 World Championship behind the wheel of his McLaren M23, helped following a severe crash for Niki Lauda at the 1976 German Grand Prix in his Ferrari 312T2. Lauda had a chance to win the title at the season-finale in Japan but withdrew from the race due to the conditions. LAT Photographic 1977: Ferrari 312T2 \nNiki Lauda only won three out of the 15 races during the 1977 season, but his consistency was enough to give him his second World Championship behind the wheel of the Ferrari 312T2. LAT Photographic 1978: Lotus 79 \nMario Andretti begun his championship-winning season behind the wheel of the Lotus 78, but it was the Lotus 79 that took him to five of his six wins that season. The Lotus 79 is remembered as one of the most revolutionary and beautiful cars in F1 history, and was the first F1 car to fully take advantage of ground effects aerodynamics. LAT Photographic 1979: Ferrari 312T4 \nFerrari caught up with Lotus by implementing ground effect aerodynamics on its 312T4, which Jody Scheckter raced in all but two races en route to winning the 1979 World Championship. LAT Photographic 1980: Williams FW07B \nThe Williams FW07B was a very similar car to the Lotus 79 that had won the championship just two years prior. Alan Jones won five races en route to winning his only driver’s title during the 1980 season. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 1981: Brabham BT49C \nF1 underwent several regulation changes heading into 1981 as the FIA tried to slow the cars down following the increased speeds due to ground effects. Nelson Piquet won three races during the 1981 season in his Brabham BT49C en route to his first World Championship. LAT Photographic 1982: Williams FW08 \nDuring the ultra-competitive 1982 season, Keke Rosberg won merely one race en route to winning the World Championship in his Williams FW08. He had raced the Williams FW07C at the opening three rounds of the year. LAT Photographic 1983: Brabham BT52 \nWith ground effect aerodynamics being banned for the 1983 season, Brabham produced the Brabham BT52, which was upgraded to the BT52B midway through the year. Piquet won three races en route to his second title during the year. It was the first championship for a turbo-charged car and only championship to date for a BMW-powered car. LAT Photographic 1984: McLaren MP4/2 \nThe McLaren MP4/2 was the dominant car during the 1984 season. Although not always the fastest, the car proved much more reliable than its competitors on race day. Consequently, McLaren teammates Niki Lauda and Alain Prost were the two drivers left fighting for the championship at the end of the year, with Lauda winning by just half a point. LAT Photographic 1985: McLaren MP4/2B \nAlain Prost became the first ever French Formula One World Champion in an upgraded McLaren MP4/2 in 1985. It was his first of four World Championship titles. LAT Photographic 1986: McLaren MP4/2C \nAgain not a whole lot of modifications were made to the successful McLaren MP4 heading into 1986, and Alain Prost took four race wins and his second World Championship title following Nigel Mansell’s infamous tire blowout in Adelaide. LAT Photographic 1987: Williams FW11B \nBoasting a powerful 1.5-liter V6 turbo engine from Honda and aerodynamics to that of the McLaren MP4, the Williams FW11 had came close to winning the championship in the hands of Nigel Mansell in 1986, but it was Nelson Piquet who finally got the job done with three race wins in 1987 en route to winning his third and final championship title. LAT Photographic 1988: McLaren MP4/4 \nThe McLaren MP4/4 is statistically the most successful car in F1 history, winning 93.8 percent of the races it competed in (15 out of 16). With it, Ayrton Senna took his first of three World Championship titles. LAT Photographic 1989: McLaren MP4/5 \nWhile sometimes overshadowed by its predecessor’s success in the history books, the McLaren MP4/5 was likewise a dominant car in F1. Alain Prost won his third of four World Championships in 1989 following a controversial collision with his teammate Ayrton Senna at the Japanese Grand Prix. LAT Photographic 1990: McLaren MP4/5B \nAgain, the championship-winning McLaren found itself looking a little worse for wear by the time its driver locked up the title in 1990, after Ayrton Senna sealed the deal following a collision with Alain Prost at the Japanese GP. LAT Photographic 1991: McLaren MP4/6 \nAyrton Senna became the youngest three-time F1 World Champion at the time when he won his third and final title in 1991 behind the wheel of the McLaren MP4/6. The V12-powered car was the last red-and-white Marlboro McLaren-Honda to win the World Championship. LAT Photographic 1992: Williams FW14B \nThanks to advanced active suspension technology, Nigel Mansell dominated the 1992 World Championship and wrapped up the title after just 11 of the 16 races. LAT Photographic 1993: Williams FW15C \nSince the FIA banned electronic driver aids following the 1993 season, the Williams FW15C is regarded as one of the most technologically advanced cars of all time. Alain Prost and teammate Damon Hill won 10 races between them in 1993, with the Frenchman taking his fourth and final title. LAT Photographic 1994: Benetton B194 \nElectronic driver aids had been banned following the 1993 season, but many wondered if the Benetton B194 still featured traction control due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher. The FIA could find no proof that such a system had been used, but Schumacher’s first of seven titles still didn’t come without controversy following a collision with championship rival Damon Hill in the season finale, which gave the German the title. LAT Photographic 1995: Benetton B195 \nBenetton switched from Ford to Renault power in 1995. Michael Schumacher drove the car home to nine race wins in 1995 while teammate Johnny Herbert won the two races in which Schumacher collided with rival Damon Hill. Schumacher and a lot of his crew switched to Ferrari for 1996. LAT Photographic 1996: Williams FW18 \nNew safety regulations made the drivers sit lower in the cars for 1996, helping the car’s handling. With help from designer Adrian Newey, the Williams FW18 was by far the fastest car during the 1996 season, winning 12 out of the 16 races. Damon Hill took the title. LAT Photographic 1997: Williams FW19 \nBuilding on from the success of the Williams FW18, the Williams-Renault FW19 remains the most recent Williams to date to win the World Championship. Jacques Villeneuve won the championship following the collision with Ferrari’s Michael Schumacher in the season finale. While Schumacher lost the championship anyway due to the incident, he was later disqualified for intentionally causing a collision. LAT Photographic 1998: McLaren MP4/13 \nMcLaren brought on designer Adrian Newey from Williams ahead of the 1998 season as F1 underwent a lot of rule changes for the cars. McLaren started the season with by far the quickest car, with Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard winning nine out of the 16 races during the season. Hakkinen took the title. LAT Photographic 1999: McLaren MP4/14 \nMcLaren made its car even faster for 1999, but reliability problems and driver errors meant that Ferrari took the constructor’s title. Mika Hakkinen held on to win the driver’s championship ahead of Eddie Irvine and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, while Michael Schumacher missed several races after he broke a leg in a crash at the British GP. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 2000: Ferrari F1-2000 \nMichael Schumacher’s first driver’s title with Ferrari came in 2000 behind the wheel of the F1-2000. While Ferrari had gone 21 years without winning a driver’s title, Schumacher’s championship kicked off an era of dominance for the Italian team in F1. LAT Photographic 2001: Ferrari F2001 \nTraction and launch control were reintroduced in 2001 and the front wing was forced to be mounted higher but, despite all this, Ferrari again produced a dominant car, with the F2001 winning nine races in 2001 and the season-opener in 2002. Michael Schumacher won his fourth driver’s title. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 2002: Ferrari F2002 \nThe Ferrari F2002 won every race it was used in during the 2002 season, bar Monaco, and even picked up a win at the 2003 San Marino Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher wrapped up the World Championship after just 11 of the 17 races held during the season. LAT Photographic 2003: Ferrari F2003-GA \nThe Ferrari F2003-GA - named in tribute of the recently deceased Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli - wasn’t as dominant as it’s predecessor due to the car’s tendency to overheat its tires, which was a problem during the summer races. However, Michael Schumacher still used to car to win his sixth driver’s title. LAT Photographic 2004: Ferrari F2004 \nMichael Schumacher won 12 out of 13 races to open the 2004 season behind the wheel of the Ferrari F2004. The car set multiple lap records, several of which remain to this day. However, the car also marked the end of an era as it was Schumacher’s seventh and final World Championship title. LAT Photographic 2005: Renault R25 \nThe Renault R25 was the last V10-powered F1 car to win a race and a championship. While it wasn’t always the fastest car in 2005, its consistency took Fernando Alonso to the championship, ending the Michael Schumacher/Ferrari era of dominance. It was the first championship for a French team since the Matra MS80 in 1969. LAT Photographic 2006: Renault R26 \nFernando Alonso drove chassis R26-03 at every race during the 2006 F1 season, winning seven of the 18 races in his Renault R26. LAT Photographic 2007: Ferrari F2007 \nThe Ferrari F2007 remains to date the most recent car from Scuderia Ferrari to win the World Championship. Kimi Raikkonen took it to six wins in 17 races to win the driver’s title. LAT Photographic 2008: McLaren MP4-23 \nThe McLaren MP4-23 wasn’t strong enough to give the team the constructor’s title but, in just his second year in the sport, Lewis Hamilton was able to take it to five race wins for his first of three World Championships to date. LAT Photographic 2009: Brawn BGP 001 \nThe Brawn BGP 001 took a 1-2 finish on its debut despite the team having only just being formed a couple of months earlier after Ross Brawn bought the Honda F1 team. Jenson Button won six out of the opening seven races of the season, but none of the last 10. However, it was enough to win the championship in the only car Brawn GP ever produced, which featured a controversial double diffuser. LAT Photographic 2010: Red Bull RB6 \nThe Red Bull RB6, designed by Adrian Newey, was the car that took Sebastian Vettel to his first of four consecutive World Championships during the 2010 season. Between them, Vettel and teammate Mark Webber won nine out of the 19 races during the season. LAT Photographic 2011: Red Bull RB7 \nThe Red Bull RB7 was one of the most dominant cars in F1 history, with Sebastian Vettel winning 11 out of the 19 races during the season en route to his second World Championship title. LAT Photographic 2012: Red Bull RB8 \nThe 2012 Formula One season started off as an ultra-competitive season, with seven different drivers winning the first seven races. While the Red Bull RB8 had to be revised a couple of times during the year due to various controversies, Vettel took four-straight wins late in the season and won the championship despite spinning on Lap 1 in the dramatic finale in Brazil. LAT Photographic LAT Photographic 2013: Red Bull RB9 \nThe Red Bull RB9 was the last V8 naturally aspirated-powered car to win an F1 race and the F1 championship. Sebastian Vettel won 13 out of the 19 races held during the 2013 season, including 10 of the last 11 races. LAT Photographic Al Staley 2014: Mercedes F1 W05 Hybrid \nF1 switched from V8 naturally aspirated to V6 turbo engines for the 2014 season, and Mercedes has been the most dominant team in the sport ever since. Lewis Hamilton won 11 out of the 19 races during the 2014 season with the Mercedes F1 W05 Hybrid, holding off his teammate Nico Rosberg for the title. LAT Photographic Al Staley 2015: Mercedes F1 W06 Hybrid \nMercedes continued to be the team to beat during the 2015 season, with Lewis Hamilton winning 10 of 19 races en route to his third World Championship title behind the wheel of the Mercedes F1 W06 Hybrid. LAT Photographic 2016: Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid \nThe Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid won 19 of the 21 races during the 2016 Formula One World Championship, making it the most dominant F1 car in history. While Lewis Hamilton won 10 races to Nico Rosberg’s 9, Rosberg won the championship due to greater consistency.
