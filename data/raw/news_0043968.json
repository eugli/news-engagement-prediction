Credit Imagno/Getty Images Getting Closer In 2001, a team led by Dr. Freedman reported a value of 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3.3 million lightyears), in the galumphing units astronomers prefer. It meant that for every 3.3 million lightyears a galaxy was farther away from us, it was moving 72 kilometers a second faster. Hubble’s original estimate was much higher, at 500 in the same units of measurement. Dr. Freedman’s result had an error margin that left it happily consistent with other more indirect calculations, that had gotten a slightly slower and lower value of 67 for the Hubble constant. Those were derived from studies of microwaves emitted and still lingering in the sky from the the primordial Big Bang fireball. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As a result, in recent years, astronomers have settled on a recipe for the universe that is as black and as decadent as a double dark chocolate chunk brownie. The universe consists of roughly 5 percent atomic matter by weight, 27 percent mysterious dark matter and 68 percent of the even more mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the cosmic expansion. Never mind that we don’t know exactly what all this dark stuff is. Astronomers have a good theory about how it behaves, and that has allowed them to tell a plausible story about how the universe evolved from when it was a trillionth of a second old until today. But now the Hubble precision has gotten seemingly better, and the universe might be in trouble again. Last summer a team led by Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, using the Hubble Space Telescope and the giant Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and supernova explosions as the ultimate distance markers, got a value of 73 plus or minus only 2.4 percent for the elusive constant. That made waves because it meant that, if true, the Hubble constant as observed today was now clearly incompatible with a result of the lower slower value of 67 inferred from data obtained in 2013 by the European Planck spacecraft of relic radiation from the Big Bang. The Planck mission observations that show the universe when it was only 380,000 years old are considered the gold standard of cosmology.

Some say it is too soon to get excited about new physics sneaking through such a small discrepancy in a field noted for controversy. With more data and better understanding of statistical uncertainties, the discrepancy might disappear, they say. “No explanation I know of is less ugly than the problem,” Lawrence M. Krauss, a theorist at Arizona State, said. Others say this could be the beginning of something big. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton and the Simons Foundation, called the discrepancy “very intriguing,” but said he was not yet convinced that this was the signature of new physics. Michael S. Turner of the University of Chicago said, “If the discrepancy is real, this could be a disruption of the current highly successful standard model of cosmology and just what the younger generation wants — a chance for big discoveries, new insights and breakthroughs.” Dr. Riess and his colleague Stefano Casertano got roughly the same answer of 73later last summer, strengthening the claim for a mismatch of Hubble constants. They used early data from the European spacecraft GAIA, which is measuring the distances of more than a billion stars by triangulation, thus allowing astronomers to skip some of the lower rungs on the distance ladder. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story They calculated that the odds of this mismatch being a statistical fluke were less than one part in a hundred — which might sound good in poker but not in physics, which requires odds of less than one in a million to cement a claim of a discovery. “I think it’s a potentially serious issue,” said Alex Filippenko, a University of California astronomer who is part of the team. “In this line of research the devil is in the details. And after getting the details right, we’re left with a major puzzle.” Photo An illustration showing the GAIA spacecraft and the Milky Way. Credit ESA/ATG medialab; background: ESO, via S. Brunier George Efstathiou, of the University of Cambridge and one of the leaders of the Planck mission responsible for its cosmological analysis, said Dr. Riess and his team had underestimated the errors in their measurement. “So, in summary, I think that the Planck results are secure,” he wrote in an email. “They,” he said, referring to the other astronomers, “may be right and we have to modify their standard model, but the evidence looks weak to me.” Dr. Riess and his colleagues have stood by their work, however, and the plot thickened further in December when a group called H0LiCOW (don’t ask) from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, reported its own value of 72 for the Hubble constant, also inconsistent with the Planck space mission’s analysis.
