The two were very close and would FaceTime every night. \nThe Hall of Famer says she recognized Chyna was going down a bad path and tried to convince her to go to rehab -- but she refused, and died while Sytch was seeking treatment for herself. \nObviously, Chyna's death isn't Tammy's fault ... but Sytch says she wishes she could've gotten her friend to see the light. Chyna passed away in April after overdosing on Rx pills and booze. \nAs for Tammy ... her next stop is another stint in rehab to combat her ongoing alcohol issues -- and she says she's receiving the full support of the WWE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T10:38:31.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
