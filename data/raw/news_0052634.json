The Homewood-based Cancer Support Center gave its annual Spirit of Life award to Susan Fine, longtime marketing director at Ingalls Hospital in Harvey. (Cancer Support Center photo) Staff report Privacy Policy \nThe Homewood-based Cancer Support Center on Wednesday honored Susan Fine, director of marketing at Ingalls Memorial Hospital, with its Richard K. Desser Spirit of Life Award. \n\"For years, Susan Fine has been a beacon of hope by creating opportunities and programs between Ingalls and The center for hundreds of cancer patients,\" said Sue Armato, executive director of the Cancer Support Center. \nThe award is presented annually to members of the community \"to acknowledge their commitment to the integration of psychosocial wellness care within cancer treatment,\" according to a release. It is named after renowned oncologist Richard Desser, who supported the center's mission to provide mental and social support to those battling cancer \"at a time when that was not considered important to survivorship,\" Armato said. \nDuring Susan's long tenure at Ingalls Memorial Hospital, she has made significant contributions in ensuring a successful partnership between The Center and Ingalls Memorial Hospital. Susan earnestly coordinated, all of the cancer related programming facilitated by Ingalls Memorial Hospital's staff, oversaw the success of the US TOO Prostate group that has been well attended for seven years, and orchestrated the combined marketing initiatives between The Center and Ingalls Memorial Hospital, the release stated. \n\"It's just awesome to be honored with an award that celebrates the Spirit of Life, and Dr. Desser's memory,\" Fine said. \"I've been at Ingalls 40 years this month, and I personally knew Dr. Desser and was aware of the impact he had on the lives of his patients and the people around him. Plus, I have always believed strongly in the mission of The Cancer Support Center and have seen the effect the services have on our patients. \n\"It's no secret that I am a cancer survivor myself, partaking more than once in classes and programs. Of course, the 'blessing' of a serious diagnosis is that it gives you a real perspective on the priorities of life. Living in an attitude of gratitude takes work, but is such a great feeling. Spirit is what life is all about ... for me it's doing what I love doing with as much enthusiasm and heart as possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:39:55.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
