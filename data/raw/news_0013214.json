Valda walks down the aisle to greet her love, Jaco.

I like him a lot. If he died, I die too.” \nThe love-struck pair met at the residential home in 2014 and it was love at first sight for Jaco, who suffers from paralysis of the left arm. \nHe has been living in the home for 19 years after being homeless and unemployed. Jaco waits for his fiancee. Picture: Caters News Agency Source: Caters News Agency \nJaco said of his 106-year-old love: “I fell in love with Valda from the moment I saw her. I know she’s a little older than me, but that doesn’t matter because she makes me really happy. \n“I asked her to marry me and we always believed it would happen but getting engaged is a step forward for us right now.” \nThe couple are inseparable and spend all day with each other, chatting and eating their meals together and sitting side-by-side in the home. The happy couple seal their engagement celebration with a kiss.
