The results disclosed that the snake was real and we then initiated action,” he said. \nNGO Plants and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS Mumbai) had first filed the complaint with the forest department in October. “We are happy that action has been taken against celebrities violating the law that protects animals. However, the forest department is yet to nab the snake rescuers that provided them the cobra,” said Sunish Subramaniam Kunju, secretary, PAWS Mumbai. \nOther animal activists said the case will set an example for the small and big screen industry that such illegal acts will not be tolerated. \n“Supplying of wild animals to film city is an organised crime and has been happening since a long time. Exploiting animals and protected species for entertainment is ethically and legally wrong,” said Pawan Sharma, president, Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), an NGO that aided the anti poaching unit and Mumbai range during their investigation at Film City, Goregaon. \nREAD MORE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:55:02.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
