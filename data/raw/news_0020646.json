She also said that the claims about relationship with Babul were a lie.\nAlthough Borni vehemently maintained that they had no family ties with Babul during the press conference, she conceded to making that claim mistakenly when bdnews24.com countered her with pictures of Babul and her father together at a Magura event. \nMeanwhile, Babul's brother advocate Habibur Rahman said that there is no truth in the reports about Borni and Babul's relation. \nHe said that no such person had ever come to stay in their Magura house. \nHe also said that legal notices have been served to one of the two newspapers and another notice will be sent to the other newspaper on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:33:17.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
