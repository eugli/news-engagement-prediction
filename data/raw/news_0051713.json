(CBC)\nMedicinal Grounds is the fourth location to reopen after the Saint John police raided six locations on Jan. 24.\nPolice arrested 12 people, charging them with possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking.\nIt didn't take long for the stores to reopen. King Canna on Germain Street was first, finding new employees within days.\nUptown Saint John pot dispensary reopens after police raid\nHBB Medical Inc. followed shortly after, and as of last Friday, BCW Medical Inc. reopened as well.\nTwo other locations, one owned by HBB and another by Medicinal Grounds remain closed.\n\"I assume the cops will likely be by later today to stick their nose in,\" Lively said, adding he was nervous about their return.\nBut Lively said if he were to be charged, he predicted they would be dropped when the federal government introduces marijuana legislation this spring.\nStores over mail-order Like others, Lively said many medical marijuana users prefer to buy smaller dosages from stores, rather than through mail order companies such as Organigram.\n\"[I] wish they would see the other side of it,\" said Lively, adding the store was just trying to help people and isn't a de facto drug dealer.\nThe Saint John police declined to comment on the reopening of the dispensaries.\nIn the past, spokesperson Sgt. Charles Breen said stores which reopen will be revisited by police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:40:25.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
