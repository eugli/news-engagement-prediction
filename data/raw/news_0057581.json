Speaking just yesterday President Trump called this, 'a horrible and painful act.' And so it was. That, along with other recent threats to Jewish Community Centers around the country. He declared it all a sad reminder of hate, prejudice and evil,\" Pence said in the speech. \"We condemn this vile act of vandalism and the people who perpetrated it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nLater, in an unannounced stop at the cemetery with Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, Pence put on gloves, grabbed a rake and helped clean up debris spread among about 200 gravestones that had been damaged and knocked over.\n\"[Missouri]'s people are inspiring the nation w/ their compassion for the Jewish community.
