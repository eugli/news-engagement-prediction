Do you sense a pattern here? \nSo maybe there is hope for reconciliation with Dolan and Charles Oakley, another immensely popular former Knick who was banned indefinitely from the World's Most Famous Arena two days before Sprewell's lifetime ban was magically lifted. \nOakley, though, will have to exercise patience. It took 14 years for Dolan to extend an olive branch to Sprewell and invite him back. \nThat this reunion would take place this week is just one of those crazy coincidences in life, right? Funny how that worked out. \nOf course we know this is a transparent public relations ploy to portray Dolan as the warm and cuddly owner while continuing to paint Oakley as the crazed drunk. And more to the point, the only former Knick he's ever had an issue with. \n\"This is an anomaly,\" Dolan said on Friday. \nTwo days later, Sprewell, a dreadlocked anomaly for 14 years until Sunday, is seated next to Dolan during the Knicks’ impressive win over the San Antonio Spurs. \nHonestly, Spree is the last person on earth you would have expected to agree to be part of something like this. But it confirmed that Dolan is committed to winning this — whatever this is — at all costs. He showed this same commitment to beating Anucha Browne Sanders in a court of law despite his advisors instructing him to settle the sexual harrassment case. After a years-long absence from Madison Square Garden, Latrell Sprewell returned to the open arms of his former nemesis James Dolan. ( Adam Hunger/USA Today Sports) \nDolan didn't listen and it cost him $9 million in damages. He's not going to settle with Oakley anytime soon either. \nOn Sunday, the Garden was filled with former players, including two sitting directly to Dolan's right: Sprewell and Larry Johnson. Considering the poor optics from Oakley's removal last Wednesday, this image made you cringe the same way you would when someone says, \"I have friends that are black.\" \nSprewell, John Wallace and Kenny \"Sky\" Walker even received video tributes. Afterwards, the alumni and Dolan visited the winning locker room. \nJust one big happy family. Minus Oakley, of course. \nJohnson, who told me on Saturday that he was conflicted about showing up for work out of respect to Oakley, is a paid Garden employee. There is a possibility that Sprewell, who sadly has financial problems, received an appearance fee. That’s his and Dolan's business. \nBut the timing of the reunion raises eyebrows. Plus, the Garden has a history of these preemptive PR strikes. \nDolan announced the hiring of Phil Jackson on the same day fans scheduled a protest outside the Garden aimed at the thin-skinned owner. Years earlier, the Knicks acquired Stephon Marbury — another famous anomaly — two days before Jeff Van Gundy was to visit the Garden for the first time as Houston Rockets head coach. Larry Johnson (left) joined Sprewell and Bernard King (right). ( Adam Hunger/USA Today Sports) \nEven Sprewell's return on Dec. 23, 2003, a few months after Dolan exiled him to Minnesota, was commandeered by Dolan hiring Isiah Thomas to replace Scott Layden a day earlier. Sprewell, though, hijacked the moment right back with a huge performance that included him taunting and cursing Dolan throughout the night. \nAt halftime, Dolan demanded that NBA security tell Sprewell to stop. It didn't work. It only got worse. And Dolan, who in the first quarter taunted Sprewell by sticking out his tongue, looked angry and humiliated by the fourth. \nAnd just like that, Sprewell was gone. \nUntil Sunday. \n\"Well, I can't tell you why I haven't been back here but I'll tell you when I left I was not happy,\" Sprewell told ESPN sideline reporter Israel Gutierrez. Sprewell was not made available to the media afterwards. \nSprewell called the situation with Oakley and Dolan \"disappointing\" and added, \"hopefully it will be something that everybody can just somehow iron out and get past. It's an unfortunate situation obviously.\" \nAs a player, Spree was always the go-to-guy. He was the voice of reason, despite what Dolan said about him. Up until Sunday, that is. Times have changed since Sprewell's days as a member of the Timberwolves. (Simmons, Howard) \nSprewell and Oakley were never teammates in New York. Sprewell was acquired one month after the Knicks traded Oakley to Toronto for Marcus Camby. The lockout season of 1999 was also Dolan's first with the Knicks. That season ended with Sprewell leading the Knicks to the NBA Finals where Van Gundy's depleted team lost to the Spurs in five games. \nThe following season, the Knicks won 50 games and returned to the Eastern Conference Finals. But the next 16 years have not been kind. The Knicks under Dolan have won 50 or more games just once since 2001 and a grand total of nine playoff games. \nThe Spurs have won at least 50 games in every season since 2000, including the lockout year in 2011-12. They've also won 139 playoff games over that same span and four NBA titles. \nThis is the ultimate culture clash: the gold standard of NBA franchises vs. the NBA's most dysfunctional organization. \nOne win on Sunday doesn't change that. And while it was great seeing Sprewell back in Dolan's good graces, it doesn't mean fans will forget Oakley. \nOr his last visit to the Garden.
