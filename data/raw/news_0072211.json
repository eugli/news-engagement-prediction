Michael Hood, was supposed to end a frustrating 12-year procurement odyssey that spanned three governments.\nDefence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan says he is confident the appropriate steps were followed in the procurement process and doesn't see any need for further delay. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\nIt was former prime minister Paul Martin's Liberal government in 2004 that first proposed replacing the fleet.\nThe former Conservative government, which put the program on hold over allegations the air force had calibrated the specifications in favour of Leonardo's C-27J, eventually asked the National Research Council to evaluate the requirements. \nThe Air Bus C-295, which is in service in 15 countries, is supposed to speed along the retirement of the air force's nearly 50-year-old C-115 Buffalos and older model C-130 Hercules transports, which were assigned to search and rescue duties a number of years ago.\nThe government said last fall that the first C-295 is expected on the tarmac in 2019, with the final delivery slated for 2022.\nIt is unclear how the court challenge will affect that timetable.\nSajjan defended the government's choice late Wednesday, saying he's confident the appropriate steps were followed and doesn't see any need for a delay.\n\"A decision has been made and it's a really good thing for Canadians,\" Sajjan told CBC News. \"If somebody has any concerns about that decision they have the right to be able to have a look at that decision and use the various processes within our court system.\"\nHe described the C-295 as a \"game-changer\" for the air force.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:40:02.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
