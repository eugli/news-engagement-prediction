Officials and independent experts all say Kim Jong-nam's assassination looks like the work of North Korean agents. \nKim, 46, collapsed on Monday in the shopping concourse at the airport and had not gone through immigration yet for his flight to Macau. \nHe was taken to the airport clinic and then died on the way to the hospital, an official said. \n\"The deceased … felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind,\" police official Fadzil Ahmat said. \n\"He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the … counter of KLIA.\" \nKim Jong-nam was estranged from his younger brother, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

(AP: Vincent Thian) \nAlthough he had been tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his dictator father, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia. \nHe reportedly fell further out of favour when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. 'Female agents' reportedly behind assassination \nMultiple South Korean media reports said Kim Jong-nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents, who fled the airport in a taxi. \nA Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. \n\"Investigation is in progress and a post-mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,\" the statement said. The reported assassination of Kim Jong-nam is the latest episode in the long and bloody history of North Korea's Kim dynasty. These are the key players. \nKen Gause, from the CNA think tank in Washington, has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years and said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong-nam had travelled under. \nKim is believed to have been born on May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Mr Gause said. \nAlthough there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother. \nThe killing comes as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analysing for evidence of advancement in the country's missile capabilities. \nFor the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong-il, the brothers' father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:56:04.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
