We wrote last month about a bunch of hires there, and today, there is official word of more. \nHere’s the memo from NBC News Digital executive editor Catherine Kim: \nHi all, \nWe have some new faces in the newsroom today – exciting additions to the team – who will further help NBC News Digital build, grow and lead. \nGregg Birnbaum joins us as politics editor for NBC News Digital and will be based in New York. Gregg most recently comes from CNN Politics and Politico. Gregg has an outstanding reputation among political reporters and will lead our political coverage working closely with our teams in New York and Washington. \nAli Vitali, who is no stranger to all of us after a tireless 460+ days as an embed reporter on the Trump campaign trail, now officially joins the team as White House digital reporter. \nAndrew Springer joins today as director of social strategy for Newsand the verticals. Andrew comes from Mashable, where he was Director of Growth and oversaw social strategy across all platforms. \nJeremy Kestenbaum joins us as lead producer for digital video’s “News” team, informally called FAST. Jeremy has impeccable editing skill, technical know-how and an impressive track record with social video. Jeremy was most recently at Nightly News Digital and prior to that at CBS News. \nJohn Makely, who is also a familiar face to our digital video producers, officially joins the team as supervising video producer. John will help build up our digital video team’s technical prowess and lead training. Importantly, he will also be involved in our VR and 360 video projects, as our resident expert on the format. \nNicole Mastrangelo, who’s learned the ropes from one of the best booking teams in the business, now leads digital booking. Nicole will work closely with Kelsea Purpura, who is among the latest to join that stellar unit. \nAlex Smith has been officially with us as a senior reporter since late January based in London. Alex won an Emmy as part of the NBC News team that covered the downing of MH17 and attracted big attention for his recent reporting on Fake News in Macedonia. \nPlease take a moment to welcome your new colleagues. \nIn the meantime, we continue to look for talent to fill a number of open roles here . Please feel free to share this link around. \nCheers, Catherine \nVitali is based of course in D.C.; Springer in London; the rest of the foolks mentioned here will be working out of New York HQ.
