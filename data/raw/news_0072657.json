EPS \nNEW DELHI: Weeks after the shocking case of mass desertion by CoBRA commandos, abuse of welfare funds for organizing parties for the top brass of the CRPF and their families has come to the fore. \nRecords accessed by the Express also suggest, the paramilitary has also subsidized purchase of prizes for the raffle draw that is organized every year as part of the annual CRPF Mela here. While an amount of Rs 75 lakhs was spent for purchasing the prizes for the lottery, only a little over Rs 37 lakhs was collected from the sale of raffle draw tickets and rentals from the kiosks at the Mela. \nAlso, an amount of over Rs 85 lakh was collected during October, the month in which the CRPF Mela was held, from sponsors, sale of raffle draw tickets and proceeds from the maturity of fixed deposit but the final computation for the month reflects just over Rs 49 lakhs in receipts. The expenditure in October is pegged at over Rs 81 lakh. \nThe Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the world’s biggest and the country’s lead counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist paramilitary force.The welfare funds of the CRPF Welfare Association (CWA) are collected through monthly contribution from the paramilitary personnel including the jawans who comprise the bulk of the rank. The CWA is registered as a voluntary organization and is headed by the wife of Director General of CRPF. \nThe CWA funds are primarily meant for the welfare of the martyrs’ families and those incapacitated in action. However, during outgoing DG K Durga Prasad’s tenure, a lavish picnic party was recently organized at CRPF Group Centre in Gurugram for which even an event management firm was even roped in for organizing the function exclusively for the wives of the top paramilitary leadership including DG’s wife Sujatha Prasad. The picnic party was organized on February 9, days after 59 Cobra commandos deserted the force. CRPF DG did not answer specific queries whether the CRPF is subsiding lottery prizes out of the welfare funds and the mismatch in the accounts register relating to receipts and expenses in October. \nSources said the CWA has not undertaken any major welfare measure for the families of the jawans and the martyrs. The revelations come in the backdrop of a recent video posted by a CRPF jawan claiming disparity in payments and allowances vis-à-vis the Army personnel. Also, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been particular against babus spending time on habits like golfing at the cost of performance.
