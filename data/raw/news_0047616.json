Why people with invisible illness shouldn't fear asking for a seat on public transport \nTodd Krieg and Amanda Dieson got engaged just three weeks ago – and have only recently found out they will become the proud parents to a baby boy in August. \nWhile this, of course, is amazing news – it’s even more special as Todd had been told by doctors that he may never be able to have children – as he lost the ability to walk after a horrific motocross accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. \nIt was during his recovery last year that he met Amanda, a therapist from California, who has been there for him all the way. \nAnd now, the couple, who have overcome numerous obstacles, have so much to look forward to as they embark upon a new life together as parents. \nTo let their family and friends know what’s to come, Todd and Amanda posed for a series of photos that were taken by photographer Kayla Duffin . \nWhile some were undeniably adorable, there was one rather funny photo that caught the internet’s attention. With Amanda holding her first scan looking slightly embarrassed as Todd held his thumb up to the camera, the main attention was what was written on the brick wall behind them –‘It still works!’ (Picture: Kayla Duffin) \nThe couple were all smiles as they posed for what will be one of their most memorable moments (Picture: Kayla Duffin) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:30:14.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
