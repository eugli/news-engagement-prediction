DU college girl Gurmehar Kaur says she can't take it anymore, after being the victim of relentless social media trolls and rape threats. Ms. Kaur, being the daughter of a Kargil war Martyr, has been fighting for peace between India and Pakistan. She has been in the spotlight of controversy after she held placards reading 'Pakistan did not kill my Dad, war did'. While many have condemned the girl's cry for peace as 'anti-national', Arvind Swamy has stood by Gurmehar's side, asking the detractors what was wrong with a girl expressing her opinion on war and peace. Disregarding all the hate as pointless, the actor quotes, \"The biggest anti nationals are those who promote corruption and steal public money thereby hindering the progress of a nation\". It is disheartening to see how a year old video of a 20 year old college girl voicing her words on peace suddenly floods social media with irate and vile comments, while wise words from like Arvind's show positive hope.
