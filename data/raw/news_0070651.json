(Chad Hipolito/The Canadian Press)\nSince the chiefs did not read English, the treaties were based on verbal agreements and signed with an X at the bottom by each First Nations leader. Some of the pages were even left blank and clauses and pages were inserted by colonial authorities later.\nElliot also notes said there is a stark contrast in perspectives of land rights and resources. That's because the Sencoten language is a product of their spiritual belief, which informed their way of life and perspective on laws and ownership, he said.\n\"We have a belief about how each and every one of those species of salmon were made and how they came to be, and how we relate to them through our language and belief system, and all of that was never taken into consideration,\" he said, referring to the treaty.\nWhile those practices should be honoured today as rights of First Nations, he said, it will be up to his community to decide whether legal action is necessary.\nA move towards reconciliation University of Victoria historian John Lutz agrees that the oral traditions of the First Nations that signed the treaties show they weren't understood to be land transactions.\n\"They weren't land surrenders... In the case of the Saanich their oral history was that this was a way of resolving a dispute.\"\nLutz hopes the translations will build understanding between indigenous and non-indigenous groups.\n\"We have to understand the truth of our past before we can move toward reconciliation,\" Lutz said.\nHe says there is a sadness in the fact it took until now to translate the documents, when very few First Nations are fluent in their own languages .\nBut, he said, it's given cause for First Nations and the broader community to discuss the documents for the first time at a symposium about treaty rights in Victoria this weekend.\n\"I think we live our lives in this region without understanding that we actually have obligations to the local First Nations through the treaty and they have rights, and they have some obligations to us through the treaty,\" he said.\nTo listen to CBC's All Points West interview with John Lutz, click on the link labelled Historian John Lutz on why it took so long to translate Douglas Treaties\nWith files from Liz McArthur, Mike Laanela and The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:04:40.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
