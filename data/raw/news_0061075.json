And that delay makes the area's City Council member, Philip Kingston, \"volcanically unhappy.\" \n\"The lack of urgency is just truly infuriating,\" Kingston said. \nCity officials hoped to open the bridge up to the Katy Trail's hikers and bikers and roller-blading patrons in April. But Rick Galceran, the director of Mobility and Street Services, said pockets of fuel discovered underground have put the kibosh on that schedule. \nConstruction crews initially broke ground on the bridge in 2013. But they still had plenty of issues with property acquisition -- one site changed hands several times and wound up in the hands of an overseas owner. \nActive construction started last year, and workers recently discovered the fuel pockets in the ground. \n\"It's complicated,\" Galceran said. \"It's not just your simple, fundamental type of work that goes on.\" \nThe bridge, which will connect the Katy Trail to White Rock trail, will appear finished in June, Galceran said. But the finishing touches will need a few more weeks. The current target is August -- provided no other unexpected delays pop up. The city will likely need to shut down parts of the thoroughfare at times to complete construction.

(Rose Baca/The Dallas Morning News) A suspension bridge is being built across Mockingbird Lane that will connect the Katy Trail and the Dart Mockingbird Station. Construction is in the process.

He began holding weekly meetings on the issue and helped them acquire the last bit of land they needed. \nAngela Hunt, Kingston's council predecessor, said she's also frustrated. During her tenure on the council, something was always in the way: utility lines, DART, right-of-way problems a new bid for a new contractor and other problems kept coming up. Angela Hunt will 'get the shovel in the ground' herself if city doesn't finally build Katy Trail bridge across Mockingbird \nHunt said she knows the project is complicated. But the city does complicated projects all the time, she said. \n\"We can get a half-billion-dollar convention center hotel up and running within 18 months,\" she said. \"Yet we can't seem to get a modest pedestrian bridge built over a decade.\" \nHunt and Kingston also say the issue is also a matter of public safety. \nSome pedestrians have been injured trying to cross Mockingbird. Movie critic Gary Murray was killed crossing the road during the Dallas International Film Festival. Dallas film writer killed in Friday hit-and-run 'died doing what he loved' \nBut Galceran said even though the city has dubbed the connection the \"Mockingbird Pedestrian Bridge\" in the past, it's not supposed to be a pedestrian bridge. It's a trail bridge. Pedestrians would have to go out of their way to enter the trail on one side. \nGalceran said the city needs to make other improvements for pedestrians on Mockingbird. \nKingston said he has a plan to combine some city money and other funding sources to make such improvements in the area. But he's waiting on the city's next bond package, which was delayed until November to his chagrin. \nBut in the meantime, he said the city shouldn't have to wait on the bridge to link White Rock and the Katy Trail. That should be the city's top priority among pedestrian projects, Kingston said. \nGalceran said he understands the frustrations, but these delays do happen in such projects. \n\"This is just a high profile project and everyone's anxious to see it through,\" he said.
