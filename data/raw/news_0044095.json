(AP) â€” Bruce Brown made a 3-pointer with 23.8 seconds left in overtime and Miami beat No. 19 Virginia 54-48 on Monday night for the Cavaliers fourth straight loss. \nBrown scored 14 points to lead the Hurricanes (19-8, 9-6 Atlantic Coast Conference) to their third consecutive victory. Kamari Murphy and Dejan Vasiljevic added 10 points each. \nDevon Hall scored 15 points to lead Virginia (18-9, 8-7), which last lost four straight in 2009-10, Tony Bennett's first season as coach. Isaiah Wilkins added 10 points and 10 rebounds, including two free throws with four seconds left in regulation to tie it. \nMiami thought it had won when Davon Reed hit a 3-pointer at the end of the second half, but a video review was used to determine he released the ball just after the buzzer. \nA putback by Marial Shayok with 39 seconds left gave the Cavaliers a 48-47 lead, but Brown made his only 3-pointer of the game on the Hurricanes' ensuing possession, and Miami sealed it at the free-throw line. \nBIG PICTURE \nMiami: The Hurricanes have only nine scholarship players on their roster, and only eight were available against Virginia because junior guard Ja'Quan Newton was sitting out the final game of a three-game suspension for violating team rules. Of the eight remaining, four are true freshmen and two of them, Vasiljevic and Brown, hit the biggest shots of the night at John Paul Jones Arena. \nVirginia: The Cavaliers have had difficulty scoring in the past two games, with a scoring average of 48 points in losses to Duke and North Carolina. That made a 12-0 run over a 2:24 span in the second half seem like an avalanche of points, but the Cavaliers then missed the front end of three consecutive 1-and-1 free-throw opportunities, and Miami quickly closed a 35-24 deficit to 35-31. \nUP NEXT \nMiami returns home to face surging, 10th-ranked Duke on Saturday. \nVirginia plays at North Carolina State on Saturday. \n___ \nMore AP college basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org \n___ \nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:28:45.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
