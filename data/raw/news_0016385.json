She told him: “I was walking up her road and I suddenly saw her car and made a point of deliberately looking at her door, and in one step everything changed… because I saw the most horrific scene. I realised it was Jill.

And there’s one in particular that stands out to me. But I wouldn’t identify that person because it’s very dangerous.” CCTV footage on the morning of her death (Photo: Press Association) \nExplaining his findings to Phil & Holly, Mark said: “I’ve never reviewed a case where there is so much information that was never followed up… and the reason being is that the police prosecuted Barry George and the information came in prior to the trial after his arrest, and continued to come in afterwards, but none of that was followed up… but what now needs to happen is that someone needs to look, in relation to that evidence and start to investigate some of it. \n\"There are eleven unidentified people still unaccounted for in the locality, there are over 100 potential suspects, there is other information naming people and specifically information on how this crime was carried out.” The crime remains unsolved (Photo: Press Association) \nGoing on to insist the police are interested in his new evidence, he discussed what he believes needs to be done next. \n“I would go back over the file, get a cold case team looking at it, start to do those inquiries that we’re never followed up - crucially Barry George was fully acquitted - so it’s now an unsolved case, so let’s look at this again with a fresh pair of eyes,\" he said. \n\"Dredge that canal, let’s look at it - and that’s one [piece of evidence], there are another five or six specific pieces of enquiry in there that should be closed down.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:27:00.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
