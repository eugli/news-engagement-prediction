The station doesn't say what was written, but it reports that the graffiti covers a small space and is described as not overtly political or hate-filled. \nPark service spokesman Mike Litterst says because of similarities in what's written and the handwriting, it's thought the graffiti was left by the same person. He says park service staffers are skilled in removing graffiti, but they have to be careful not to further damage the stone. \nU.S. Park Police are investigating and reviewing surveillance footage from the monuments Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:59:04.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
