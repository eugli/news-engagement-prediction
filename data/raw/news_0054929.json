A year before his al-Qaeda followers pulled off the most destructive assault on U.S. soil, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Osama bin Laden had pledged a jihad to free Abdel-Rahman from prison. \nWhen Mohammed Mursi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, began his short-lived presidency of Egypt in 2012, he said winning the sheikh's freedom would be a priority. The jihadists who attacked an Algerian oilfield and took hostages in 2013 also demanded his release. \nYet supporters paint him as a revered scholar who faced injustice and torture at the hands of the Egyptian and U.S. governments for sticking by his principles. \nMourners chanted \"God is great\" and cheered as his body, draped in a brown blanket inside a wooden coffin, was brought out to be washed at his brother's house before the burial. \n\"If he were a bad man, people from all over the country wouldn't have came to attend his funeral,\" said Mostafa al-Wakeel, a 40-year-old lawyer who traveled around 175 kilometers (108.74 miles) from Cairo. \nThe sheikh said he was hung upside-down from the ceiling, beaten with sticks and given electric shocks while held in Egypt but he was eventually acquitted and went into self-imposed exile in 1990. He managed to get to New York after the U.S. embassy in Sudan granted him a tourist visa in 1990. \n'PLANT FEAR IN THEIR HEARTS' \nEven in exile, he remained a force in the Middle East, where followers listened to cassette tapes and radio broadcasts of his sermons decrying the Egyptian government and Israel. \n\"We grew up learning his books and tapes. He was among the first people who openly spoke against a tyrant,\" said Wakeel. \nAbdel-Rahman was arrested and went on trial with several followers in 1995, accused of plotting assassinations and synchronized bombings of the U.N. headquarters, a major federal government facility in Manhattan and tunnels and a bridge linking New York City and New Jersey. \nThey were also accused of plotting to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during his U.S. visit in 1993. He and nine followers were found guilty in October 1995 on 48 of 50 charges. \nAl-Qaeda issued a statement after his death, referring to Abdel-Rahman's instructions to seek vengeance from those who killed him, referring to the U.S. authorities whom he accused of neglect and abuse during his incarceration. \n\"This is the instruction of the sheikh in your hands, work hard to fulfill it and don't let the Americans enjoy safety and security. Kill them, keep a watch on them and plant the fear in their hearts. Seek vengeance for your sheikh.\" \n(Additional reporting by Ali Abdelaty and Ahmed Tolba in Cairo; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein and Tom Heneghan) Next In World News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:53:32.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
