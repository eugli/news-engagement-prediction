He made no further comments.\nAbe called the launch \"absolutely intolerable\" and said North Korea must comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nNATO condemned the missile test in a statement by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who said North Korea \"must refrain from further provocations, halt all launches using ballistic missile technology and abandon once and for all its ballistic missile programs ... \"\nThe French foreign ministry also condemned the launch, issuing a statement that said \"France reaffirms its solidarity with its partners in Asia-Pacific whose security is threatened by the North Korean nuclear and ballistic program.\"\nChina is North Korea's main ally but has been frustrated by Pyongyang's repeated provocations, although it bristles at pressure from Washington and Seoul to curb the North and its young leader, Kim Jong Un.\nChina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump and his aides are likely to weigh a series of possible responses, including new U.S. sanctions to tighten financial controls, an increase in naval and air assets in and around the Korean peninsula and accelerated installation of new missile defense systems in South Korea, the administration official said.\nBut the official said that given that the missile was believed not to have been an ICBM and that Pyongyang had not carried out a new nuclear explosion, any response will seek to avoid ratcheting up tensions.\n\"IT WON'T HAPPEN\"\nTrump has pledged a more assertive approach to North Korea but given no clear sign of how his policy would differ from Obama's so-called strategic patience. In January, Trump tweeted \"It wonâ€™t happen!\" after Kim said the North was close to testing an ICBM, but his aides never explained how he would do so.\nThe missile was launched from an area called Panghyon in North Korea's western region just before 8 a.m. (2300 GMT Saturday) and flew about 500 km (300 miles), the South's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\"Our assessment is that it is part of a show of force in response to the new U.S. administration's hardline position against the North,\" the office said in a statement.\nA South Korean military source said the missile reached an altitude of about 550 km. While Seoul initially said the missile was probably a medium-range Rodong, it later said the launch was likely of a Musudan, which is designed to fly up to 3,000-4,000 km.\nThe North attempted eight Musudan launches last year. Only one of those launches - of a missile that flew 400 km (250 miles) in June - was considered a success by officials and experts in South Korea and the United States.\nKim said in his New Year speech that the country was close to test-launching an ICBM and state media have said such a launch could come at any time.\nThe comments prompted a vow of an \"overwhelming\" response from U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis when he traveled to South Korea earlier this month.\nOnce fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is about 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or more.\nNorth Korea conducted two nuclear tests and numerous missile-related tests last year and was seen by experts and officials to be making progress in its weapons capabilities, although until Sunday no ballistic missile launch attempt had been detected since October.\nIts repeated missile launches prompted Washington and Seoul to agree to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile battery in South Korea later this year, which is strongly opposed by Beijing, which worries the system's powerful radar undermines its own security.\nSunday's launch comes at an awkward time for South Korea, where President Park Geun-hye has been stripped of her powers after a December parliamentary vote to impeach her. Her fate will be decided by the Constitutional Court, which is hearing arguments on whether to uphold or overturn the impeachment.\n(Additional reporting by Jack Kim and Yun Hwan Chae in Seoul, Phil Stewart in Washington, Ayesha Rascoe and Kiyoshi Takenaka in Palm Beach, Elaine Lies in Tokyo, and Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Tony Munroe and Raju Gopalakrishnan, Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:53:20.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
