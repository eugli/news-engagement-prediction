Christian Brothers WA \"harrowing\" \nIn her opening address, Gail Furness SC said the accounts given to the commission in 2014 by survivors of four institutions in Western Australia run by the Christian Brothers was \"particularly harrowing\". \n\"The Christian Brothers had kept visitation reports and Provincial Council Minutes from 1919 which revealed concerns about Brothers sexually misconducting themselves with children,\" she said. \n\"From 1959, such concerns were no longer reported in the minutes.\" \nThe lawyers for the Christian Brothers told the commission that there may have been a decision made in the late 1950's to stop recording the matters. \nThe commission found 22 per cent of Australian Christian Brothers non-ordained religious and priests were alleged perpetrators. \nThe commission examined abuse allegations at Christian Brothers colleges in Bindoon, Tardun, Clontarf and Castledare between 1947 and 1968. \nIt found the Christian Brothers were aware of abuse allegations at their WA schools for decades, but failed to prevent it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:33:46.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
