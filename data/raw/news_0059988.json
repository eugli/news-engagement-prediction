It found levels of depression, anxiety and stress fell by people just going outside and depended on the number of birds they could see in an afternoon. In the study, common types of birds including blackbirds, robins, blue tits and crows were spotted. But the study did not find a relationship between the species of birds and mental health, but rather the number of birds people could see from their windows, in the garden or in their neighbourhood. It suggests that for most people it is interacting with birds, not just specific birds, that provides wellbeing. Dr Cox said: ‘It appears people just like seeing birds, the more birds the better, whether that is a blackbird or a crow. In another study we show that watching birds in the garden makes people feel more relaxed and connected to nature. The study showed that 274 people exposed to bird song saw a fall in stress levels and that those in areas with more bird life had better levels of mental health ‘This may be because a different study by this group found in urban areas that people know the common birds like robins and blackbirds, but are less able to distinguish other species. They may get a great tit and blue tit confused, for example, but they get the same experience from both.’ The academics studied afternoon bird numbers, which tend to be lower than birds generally seen in the morning, because more people are likely to be up, about and outside at that time. The research, conducted with the University of Queensland and the British Trust for Ornithology, is published in the journal Bioscience. Dr Gavin Siriwardena, head of terrestrial ecology at the BTO, who led its work on this study, said: ‘If we want to design our urban landscapes so that people get more wildlife-related benefit, we need to consider what people actually experience, not just what is there. ‘A woodland on the edge of town might tick a conservation box, but mature trees in gardens might be better for human health, even if they support fewer birds.’ Share or comment on this article 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:11:53.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
