And that's exactly how it played out, so it’s harder,” Rubio said. \nHe also said that the strategy to arm the rebels may have once been a lot more productive than it is now, but noted that there are still some elements on the ground which the US could work with. \nRubio was a US presidential contender before dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination last May. He withdrew his candidacy after losing the primary in his home state of Florida to Donald Trump. \nThe Florida senator's comments come after then-President Barack Obama lifted military aid restrictions on Syria, allowing the US to provide \"defense articles and services\" to forces allied to the US. \nSyrian President Bashar Assad criticized the move at the time, claiming that it provided legitimacy to providing militants with weapons. \nThe move was also met with concern from the Kremlin, with Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating that the \"worst result\" of the decision would be that weapons could end up in the hands of terrorists. \nMoscow has criticized Washington for supporting various anti-government forces, which it has presented as \"moderate rebels,” despite many of these forces having links to radical Islamists and terror groups. \nSyria's civil war has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people since the conflict began in 2011. Millions of others have been displaced, according to UN figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:55:48.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
