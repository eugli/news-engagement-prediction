Towards this end, the Government has given the green light for foreigners to own a majority stake in the assembly plant. \nAccording to CIMB Research, the net book value of the plant was about RM501mil as of March 2016. \n“We are not surprised by this, as the plant is considered a prized asset for Proton’s potential partner as it would provide immediate access to car production facilities, which is valuable to a partner that targets the growing South-East Asian market. \n“The Government has also reportedly given the approval for a foreign company to own a majority stake in the assembly plant,” it said. \nThe need to acquire a strategic partner was imposed on Proton as part of the conditions issued by the Government for its approval of an RM1.5bil soft loan to the national car company, in which a bulk of the money would be used to pay its vendors. \nLast month, Proton chief executive officer Datuk Ahmad Fuaad Kenali said the company would announce its tie-up with a foreign strategic partner as early as April. \nProton has been a drain on parent DRB-Hicom Bhd ’s earnings. \nThe latter marked its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, reporting a net loss of RM267.55mil in its second quarter ended Sept 30, 2016, compared with a net profit of RM52.67mil in the previous corresponding period. \nProton sold 72,290 vehicles last year compared with 102,175 units in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:08:23.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
