She's Returned To Speak To Her Former Flame Source: Robin Marchant/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images By Lindsay Denninger 7 min ago \nWhen Nick Viall was cast as the Bachelor, it seemed like a gimmick, and really, his season of The Bachelor has been a few months of gimmicks. There have been nannies and astronaut dates and sneaky midnight room visits (none that resulted in any illicit activity, though), but don’t worry! That’s not all! Andi Dorfman visited Nick on The Bachelor and Nick damn near fell over. \nWhy is this gimmicky? For those new Bachelor fans out there, Nick was the runner-up on Andi’s season of The Bachelorette, and Andi smashed Nick’s heart to bits on national television. Later Andi wrote a tell-all book about their sexy times, and let’s just say that things have been very frosty between them since. A recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! was awkward , believe me. So I was surprised, but not shocked, when Andi showed up on hometowns week. Was it for a pre-elimination pep talk? It didn't seem like it. \nFrankly, I'm not really sure why Andi is there, and like all episodes of The Bachelor this season, it ended in a \"to be continued...\" again. The previews for next week make things look frosty between these two, but I'm not sure they will be. I think that's to get people to tune in. I think that Andi, who is now so far removed from Nick as a relationship option, can give Nick some great advice. Honestly? With all the problems he's had this season, he should take it. With experience comes wisdom, Nick, and even though you've been on a Bachelor Nation show like 40 times, a little more advice couldn't hurt.
