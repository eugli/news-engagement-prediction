The Arsenal manager confirmed one was thrown in his direction. \nAfter the 2-0 victory for Arsenal , which sets up a quarter-final against another non-League side, Lincoln City, fans also stayed on the pitch and there were skirmishes, with police having to intervene. One fan appeared to be arrested for aiming a blow at another. \nOf the bottle incident, Doswell said: “It would not be a Sutton fan... it would be a fan…” before adding of the scenes after the final whistle: “It disappointed me at the end. They don’t support Sutton. You know that and I know that. Absolute idiots. \n“I totally get it. Unfortunately that’s the world we live in. I saw a few idiots shouting and screaming at Wenger and Arsenal players. They’ve got to be protected from those type of people. I saw some odd stuff on Twitter, what people are going to do when they got here. You saw the idiot run on the pitch (pitch-invader during the game), that was the big moment of his life. I don’t blame them, it’s way out of anything I can understand or would even want to understand. I wouldn’t want that if you gave me £1 million.” Watch | Sutton United v Arsenal - key match stats 01:02 \nH owever Doswell, while praising Arsenal as a club for the way they have conducted themselves, also criticised the security entourage surrounding the visiting players at Gander Green Lane stadium. \n“We have done the non-league proud,” Doswell said after his team’s impressive performance and outstanding Cup run. “They (Arsenal) are 105 places above us in the pyramid. Those lads (Sutton) won’t walk probably tomorrow. Arsenal walked in with bodyguards. My lads were driving round their bodyguards to get out. They took over the tunnel. We didn’t even get to say ‘thank you’ to our supporters at the end. \n“It’s a different world, can’t say any more than that. My lot are going to work tomorrow. They (Arsenal) are movie stars now, not allowed to speak to them, can’t get near them. It’s a different world from when I watched first division football when I was growing up, 14 or 15. Bizarre, to be honest, seeing James Bond security around us, felt quite safe. A very strange way that football’s gone.” Some members of the crowd could not contain themselves after their team had been knocked out of the FA Cup Credit: REUTERS \nD oswell added: “They (Sutton) couldn’t get the round of applause they deserved. It was a real shame people came on the pitch and took that away from them. They should feel very proud. The problem in sport is, when you have lost, you feel disappointed but they put this club on a worldwide map.” \nDoswell said he had spoken to Wenger before the game. “He was an absolute gent. He gave me a very nice smile and a handshake,” he said before adding: “Let’s be fair Arsène Wenger put up a very strong side. When I looked at my lads at 70 minutes and (Alexis) Sánchez has come on, it was a wonderful thing but I knew how tired they were. It was quite a cruel thing to do.” \nDoswell also confirmed that the Cup run would earn Sutton “more than £1 million” which will “buy new dressing rooms, class rooms and toilets” with Arsenal also contributing £50,000.

I will never go down there (to manage) because it is too difficult,” he said before expressing his surprise at “the speed of their game, the fact they never stopped going until the end and compared to 20 years ago these teams are fit now and can play at the pace of the Premier League. Maybe before they collapsed in the last 20 minutes, that is finished. They kept going and we were never really in a position where we could really afford to have a little breather in the game.” \n“We had to keep our focus, I must give credit to the players who were professional and kept their focus, if we had come here in a relaxed mood we would have gone out because they produced quality.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:48:43.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
