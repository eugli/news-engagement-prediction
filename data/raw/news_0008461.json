After months of heavy promotion, Big Sean ’s highly anticipated fourth studio album, I Decided , has finally arrived. \nServing as the follow up to 2015’s Dark Sky Paradise , I Decided contains 14 tracks in total & features guest appearances from Eminem , Migos , Jeremih , The-Dream , and girlfriend Jheni Aiko, among others. Here’s what Sean Don had to say about the concept album & its cover art: \n“The concept of the album is ‘this is me & this is an older version of me (referring to the two men standing on the cover). It’s parallel right there with each other, but the name of the album is ‘I Decided.’ I realized my whole life changed when I decided.” He said. “I feel like life is ‘bout making right decisions at any point, or the wrong decisions.”“So the album is basically like having that wisdom of an old man while you’re young and going through life & figuring it out,” Sean says about the album. \nLead by the previously heard singles “Moves”&“Bounce Back,” which went gold last week, fans can now stream the rest of I Decided (below) via Apple Music. Be sure to show your support on iTunes if you're feeling it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:09:15.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
