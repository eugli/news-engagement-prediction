Forty miles of the border zone was built up, and the 14-mile fence was constructed,” Poznaka told journalists. \nThe Delfi news agency reported last March that Riga received nearly $2 million from Brussels for constructing the first part of the wall, a 15-mile section. \nIn 2017, Latvia allocated 6.3 million euros ($6.8 million) for the construction of the 37 miles of fence and 93 miles of border zone, the spokeswoman stated. Putin 'Has to Respond to NATO's Military Buildup' in Eastern Europe and Baltics Media reported that the minimum height of the fence, including the barbed wire, will reach almost nine feet. It is expected to be constructed along some 120 miles of the border.\nLatvian official have also included in the country's 2017 budget funds for construction of a similar fence on the border with Belarus. State Border Guard Chief Gen. Normunds Garbars hasn't provided details on the length and cost of the planned wall. \nLatvia was not the only state that decided to fence it off from neighbors. \nNorwegian authorities have decided to erect a gated fence at the only checkpoint on the border with Russia in a bid to prevent a new wave of migrants crossing in, while the Estonian government has approved the building of a 2.5-meter fence on its border with Russia as the latest measure aimed at fortifying Estonia’s part of EU outer borders. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:41:27.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
