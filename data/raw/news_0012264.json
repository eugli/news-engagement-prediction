Ramon ‘Bong’ Revilla Jr. NOY MORCOSO/INQUIRER.net FILE PHOTO \nThe Sandiganbayan has granted the motion of former senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr., detained for plunder over the pork barrel scam, to visit his ailing father when the latter undergoes surgery. \nIn a resolution released Tuesday, the anti-graft court First Division partially granted Revilla’s urgent motion for furlough due to humanitarian considerations. \nThe court allowed Revilla to visit his father on Feb. 8 from 6 a.m. to 12 noon for the surgery. The court also granted Revilla’s furlough on Feb. 9 from 4 p.m to 8 p.m. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe court said Revilla is not allowed to bring communication devices, and that media interviews are not allowed. \nThe court said Revilla should shoulder the expenses by the police, who were tasked to escort Revilla to the St. Luke’s Medical Center in Taguig and nowhere else. READ: Bong Revilla seeks furlough to be at father’s surgery \nIn his urgent motion, Revilla asked the antigraft court’s First Division to allow him to be with his father on Feb. 8 from 6 a.m. to 12 noon, and on Feb. 9 from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the St. Luke’s Medical Center in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. \nRevilla said his 82-year-old father Ramon Sr. had been diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and was set to undergo trans-arterial aortic valve replacement. \nThe surgery will be on Feb. 8 at 9 a.m. with the preparation starting at 7:30 a.m. \nRevilla said he felt it his obligation to be at his father’s side to provide assurance and support. \nAccording to him, his father requested that he be at his side during the surgery. \n“Deeply worried and concerned about this recent unfortunate development, Senator Revilla again respectfully implores this Honorable Court’s kind consideration and compassion that he be allowed to visit, and be with his ailing and weak father while he is undergoing this major surgery,” Revilla said through his lawyers. \nIn the past, the court granted Revilla’s request to visit his father, who is at the intensive care unit of St. Luke’s in Bonifacio Global City. \nRevilla told the court that his father was again rushed to the hospital on Jan. 20 due to coronary heart disease. \nRevilla Sr. was in and out of the hospital from Jan. 26 to 31. \nEarlier, Revilla’s father was hospitalized due to severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. \nRevilla recently lost his petition before the Supreme Court, which sustained the finding of probable cause for plunder against him.
