Nobody wants to be mean to Little Sisters of the Poor. But getting back to your favorite Trump administration moves. What’s number two? Ben : It might surprise you to learn that the other encouraging aspect of it for me is in the opposition Trump has received, and a growing appreciation for federalism and localism. The protesters engaging in violence, like the ones at U.C. Berkeley, are obviously unhealthy. But underneath it all, many of my moderate and liberal friends have woken up to something that has been troubling for me for a decade and a half: the increasing centralization of power in the presidency. Gail : This is the moment when I note that virtually no one in the anti-Trump ranks is calling for violence. Go on about the centralization of power. Ben : We shouldn’t care as much about the presidency as we do. The imperial presidency expanded under George W. Bush, and Barack Obama ended up giving Donald Trump far more levers of power than many people would like. It’s a reminder that citizens should never invest powers in government that you would not want held by your worst enemy. I like things locally grown, particularly government. \nAdvertisement   Gail : There were moments in the Obama presidency when I thought, “Wow, all these executive actions may not set the greatest precedent.” But here’s the thing: Ever since the rise of the Tea Party — actually, ever since the rise of Speaker Newt Gingrich — there’s been a collapse of Congress’s ability to do anything. So eventually, a frustrated president will act around them. If you didn’t like the Obama executive order on immigration, blame it on the people who torpedoed the bipartisan work on a congressional immigration reform bill. Ben : You’re right about Congress not doing its job. But I’d argue that it goes back even earlier — we’ve basically had more than half a century of Congress ceding power, often in their own political self-interest. They’ve purposefully made themselves political eunuchs. Think about it this way: As a member of Congress, it’s a lot easier to direct a bureaucratic agency to make a rule instead of making it yourself. Then, if the rule hurts a constituent, you can write angry letters and hold hearings and generally go all Foghorn Leghorn, and you don’t get the blame. You just told them to write a rule, after all. Members of Congress do this constantly to protect themselves from criticism, and the result is they have vastly diminished their ability to represent us as the first branch of government. Gail : When it comes to actual spending, I agree with you. It’s very interesting to watch conservatives who rail against federal spending throw themselves in front of any bill that eliminates money for something in their district. You know, this is the burden of fiscal conservatism. Cost-cutters always wind up looking like hypocrites, while liberals just naturally seem consistent. Ben : Well, they’re consistent in their hypocrisy! Chesterton was right: “The business of progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.” Gail : I’d be extremely wealthy if I had a dollar for every member of Congress who railed against the Environmental Protection Agency and then added the caveat: “But of course we want clean air and water…” You don’t get clean air and water without government rules. \nAdvertisement Ben, I’ve made you list the things you like about Early Trump. What turns you off? Ben : One thing that is not encouraging is how poorly our media is adapting to the moment. Gail : I want to register a protest that the one bad thing is our fault. But go on. Ben : I have a theory about this: It is that we have a president who has been very famous for a very long time, which is a rarity historically. It causes everyone to view his decisions through a Trumpian lens. As Gabriel García Márquez said, “The problem is that you’re famous for 24 hours a day” — so everything every day takes on the appearance of being unique to Trump, when it’s oftentimes business as usual. Gail : Although the business frequently seems to be conducted in a uniquely weird way. Ben : Weird for presidents, yes, but not weird for Trump. I’d point to multiple instances where a journalist will cite something as an act of Trump, when it turns out the Obama administration did pretty much the same thing. See, for example, the stories about having more business with the Russian FSB , or changing the name of Black History Month , or displaying just Trump books in the library . This has the defect of constant blaring klaxons announcing “Breaking news” to learn later that it was unimportant. The point being, Trump’s tenure is going to be odd enough. Let’s not make it stranger than it already is. Gail : On this, we are in accord. And I will not even throw in a snarky comment about how it couldn’t be stranger unless the White House issued an announcement that for security reasons, all federal employees will be required to come to work naked. Ben : It would mean fewer bureaucrats and an incentive for them to get in shape! People would eat healthier, more people would telecommute, DC’s SoulCycle businesses would love it. I don’t see the problem. Gail : See, in this administration, you have to be very careful with the use of humor. Your jokes can wind up as federal policy. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:59:59.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
