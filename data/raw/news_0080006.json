The revamped variant of the iconic Nokia 3310 alongside other Nokia-branded Android phone will be ‘Made in India’, will cost low and go on sale by June this year, according to a report by Economic Times .\nIn a statement to the daily, HMD Global CEO Arto Nummela confirmed to partner with Foxconn, an electronic manufacturing firm, to manufacture Nokia units in the country. The move to manufacture Nokia units in India will lessen their cost, lower than of those available globally.\n“All phones that are sold in India will be made in India,” said Nummela.\nIts launch price is €49, that is, approximately Rs 3,500, but it is likely to cost under Rs 3000 in the country.
