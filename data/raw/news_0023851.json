There were interesting developments for the East, but when it comes to the playoff races, the West saw the most interesting shuffling. \nThe Minnesota Wild fattened their Central Division lead over Chicago and others, the San Jose Sharks coughed up an overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres and the Anaheim Ducks failed to gain ground on the Oilers. \nThat’s interesting stuff, but let’s focus on the teams fighting for their playoff survival, where the most dramatic movement happened. \nFirst, the wild card races: \n1. Blues – 59 points in 54 games, St. Louis shut out the Senators ( read more here ) 2. Flames – 59 points in 56 games, Calgary edged Pittsburgh via shootout \nKings – 58 points in 54 games, Los Angeles dropped a humbling loss to Tampa Bay ( click for more ) Jets – 54 in 56 games after 4-2 loss to the Wild Canucks – 52 in 53 games after regulation loss to Predators Stars – 52 in 54 games after losing to Maple Leafs \nAs you can see, there seems to be a distance building between the teams in playoff position, one squad on the outside looking in (the Kings) and teams that are falling behind. \nBattle for third place in Central \n3. Predators – 60 points in 53 games \nBlues – 59 in 54 games Jets – 54 in 56 games Stars – 52 in 54 games \nNashville and St. Louis are in a tight battle for that third spot (which would place them against the Blackhawks right now). Some might count the Stars and Jets out of the running for the third spot. \nBattle for third in the Pacific \n3. Flames – 59 points in 56 games \nKings – 58 in 54 games Canucks – 52 in 53 games *** \nOK, as you can see, there’s room for the Blues, Predators, Flames and Kings to jockey for positioning, whether it means in the wild card races or for the third spot in their respective divisions. \nWhile tonight was very tough on Los Angeles, the Blues, Predators and Flames have all looked at the playoff picture with reasons for pessimism as well. The races for the last four spots in the West could be very dramatic, especially if teams like the Stars, Jets or Canucks manage surges of their own.
