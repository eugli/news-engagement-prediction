The nomination was thought to be Mr. Northam’s for the taking until Mr. Perriello made a surprise entry in January , vowing to make Virginia, the only Southern state that supported Hillary Clinton, “a firewall” against the new president. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Northam, the chosen successor of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term, had locked up support from every major Democratic official in a state that is trending leftward. But then Mr. Trump won in November, and Mr. Perriello saw his opening. Addressing college students and local residents at his town hall meeting, Mr. Perriello seemed to be just as focused on Washington and the new administration as he was on Richmond, the state capital. Mr. Perriello said Mr. Trump “ran the most viciously racist campaign of my lifetime,” and cited the president’s “trial balloon” about using the National Guard for deportations . Mr. Perriello lamented that a speech by Senator John McCain warning about Trump-style nationalism had not gotten sufficient attention. He name-dropped the newest liberal protest group, Indivisible , and won laughs with an in-joke about how the “paid protesters” Mr. Trump has talked so much about are “still waiting for their checks.” Mr. Perriello entered the race before millions of protesters had flooded American cities in opposition to Mr. Trump, before demonstrations had broken out at airports across the country in response to his travel ban and before Democrats began seeing swelling turnouts at organizing meetings. “A lot of the establishment said that I clearly didn’t get Virginia, that this was not a local issue that people expected from their governors,” Mr. Perriello said with evident satisfaction. “This was actually a matter of me having very much a sense of where Virginia voters were in terms of their concerns.” It remains to be seen whether that claim is correct — the answer will come in the primary on June 13. But if he is proved right, it will indicate that Trump-bashing is enough to transcend one’s own past apostasies on issues dear to the left in a Democratic primary. And it will underscore how much this state has changed. Scheduled in typically low-turnout elections the year after the presidential votes, Virginia’s primaries and conventions in governor’s races have been dominated by those engaged in politics, and particularly local and state government. So the issues discussed have largely been unique to Virginia, a history-drenched state with a healthy self-regard and a bipartisan commitment to business. In Mr. Northam’s view, this year will continue in the same pattern. “The most important thing for Virginia is our economy,” he said in an interview in his office adjacent to the State Capitol, highlighting the job gains the state has had under him and Mr. McAuliffe and outlining a message just as easily offered had Mr. Trump never left “The Apprentice.” “If we’re not helping businesses grow and bringing in new business and new manufacturers to Virginia, then the rest of these things we like to talk about are not that important.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The two Democratic candidates are as stylistically different as their strategic calculations. Mr. Northam, 57, could have been a candidate for governor here decades ago, before Virginia was transformed into a suburb-dominated and culturally diverse dynamo. The easygoing son of a judge who grew up across the Chesapeake Bay on the state’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam bears the state’s distinctive accent, a diploma from one of its venerated institutions, the Virginia Military Institute, and a direct connection to its painful history. Addressing a black fraternity alumni group visiting the Capitol, he noted that his parents had kept him enrolled in public schools after Virginia’s leaders reluctantly integrated under federal order. “That’s something I’m very proud of,” he said. Before being elected lieutenant governor, Mr. Northam was a state senator and, after a stint in the Army, had a pediatric neurology practice. Mr. Perriello, 42, reflects a newer Virginia. The grandson of Italian immigrants, he was reared near Charlottesville, went to Yale and became a diplomat and social justice activist.

Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times He speaks from the lexicon of modern-day liberalism — alluding to the “structural privileges” he enjoyed — and is plainly trying to position himself as the preferred candidate of the left. Yet in the one term he served in the House before being swept out with the Tea Party wave of 2010, he took positions that have raised doubts about his ideological consistency. Representing a conservative-leaning district, Mr. Perriello received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association in his re-election bid and supported an amendment to the Affordable Care Act barring insurance companies participating in the law’s exchanges from covering abortion.
