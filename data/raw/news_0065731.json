Sadly this was not to be. Claudio Ranieri.

To Steve Kutner and Franco Granello for bringing me the opportunity to become a champion. \n“Mostly I have to thank Leicester City Football Club. The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever.” \nSky sources understand Ranieri has told those closest to him he felt he still had the respect of the vast majority of the dressing room and only had potential issues with ‘a couple’ of players. Jose goes to bat for Ranieri 1:03 \nIt is believed he feels some players had difficulty adjusting after what was achieved last season. \nRanieri failed to mention his assistant Craig Shakespeare in the statement. Sky sources understand, however, the Italian has told friends he had no problems - professional or personal - with Shakespeare, who has been placed in temporary charge ahead of the Monday Night Football clash with Liverpool. \nRanieri added: “Thank you to all the journalists and the media who came with us and enjoyed reporting on the greatest story in football. \n“My heartfelt thanks to everybody at the club, all the players, the staff, everybody who was there and was part of what we achieved - but mostly to the supporters.

No one can ever take away what we together have achieved. \n“I hope you think about it and smile every day the way I always will. It was a time of wonderfulness and happiness that I will never forget. It’s been a pleasure and an honour to be a champion with all of you.” \nIt is thought Ranieri has no plans to retire because he still feels fresh and young.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:58:39.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
