(CBC)\nShe adds that students have told her translation apps on devices are also very helpful for those who are learning English as a second language. \"They do that right on their cellphones, and I couldn't imagine not having them be able to do that in the classroom,\" she said.\nStill, Warkentin maintains a strict policy when it comes to cellphone use in the class that isn't connected to learning. She'll issue a warning once, and then confiscate the device for the period if a student is caught a second time, and she says that happens daily.\n\"I know what that Snapchat screen looks like. I know the sound that your phone makes when you're logging on to a certain game,\" she said. \"So it's pretty easy for me to shut them down when they are doing those things.\"\nImportance of face-to-face interaction This week, Earl Grey Senior Public School in Toronto banned cellphones from the classroom after parents complained students were using them improperly when they should have been learning.\nWarkentin doesn't support such a ban, and she says her students don't either. Instead, she believes in teaching students about the balance between screen time and face-to-face interaction.\nShe teaches a \"digital citizenship unit\" where her students learn about cellphone security and privacy, the negative impacts of screen time on adolescent brain development, and communication skills.\n\"I think just having those conversations in the classroom, challenging them with little things, telling them the importance of taking time away from the screen, I think that's a good place to start,\" she said.\nWhat do you think?\nDo you support an outright cellphone ban in Ottawa classrooms?", "external_links": ["http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9672562.js", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/9672562/"], "published": "2017-02-23T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:54:20.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
