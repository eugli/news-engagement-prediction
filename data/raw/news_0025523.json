But we are failing on six of seven key goals. \nIn a concerning update, progress on decreasing Indigenous child deaths appears to be plateauing. \nFor the first time in several years, that target is marked as not on track, Mr Turnbull said. \n\"We are also reminded of the fragility of life and the heavy burden of families, communities and governments,\" he said. \n\"I am very saddened and disappointed that the target to have the gap in Indigenous child mortality is not on track.\" \nThe Government's target to halve Indigenous unemployment by 2018 will not be met, but the Prime Minister said it would be re-evaluated in partnership with Aboriginal organisations. \nAt a Closing the Gap breakfast in Canberra, National Congress of Australia's First Peoples co-chair Jackie Huggins told the Prime Minister it was another round of disheartening news. \n\"Respectfully your disappointment will not compare to our old people and what they feel at the repeated news that our lives are still shorter sicker and poorer than other Australians,\" she said. \n\"We have seen many reports and inquiries over the years make important recommendations — 400 in fact — without the required attention or response from government.\" Redfern Statement support on the agenda \nThe National Congress of Australia's First Peoples — a member-based Indigenous representative organisation — this morning hosted a breakfast at Parliament House and delivered its blueprint for change to the nation's political leaders. \nMr Turnbull, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Greens leader Richard Di Natale all attended. \nThe Congress urged them to support the Redfern Statement, an 18-page manifesto released during last year's election campaign. \n\"That's about resetting the relationship, working with us, acknowledging that we have the solutions and value our experience and our expertise within our service organisations and within our communities,\" Congress co-chair Rod Little said. \n\"We are looking for a renewed relationship.\" \nThe Redfern Statement calls for dozens of changes, including reversing Abbott-era budget cuts, adding a Closing the Gap target aimed at reducing imprisonment rates and establishing a standalone department for Indigenous affairs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:57:36.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
