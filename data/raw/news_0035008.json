Editor Advertisement \nWhat's this new ruling about the Singapore Sports School indicating that any prizes, be it monetary or products, that the students of the school win while representing the school must be given to the school instead? Previously, the student-athletes get to keep their winnings as long as these prizes were not clearly awarded to the school. \nHave the school gotten too greedy for their own good? The students pay a school fee for their rights to be in the school, and I'm very sure there are other fees that they are paying in their duration studying at the school. So, to be rewarded for winning competitions that they take part in, even though as student athletes of the school, shouldn't they be allowed to keep their hard earned prizes? \nStudents should not be forced to channel back whatever they have won to the school. Let them enjoy the fruits of their labour. For the school, isn't seeing your students winning things under your umbrella enough, rather then go after their prize winnings also? \nPrem Shankar \nA.S.S.
