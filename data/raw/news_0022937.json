(William Vavrek Photography)\nFire crews moved one more cat out of the home and made quick work of the flames, containing them to underneath the trailer.\nOther than minor smoke damage, the interior of the home was unaffected. No one was injured.\nGrant said a cat alerting its family of an emergency is not the preferred method of fire detection.\n\"We definitely prefer to have the use of smoke detectors or heat sensors within a residence,\" he said.\nBut he also said this isn't the first time he's heard of animals alerting their owners of potential dangers.\nHe said he's seen it before with a dog, but never a cat.\nThe cause of the fire is still unknown at this time.\n4-month-old puppy wakes up owner during Vancouver apartment fire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:38:45.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
