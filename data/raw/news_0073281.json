(Supplied: One and All) \nShe conceded that modern navigational requirements meant the tall ship had an engine, GPS, radars and satellite navigation, but said they took a secondary role when trainees came on board, such as when 18 young people from remote parts of the state sailed to Port Lincoln recently. \n\"They had an opportunity of a lifetime to get on board and have five days at sea,\" she said. \n\"It is a big buzz for the crew when these kids actually start to meld together and work as a team. \n\"After two or three days at sea we actually hand the ship over to them and they start to bring the ship home. \n\"It's an enormous high when they get off the ship, it's that real sense of achievement.\" \nTo mark 30 years, the One and All is offering special weekend voyages in early April and will also sail to Kangaroo Island for events to mark the anniversary. \nMs Roberts said she was not sure how many nautical miles the One and All had sailed over the years, but its small professional crew always loved the chance to be out on the water. \n\"Every day's a good day to go sailing, in our book, even if it's really windy or there's no wind, we love it,\" she said.
