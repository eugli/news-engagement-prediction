Credit Theodore Parisienne A bull escaped from a Queens slaughterhouse on Tuesday and was free on the streets for two hours, but died after being captured, the police said. The black bull ran away from the Aziz Slaughter House on Beaver Road in Jamaica shortly after 10 a.m., the police said. By 10:20 a.m. the police were receiving 911 calls about a “vicious animal” right across from the Jamaica train hub on Archer Avenue, Detective Ahmed Nasser, a police spokesman, said. The police shot the bull with several tranquilizer darts, but it kept moving. Video from a news helicopter showed the animal trotting down streets and onto lawns, with a police car in slow pursuit.

But it escaped again, trudging along for an additional half mile before sitting in a yard on 158th Street and 116th Avenue around 12:20 p.m. An animal sanctuary in New Jersey agreed to take the bull, and the authorities drove it to a city shelter in East New York, Brooklyn, to await pickup. But the bull was pronounced dead there at 1:50 p.m. the police said. Escaped livestock are relatively common in New York City, which has dozens of slaughterhouses.
