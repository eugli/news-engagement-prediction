Exhibit A: a black-and-white photo of a woman with “Fuck You Governor Herbert” painted across her nude body. She holds up a middle finger over her vagina. \nCat Palmer, the woman behind the camera, posted the image to social media. Droves of women tagged Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a conservative Republican, until, Palmer claims, someone from his social media team blocked her account. (Herbert’s camp says the photo violated Facebook’s policies and that they never blocked Palmer.) \nPalmer, a self-described “photographer, provocateur and activist,” doesn’t back down in a fight, even when she’s clearly David to the government’s Goliath. Her work thumbs its nose at gender inequality and religious hypocrisies as much as it celebrates the act of free expression. She has parodied the Last Supper, photographed numerous women with shaved heads and shot nude women with statements painted on their bodies about how — radical concept — they should get to make decisions about those bodies. In short, Palmer has shaken up Utah’s art scene, exhibiting at Planned Parenthood and winning accolades such as best feminist of the year. “Cat’s been really visible, forging her own path in the state,” says art critic Scotti Hill. \nYou let her leave the house looking like that? \nWith dyed hair and a tat of the Salt Lake City skyline on her left leg, the petite 37-year-old doesn’t look like a former Mormon . When Palmer was growing up in Southern California, her family was religious. Her mom married at 16 and had her soon after. Palmer ended up moving in with her grandparents, opting for hot-pink dreadlocks and vintage dresses paired with Chucks rather than somber, pressed white shirts and black pants. She picked up a camera at age 15 and started photographing local up-and-coming bands. “People would say things about me to [my grandparents]. You know: ‘You let her leave the house looking like that?’ ” Her grandparents’ response? “So what? She’s not hurting anybody.” All the while, Palmer regularly attended church services (her grandmother was a prominent member of the chapter).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:34:05.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
