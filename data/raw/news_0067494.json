Ghada Selem, left, and Ann Rabin said the became new friends while participating in the Moms Building Bridge's Community Unity Circle of Peace held Friday outside the Islamic Center in Naperville. (Steve Metsch / Naperville Sun) Privacy Policy \nAs they stood outside the Islamic Center of Naperville as part of Friday's Community Unity Circle of Peace, a Jewish woman and a Muslim woman celebrated their newfound friendship. \n\"We just met, but we're friends now,\" said Ann Rabin, who attends Congregation Beth Shalom, of fellow Naperville resident Ghada Selem, who prays at the Islamic Center mosque on Ogden Avenue. \nBoth women were smiling when they asked a passerby to take their photo with Rabin's phone. \nThey were part of a multicultural gathering to show support for area Muslims. The event, sponsored by the Islamic Center and Moms Building Bridges, attracted about 250 people. Many held signs reading, \"Hate Has No Home Here.\" \n\"I think this give us a lot of hope,\" Rabin said of the large turnout on a seasonably cool and cloudy Friday. \"We're all the same. The outside is just wrapping. Inside is what counts.\" \nSelem nodded in agreement. \"If you open your heart, you can be friends with anyone. I'm so happy. I'm very happy she came here in solidarity with us. We can all live together without hate and ignorance.\" \nThe solidarity theme was celebrated as the group slowly walked around the building, sang \"Let There Be Peace On Earth,\" recited a Charter for Compassion, which calls on people to \"treat all others as we wish to be treated,\" and then gathered inside for refreshments. \nThe Rev. Grayson Van Camp, of Glen Ellyn, a parish associate at the Presbyterian Church of Western Springs, said, \"This is how we're going to make America great again.\" \n\"I'm here today because this is what I believe,\" Van Camp said, raising her homemade sign that read, \"Islam and Christianity are both religions of peace.\" \nGestures like that are \"heartwarming,\" said Shoaib Khadri, president of the Islamic Center. \n\"At the end of the day, the divisiveness, the hatred stems from a fear of the unknown. Some people just don't know any better,\" Khadri said. \nKhadri said while he's noticed \"an increase in the divisiveness\" since President Trump took office, he remains hopeful. \n\"If it comes from the top,\" he said. \"That makes it seem acceptable and it has emboldened people who were either right wing or anti-minority that it is okay to act upon those feelings. That's why when people like this, people of consciousness, come together, it's a feeling of hopefulness, a feeling of support.\" \nFouzia Hassan Khan, of Moms Building Bridges, said the group's members \"come together to promote love, acceptance and tolerance.\" \n\"It's not just for Muslims. It's for any group being mistreated, stereotype or, God forbid, demonized,\" she said. \nThe group sponsored a unity walk in Naperville in December, and may host a unity picnic this summer, she said. \nAs Naperville resident Amani Soliman, a native of Egypt, strolled around the center, she said it was \"touching\" to see so many non-Muslims outside after she attended Friday prayers. \nIt's a scene she'd love to see repeated, \"not just at mosques but at synagogues and churches.\" \nAlthough there was a religious feel to the event, not everyone was representing a church. \nPat Marinelli, of Aurora, who claims no certain faith, said she thought it was important to attend so she could \"stand by my neighbors, to stand up for religious freedom, for differences and diversity.\" \nThe current political climate is \"frightening,\" she said. \n\"It seems to be drumming up hatred and distrust in people instead of caring,\" said Marinelli, who is retired. \"It's not what I grew up with.\" \nSteve Metsch is a freelance reporter for the Naperville Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:26:36.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
