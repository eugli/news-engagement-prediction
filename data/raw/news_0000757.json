There the slender young woman was introduced to wushu. \nWhen she returned one year ago she immediately opened her club in a stronghold of the ethnic Hazara community, of which she is a member, in Kabul. \n“Unfortunately, we have only Hazara students here and I don’t like this, I am not comfortable with this solo ethnicity in my club,” she tells AFP, adding she wants to welcome girls from other communities. \nDemanding and complete \nHazaras, a long persecuted Shiite minority, are among the most open people in Afghanistan. Women are freer in their movements and more independent; men less oppressive to them. \nAs a result, they are typically found in the young teams of cyclists, climbers, and runners in the country who are often anxious to “open the way for others”. \n“My family never opposed my class here, my father was just concerned for me, he found me too small and he feared I could get in trouble,” said Soraya Rezayi, 19, with the silhouette of a twig like her fellow pupils. \n“But thanks to my training I became more powerful,” she adds. “If someone came to harass me I could certainly defend myself.” \n“I am the first lady in my family to do sport,” says Latifa Safayi. \nAged just 15, she already sees a long way into the future: to overcome her parents’ reluctance to let her train, she proclaimed her dream of “representing the country and ... raising the Afghan flag abroad”. \n“I want to change the image of Afghanistan, too well known for war and drugs,” she vows. \nNow she trains three times a week, the aches which overcame her body in the beginning fading to a sport she describes as “demanding and complete”. \nFor their master Sima, the biggest obstacle was readjusting to her country of origin. \n“Iran is a developed country but here in Afghanistan there are some very conservative thoughts to fight,” she says. \n“But it is only up to women to do something for themselves. So please, get out, show your capabilities, and don’t let anyone choose for yourself.” \nIt is not only on the training mats that the young woman knows how to fight. \nBut her demonstration this week at the top of the hill of Sharak Haji Nabi, although a traditional rendezvous of Hazara walkers, attracted too much attention in a country where many still believe women should be veiled and confined to the home. \nShe does not plan to return soon, she confesses. -AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:26:30.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
