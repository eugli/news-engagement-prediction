(Melissa Healy) \nUnlike most other drugs, mifepristone may only be dispensed at a doctor’s office or a hospital. A doctor or nurse practitioner who wants to provide medication abortion has to register with the drug’s distributor and stock the medication in his or her office. At a minimum, this process is burdensome for clinicians, and it discourages them from making these abortions available to patients. Given how common violence is against abortion providers, doctors may not want to get on the drug distributor’s list. Writing a prescription, as doctors do for just about all other drugs, is a simpler process. \nThe ostensible reason for the hurdles is patient safety. After almost 17 years of experience with mifepristone in the United States, its extensive, positive safety record supports the removal of such restrictions. The drug can be prescribed by clinicians and dispensed in pharmacies without increasing risks for patients. Some people have voiced concerns that making abortion easier to access will make the abortion rate increase. But that was not the case in Iowa. \nJust as less access in Texas was associated with an increase in later abortions, research shows that more access leads to earlier ones. In Iowa, an innovative program was started in 2008 to provide medication abortion using telemedicine. State law in Iowa mandates that only a physician can provide an abortion, and there are just a handful of doctors who offer the service. Telemedicine extends their reach. \nWomen can visit a clinic close to them, where they will get an ultrasound and obtain any necessary blood tests. They then video-consult with the providing doctor, who reviews the clinical information and determines if medication abortion is appropriate. Through a telepharmacy system, the doctor can then remotely open a lockbox at the clinic and dispense the drugs. In the two years after telemedicine was introduced in Iowa, there was a significant increase in medication abortion — particularly among women living in rural areas of the state — and a significant reduction in second-trimester abortion. \nSome people have voiced concerns that making abortion easier to access will make the abortion rate increase. But that was not the case in Iowa. After the introduction of telemedicine, the abortion rate continued to decline statewide, probably because the state also invested in a program to improve access to the most effective contraceptive methods. \nAs the New England Journal article points out, if the regulatory restrictions on mifepristone were removed, more clinicians would provide medication abortion and make use of new ways of providing it. Telemedicine in particular would expand, and prescriptions could be picked up at a local pharmacy or ordered by mail so that women could have a private abortion without traveling long distances to a providing doctor and clinic. \nIn the United States, 39% of women of reproductive age live in a county without an abortion provider. Proactive policies aimed at improving their access to abortion seem unlikely to gain traction in the current political climate. But adding hurdles that force women to obtain an abortion later in pregnancy — or to seek out options on their own, such as online medications of unknown quality — is bad for women’s health. \nThe FDA can unburden medication abortion from outdated overregulation and allow pharmacy dispensing of the drug, a move that would help more women obtain care as soon as they have made their decision to terminate a pregnancy. \nDaniel Grossman is a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences and director of the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at UC San Francisco.
