The smell of blood attracts them,” he said. \n“Overfishing in rivers also depletes food resources for crocodiles, forcing them to go on land for food,” added Mohd Izwan. \n“Pollution also drives crocodiles out from the rivers.” \nRiverine communities in Sarawak believe killing a crocodile is bad luck, thus adding to their numbers. \nMohd Izwan, who is doing his PhD on crocodiles focusing on ecology and human-crocodile conflicts, said there were 52 human-crocodile conflicts reported between 2010 and August 2016 with 27 deaths. \nSarawak Forest Department director Sapuan Ahmad had said before that surveys have shown there were about 20,000 wild crocodiles in rivers in the state. \nTen rivers have eight to 14 crocodiles per kilometre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:52:40.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
