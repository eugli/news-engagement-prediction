Most are from the banned countries with nearly a third being from Syria.\nSince the ban was lifted, 64 percent of refugees said they are Muslim compared to 31 percent in the first few weeks of Trump's presidency.\nThis makes sense considering the State Department is making up for cancelled travel plans for people from the seven Muslim majority countries.\nThe State Department told the Times in a statement: 'rescheduling those whose travel had been suspended the previous week.'\nPerhaps Trump didn't link to anything besides the headline because part of the article echos the sentiments of many of his opponents.\n'SO DANGEROUS!': President Trump tweets that he believes the ruling against the travel ban is dangerous since more refugees from those countries are being offered asylum\nErol Kekic, executive director of the Church World Service’s refugee program said in the article: 'What I would hope for is we find a way to communicate with this administration and find a way to sit down and understand why are these, what I’ll call alternative facts, about the danger of refugees being presented, because it’s just not correct.'\nPresident Trump says he could execute a new immigration order within days, as his administration looks to quickly move beyond a defeat in a federal appeals court in San Francisco.\nTrump made the comments aboard Air Force One en route to Mar-a-Lago, as his team grapples with a court panel's ruling Wednesday that kept a stay in place that prevents the government from enforcing his new 90-day ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\nTrump was defiant on Twitter about the 'disgraceful' ruling, which he vowed to fight, even as he suggested his administration is pursuing other ways to try to get around it.\nHe said he is confident he'll win in court, but 'We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order,' the Associated Press reported.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters traveling with him to Florida that he is considering 'just filing a brand new order' as a way of responding to a federal appeals court panel that halted his new immigration order\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie Abe step off of Air Force One as they arrive in West Palm Beach, Florida\n'We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that,' Trump said.\nReferring to the court case that knocked down his order, Trump said, 'We will win that battle. The unfortunate part is that it takes time statutorily, but we will win that battle. We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order.'\nThe administration has decided not to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, The Hill and other outlets reported. Under such an appeal, this week's ruling by a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel would have gone before the evenly-divided 4-4 Supreme Court. A tie ruling would have let the initial ruling stand, potentially leaving the administration in a weaker position.\nDrafters could try to craft an order that would better withstand judicial scrutiny, including claims that it discriminates based on religion, in part due to Trump's earlier claims that he would instate a 'Muslim ban.'\nBut Trump indicated it might just be tinkering.\nThe new order would likely change 'very little' from the original. The new action could come Monday or Tuesday, just as Trump returns from his Florida weekend, where he plans to golf with the Japanese prime minister.\n'I'd like to surprise you,' Trump said.\nEarlier Friday, the White House floated the idea of countering a stunning appeals court ruling that set back Trump's immigration order – redrafting the order in a way that could take effect immediately and be more resistant to legal challenge.\nPresident Trump signaled an unmistakable instinct to fight for his original order Thursday night when bluntly told opponents: 'See you in court!' after criticizing judges who stood in his path.\nPresident Trump made his comments aboard Air Force One while traveling to Florida with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\nPresident Donald Trump has used Twitter over the last few days to try and encourage the three judge panel to rule in his way. Now, the White House is signaling that redrafting the order isn't 'off the table'\nBut now, the White House is also laying out an alternative path. Asked if the president was considering signing a new executive order on immigration, a White House official told CNN , ''Nothing's off the table.'\nCNN's Jim Acosta added on air Friday morning, 'They may go back and revise this executive order that that is a possibility that no options are being essentially taken off the table at this point.'\nBy redrafting the order, the White House could conceivably try to correct several elements of the order that have drawn scrutiny in court.\nNBC reported Friday that White House attorneys were already engaged in the effort. Options include continuing the court fight that Trump has vowed or signing a new order 'very soon.'\nPlaintiffs have argued that the order essentially codifies Trump's campaign 'Muslim ban,' which he overtly campaigned on, then describing it in new terms as the campaign wore on.\nThe existing order includes only seven countries where Muslims are the vast majority. It also provides a special carveout for religious minorities in those countries, a provision that would help Christians facing persecution.\nState governments have also complained about the hasty drafting of the order, and how it placed a burden by blocking speakers, lecturers, and students from affected countries with legitimate visas. These and other elements might be able to be tweaked to better insulate the order.\nIn its Thursday ruling, the 9th Circuit court of appeals noted the interest in the free flow of travel that avoids separation of families and 'freedom from discrimination.'\nTrump blasted the decision with a comment from the Lawfare blog that the court opinion didn't even bother to cite the statute. 'A disgraceful decision!' Trump wrote.\nBut the blog's author, Benjamin Wittes, noted when he tweeted his post after the president's comment that he backs the court panel's decision.\n'You decide whether the POTUS is quoting me in context. Here's the article. For the record, I support the decision,' he wrote. In the post, Wittes called referenced Trumps 'repeated and overt invocations of the most invidious motivations' when describing Trump's Muslim ban. He also notes both broad presidential powers and the 'incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.'\nAfter a San Francisco appeals court panel of three judges unanimously ruled to not reinstate Donald Trump's travel ban, his defeated election rival, Hillary Clinton took a jab at the president.\nThe former secretary of state tweeted '3-0', noting the judges' unanimous call.\nSoon, Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, hit back at Clinton with a stinging reminder of her defeat in the presidential election.\n'PA, WI, MI,' Conway, an advisor to Trump in the White House, said in a message of her own. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are the states that were supposed to secure Clinton's presidency but went red.\nJust minutes after the ruling, Trump also ashed out on Twitter with an all caps message.\n'SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!' Trump wrote.\nTrump blasted the Thursday court ruling as a 'disgraceful decision!'\nShortly after the decision was announced, President Donald Trump announced the government would be repealing the decision in a tweet using all caps\nPresident Donald Trump's defeated presidential rival Hillary Clinton, trolled the president tonight with a tweet noting the judges' unanimous call\nThe panel of three judges from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travelers to enter the U.S.\nAn appeal to the US Supreme Court seems likely and would put the decision in the hands of a divided court that has a vacancy.\nTrump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, could not be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban.\nThe president also spoke to reporters in the West Wing and called the judges' ruling a 'political decision'.\nHe reiterated that he would appeal: 'It's a very very serious situation so we look forward to seeing them in court,' he said, according to NBC News .\nThe president also told NBC News that the ruling didn't undercut his new presidency.\n'No this is just a decision that came down but we're going to win the case,' Trump said.\nScroll down for video\nTrump's campaign manager hit back with a stinging reminder of Clinton's electoral defeat. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are the states that were supposed to secure Clinton's presidency but went red\nThe three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals: (left to right) Judge Richard Clifton, Judge William Canby and Judge Michelle Friedland\nThe three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in their decision that they believed the government, which includes Trump's White House, was unlikely to win an appeal.\nThe appeals panel said the government presented no evidence to explain the urgent need for the executive order to take effect immediately. The judges noted compelling public interests on both sides.\nU.S. District Judge James Robart (pictured) ruled last Friday to suspend President Trump's travel ban\n'On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.'\nThe court rejected the administration's claim that it did not have the authority to review the president's executive order.\n'There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,' the court said.\nWhile they did not rule on the actual merits of the states' argument that the travel ban was intended to target Muslims, the judges rejected the government's claim that the court should not consider statements by Trump or his advisers about wishing to enact such a ban.\nConsidering those remarks, the judges said, falls within well-established legal precedent.\nThe decision also said that the states suing, Washington and Minnesota, had standing in the case because their public universities were suffering harm from the executive order, which was preventing scholars from the seven countries from coming in.\nDavid Pearce, left, and his daughter Crissy Pearce hold signs outside of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Tuesday\nThe White House is seen as the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals rules not to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban\nThe judges wrote that they believed Washington and Minnesota raised serious allegations about religious discrimination in the ban.\n'Bottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington,' Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson said at a press conference held shortly after the ruling dropped.\n'We are a nation of laws and as I've said, as we have said, from day one that those laws apply to everybody in our country and that includes the president of the United States,' Ferguson added.\nFollowing the announcement, Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor, told Fox News's The First 100 Days: 'We are fully confident now that we will get our day in court and have an opportunity to argue this on merits. We will prevail.\nShe said President Donald Trump's travel ban is legal because it's written in a 1952 statute that the president has great authority over America's national interests and security.\nConway added that the purpose of the order is to temporarily suspend travel from seven countries - Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia - that don't have 'adequate vetting procedures'.\n'If we can argue that on the merits and people really look at that statute ... we'll get a different result'.\nThe appeals court was looking at a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travelers to enter the U.S.\nAn appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible, though the White House could also keep the case in the 9th Circuit and have it heard 'en banc,' by all the judges.\nUS District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The ban temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.\nTemporary setback: Kellyanne Conway, White House counsellor, (pictured on Thursday evening) said they were 'fully confident' that they 'will prevail'\nJustice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\nThe states said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities.\nCiting Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.\nBoth sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments Tuesday conducted by phone – an unusual step – and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media.\nIt attracted a huge audience.\nThe judges hammered away at the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but they also challenged the states' argument that it targeted Muslims.\n'I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,' Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota.\nOnly 15 per cent of the world's Muslims are affected by the executive order, the judge said, citing his own calculations.\n'Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism?' Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked the Justice Department attorney.\nThe lower-court judge temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base.\nRobart put the executive order on hold while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.\nAfter that ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country.\nThe ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue. The administration also could change the order, including changing its scope or duration.\nTRUMP DEFEATED - BUT FOR HOW LONG? WHAT COMES NEXT W HAT DOES THE RULING MEAN?\nFor now, it means refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim nations identified in the president's surprise Jan. 27 executive order can continue entering the country. Travelers from those countries won't be detained, or put back on planes heading overseas, and there won't likely be more protests jamming the nation's airports as there were after Trump issued the surprise order.\nBut the executive order isn't dead, either — it just isn't being enforced while the courts debate its legality. The federal government has 14 days to ask the 9th Circuit to reconsider Thursday's decision. It could also file an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, which would go to Justice Anthony Kennedy for referral to the rest of the court.\nRory Little, a former Supreme Court clerk who teaches at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, doesn't think that's such a good idea. In addition to seeking to overturn a reasoned decision, he said, Trump would be facing Chief Justice John Roberts, who just wrote an annual report in which he raved about his District Court judges. The president repeatedly insulted the Seattle judge who ruled against him, in addition to the appeals judges who followed suit.\n'I think Kennedy and Roberts are seething about the president insulting their judges,' Little said. 'If they go to the U.S. Supreme Court, they risk getting a serious adverse ruling.'\nWHAT DID THE COURT CONSIDER?\nThere have been, in effect, two items before the court: the government's appeal of the lower judge's ruling, and its motion to put that ruling on hold pending the appeal. On Thursday, the panel denied the motion for stay and set a briefing schedule for fuller arguments on the merits of the appeal.\nThat prompted some confusion among those watching the case, many of whom expected it to be returned to the Seattle courthouse. Washington's lawyer, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell, wrote to the Seattle court's clerk late Thursday to note the state wouldn't be making an expected court filing because of the new appellate briefing schedule.\nBarring an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court, the government's opening brief is due March 3, with the states' filing due March 24.\nIn denying the motion for stay, the court said it was considering whether the administration was likely to win its appeal, whether suspending the travel ban had harmed the government, and whether the public interest favored granting the stay or rejecting it.\nThe judges agreed that the lower court's ruling was appealable — the only question on which the states lost. They rejected the DOJ's argument that the states lacked standing to sue, noting that some faculty members at state universities were unable to travel, for example.\nBut most forcibly, they rejected the DOJ's notion that the president has nearly unlimited authority over immigration decisions.\n'There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,' the opinion said.\nA PROBLEMATIC EXECUTIVE ORDER?\nBased on what they know so far, Trump's executive order poses some serious constitutional concerns, the panel said. For example, the government hasn't shown that it complies with due process, by giving those affected notice or a hearing before restricting their ability to travel.\nWhile the government insisted that most or all those affected don't have such rights, the court disagreed. The protections of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause aren't limited to U.S. citizens, the judges said.\nFurthermore, while the White House Counsel Donald McGahn issued guidance days after the executive order saying it didn't apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S., some of whom had been caught up in the travel ban, that guidance was of little use, the court wrote.\n'The Government has offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order signed by the President,' the opinion said. 'The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments.'\nA LIBERAL COURT?\nMany conservatives denounced the ruling, and some law professors criticized various aspects of it, including its lack of analysis regarding a law giving the president power to suspend entry of 'any class of aliens' when he finds their entry 'would be detrimental' to the country.\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called the decision misguided and wrote off the court it came from as 'the most notoriously left-wing court in America.'\nWhile the 9th Circuit certainly has a lefty reputation, based in part on the long tenure of the many liberal judges that Democratic President Jimmy Carter appointed, legal scholars say the label is less deserved than it used to be. Two of the judges on the panel that made the ruling are Democratic appointees, while one, that Judge Richard Clifton, was appointed by President George W. Bush.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond Law School, said Clifton's decision to join the opinion should allay any concerns that it was motivated by politics instead of the law. That should make the government think twice before going to the Supreme Court, he said.\nDuring oral arguments Tuesday, Clifton 'was asking the best questions that might lean toward the government, but even he wasn't persuaded on the law or the facts, so that makes it really tough for the government,' Tobias said. 'I don't think they're going to be well-received at the Supreme Court for all kinds of reasons, but mainly because this is a reasonable decision. The precedents are there, they've weighed the issues, and even Clifton signed it.'", "external_links": ["http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-politics/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/829840749822877697", "https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/829843069126184965", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-rewriting-trump-s-controversial-travel-ban-order-sources-n719356?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma", "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319029-trump-not-planning-to-appeal-travel-ban-ruling-to-supreme-court", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/refugees-entering-us-doubled-rate-ruling-trump-tra/"], "published": "2017-02-11T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:53:45.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
