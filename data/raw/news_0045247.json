After turning in a strong performance in the first round of his UFC Fight Night 105 main event bout with Derrick Lewis, the Hawaiian (who happens to be dating Ronda Rousey) wound up on the receiving end of an absolutely vicious series of punches that stopped the fight in the second round.

That's because Lewis tore him apart in the most vicious post-fight interview in UFC history and punctuated his performance by making a quick overture toward Browne's girlfriend, former UFC champion Ronda Rousey. He started that total verbal destruction of Browne by completely no-selling his early offense. \"I just got to do a No. 2, that's all,\" Lewis said when asked about body kicks he absorbed in the first round. \"It's not really hurting from the kick, I've just got to boo-boo.\" Jessica Hudnall @LegKickTKO 2/20/2017, 5:20:47 AM Adding insult to injury like that was enough to make the interview a memorable one, given how fighters rarely use their camera time to say anything more than \"Oh, I'll fight whoever Dana White asks me to next.\" But when asked about how he managed his comeback, Lewis threw verbal punches that were even harder than the ones that stopped the fight. \"I just knew I had a bigger heart than him. He calls himself a man, but he likes to put his hands on women,\" he responded, referencing domestic violence allegations leveled against Browne by his now-ex-wife in 2015. \"So forget that guy, I've got much more heart than he has.\" Jessica Hudnall @LegKickTKO ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:11:28.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
