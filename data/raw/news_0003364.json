Now it has a venue. The March 31 card featuring the rematch between Quinton “Rampage” Jackson and “King Mo” Lawal will be held at the AllState Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Ill. T he Chicago Tribune broke the news Wednesday. The building, formerly known as Rosemont Horizon, is a legendary facility which has hosted the likes of WrestleManias 2 and 13 and middleweight boxing champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler’s 1981 title defense against Mustafa Hamsho. In MMA, the building was the host of UFC 90 in 2008, the first-ever UFC event in Illinois, which was headlined by Anderson Silva’s middleweight title defense against Patrick Cote. It is perhaps best remembered for a debuting Junior dos Santos’ knockout win over Fabricio Werdum. Jackson and Lawal previous met at Bellator 120 in 2014, with Jackson winning a decision which, while unanimous, was hotly debated. That bout was fought at light heavyweight, while the rematch will be at heavyweight.
