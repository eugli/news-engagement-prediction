Dirk Nowitzki and Marc Cuban (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:48 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:48 p.m. ET \nBleacher Report thrives on giving millennials \"all the feels\" by having \"no chill\" with their trendy social content. \nWell, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has mad beef with that. \nAfter Bleacher Report's Instagram and Twitter accounts published a clip of Dirk Nowitzki air-balling a shot with the caption \"Dirk Forever,\" Cuban took his fierce complaints to the very top until the post got taken down. \nJust a few highlights from the tongue-lashing he gave BR \n(E ditor's note: foul language is used) : \nMocking Dirk certainly isn't off limits and nothing about the post was \"unacceptable\" or offensive. In reality, it was just extremely weak. \nOn the surface, it seems like a cheeky jab at Nowitzki from a social media producer. Problem is, there wasn't much context there with the video. At least, not enough for Cuban; maybe it's a bit much to rip on. Cuban clearly felt the same way, and pounced. \nThe Mavs owner pulled no punches getting his guy's back here, hurling threats straight at the Turner president. Sure, the wording in his email was over the top, but he clearly didn't care as long as the objective was achieved. \nTherein lies Cuban's genius. \nWhat player wouldn't want to play for an owner like that? Cuban probably tweeted his exchange as a subtle message to prospective free agents: \"Go to battle for me and this is the level of support and, more importantly, influence you'll have behind you.\" \nESPN wants to pull their writer from traveling with the Mavs? Goodbye ESPN media credentials. Cuban doesn't mess around or care about his image among the sports media titans. All that matters is his players and team are given what he deems is appropriate respect. \nThat type of commitment is how Dallas continues to attract good, young free agents. They nabbed Harrison Barnes this year, and in the past have successfully wooed guys from comfortable situations like Chandler Parsons (back when he was healthy) and even DeAndre Jordan for minute (which in itself was pretty impressive). \nCuban, along with the most unheralded coach in the league, Rick Carlisle, is the reason Dallas won't be out of playoff contention for very long after this season. \nAnd if Cuban has this much clout with media outlets already, imagine if — or when — he's running the country in 2020 .
