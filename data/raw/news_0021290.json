Speculations pointed to a possible role of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), as the destruction of places of worship as well as cultural and historic sites is the group’s signature tactic. \nBack in 2015, the terrorist group’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi encouraged his henchmen to destroy the historic monuments, calling such vandalism a “religious duty.” In a radical interpretation of Islam, imposed by IS, no objects, including stones, should be idolized. \nThe call was echoed by Islamist preacher from Kuwait, Ibrahim Al Kandari, who lamented that “early Muslims who were among prophet Mohammed’s followers did not destroy the pharaohs’ monuments upon entering the Egyptian soil,” adding that their mistake “does not mean that we shouldn’t do it now.” \nREAD MORE: Kuwaiti preacher, ISIS call for demolition of Egypt’s Sphinx, pyramids \nThe Kaaba is a cube-shaped structure, built around a black stone, whose origin is traced back to the ancient times of Adam and Eve. Every year, millions of Muslims set off to Mecca on a pilgrimage known as Hajj. The Hajj is considered to be one of the five pillars of Islam, and is mandatory for every Muslim to undertake for at least once in a lifetime.
