The last President who skipped the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981, when he was recuperating from an assassination attempt, but he still delivered some remarks by telephone. \nIn other words, it’s pretty unusual for a President not to attend the event – but some celebrities and comedy fans have come up with a novel solution to the situation, suggesting that actor Alec Baldwin attend to deliver his now-regular Saturday Night Live impression of Trump instead. The White House Correspondents' Association should invite @AlecBaldwin (as Trump) in his place. #WHCD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T15:33:22.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
