In one sample, PCB levels were 50 times higher than in crabs in one of China’s most polluted rivers. \nThe high concentrations may be because trash or the remains of contaminated fish sink and build up even on the remotest seabeds, providing food for tiny scavengers. \nA beer can seen at 3,780 meters depth at Enigma Seamount.
