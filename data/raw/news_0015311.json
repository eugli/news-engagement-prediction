Editor Advertisement \nWhat is happening to the situation at the hawker centre located above Beauty World Centre? According to reports, they were supposed to vacate their stalls by 11 February, but no official confirmation have been received by the hawkers. \nNo reason was also given to the hawkers on why the stalls have to be closed by then. The hawker centre at Beuaty World Centre is not managed by NEA, but the authorities should help shed some light on what is happening. This involves the livelihood of people, and whether the hawker centre is managed by private business or government, they cannot just instruct people to wind up their business with no valid reason. \nHope the issue will be resolved in the best possible scenario. \nOng SW \nA.S.S.
