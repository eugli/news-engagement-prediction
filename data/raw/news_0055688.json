One of the oldest known board games in the world is Senet from Egypt. Unfortunately no one wrote down the rules, so historians have had to make them up. Many of Africa's traditional board games can be played using materials found in nature. Seeds and stones make perfect game pieces, and boards can be scratched into dirt, dug out of the ground, or drawn on a piece of paper. Mancala is an African board game that is played worldwide, there are in fact hundreds of versions played in Africa. Peter Adams/The Image Bank/Getty Images 1. Mancala, Oware, Bao (Throughout Africa) \nMancala is one of oldest games in the world, dating back thousands of years. Pits have been found carved into the roofs of ancient Egyptian tombs in Luxor and Thebes. I grew up playing bao in Malawi, some of you may know the game as mancala , oware , ayo , omweso , enkeshui or aweet . There are in fact more than 200 versions of this \"count and capture\" game, played throughout Africa, all with slightly different rules In North and West Africa it's common to use two rows of pits, in Ethiopia they play with 3 rows, and in East and southern Africa, they play with four rows. Some games have \"stores\" at the end of each board, others do not. These days you can play online, make your own board , or buy mancala on Amazon.com.

Morabaraba or Umlabalaba (Southern Africa) & Shax (Somalia) \nMorabaraba is a traditional African game played by many in South Africa . A version called Shax is also popular in Somalia and Achi in Ghana. All of them are similar to 3, 6, 9 or 12 Mens Morris played in Europe, but the true origin of the game is still in question. Morabaraba in southern Africa was used to teach herd boys appreciation for tactical thinking. The game pieces are called \"cows\" and the object is to form \"mills\" or rows of three in order to \"shoot\" one of the opponents \"cows\". Rules differ from region to region, but a standard set of rules can be found here . I bought a lovely board from Games from Everywhere , but you can also play online or make it at home. More » Senet. 3. Senet (Egypt) \nSenet is one of the world's oldest board games. A lovely painting in the tomb of Egyptian Queen Nefertari depicts her playing Senet , it dates back to 1295 BC. The Senet game board is a grid of thirty squares, arranged in three rows of ten. Apparently, the original rules were passed along verbally, because no written form has been found. Each player has a set of 5 pawns, and what to do with them has been left up to educated guesses by two historians. The rules they devised created a game that is similar to backgammon. Four sticks, black on one side and white on the other, are used like dice to move the pawns 1,2,3,4 and/or 6 paces ( see complete Senet rules ). You can buy Senet on Amazon, play it online , or download it to your i-Phone. More » Zamma. 4. Zamma, Dhamet (North Africa) \nZamma is a traditional game played in North Africa. It is a bit similar to Alquerque the grandfather of checkers. The board is square with 9 rows across and 9 down. Each player gets 40 pieces, black (called men) and white (called women). Black starts to play first. The pieces follow the pattern of the board, can only move forward, and capture their opponents by hopping over them. If a piece reaches the opposite end of the board it is promoted, like a King in draughts (checkers) and can then move in all directions. Zamma boards have been found dating back to 1400 BC, but modern rules appear to have been influenced by checkers and vary slightly from region to region. More » Fanorona. © Games from Everywhere 5.

It's been played for hundreds of years, legend has it that in the 1500's a King's son was so busy playing the game, he lost his chance to inherit land from his father. Fanorona is similar to Zamma (see above), they both share a common ancestry with Alquerque .
