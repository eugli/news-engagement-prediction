Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIf you're not yet aware of the (sweary) ' Chiefs of Trip ' Twitter account, let us point you in its direction. It compiles some of the site's more ridiculous reviews. \nBeforehand, though, here's an example of someone who might qualify. TripAdvisor user 'levace', from Gloucester, left an offensive 'review' after dining at local restaurant So Thai. \nIn it, 'levace' doesn't hold back. They berate the restaurant's aesthetic, service, and food, and write that their partner has \"Thai friends, so we know the flavours of Thailand\". \nSo Thai has been open about a year and so far has amassed 448 reviews, 359 of which have been \"excellent\". \nWe're not saying that TripAdvisor is a sound indicator of whether a restaurant is any good â€“ but So Thai is clearly popular among locals. It's rated number two in Gloucester, as noted by Gloucester Live .

We've left the review unedited... \n\"What am i on about ? \n\"Well 20 years ago, when you went to a Thai restaurant, the food, was pretty good, with attention to detail, fancy carved vegetables, And Actual Thai food. \n\"Now most seem to serve up, what they think English customers want, Ie Boring food, ready made sauces etc. \n\"This place, I / we were expecting something special, judging by the Reviews, I can only Assume that customers here, have never been to Thailand, And tried the \"Real Thing\" \n\"On entry to \"So Thai\" you enter a really naff lobby area, where you can sit and drink, Your first impression is bad, But then the eating area, is downstairs, in some really cute old cellars, which are very nice. \n\"On the night we went, the service, was V V Slow, our waitress looked bored,,, or tired. Anyway Starters Plaa Tord Mun ,,, Boring fish cakes 5/10 & Kna Nom Jeeb Tord so so 6 perhaps \n\"My Chang beer 330 ml came draught, Not bottled as advised, nothing special 4/10 The bit i was really looking forwards to, because its a staple meal in Thailand, Brilliant and about 50 p ! Laab Chicken salad, which is spicey minced chicken, with salad HOW WAS THIS SO BAD Not savoury, or spicey, more sweet. totally wrong, \n\"Then the Gaeng Massaman ( Lamb shank in sauce) yes it was tasty, But the sauce was more curry sauce out of a packet, certainly not a proper massaman, Plus to be fair. Lamb shank is not really a Thai recipe. \n\"All in would i recommend, Definitely not. As my partner has Thai friends, We know the flavours of Thailand,,,, And they were totally absent in our meal . Very disapointing\". Phew. Very harsh (Photo: Gloucestershire Live) Read More \nIt's the type of review that might lose a restaurant customers. Who knows, maybe 'lecace' is an expert in Thai cuisine. Perhaps the fishcakes really were boring. \nBut owner Thitapha Martin wasn't going to take it. She completely demolishes the TripAdvisor post in response. \nThitapha accuses 'lecace' of \"insulting Thai people,\" before advising they try a Loyd Grossman sauce jar instead of eating at her restaurant. Thai jasmine rice (Photo: Getty Images) We've also left Thitapha's (very long) response unedited \n\"Thank you for taking time to review our restaurant and you're first 5 words perfectly sum up your detailed review - What are you on about ?? \"We admit we do not serve 'fancy carved vegetables' as you were served in Thai restaurants 20 years ago. Times have moved on and I am V V surprised that an orchid shaped raw carrot missing from your plate has upset you so much! \n\"You title your review 'Typical Lazy Thai Attitude'. Not only have you insulted our 8 Thai members of staff and your partners friends, you have insulated the Thai Nation - how presumptuous of you and explains the tone of your review. \n\"You have included many inaccuracies within your review, so please let me enlighten you: \n\"We serve authentic Thai food as you would eat in central Thailand, cooked by the Thai Chef owner who comes from that region. She makes ALL sauces from scratch using fresh ingredients and all dishes are cooked to order. \n\"The fish cakes are made in house with fresh fish and our home made pastes to the central Thailand authentic recipe. We will not apologise that the authentic taste is not to your palate and we do not aspire to have them taste like the fish cakes you tasted many, many years ago.
