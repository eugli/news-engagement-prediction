He subsequently left the scene after around 20 minutes. \nAhmad Fadhli, who was one of the speakers at the ceramah, said Husam was not allowed to speak as the permit for the ceramah did not include him as a speaker. \n\"As organisers, we cannot allow anyone who is not listed in the permit to speak. \n\"If we allowed it, we would be breaching the law,\" he said. \nAhmad Fadhli also accused Husam of being \"unprofessional\" for showing up at the ceramah. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:58:04.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
