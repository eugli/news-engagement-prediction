But I’m definitely sensitive to who’s in the studio. I pay attention to what comes back at me from the dancers. I teach a phrase and then Wendy bends it and pulls it. WHELAN I do it differently. BROOKS It’s call and response. Like, how do you translate this? She draws attention to aspects of my own work that I’m blind to. Her sense of suspension of time through the gaze and gesture is fundamental to the work. I’m more of a manic choreographer by choice — the idea of moving as fast as you can until something stops you has been elemental for me. Do you use that opposition in the piece? BROOKS We’re trying to find an equilibrium between us as we go through the same set of tasks. To have us walk forward side by side down to center-stage, even that simple arrival is a way to get information about these two people. What intrigues you about Brian’s work? WHELAN The intricacy of his folding and unfolding and winding and twisting. I love the arm work. I have these really long arms, and I have to say my arms are sometimes my favorite body part, so I like what he gives me to do with them. And I like the mental challenge of what he gives me to do. There are so many tiny details, and it’s so three-dimensional for a ballet dancer. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story What’s it like to perform alongside a dancer like Wendy? BROOKS It’s intimidating being onstage with Wendy Whelan! I’m picturing watching her onstage for years — she can transcend the theater and transport you to some place somewhere between your head and your memory and history and that line she’s holding. To be onstage working beside her influences me and challenges me and scares the hell out of me. I noticed in a rehearsal that there is a section that contains these gliding, almost balletic lifts. Is that new? BROOKS It’s a new section of “First Fall,” to Philip Glass. It’s all about falling and descent. I thought, in this second-to-last movement, just for a moment, let’s emphasize the lift. I’m more comfortable now doing things that aren’t necessarily brand new for her. WHELAN It’s like putting on old clothes again. I love that moment of, ‘Remember when?’ I love to waft. There isn’t too much wafting in this world I’m in now. But my first instinct is to float, always. It’s very sweet that Brian went to the gym all those days to lift me.
