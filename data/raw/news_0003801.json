However this time round I will play the local in the local league,\" said Kutuny.Kutuny has in the recent past compared himself to an eagle which undergoes a rebirth to extend its lifespan by removing their beaks, talons, and feathers in order to grow new ones, saying he would make a strong political comeback in the August polls.He is expected to resign this month to focus on reclaiming his seat, will face off for the party primaries with Korir who has defected to Jubilee party.Kutuny is considered a front-runner in the parliamentary race which has attracted over ten aspirants.
