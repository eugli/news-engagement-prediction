Other benefits include countryside that avoids the scars of intensive farming, he added.\nThe report was published by Morrisons, but researched independently by academics at the Universities of Leeds, York, Oxford, Aberdeen, Reading, City University and Rothamstead.\nThe supermarket said it was looking to recruit more than 200 new suppliers in the UK in the next year.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C1DB/production/_94672694_mediaitem94672693.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-17T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:17:58.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
