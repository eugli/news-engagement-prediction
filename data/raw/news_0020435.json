Good for you. \nThere’s no doubt the most powerful form of marketing for any brand is personal recommendation. \nAnd naturally in our celebrity obsessed culture the public want to know what beautiful people use behind closed doors. But when money changes hands isn’t that about as far away from a genuine recommendation as you can get? \nBelieve me, if Nicole Kidman, her perfect skin and I went out for coffee and she said, apropos of nothing, “you know I’ve been using this moisturiser I bought for $25 and it’s the best s**t I’ve ever put on my face”, I’d be racing off to the nearest chemist. \nBut if the recommendation is coming after a contract has been signed, pardon me if I’m not filled with the same desperate passion to purchase.

But wouldn’t it be more convincing if it was endorsed by someone with some actual expertise? \nI know a dermatologist isn’t as sexy as an Oscar winner, but doesn’t the more weighty recommendation come from the person who’s been hunched over a microscope for decades trying to work out whether this stuff actually works? \nYes, Nicole Kidman has undeniably beautiful skin and that’s what Neutrogena is selling. But the idea that her blemish-free face was achieved through nothing other than a tube of their latest moisturiser is surely enough to make anyone raise an eyebrow (Botox permitting). \nIf her complexion is not the result, as she’s claimed, of surgery or syringes, then the next logical explanation is genetics. And last time I checked you can’t buy that stuff in a bottle. \nThere’s also every chance her youthful radiance is the result of slathering herself in sunscreen for most of her life, or because she eats well and drinks six litres of water a day. \nThe point is, all of these things accumulated over the course of decades, or buried in her genetic make-up, adds up to skin you’d have to get in a time machine or be born again to achieve. \nIf Nicole Kidman endorsing a product makes you curious about it then by all means give it a try, but if you’re comparing your wrinkles to her silky smooth, make-up artist and soft lighting assisted face and thinking it can be achieved with whatever product that beautiful face is attached to, I’m afraid you might be disappointed. Don’t get us wrong, we love Nicole. We just don’t quite believe this endorsement. Picture: Frederick M.
