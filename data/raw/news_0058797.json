Article continues below \nBut, it was Jamie Vardy who grabbed the headlines as the England international ended his 759-minute goal drought to finish off a slick Leicester move. \nPablo Sarabia and Joaquin Correa had put the home side two goals clear at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, but the Foxes' ability to battle back delighted their travelling faithful, reported to be close to 5,000 despite just securing an allocation of just 2,500. Article continues below Wayne Shaw reveals the real reason he ate a pie during the Arsenal game \nConsidering the champions are just one point and one place above the relegation zone in the Premier League, the fans have been enjoying the relative escape of European football this term, and their trip to Seville on Wednesday was no different. \nIn fact, the City fans might have enjoyed themselves a little bit too much before the game. But not in the manner you might think. \nNo, the Foxes fans were not violent or rowdy during their stay in Seville; quite the opposite in fact. \nA video has emerged of several Leicester fans, possibly hundreds, gathered at a bar in sunny Seville and they seem to be having a good time signing loudly. \nHowever, in the middle of the signing? An elderly Spanish woman who probably has no idea what is going on, getting down to the serenading cheers. \nJust when you think you have seen it all... \nLeicester can now concentrate on their home game with Liverpool next Monday night before a must-win relegation six-pointer against Hull the following Saturday. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
