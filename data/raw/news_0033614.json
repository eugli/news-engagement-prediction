Because in addition to the two-part play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child revealing the characters' future, a new franchise of blockbusters has just begun as well. Written by J.K. Rowling herself, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will include a whopping five films which will move across years of time in the Wizarding World. And in addition to introducing exciting new characters, the Fantastic Beasts franchise will also feature characters and settings from Harry Potter , leading many to wonder which fan favorites could show up in the franchise down the line. \nActor Jason Isaacs played the villainous and slimy Lucius Malfoy for six of the Harry Potter films. I recently had the chance to speak with Isaacs about his role in Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness , where I asked him if the Malfoy patriarch would be returning in Fantastic Beasts . He told me, \nLucius? No, no I don't think you'll be seeing him again. Not that I wouldn't heed the call to come, obviously. \nWell, this is certainly a bummer. There's nothing better than a dastardly villain, and Jason Isaac's Lucius Malfoy was definitely a highlight of the Harry Potter franchise for me. \nLucius Malfoy actually seemed like one of the most logical characters to show up sometime during Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . With the franchise starting in the 20's and going through decades, it's perfectly plausible that the films will eventually reach a point where Lucius could reenter the story. And since he's had quite an influence on the Ministry of Magic through the years, if Newt eventually returns to the ministry down the line Malfoy could pop up. It's just a matter of just how many years will pass during the five films . \nThe upside of Jason Isaacs comment is that he'd be down to put that long blonde wig back on and step into the role if he were asked. After filming six movies in the franchise, it would be perfectly reasonable for Isaacs to be a bit tired of the magic. Alas, The OA actor would be happy to reprise his role as Lucius Malfoy if Fantastic Beasts and J.K. Rowling needed him. \nSince Warner Bros. is likely not casting multiple films in advance, it makes sense that no one has reached out to Jason Isaacs yet. Any possible appearance by Lucius Malfoy would presumably take place quite a few movies down, so offers would occur in a few years time, if at all. Let's just hope that the inclusion of Dumbledore's past will be the catalyst for more Harry Potter crossovers into the world of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . \nYou can catch Jason Isaacs in A Cure for Wellness opening February 17, 2017.
