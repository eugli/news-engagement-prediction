Ellen and Scott Park (Courtesy Ellen Park) \nUpdated at 8:17 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:17 a.m. ET \nRICHMOND, Va. — On Wednesday morning on the floor of the Virginia General Assembly, a man who has inspired countless thousands of people with his courage, his strength and his commitment to never, ever give up — and the unwavering love of his family and friends — will by honored by his state government. \nThis will be an amazing moment for Scott Park. \nSometime shortly after the daily session begins at 11 a.m. ET in Virginia’s historic state capitol building, Scott will be presented with a Commending Resolution — House Joint Resolution 742 — that will be read aloud by delegate Jason Miyares , a state representative from Virginia Beach (Virginia’s 82nd District). Then, Scott, who was an environmental engineer in the Navy for 36 years before retiring, will be presented with a framed copy of the resolution. Scott is traveling with his wife, Ellen, up from their home in Virginia Beach for the event. \nYou can watch the live feed of the House of Delegates here . We'll post the full text of the resolution here after the presentation. \nYou remember Scott Park. \nHe’s the diehard N.C. State fan who won a contest to attempt a half-court shot worth a million dollars at halftime of the Notre Dame-Duke semifinal game during the 2015 ACC Tournament. Scott’s attempt only made it about halfway to the hoop, and video of the miss that I posted to Vine quickly went viral, with the loop counter climbing into the millions within a couple of hours. \nWe all soon found out there was so much more to Scott’s story than a simple missed half-court attempt, though. His incredible medical journey was almost beyond comprehension, and the mere fact that he was able to step out on that court that day and attempt any shot was a miracle. \nHere’s the original day-after story , and here’s a follow-up from March 2016 on Scott and Ellen’s roller-coaster journey . This powerful piece produced by ESPN’s \"E:60\" is so very worth your 15 minutes, as is the video’s companion piece written by ESPN reporter Ryan McGee . \nWhen the ESPN video aired last March, Scott was back at Johns Hopkins. He’d spent months of 2015 in a coma, and when the crew visited Scott and Ellen in the hospital, Scott was in the early stages of rehabilitation. He spent nine months there, finally going home to Virginia Beach on June 8. He was, as you can imagine, happy to be home, and Ellen was beyond thrilled to have him there. \n“Scott is doing well, as sure as can be,” she told me on Tuesday, and it was obvious, even over the phone, that she was smiling. “He’s slow and steady, as is his way. It was his way in getting better in the hospital and in therapy.” \nMARCH MADNESS: North Carolina No. 1 in projected NCAA bracket \nScott’s amazing story is close to Miyares’ heart. See, when Miyares was finishing up high school in Norfolk, Scott and Ellen were his Sunday school teachers at First Baptist of Norfolk. Miyares was part of the youth choir, Ellen said, and the group went on several trips, including one into Canada and another to New Orleans. \nThose types of connections are so very common with Scott and Ellen; they’re the type of giving, welcoming people you feel you’ve known your whole life after spending just a few minutes with them. They still have to travel from Virginia Beach up to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore every other week for his treatments. He’s still in a wheelchair, but ever the fighter, Scott is working toward a longstanding goal — walking again. \n“Everybody thinks he’s going to. Everybody believes he will be able to walk,” Ellen says. “Just this week we’ve started measuring how long he can stand. He holds onto me while I’m standing there by the bed, I don’t hold onto him. And we’ve gotten to the point where he’s up to four-and-a-half minutes standing without any problem. He can bend his knees and straighten himself up without falling. When we get to five minutes for a couple days, I’ll call and we’ll go back to therapy and start trying to do some stepping.” \nThat will be a good day. Wednesday will be a good day. \nScott and Ellen deserve so many good days.
