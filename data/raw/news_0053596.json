The reality is that â€¦ this is an assessment based on the threat these countries pose today and going into the future, but more fundamentally is the position of the intelligence community that these countries today pose a threat to our country going forward,\" Miller explained.\n  According to Miller, the latest executive order will take into account arguments made by a three-judge panel that blocked Trump's travel ban from being implemented earlier this month. The panel and several other federal judges claim the president's directive could violate constitutional guarantees such as due process and religious freedom.\n\"One of the big differences\" with the new order, he said, \"is that it's going to be responsive to the judicial ruling that didn't exist previously.\"\n\"These are mostly minor technical differences. Fundamentally, you're still going to have the same policy outcome for the country,\" Miller told MacCallum, adding that Trump and his administration \"is fully committed to doing what is lawful, legal, just, decent and right to take care of patriotic citizens and their communities.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:21:46.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
