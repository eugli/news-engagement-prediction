Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWhen relationships break down, there can be a lot of bad feeling, arguments and awkwardness - it's what people have come to expect. \nBut it doesn't always have to be that way - and one man who wanted to challenge these misconceptions has won hundreds of thousands of fans after a Facebook post he wrote about his ex-wife went viral. \nIn a post published on Love What Matters, Billy Flynn explained: \"It's my ex-wife's birthday today so I got up early and brought flowers and cards and a gift over for the kids to give her and helped them make her breakfast. \n\"Per usual someone asked me why the hell I still do things for her all the time. \n\"This annoys me. So ima (sic) break it down for you all.\" The couple's marriage didn't last, but they keep it friendly for the kids (Photo: Getty) \nHe went on to explain why he chooses to treat his ex like this and what he hopes to gain from it. \n\"I'm raising two little men. The example I set for how I treat their mom is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women and affect their perception of relationships. \n\"I think even more so in my case because we are divorced. \n\"So if you aren't modeling good relationship behavior for your kids, get your sh** together. \n\"Rise above it and be an example. This is bigger than you. \n\"Raise good men. Raise strong women. Please. The world needs them, now more than ever.\" What happens after the ring comes off? (Photo: Getty) \nThe post has since received nearly 700,000 Facebook 'Reactions' and been shared over 200,000 times. \nHis words really resonated with lots of other parents, who began sharing their own stories. \nRick Howard commented: \"Right on the money. Ive been divorced 17 years and I get along with my ex wife better now that when we were married. \n\"When we decided the marriage was over, we sat down, made a list of everything we wanted as far as child support, visitation, etc, went to one lawyer to finalize (sic) it and the rest is history. \n\"We both agreed not to get into p***ing matches in front of the kids, and for the most part it has worked well. The kids know both of us are on the same page when it comes to them. I wouldn't have it any other way.\" \nLani Weber praised him, saying: \"Now this is A REAL MAN! Amazing attitude and role model. He's a blessing to his boys. Wish there were more men in todays (sic) society that has his perspective. Thank you for sharing.\" \nPatricia Prado wrote: \"[My stepson's] mom doesn't like me, in fact, she hates me. \n\"She hates me so much that she lies about me, she tries to destroy my marriage and creates problems between me and my in laws. \n\"But despite of that, there is not a single word that comes out of my mouth or action that doesn't show to him that I don't respect her has his mom \n\"Children don't have to suffer because of adults issues.\" \nSamantha Cotterill liked Billy's positive message but said it's a different story in her household, writing: \"My ex shows total disregard for me in front of my kids. \n\"I try to rise above it and always have a gift for them to give him for xmas, birthday, Father's Day. \n\"It's certainly not because I'm sad, or want him back! It's because it makes my children happy, because they love him. \n\"He would no way reciprocate, but I accept that. The message is good and positive. No such thing as being too kind/thoughtful in this life.\" \nWhat do you think? Have you had a similar experience? Share your experience in the comments below or e-mail yourmirror@mirror.co.uk.
