ABC By Morgan Evans Feb 13, 2017 This season of ABC’s The Bachelor, Nick Viall has opened his heart to all six of the remaining women on the show. While some have become Bachelor \"villains,\" viewers have found a favorite in Dallas native Rachel Lindsay. In a show with an overwhelmingly white history, Lindsay is rumored to be the frontrunner to become the first black Bachelorette in the show's history. (Took long enough.) Though it's unclear how far she'll go on Viall's season — unless you read spoilers, in which, OK, Reality Steve has it down — here are some important facts about the Bachelor contestant who is stealing Nick's heart.

A post shared by Rachel Lindsay (@therachlindsay) on Dec 31, 2016 at 3:14pm PST Lindsay attended the University of Texas where she graduated with a degree in Kinesiology and Sports Management. After undergrad, Lindsay went on to law school at Marquette University. The attorney now practices in Dallas, Texas where her expertise is listed as insurance law on her firm's bio page . Judging by Nick's past relationship with former Bachelorette Andi Dorfman, he really likes lawyers. 2. She has a tight knit family. A post shared by Rachel Lindsay (@therachlindsay) on Apr 5, 2015 at 11:56am PDT Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Texas native is very close with her family — and told Nick about her \"strict\" father, a federal judge. You can find her at her family's church on Sundays, most likely with her younger sister (who could also pass as her twin). Lindsay is also an Auntie! She recently shared a photo of her adorable baby nephew on her Instagram as well as several photos of other family members, including a recent Happy Birthday post dedicated to her mama. 3. She made Bachelor history. A post shared by Rachel Lindsay (@therachlindsay) on Feb 3, 2017 at 2:50pm PST Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It was obvious that Rachel was going to last a while after she won the first-impression rose on the show's premiere episode. She even made history by becoming the first black contestant to ever win the first-impression rose. (Yes, it took this long for that to happen.) And now that Rachel is part of the top six, she's already gone further along on the show than most women of color ever have. 4. She's currently one of the oldest contestants on the show. Nick has made Bachelor history a few times - being on the show three times to start - and now he is the oldest Bachelor contestant at the age of 36. But with an age range of women from 23 to 31 vying for Nick's heart, Lindsay also falls on the older end of the spectrum being one of the oldest girls along with neonatal nurse Danielle Maltby, who is also 31. 5. She was one of Jennifer Aniston's Bachelor picks.

Without knowing anything about the contestants, minus the few details on the Bachelor screen, Aniston assessed who she felt would make it to the top four. Aniston ended up choosing Elizabeth Sandos, (who is no longer on the show), Danielle Maltby, (who is in the top six), Corinne Olympios (the season's controversial villain, but also in the top six), and Lindsay. The fact that three of Aniston's picks are currently still on the show is pretty impressive. 6. She has Bachelor alum fans.

What I like about Rachel is that is demonstrates that you can be a smart, confident, badass woman and also *WARM.* — Ashley Iaconetti (@ashleyiaco) January 31, 2017 Rachel's date was so refreshing. She's stunning, smart and classy but still knows how to have a good time! I'm a fan #thebachelor — Amanda Stanton (@amandastantonnn) January 31, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Rachel will either be with @viallnicholas28 in the end or she will be the next #bachelorette #TheBachelor — Benjamin Higgins (@benhiggi) January 31, 2017 7. And she's still good friends with many of her fellow contestants.

In each instance, Rachel tagged the post #realfriends #friendsforlife. 8. And rumors are swirling that she will be the next Bachelorette. A post shared by Rachel Lindsay (@therachlindsay) on Jan 2, 2017 at 5:04pm PST The Bachelor and The Bachelorette have constantly received criticism for not being diverse . And though the show has taking some initiative by adding more of a diverse group of contestants, there has still yet to be a Bachelor of Bachelorette of color. But if Rachel is not offered Nick's final rose, the 31-year-old is rumored to be not only the next Bachelorette , but the first black Bachelorette - making history yet again.
