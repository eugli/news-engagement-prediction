He now fears transport teams may struggle to handle other people in a similar situation.\nObese man dropped by private ambulance crew Credit: ITV News Robert Wiley's health problems make it difficult for him to move around. He can get from his bed to the door given time and some help.\nWith just fifteen minutes until he was due at hospital for an appointment, he agreed to be taken to his transport in a wheelchair.\nRobert saids, \"They started to load me in the chair, put me on the chair, strap me on, took me through the door, through the first step and then the next thing I knew I was on my back after that.\"\n\"And I was there for a few seconds, could be a minute and a half, looked like a beached whale. And if it wasn't for my son being here I don't know how they would have got me up.\"\nThe steps outside Mr Wiley's house Credit: ITV News Patient transport staff struggled on the last of two small steps from Mr Wiley's home in Saltash.\nThere were two people on the back of the chair, one on the front. Mr Wiley thinks the people carrying him weren't fully prepared for the challenges of handling him.\nHe said, \"If it has happened to me, it'll happen to someone else and I'm trying to prevent something like this.\"\nRobert and his wife Christine Credit: ITV News Mr Wiley's wife Christine was watching what happened. She says he ended up on his back on the floor very quickly.\n\"I couldn't believe it, that has never happened before. I know he is obese, but that is no excuse really.\"\n\"You know he's not well and it added to his anxiety really.\"\nMr Wiley says he's now worried about being transported again.\nIn this case, he feels he wasn't treated with the dignity and care he might have hoped for.\nWe asked the private ambulance service E-Zec Medical for a response to Mr Wiley's claims but they haven't come back to us.\nLast updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Cornwall and Isles of Scilly", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:22:22.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
