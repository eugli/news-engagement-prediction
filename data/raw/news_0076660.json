14 nominees - at the 89th Academy Awards. \nHacksaw Ridge picked up six nominations, including a best picture nod. \nAnother Australian production, Lion, also received six nods including Nicole Kidman for supporting actress and for the first time in Oscar history an Australian film, the remarkable Tanna, was nominated for best foreign language film. \nAustralian Oscar newcomer Jason Billington, for his visual effects work on oil rig disaster film Deepwater Horizon, also scored an invite to Hollywood's biggest night. \nThe ceremony, however, is expected to be dominated by the quintessential Los Angeles movie, the musical La La Land which has 14 nominations - equalling the all-time Oscar record held by Titanic and All About Eve. \nGibson's nomination was significant because for the past decade the industry has shunned him for alleged anti-Semitic, sexist and racial rants and domestic abuse while he struggled with alcoholism \nThe Academy is not some club of faceless people. \nIt is made up of 7000 of the most famous people on the planet. \nThey are Gibson's peers. \nTom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Naomi Watts, Russell Crowe - pretty much anyone who has won an Oscar, received multiple nominations or has had an influential role in Hollywood is likely a member. \nThe Academy this year also had plenty of other compelling directing options to nominate instead of Gibson. \nA-List directors who missed out include Denzel Washington (Fences), Scorsese (Silence), Clint Eastwood (Sully) and Tom Ford (Nocturnal Animals). \nGibson will compete with La La Land's Damien Chazelle, the favourite, and Moonlight's Barry Jenkins, Arrival's Denis Villeneuve and Manchester By the Sea's Kenneth Lonergan. \n\"It has been an especially difficult environment for Mel, but to come all of the way back and get that from all of his peers, he is walking on air,\" Mechanic said. \nSince his nomination Hollywood studios have been courting Gibson with major projects, including Warner Bros reportedly hoping he would direct Suicide Squad 2. \nLast year, largely on the back of George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road, Australia had a record Oscar haul with 13 nominations and eight wins. \nThis year Australia's best chances are Hacksaw Ridge's sound editors Andy Wright and Robert Mackenzie. \nWright and Mackenzie, along with another Aussie Peter Grace and American Kevin O'Connell, are also decent chances of winning the sound mixing Oscar for Hacksaw Ridge. \nO'Connell has the infamous title of being the most nominated person in Academy Awards' history never to win, with Hacksaw Ridge his 21st nod and his painfully long list of misses dating back to Terms of Endearment in 1984. \nWright laughed when AAP asked him if he might jump in front of the microphone and rob O'Connell of an acceptance speech if they finally win. \n\"Oh no,\" Wright said. \n\"I'll be happy to stand back and let him speak.\" \nDonald Trump is expected to be the elephant in the Dolby Theatre, with winners venting about the US president, particularly when the foreign language film Oscar is announced. \nTanna's Australian filmmakers Bentley Dean and Martin Butler penned a joint letter with the other four filmmakers nominated in the category blasting Trump's attempted travel ban directed against seven mostly Muslim nations, including Iran. \nThe Iranian director of the category favourite, The Salesman, will not attend the ceremony in protest of Trump. \nIn another controversial incident, Khaled Khateeb, a 21-year-old Syrian cinematographer who worked on the nominated documentary short, The White Helmets, was barred entry into the US after officials reportedly found \"derogatory information\" on him. \nDean and Butler will be joined on the red carpet and in the Dolby Theatre by two of their stars, Selin Kawia and Lingai Kawia, and interpreter JJ Nako, who will be wearing their traditional dress from the tiny Vanuatu volcanic island of Tanna. \nThe men will be shirtless and wear large vertical penis sheaths. \nAUSTRALIA'S 2017 OSCAR NOMINEES \nMel Gibson -
