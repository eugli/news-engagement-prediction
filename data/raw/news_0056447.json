East Aurora School District is looking at providing everyday school busing for many more students. (School District U46 / Handout) Privacy Policy \nEast Aurora School District 131 board members are moving forward with providing regular, everyday busing for more students. \nDistrict officials are looking at providing buses for general education elementary-, middle-, and high-school students who live more than 1.5 miles from their school. Board members, saying they would not need a referendum and without discussing any other tax hike, decided at a meeting Tuesday to move forward with the process and put the service out to bid. \n\"I just think it would help the district overall,\" School Board President Annette Johnson said. \"Personally, it should have probably been done years ago.\" \nEast Aurora has never provided regular, everyday busing for students, as far as officials know. Over the past decade, those in favor of busing have pointed to transportation as one option to lower the district's truancy rate, while opponents have pointed to its high cost. \nCurrently, the district buses special education students, some preschool and kindergarten students, and district students who attend the third- through eighth-grade John C. Dunham STEM Partnership School on Aurora University's Campus. (Sarah Freishtat) \nDistrict officials now expect to provide busing to more than 3,000 additional students, on top of those who already take the bus to school, Assistant Superintendent for Finance Mike Prombo told the school board in a presentation. The additional students – who are all of the remaining district students who live more than 1.5 miles from their school, the distance at which in most cases the state will provide some transportation reimbursement – make up about 24 percent of students who aren't currently bused. \nThough the district has not yet received bids from busing companies, an estimate of the additional busing cost came in between about $1.2 million and $1.4 million annually. Much of that would reimbursed by the state which, in addition to students who live an eligible distance from their schools, also pays for students who live closer but would have to walk through hazardous situations to get to school. Prombo said the state would reimburse around 70 percent of the district's transportation cost, but Johnson put that figure closer to 80 percent. \nThe estimated cost does not include additional expenses such as an employee to oversee transportation or bus monitors. It also does not take into account students who might live closer than 1.5 miles to their school but face hazardous walking situations and could be eligible for busing. Prombo said the district likely would not be able to identify and receive approval for those hazardous situations immediately, and instead would get busing up and running before identifying those additional eligible students. \nJohnson said the district has enough cash reserves to pay its share of the transportation cost, and that expense would be \"the perfect thing\" for money approved in a 2008 bond referendum, more than half of which remains in a district bank account. But Johnson and other board members said overall, busing would wind up paying for itself because it is expected to increase attendance. The district's attendance is tied to the amount of money it gets from the state. \nNearly six months into the school year, East Aurora School District 131 officials have expelled more than double the number of students they expelled all last school year.\nThe uptick comes the same year as a new discipline law that includes measures designed to limit punishments that remove kids... \nNearly six months into the school year, East Aurora School District 131 officials have expelled more than double the number of students they expelled all last school year. \nThe uptick comes the same year as a new discipline law that includes measures designed to limit punishments that remove kids... (Sarah Freishtat) \nBoard member Dick Leonard said the board had been told before that busing would be too expensive in the district. \n\"No one did their homework,\" he said. \"And I was really shocked to find out how little it would cost us.\" \nThe district has, in the past, eyed tax hikes to cover transportation. In 2005, the district attempted to gain voter approval to raise the transportation tax levy to cover busing, but the measure was rejected by 59 percent of voters. \nTuesday night, Prombo also presented an analysis of providing a shuttle bus service for middle- and high-school students who live more than two miles from their schools, which was expected to cost between roughly $515,000 and $574,000 annually and was not eligible for reimbursement from the state. Board members gave little consideration to that option. \nThe move toward busing marks a significant step for the district, where resistance to busing dates back to at least 1966, when the board declined a neighborhood's request for busing citing the cost, a former board president told the Chicago Tribune in 2003. \nIn the late 1970s, East Aurora took the Illinois State Board of Education to court over a mandate that the district create more racial equality among its schools, which district administrators said would require busing. The case eventually went to the state Supreme Court, which upheld a lower court's decision in the district's favor. \nBoard members expressed enthusiasm about the busing proposal. Kirsten Strand said the possibility of busing was \"exciting.\" They requested an analysis to determine whether students who live further away from schools have higher rates of truancy. \nPrombo said the proposal would require the district to look at its current bell schedule to ensure there would be time for buses to drop off middle- and high-school students and then return to take elementary students to school. Strand said that would require conversations with the teachers and staff union, because start times are written into their contract. \nPrombo also said the district likely would face increased discipline problems on buses, and would have to work to introduce families to riding a school bus and bus stop locations. \nBusing bids are expected to come before the board for a vote in April. Johnson said officials plan to have busing in place for the 2017-18 school year. \nTwitter @srfreish", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:58:09.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
