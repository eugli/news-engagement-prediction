But it was abruptly canceled after Trump announced his executive order banning the entry of people from seven countries with Muslim majorities. The girl and her parents had to return to Iran. \nA Seattle judge issued a temporary restraining order on the ban the same day a waiver was granted for the baby. \n\"Fatemeh looks well,\" said Dr Laurie Armsby, interim head of the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital. \"Our tests this morning have confirmed her diagnosis and the urgent need for treatment.\" \nSeven-year-old Hyderabad girl fed infected IV by doctors, dies \nUS Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, was instrumental in getting the waiver for the baby's family, as were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and immigration attorneys. \nThe hospital issued a statement saying that the family \"would like to extend their heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped make their trip possible. The family would like to give special thanks to the congressional delegations and governors of Oregon and New York.\" \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Wednesday, February 8, 2017 - 11:30 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:18:19.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
