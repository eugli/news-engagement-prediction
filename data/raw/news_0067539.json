As a stark contrast to the joyous and romantic wedding scenes we have just enjoyed, tonight’s airing will see Robert and Aaron torn apart as Aaron is jailed for a year. \nThe devastating scenes will break the hearts of Robron fans as a vulnerable Aaron says goodbye to his loved ones and is locked up where he immediately struggles as he gets his head around being ripped away from the people who mean everything to him for twelve months. \nAnd, back home, Robert is left both livid and upset over Aaron’s harsh sentence, vowing to launch an appeal and get him out as soon as he can. Liv Flaherty also takes the news badly and assumes that Robert will want to send her back to stay with her mum but he assures her that they are in this together before hugging her close. (Picture: ITV) \nMeanwhile, Aaron faces his first tough decision inside as he asks the officer for advice on whether to be open about his sexuality as he fills in a form. And fans know that there are tough times ahead after the top dog discovers Aaron is Gordon’s son . \nElsewhere, there are tense times ahead for Debbie too as she persuades Ross to get her a fake passport and prepares to take Sarah to Prague. The risks are high as she takes her daughter to the airport and, after a near miss, she begins to doubt whether the passport is enough to let her slip through the checks. UNLOCKED: Debbie needs a favour but will Ross comply? #WishListWednesday #Emmerdale pic.twitter.com/SQL1g3jUod \nKnowing that she could be jailed for what she is doing, Debbie has a big decision to make – will she risk everything to go with Sarah or will she change her mind? \nEmmerdale airs at 7pm and then for an hour at 8pm on Thursday 23rd February on ITV.
