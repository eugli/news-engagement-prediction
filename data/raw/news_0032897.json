During her acceptance speech for album of the year, she appeared to confirm a new development in her personal life when she referred to longtime partner Simon Konecki as her ”husband.” “Grammys, I appreciate it. The Academy, I love you. My manager, my husband and my son—you’re the only reason I do it,” the now 15-time Grammy winning artist said in her speech. This seemed to be the first time that Adele has publicly called Konecki her husband. In Vanity Fair’s December 2016 cover story , she referred to him as her “boyfriend.” Then, she praised the father of her four-year-old son, Angelo , as being the perfect partner for her busy life in show business. She also noted that she and Konecki were not married, and she did not see the need for it. Having a child together was the bigger commitment in her eyes. “It’s the most serious relationship I’ve ever been in; we’ve got a child together and we live together,” she said. “After releasing my first album, all the other people I ever was with were so insecure about themselves—they couldn’t handle it at all. When I try to describe this to my friends they don’t always get it, because they go out with people that are our age, but Simon is already who he is, and I’m still becoming who I’m going to be. He’s confident. He’s perfect.” Although she referred to Konecki as her husband onstage, Adele backtracked a bit in the press room. According to People she referred to him as her “partner.” The magazine also notes that the two caused speculation last month when Adele was seen in public sporting a band on her left ring finger. This kind of hushed behavior is not uncommon for the Grammy winner. She kept her son’s birth in October 2012 under wraps until confirming she had welcomed a son at the 2013 Golden Globes Awards a few months later. For now, Adele’s marital status remains a mystery, but as clearly indicated by last night’s festivities, her love for Beyoncé does not. Vanity Fair has reached out to a representative for Adele for comment.
