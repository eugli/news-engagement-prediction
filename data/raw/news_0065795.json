According to a source, that remained true the last 48 hours leading up to the deadline, with the Bulls asking for the world from the Celtics, including multiple picks and core players that would have crippled Boston’s current foundation.\nA price that obviously proved to be too rich.\nVP of basketball operations John Paxson downplayed what was offered for Butler leading into Thursday, but also couldn’t commit to the two-way standout long-term, either.\n“Right now, today, Jimmy is on our roster,’’ Paxson said. “This league is fluid. And things can change quickly.\n“I’ve always felt this way about team building and a team in general: There are very few guys who you build around. This is a team game. You build with players. We are building with Jimmy right now. … maybe outside of a handful of guys who ever played this game, you build with players, not around one.’’\nThat’s where Payne – who was the 14th overall pick in the 2015 draft – comes in, according to Paxson.\nThe 22-year-old played behind MVP candidate Russell Westbrook the past two seasons, so minutes were hard to come by, but even so there were some red flags with the 6-foot-3 play-maker coming out of Murray State.\nThe knock on him by several scouts was he was quick, “but not real athletic.’’ He’s also proven to be an inconsistent shooter from the outside at the NBA level (32 percent from three), as well as coming off a foot that he’s now broken twice.\nSo why the head-scratching?\nThe best three-point shooter the Bulls had on the roster was McDermott, who was hitting 37 percent from the outside this season and 39 percent for his career. Coincidentally, the same McDermott they gave up two first-round draft picks to acquire back in the 2014 draft.\nThe other concern with this deal was the strength of this Bulls team was the physicality of the frontline in Gibson and Robin Lopez, and they somewhat neutered that strength by removing Gibson. Yes, he has an expiring contract, but Gibson always played the good soldier and was open to returning to the Bulls through free agency. More importantly, Gibson established what remained of a dwindling culture.\nBoth Morrow and Lauvergne can be free agents this summer, so the Bulls can at least take that money off the books.\nBut for the immediate future, with Gibson, 31, out of the picture, that means Bobby Portis and Nikola Mirotic will compete for the minutes left by that vacancy. Neither has shown they can be a consistent NBA starter, but Gar/Pax were swearing there was a plan, but it needed “time.’’\n“We’re taking steps to get better, and we’re trying to do it in a way that’s, maybe it’s methodical, but we’re not gonna go out here and try to reinvent things,’’ Paxson said. “We’ve got a plan in place, we talked about it last year.\n“And now we’re gonna get some of our young guys minutes to play and see if they can grow as a team. And we’ll see if they can make significant impacts and become a better basketball team.’’\nPaxson also added that not only was his own job safe, but so were Forman and Hoiberg.\nAs for Gibson, he remained the ultimate professional.\n“Just being able to put on a Bulls jersey and every day I came to the locker room and saw my name on the back of a Bulls jersey was a dream come true,’’ Gibson said.\nHe also didn’t rule out returning this summer.\n“I’m open to coming back at the right price,’’ Gibson said. “We’ll see. Like I said before, the NBA is going to be open this summer. It’s going to be a huge number of teams looking. But at the same time, Chicago’s going to be in my heart.’’\nCOMINGS\nCameron Payne – This was the key piece as far as the Bulls were concerned, as the hope is Payne can develop into an NBA lead guard now that he is out of Russell Westbrook’s shadows. How he develops will determine the trade.\nJoffrey Lauvergne – At 6-11, not afraid to stretch the defense and shoot from outside, but will find minutes hard to come by, considering he’s behind the likes of Robin Lopez, Cristiano Felicio, Bobby Portis and Nikola Mirotic.\nAnthony Morrow – A career 41 percent shooter from the three-point line, Morrow could help from outside, but was only shooting 29 percent from the three this season. Bulls would have rather nabbed Andre Roberson, instead.\nGOINGS\nDoug McDermott – Since being named the top collegiate player coming out of Creighton, McDermott never reached the star potential that some thought he could. The Bulls are left asking was it McDermott or was it their inability to develop talent the last few years?\nTaj Gibson – Never complained, always played hard, always smiled, and the Bulls will miss his veteran leadership. Gibson was the ultimate professional, raised in the NBA by Tom Thibodeau and taught to play the game the right way.\n# bulls Taj Gibson Chicago", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg?w=324", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg?w=150", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg?w=768", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg?w=670&#038;h=620", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/513961090_59830463.jpg?w=1024", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-26ev"], "published": "2017-02-23T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:21:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
