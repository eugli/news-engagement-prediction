But NBA history shows, it's better to act quickly. (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:20 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:20 p.m. ET \nBack in December, a handful of NBA executives told Sporting News that the Kings were moving near to the last remaining opportune moment to deal away DeMarcus Cousins while still being able to bring back a package that would include a young star and high draft picks. \nThe consensus was that the Kings were moving toward a Cousins deal because they’d still be far enough from the trade deadline — and thus, the second half of the season — to avoid the pressure of trading from a position of weakness. The Kings would give whatever trading partner they eventually found plenty of time to work Cousins into the new rotation and allow his new team time to work on a potential contract extension. \nIt is this reality, sources told Sporting News, that now has the Pacers reconsidering their commitment to keeping out of trade discussions involving star player Paul George ahead of Thursday’s deadline. In fact, the Kings’ experience with Cousins this week and the Jazz’s experience with their star point guard six years ago — Deron Williams — provides the Pacers with a blueprint on the benefits of decisive action on George. \n“The last thing that Larry Bird wants,” one source told Sporting News, “is to be in the position Vlade Divac was in this past weekend. The more focused you can be now, while you have time before free agency, the better your chances of finding a good return.” \nTRADE DEADLINE: Follow along with all of the NBA's moves \nUSA Today’s Sam Amick reported on Wednesday that George informed the Pacers that he wants to stay in Indiana, but only if the Pacers can supply a championship-caliber roster. But the Pacers are just a game over .500, losers of six straight with a five-game road trip that begins on Saturday. There’s little to suggest that this group can be transformed into a contender in the next year. \nThe return on Cousins, of course, was a massive disappointment. For their 26-year-old, three-time All-Star, the Kings got Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield, Langston Galloway and the Pelicans’ first- and second-round picks in this year’s draft. Cousins was a different kind of case, known as a hot-headed player who accumulates technical fouls at a staggering rate and has struggled to get in line with his NBA coaches. \nBut there’s still a lesson in what happened with Cousins and the Kings for Bird, George and the Pacers. If you’ve determined that a star player is going to have to be traded, it’s best to act quickly. The Pacers don’t necessarily have to move George by Thursday’s deadline, not when they can revisit a potential deal with any team who has expressed interest — Boston, Phoenix, Denver and the Lakers among them — once the lottery order has been determined in May. \nOn the flip side of the Cousins lesson the Utah experience with Williams. Think back to 2011, when the Jazz had determined, in the wake of Jerry Sloan’s retirement, that they were unlikely to sign Williams the following summer when he became a free agent. \nThe Jazz, like the Pacers this year, were not particularly vocal about dealing away Williams, not even after he publicly butted heads with Sloan. But they were still able to find a team desperate for a star and willing to cough up a budding youngster (Derrick Favors), an established veteran (Devin Harris) and two first-round picks (which wound up being No. 3 in 2011 and No. 21 in 2013). \nMORE: Lakers kids are \"untouchable\" according to Magic Johnson \nThe Pacers are in position to draw a similar package, or better, for George. The Celtics are in the best position. They have promising youngsters (Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Ante Zizic), established veterans (Jae Crowder, Avery Bradley) , plus all of their own picks going forward, in addition to the right to swap with Brooklyn for the potential No. 1 pick this year, the Nets’ first-rounder next year, and likely the Grizzlies’ and Clippers’ first-round picks in 2019. They also would become a contender with George in the fold, and thus be in the best position to re-sign him. \nDon’t discount Phoenix, with young players (Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss), young veterans (Eric Bledsoe, T.J. Warren) and some potentially valuable picks ahead (all of their own, plus Miami’s top-8 protected pick in 2018 and unprotected in 2021). The Lakers, lacking quality picks to trade, would be a longshot without giving up at least two of their three budding young players, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell or Brandon Ingram. \nThe Pacers don’t have to hurry, and don’t have to pull off a George move on Thursday. But the lessons of Cousins and Williams are stark. If there’s a chance that George must be traded, it’s better to move quickly.
