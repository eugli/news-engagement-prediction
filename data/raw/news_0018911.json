Dunlap was born Dec. 12, 1902, in Newark, N.J. FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey woman who was the oldest American person has died at age 114.\nAdele Dunlap died Sunday at a hospital near Flemington, according to the Martin Funeral Home.\nShe had become the country's oldest person in July 2016 following the death of 113-year-old Goldie Michelson, of Worcester, Massachusetts.\nA group that tracks long-living people says the oldest known person living in the U.S. is now 113-year-old Delphine Gibson, of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.\nDunlap didn't have an explanation for her longevity, and neither did her children. Asked at the time how it felt to be the oldest American, Dunlap said \"I don't feel any different.\"\nDunlap was born Dec. 12, 1902, in Newark, though family and caregivers said she often gave a younger age when asked how old she was.\nDunlap taught school before marrying and settling down to raise the couple's three children. Her husband worked for an insurance company and died in 1963.\n\"It's hard to say,\" her son, Earl Dunlap, said when his mother became the oldest American. \"She never went out jogging or anything like that. She's not really thin, but she never weighed more than 140 pounds. She smoked, and when my father had his first heart attack, they both stopped. I think she ate anything she wanted.\"\nEarl Dunlap says his mother wasn't a drinker but did occasionally enjoy a martini with her husband. Officials at the Country Arch Care Center in Pittstown, where Dunlap first arrived at age 99 ½, described her as a passive participant in daily activities who socialized minimally. But they said she looked forward to Girl Scouts' coming to sing Christmas carols.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:06.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
