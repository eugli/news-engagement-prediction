Official Explains Why They Never Said 'Radical Islam' Published February 13, 2017 Reuters \nBy Jonah Bennett | The Daily Caller \nA former Department of State official confessed Monday that the reason no one in the Obama administration referred to certain acts of terror as “radical Islam” is because they were scared of alienating Muslim allies. \nIn an op-ed written for The New York Times, Richard Stengel, who previously served as under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, said there was a very clear reason no one could–or did–label various acts of terror as the product of “radical Islam” and instead used the much less loaded term “violent extremism.” \nFor Stengel, the reason the Obama administration shied away from the term “radical Islam” was not because it was “too timid or too politically correct,” despite harsh criticisms from Republicans and especially President Donald Trump. \nRather, it was because the Obama administration was concerned the term would alienate Muslim allies in the Middle East. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:42:18.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
