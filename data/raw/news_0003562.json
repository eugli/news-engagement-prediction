Meanwhile, the Premier League meeting completed the set with a goalless draw. \nChelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs all dropped points yesterday as both Manchester clubs seek to gain ground on the top four. \nCity, yet again, thrashed West Ham this time by the four goals thanks to efforts from Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Gabriel Jesus and Yaya Toure. \nAs they extend their lead ahead of United to four points following the stalemate at Old Trafford. \nAnd after the game, Mourinho was less than pleased with the referee. Not only did he claim he gets harshly treating by the FA but also walked out of a post-match interview: \"I don't want to speak much because I pay lots of fines.\" - The post match comedy whenever Jose Mourinho does not win #MUNHUL pic.twitter.com/AcGYGOoCrB - Andrew Jerell Jones (@sluggahjells) February 1, 2017 \nIs Jose right? Or is he just being salty? \nSound off in the comments section below.
