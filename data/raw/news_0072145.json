Save AOL, Roberto Baldwin \nGoogle's oh-so-brief Spaces experiment didn't even last a year before the company decided to shut it down . According to a note from the Spaces team today, they've made a \"tough decision\" and the group-sharing social network will lock down in read-only mode on March 3rd, then completely shut down on April 17th. \nAssuming they actually used the service at all, users can still save, print or delete what little content they may have posted until then. After April 17th, Spaces will get the Google Wave treatment and disappear completely from the internet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:14:35.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
