Unfortunately for Beckham (oh, and his friend) that house was then broken into. Still, it sounds as if he didn't lose anything that was all that important. \"He just had some stuff there,\" the source relayed. \"Shoes and that sort of thing. It wasn’t anything expensive—just some of his belongings.\" The news of OBJ getting jacked comes in addition to the other alleged Super Bowl heist news, and by that we mean the story that some lucky S.O.B. walked off with Tom Brady's game jersey , valued at $500,000, to either sell on the black market, or hang on his wall for a conversation piece. We're not sure what leads the authorities have on Brady's jersey snatcher (some reports released on Thursday say it actually may be onboard a \"team equipment truck\" heading back to Boston). But, at least when it comes to Beckham, if we were the cops we know who we'd be questioning first.
