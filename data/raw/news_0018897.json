The wedding will take place on February 9, that is, tomorrow. But before the big day, the couple threw a pre-wedding bash which was every bit dreamy! As we had earlier stated, last night was the engagement ceremony of the couple, where Neil donned a crisp suit while Rukmini wore a shimmery gown. The busy groom had told a leading tabloid earlier, ”I have always believed marriage is a coming together of two families and we’re looking forward to spending time together. Right now we are busy welcoming guests.” Since it is an arranged marriage, the families have been very much involved in the wedding. In fact, in the videos that have surfaced on social media, we notice an elated Nitin Mukesh ecstatic as were the bride and groom. It definitely looks like a grand affair as the pics and videos speak volumes! \nA lot of preparations are being done and since the big day is nearing, both the families are super excited for the union! Thanks to videos and pics shared on social media by fan clubs, we were able to see Neil and Rukmini in action as they happily danced and posed for pictures! In fact, there’s a video where the actor is caught grooving to the tunes of Kala Chashma as well! Just the other day he was crooning to Kabira from Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani. You can check out all the pics and videos from the pre-wedding bash below!
