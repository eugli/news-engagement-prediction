Close US teachers caught playing ****, marry, kill, about students UP NEXT VIDEO Parents outraged after footage surfaced of teachers playing \"****, marry, kill\" game in a bar about schoolchildren in Michigan, US. Source: YouTube/ Jennifer Prentice US teachers caught playing ****, marry, kill, about students \nIn the YouTube clip the group, believed to be Michigan educators from Bangor Public School, appeared to be discussing which pupils they would sleep with, marry, or kill. \nThe concept is a \"game\" where one is given three names with the task of selecting which they would hypothetically sleep with, marry, or kill. A leaked video appears to show six US teachers and staffers making lewd comments about their students at a local bar. Source: YouTube \nOne of the women in the group is asked about a particular student and responds, saying: “Ooh, I would f**k [pupil’s name].” \nAnother in the group said: “Oh I would f**king kill [pupil’s name].” \nA special needs boy was also ridiculed when sexual comments were made about him. \nThe six-minute video appears to have been taken at the Bangor Tavern Bar and Grill by a person not connected to the group. \nAt one point someone can be heard asking in disbelief: “Are they school teachers?” \nIt is believed the clip circulated across the small town weeks before it was uploaded to YouTube. \nThe school staff were reprimanded, but not stood down, after the another staffer viewed the footage and filed a complaint. A school secretary reportedly seen in the video later resigned over the incident. Geelong Grammar head did not act: inquiry \nThe mother of an autistic student at the school, who was mentioned in the footage, demanded an apology. \n\"I think they should be held to higher standards and it doesn’t matter how angry you are, how you need to let off steam, you can’t talk about children this way,\" she said. \nBangor Police Chief Tommy Simpson told local news WZZM 13 while he did not see anything in the video that warranted charges to be issued, the matter was being investigated by the school internally. The school employees were not sacked over the footage where the group appeared to be discussing which pupils they would sleep with, marry, or kill. Source: YouTube \n\"There was a member of the school staff that filed a complaint because she felt threatened by the video,\" Mr Simpson said. \nTwo of the employees were reportedly given written reprimands, while four others were given verbal warnings. \nOutraged parents who attended a school meeting this week, following release of the leaked video, pressured each of the staffers involved in the video should resign. \n\"When I hear off-campus or off-duty conduct, we can't regulate what teachers, school staff, bus drivers do, unless it has an adverse effect on the school setting,\" school attorney Robert Huber told Newschannel 3.
