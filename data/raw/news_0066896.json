Few would have had the stomach for that fight or the self-control not to argue, but a player with 112 international caps did.\nSchweinsteiger was frozen out by Jose Mourinho after the manager's arrival at Old Trafford Credit: Getty Images M ourinho was adamant he would not change his mind. He even went so far, back in August, to claim he would rather play someone from the youth team, with no Premier League experience, than a 32-year-old who had won eight domestic league titles and a Champions League at Bayern Munich.\nSchweinsteiger was too slow, too ponderous to play for him. The decision to sign a player of his age, in decline, even one who had just captained Germany to a World Cup triumph, was a horrendous mistake by his predecessor Louis van Gaal.\nHowever, Mourinho did not just drop Schweinsteiger, he humiliated him. He was turfed out of the first-team dressing room at Carrington, forced to train away from his team-mates, either alone or with the Academy players.\nIt was deliberately brutal. Mourinho wanted Schweinsteiger to leave and he did not care how harsh he had to be to make that happen.\nSchweinsteiger waves a tearful goodbye to international football last summer Credit: Reuters T he Portuguese also had no time for people who questioned his decision either. He ignored criticism from Schweinsteiger’s previous club, Bayern Munich, where chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and former manager Otmar Hitzfeld accused him of abusing one of Germany’s most famous names.\n“One or two players are going to think long and hard in future about whether they want to go to such a club [like United],” said Rummenigge\nHitzfeld went even further. “It's a lack of respect for a worthy player,\" he said. \"It's a method which is strange to me. Schweinsteiger is a key player, a world champion, a personality, while at the same time he has an exceptional attitude.\"\nThe player’s brother, Tobias, vented his frustration on Twitter, also accusing United of treating his sibling with “no respect.”\nSchweinsteiger has grown accustomed to watching from the sidelines Credit: ACTION IMAGES T he club, though, backed Mourinho and when the accounts were released in September last year, they showed Schweinsteiger was a £6.7m asset that had been written off . They effectively did not care if he played again, retired, quit or left on a free transfer in January. His United career was over.\nSchweinsteiger, though, did not complain. He did not retaliate, miss training sessions or refuse to do anything. He patiently and diligently broke his manager down. Mourinho, albeit begrudgingly, began to admire his belligerence. \nHe had prodded and poked a World Cup winner, a Germain national icon, to force him to leave, but the player refused to budge.\nHe repeatedly antagonised him, yet Schweinsteiger would only say nice things in response. Mourinho had to accept defeat - there is only so many times you can throw stones at a dog before you accept it is going to follow you regardless.\nMUFC greatest XI I n November, Mourinho, following meetings with the player and his advisors, agreed a peace deal. He allowed Schweinsteiger to return to training with the first team , he even allowed him to play against West Ham in the League Cup soon afterwards.\nEven then, most believed Schweinsteiger would leave. His return to training was likened to fattening up a pig for sale at market .\nBy bringing him back into the fold, Mourinho was probably hoping for an end to the soap opera. If Schweinsteiger looked trim, fit and he had been playing, he would be easier to sell. The rumoured interest from American clubs would be firmed up.\nIs winning the EFL Cup a blessing or a curse? A glance over the past 20 winners I f that was the plan, it did not work and it is unlikely to do so again in the summer. Schweinsteiger has 16 months left on his contract and he intends to spend them in Manchester.\nThere have been a smattering of first-team appearances since November, the most recent in the Europa League win over St-Etienne in France when he replaced the injured Michael Carrick.\nSchweinsteiger has been given another chance by Mourinho and is determined to take it. And for those who question his place in the squad this weekend, it is worth remembering, the last time he played at Wembley, he won the Champions League with Bayern Munich.\nSometimes there is no better substitute like an experienced one. Even Mourinho seems to realise that now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:00:32.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
