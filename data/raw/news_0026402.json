The registration would then be backdated to fall under the unsuspecting new owner’s name. The vehicle would then be registered back under the original owner’s name‚ minus the fines. 'Do not hide criminal actions behind the reputation of Oliver Tambo or Nelson Mandela'‚ says Tokyo Sexwale \n“What would normally then happen after this‚ the unsuspecting person‚ business or estate on whose name the fines have been dumped would then approach the licensing department to query the transaction. The officials would then say they did not know what happened and simply wipe off the fines. That is how the city has been losing on traffic fines and licensing revenues‚” he said. \nMsimanga said 105 officials fingered in the fraudulent practice‚ believed to be part of a syndicate operating across Gauteng‚ were from all the city's licensing stations. \nHe said internal disciplinary processes have already been initiated against 12 of these officials. Did your fine just disappear? Traffic officials caught hiding paperwork away from City of Tshwane \n“This number may grow as we probe further into this practice that went largely unchecked under the previous ANC administration‚” he said. \nHe said this fraudulent scheme meant that the metro was unable to recoup some of the money owed to it‚ which further compounded its ability to generate the revenue it needed to provide services to law-abiding citizens entitled to services. \nThis comes on the heels of the metro's announcement last week about just how precarious its financial situation is. \nMsimanga has since instructed that all officials implicated in this collusion be suspended and dealt with swiftly so that they can start recovering some of these monies‚ which he said would go a long way toward generating the much-needed revenue. Tshwane deficit tops R2bn after surplus of R2.5m \n“In doing so‚ we will also swiftly root out this corruption from our traffic sector. This‚ coupled with the roll-out of parking meters‚ will ensure that we leverage the tools and instruments available to us in the traffic sector to generate revenue‚ enforce by-laws and create a more efficient and sustainable traffic sector in this city‚” he said. \nMsimanga said the practice had been playing itself out for several years. He added that though the amount that had been lost had yet to be ascertained‚ it could easily run into millions of rand. \nHe said they were still looking into how these funds could be recovered from the officials‚ once they had been found guilty‚ as well as from members of the public who benefited from the novel fraudulent scheme. \n“Licensing fraud and corruption become very‚ very technical since most of it is system-based (e-Natis). I will therefore be appointing a dedicated prosecutor and presiding officer to look into these cases‚” he said. \nMsimanga said during their election campaign‚ they promised that corruption would not be tolerated and that they remained resolute in this promise. \n“We will root out fraud and corruption in all its manifestations‚” he said. \n-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:00:32.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
