Wonderscope Children's Museum of Kansas City plans to vacate its longtime home in Shawnee and move to a new 30,000-square-foot facility to be built adjoining a new Mid-Continent Public Library branch in Red Bridge Shopping Center. Plans call for the Wonderscope Children's Museum and a new Mid-Continent Public Library… more Mershon & McDonald The new Red Bridge library branch will be financed via a bond issue, approved by voters within the Mid-Continent system's boundaries last November, that will raise about $10 million annually for new construction, renovations and added services. Part of the new Red Bridge branch, which will replace the existing branch at 11140 Locust St., will be a new 300-seat auditorium that will connect the library and children's museum. Representatives of the children's museum, which has occupied two former elementary schools in Shawnee since its 1989 opening, planned to announce a $12 million capital campaign to pay for the new facility and expanded programming during a breakfast for supporters Tuesday morning at the Hilton President Kansas City. \"We envision a premier destination experience where families can celebrate play and children can tinker and experiment at their own pace,\" Roxane Hill , Wonderscope's executive director, said in a release. \"The environment will foster children's creativity and confidence, with parents and caregivers learning right along with them.\" Wonderscope has been attracting about 70,000 children and adult visitors a year at its current facility, the former Flint Elementary building at 5700 King St. in downtown Shawnee. That facility is owned by the Regnier Family Foundation, which leases space to the children's museum for a nominal rate. But the facility's staff and board have been considering a move for years due to repair and maintenance costs associated with the old school building and a desire to expand exhibit space. Wonderscope, which merged with the Beyond the Book children' museum in 2007 and the Children's Museum of Kansas City in 2008, is the only nonprofit children's museum in the Kansas City area focusing exclusively on children ages newborn to 10. Its new Red Bridge location is expected to provide greater visibility, better accessibility and more participation by schools, families and children, including those in lower-income communities. A new, strategic partnership with the Mid-Continent Public Library will expand the museum's reach and provide more opportunities for events and co-sponsorships, Wonderscope said in the release. Kansas City Councilman Scott Taylor said he and Councilman Kevin McManus had been working behind the scenes to encourage Wonderscope to move to Red Bridge since plans for Lane4 Property Group Inc.'s plans to renovate the shopping center were first announced early in 2015. \"The addition of the Wonderscope Children's Museum to the revitalized Red Bridge Shopping Center will be a major benefit for the families of Kansas City,\" Taylor said. \"This new state-of-the art facility is just what we need for additional early childhood education opportunities. We welcome the Wonderscope family to south Kansas City with open arms.\" Brandon Buckley , a vice president with Lane4, said the firm had invested $11.4 million in Red Bridge Shopping Center's renovation so far and would likely invest another $2 million to wrap it up. Renovation of the center's main square has been completed, he said, and half of the vacant bowling alley there has been occupied by a 15,000-square-foot Euston's Hardware store — one of several new tenants . The project also has yielded a new parking lot, new roofing, new lighting, \"pretty much new everything,\" Buckley said. Located at Red Bridge and Holmes roads, Red Bridge Shopping Center was opened in 1959 by the J.C. Nichols Co., developers of the Country Club Plaza. When Lane4 acquired the center in 2015, it was 58 percent vacant. Now nearly filled, it is anchored by a Lipari's Sun Fresh grocery store. Rob reports on real estate and development.
