We will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal and bring to justice those who commit fraud against our immigrant communities.” The recent surge of ICE raids has heightened fears and paranoia among immigrants across the country. According to this week’s reports, immigration officers arrested about 600 people in at least 11 states. It’s estimated 40 of those people were detained in NYC. On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly released a statement defending the raids. \n[Donald] Trump has been clear in affirming the critical mission of DHS in protecting the nation and directed our department to focus on removing illegal aliens who have violated our immigration laws, with a specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety, have been charged with criminal offenses, have committed immigration violations or have been deported and re-entered the country illegally. To report potential fraud or other issues involving immigration services, Schneiderman urges you to contact the Attorney General's Immigration Services Fraud Unit by phone, (866) 390-2992, or email, Civil.Rights@ag.ny.gov. The office will not ask for your immigration status or share information with federal authorities.
