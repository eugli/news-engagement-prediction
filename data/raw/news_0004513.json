Nevertheless, his refusal to play for the Hammers has been dually resolved via a return to Marseille. \nHowever, Payet might just be as embarrassed at the French side as he was disliked at the London Stadium after his recent initiation ritual for the club. He may have a mean free-kick, but those high notes could do with some work. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Furthermore, it wouldn’t be legitimate if it wasn’t in front of the entire squad of course.

It certainly gives a new perspective to a seemingly unflappable playmaker. \nThe immeasurably awkward video can be seen below: \nCome on Dimitri, where was the commitment? What was meant to be a passionate delivery of a favored song came off as nothing more than an embarrassed mumble. \nWhile the humiliation is certainly understandable, you would think the initiation ceremony would be the least of his worries at the moment. After all, to say his exit from West Ham was messy would be putting it mildly. Future goals \nIt may not be the case in terms of singing, but Payet can be seen as having gotten off lightly this month. \nConsidering he completely refused to play for the Hammers, being able to depart for just £25 million leaves a lot to be desired. It can only assumed that Slavan Bilic was desperate to offload a player who was, ultimately, undermining the club. \nEither way though, it proves a disappointing result for neutral supporters. Last season demonstrated the boundless talent of Payet, yet his long awaited move from West Ham saw him sign for a team placed sixth in Ligue 1. \nFrom an outside perspective, it seems a cop out and a move born out of familiarity with the club. Besides, the 29-year-old was linked with transfers to clubs such as Manchester United as recently as the summer. \nIt won’t concern the man himself, however. He’s back in the league which made his name and should see him experience a comfortable end to the peak of his career. \nAs long as he keeps away from the microphone, we’re not that bothered though. \nDo you think Dimitri Payet should have moved to a bigger club?
