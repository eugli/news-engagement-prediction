Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the Republican nomination last year, echoed the Speaker, saying that Trump had satisifed his promise, \"and the rule of law will be all the better for it.\"\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of Trump, tweeted his approval of the nomination, calling Gorsuch \"a tremendous pick.\"\nI congratulate President Trump for nominating a conservative jurist with outstanding credentials and experience to the Supreme Court.\n— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 1, 2017 By contrast, and in an apparent preview of the bitter confirmation fight ahead, the Democratic National Committee said Gorsuch's nomination \"raises some very serious questions about whether he would be a Supreme Court Justice who believes the Constitution protects all of us, not just the wealthy, and whether he can approach each case with an open mind to make fair decisions based on the merits.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was \"skeptical that [Gorsuch] can be a strong, independent Justice on the Court.\" Schumer added that Gorsuch had previously \"sided with corporations over working people [and] demonstrated a hostility toward women’s rights.\"\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. went even further, saying Gorsuch's nomination was \"a breathtaking retreat from the notion that Americans have a fundamental right to Constitutional liberties, and harkens back to the days when politicians restricted a people’s rights on a whim.\n\"No Senator who believes that individual rights are reserved to the people, and not the government, can support this nomination,\" Wyden added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:11:15.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
