Gettys, who had a team-high eight rebounds, and Mike Williams with 14 points each. Corey Sanders added 13 points, five assists and five rebounds. \nThe Scarlet Knights, who trailed by 12 early in the second half, cut the lead to five after Williams hit a 3-pointer to make it 66-61 with 4:02 to play. \n“We’re competing,” Williams said. “Like Coach said, it’s not the Rutgers that everybody had on the schedule and was like, `We have an easy W,’ and either you’re going to take this L or have a hard-fought victory. Nothing easy.” \nMurphy fouled out at the 2:28 mark with Minnesota leading 68-61 and Rutgers again pulled within five, 68-63, on a Gettys tip-in with 1:44 remaining before the Gophers made four free throws in the final minute. \nPitino credited it to his team’s “next man up philosophy.” And the Gophers’ fourth-year coach feels like his team is hitting its stride at the right time. \n“We’re playing our best basketball,” Pitino said. “It’s most important to do that in February.” \nCRASHING THE GLASS \nRutgers came in to the game ranked third nationally in offensive rebounding at 15.16 per game and fifth nationally in rebounds per game at 42.0. Rutgers was outrebounded 40-34 and had 14 offensive rebounds. \nBLOCK PARTY \nMinnesota entered the game ranked first in the Big Ten and second nationally with 6.8 blocks per game. They had five blocks, with Reggie Lynch — who leads the Big Ten and is third nationally with 3.2 per game — recording three. \nSTRUGGLES FROM 3 \nBoth teams struggled beyond the arc. Minnesota was 3 of 17 while Rutgers was 3 of 14. \nNO CHARITY \nRutgers had a poor day from the foul line, going 10 of 22. \n“We just got to make free throws,” Williams said. “We make free throws, the game is a little bit different.” \nBIG PICTURE \nMinnesota: Ranked No. 24 last month, the Gophers followed up the ranking with five straight losses before reeling off three wins in a row. Minnesota is trying to up its seeding in the Big Ten Tournament and gain a bid to the NCAA Tournament. \nRutgers: After starting the season 11-1, the Scarlet Knights have fallen to .500 for the first time under first-year coach Steve Pikiell. \nUP NEXT \nMinnesota: Host to Indiana on Wednesday. \nRutgers: Travels to Purdue on Tuesday. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:14:12.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
