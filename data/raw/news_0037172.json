(Photo: Lucas Thomas/DVT)\n260 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Orn Hier had a lot to think about on his six-hour drive from Spearfish, South Dakota, to Bismarck, North Dakota, on a sunny summer day in September 2009.\nHier, a World War II veteran, was on his way home after attending the funeral of an old service friend. It was later in the day, at a gathering of friends and family, that he heard someone mention the name of a familiar girl: Methal.\nIn another life — before he fought in the war, before he returned to America and had three children with his wife of 60 years, and before his wife passed away earlier in 2009 — Orn dated Methal Long while on a 15-day furlough in Minnesota in 1944. Orn was stationed in Fort Benning in Georgia with the 10th Armored Division, but the two dated every night while he was home in Minnesota. When the furlough ended, Orn went to Europe to fight the war.\nThe two wrote each other occasionally from across the ocean until, one day, Orn got a letter from Methal in which she announced she was getting married. After that, they went on to live separate lives.\nAt some point during his 350-mile drive that day, he made a decision that resulted in what he now says is the best thing to ever happen to him. When he got home around 9:30 that evening, he looked up every person with the last name “Long” in the phone directory for Timber Lake, Minnesota —the last place he could recall Methal living.\nBut her last name wasn't Long anymore. Like Orn, she too was married for 60 years and was now Methal Majorowicz. When her husband passed away in 2006, Methal says she never gave much thought to dating another person.\nMethal and Orn, in the 1940s.

Do you remember me? Don’t hang up,” the man pleaded.\nOrn had found Methal’s number through a relative and although it had been 63 years since the two had last spoke, Methal remembered him. And, luckily for Orn, she didn’t hang up.\n“It was bedtime, you know?” Methal remembers of that night. “I kind of thought, ‘Should I take this call?’ And on the other end he says don’t hang up! Please don’t hang up! I said, 'I’m not gonna hang up, who is this?'”\nThat night, for the next two hours, Methal says they talked about days gone by. It’s possible they reminisced about the first time they met. As Orn tells it, he went on a blind date with a friend and his date. The problem was, Methal was his friend’s date.\n“I eyed her a little bit and she eyed me, and we were sitting in a restaurant, the four of us in a booth, and I wanted to ask her for a date but I didn’t know how to do it,\" Orn recalls. \"So I wrote her a letter and said, 'How about a date tomorrow night?'”\nIt's unlikely Orn could have imagined that handwritten note would still resonate 73 years later. Nevertheless, the love created during that 15-day furlough in 1944 survived two separate marriages of 60 years.\nOrn and Methal (Photo: Submitted by Sandy Dailey)\nA few days after the first phone call, Orn called again. Then again. And again after that. What began as old friends reconnecting over the phone quickly became much more. From 2009 through 2014, Orn made 23 separate trips from Bismarck to visit Methal at her home in Rochester, Minnesota. On April 7, 2014, he moved in with her. They don’t have plans to remarry. They’re both content just being in each other’s company.\n“Back when I was young and we did this, it was called ‘shacking up.’ Nowadays they call it cohabitating. So I guess that’s what we’re doing, cohabitating,” Orn jokes as the couple prepares to spend another Valentine's Day together..\n“I lived in a condo in Bismarck but I was alone. After I talked to her, she started a little something that must have been smoldering here and set that off,” he says, pointing to his heart.\nMethal, who turned 94 in January, and Orn, who will be 95 in March, split their time between Rochester and Mesquite, where Methal’s daughter Sandy Dailey lives with her husband. She says the two are inseparable.\n“They are like toddlers. They chatter all the time. When they go to bed at night, John (her husband) and I will be watching TV and we can hear them in there chit-chit-chit,” she says. “What makes this relationship workable is that they both had successful marriages. You learn from that. I can see how they look at each other; they might as well have been married a zillion years, because Orn will look at mom, or she’ll look at him and she’ll know exactly what he’s thinking.”\nOrn describes their daily routine in Rochester: Usually it starts with breakfast, where his friends seem to enjoy Methal’s company as much as he does.\n“I take her down to the restaurant there and they got them old farts and they just turn their heads. They don’t even talk to me and I get a little jealous,” Orn says.\n\"He does!\" Methal confirms with a laugh.\nAfter getting back home at around 11:30, Orn says they’ll usually take a nap until 12:30, when \"Days of Our Lives\" comes on television.\n“I’ve been watching that one for 50 years, or 51, whatever it is now,” he says. “Then we take another nap. Then we play a lot of cards.”\nMethal indicates she usually wins, though that might depend on who you ask.\n“She said she wins all the time so if that makes her feel better, I’ll go along with it,” he says.\nMethal says she and Orn still enjoy doing a lot of the things they did together back in 1944.\n“We both love to dance but we kind of out danced ourselves, you know? So we’re just homebodies. That’s a sign you’re old,” she says.\nOrn hugs a teary-eyed Methal after his rendition of \"I Love You Truly.\" (Photo: Lucas Thomas/DVT)\nNeither are too old for karaoke, though, which Dailey says they both still enjoy. Orn even broke out into song for Methal. He sang the lines of a fitting song, “I Love You Truly,” which, written in 1901, has survived much the same as their love:\nI love you truly, truly dear\nLife with its sorrow, life with its tear\nFades into dreams when I feel you are near\nFor I love you truly, truly dear\nThough it was only a few lines, it was enough to make Methal reach for the box of tissues sitting ready on the table nearby. Methal says Orn’s love is what she appreciates best about him.\nSeeing her in tears, Orn reaches over to give her a hug.\n“She’s just as sweet now as she was then ... She’s the sweetest little gal I ever met,\" he says.\nFollow Lucas Thomas on Twitter, @LucasThomas14 , or call him at 702-232-0603.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/62eb68890283cf3d2a9f6c60ffbcb8d96d434f5a/c=0-254-2048-1794&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226007602313746-Image-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8d2c3973e2d6687b84bf92c75ba58eb4110ec41/c=207-0-3442-2432&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226008396057010-IMG-9295.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226006041659734-IMG-9537.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//www.thespectrum.com/story/news/local/mesquite/2017/02/13/lasting-love-story-orn-hier-and-methal-majorowicz/97868198/&text=A%20lasting%20love%3A%20The%20story%20of%20Orn%20Hier%20and%20Methal%20Majorowicz&via=azcentral", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//www.thespectrum.com/story/news/local/mesquite/2017/02/13/lasting-love-story-orn-hier-and-methal-majorowicz/97868198/&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226008396057010-IMG-9295.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa0b872e1974278e4940063283f3d45197779e7b/c=1-0-639-480&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226006041659734-IMG-9537.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8acd359c3aa2998591cc064e605bd8f60151c1fc/c=207-0-3442-2432&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226002189633658-IMG-9293.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226008396057010-IMG-9295.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226007602313746-Image-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226002189633658-IMG-9293.JPG", "https://twitter.com/LucasThomas14", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226002189633658-IMG-9293.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226007602313746-Image-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/StGeorge/StGeorge/636226006041659734-IMG-9537.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-14T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:34:05.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
