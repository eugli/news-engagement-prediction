I had a job, it seems awful,\" he joked. \nCheers for Europe \nIn the packed hall, where people waved French and EU flags, Macron drew the biggest cheers when he spoke in favour of the European project. \n“Our country cannot succeed without Europe,” he said.

The term is more commonly used in Britain to describe ties with the United States. \n“Nothing will be the same (after Brexit), but I think we can defend mutual interests over the long term,” he said, citing close cooperation between London and Paris on defence and security. \nAs well as business professionals, the audience included footballers Steve Mandanda and Yohan Cabaye, who play for the French national team and the English side Crystal Palace, Macron's campaign team told Agence France-Presse. Is this the man to reform Europe & shape the course of Brexit (the one with the tie, obviously)?

An exit is an exit,” he told reporters outside 10 Downing Street after meeting May. \n“I am very determined that there will be no undue advantages.” #macron emerges from what he calls 'mutually respectful' meeting with May pic.twitter.com/OwvQQvcdBs — Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) February 21, 2017 \nMacron, who created his own En Marche! (On the Move!) party, also slammed his far-right rival, National Front leader Marine Le Pen . \nHe accused her of wanting to \"divide France into non-Muslim people and Muslim people\", and said her \"programme is one to push France into the 19th century\". \nOpinion polls suggest Le Pen would win the first round of France's presidential election on April 23, but would lose in the run-off vote on May 7. \nMacron had been the favourite to take her on, but a new Elabe survey published Tuesday suggests conservative Fillon has overtaken him again. — CÃ©leste Owen-Jones (@CelesteOJ) February 21, 2017 \nDespite the damaging fake-jobs investigation weighing down Fillon’s campaign, the conservative former prime minister was up three points to 21 percent, while Macron was down five to 18.5 percent. \nLe Pen polled at 28 percent, up two points on the same poll in early February. \nRare Downing Street reception \nIt is unusual for a British prime minister to host a foreign candidate for elected office, although Downing Street noted that former prime minister Tony Blair had hosted Nicolas Sarkozy months before he became French president in 2007. \n\"Monsieur Macron was already in London, he asked for a meeting and we were able to accommodate,\" May's spokesman told reporters. \nAsked if May would be prepared to meet Le Pen, he said: \"There's a long-standing policy that we don't engage with the Front National.\" \nConservative leader May promised a close post-Brexit relationship with France on security and defence as she met with French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve in London on Friday. \n(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS) Date created : 2017-02-22 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:07:12.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
