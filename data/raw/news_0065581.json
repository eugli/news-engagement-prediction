Image: Clarizel Abanilla \nIt could be quite an unusual view for a typical gay guy, but comedian Tammy Brown eyes ending up with a woman rather than a man. \nIn his February 22 guesting on Inquirer ShowbizLive, the comedian revealed that while he may be openly gay, he sees himself choosing a woman to raise his own family. \n“Yes [I might end up with a woman]. ‘Yung utak ko nagfo- focus na magkaroon ako ng pamilya (My mind is bent on having a family of my own),” he said. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe comedian who hails from San Pablo, Laguna said he has experienced all sorts of relationships, being with men and women in the past. \nSurprisingly, despite dressing up in such a way that no one would doubt his sexual preference, that is being gay, he says women, even lesbians, fall for him and pursue him. \n“ Lahat po ng relasyon na -experience ko na, ako ‘yung bading na hindi masyado matyaga sa lalaki. Nahihiya ako (I’ve been through all kinds of relationships. I am the kind of gay person who does not pursue guys too much. I’m shy.),” he said. \nHe further shared that he does not feel comfortable flirting with guys. \n“ Kung may bet ako, o may crush ako, hindi ko sinasabi. Hindi ako pala- boyfriend. Tamang harot lang (If I like a guy or I have a crush on someone, I do not tell. I don’t frequently engage in a relationship with a guy. I just flirt a little.),” he added. \nInquirer ShowbizLive airs every Wednesday, 8 p.m. on Inquirer.net Facebook, Youtube and Periscope. It is also broadcast live on Inquirer Bandera Facebook, RadyoInquirer 990AM and channel 16 or 18 via TV Plus. \nThe show is hosted by Inquirer Bandera’s entertainment editor Ervin Santiago and Inquirer.net’s entertainment correspondent Izel Abanilla. \nFor more showbiz inside stories, follow the hosts on their Instagram accounts: \n@Ervinsantiago7 – Ervin Santiago", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:48:38.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
