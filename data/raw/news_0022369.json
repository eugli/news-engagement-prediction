After all, a picture/video of her playing with a cobra has unexpectedly hit the web. Following which, many officials from the wildlife welfare/NGOs too have been slamming the actress over illegally using the snake on her TV show, Nagarjun Ek Yodha. While Sunish Kunju of PAWS was the first one to take notice of it and raise the issue. Shruti along with her show’s three other members – Nitin Solanki, Utkarsh Bali and Pearl Puri were also reportedly arrested under the violation of sections wildlife act 1972 -Sections 9, 39, 48a, 51 yesterday. However, Shruti FINALLY breaks her silence on the whole fuss surrounding her posing with a cobra.

She said, “We are not arrested; it so happened that we posted a picture with Cobra during our Nagarjuna shoot and I was not aware that time that it’s illegal to post an image like that. Otherwise, why will I do such a thing and get into a hassle unnecessarily! We are going to forest station for our statements and its been 4 months already.” \nHere’s the video that’s going viral: Forest Dept say that production manager nd actress said this snake was special effect bt forensic tests cnfrmd it was real @dna pic.twitter.com/DIfosxGhZO \n— Virat A Singh (@singhvirat246) February 8, 2017 \nThe telly website even got in touch with Pearl V Puri, another accused in the same case and he too clarified, “Firstly, we were not arrested, we just went to forest station. It so happened that when Nagarjuna completed 100 episodes, a Cobra was brought on the set by Cobra catcher and we posed with it for a picture. We went only for giving the statements.” \nHowever, Pawan Sharma, the founder of RAWW, a wildlife and environment conservation NGO took to Facebook last night and expressed his angst stating, , “Actress Shruti Ulfat and three others from NagArjuna daily soap booked by Mumbai Range of Thane Territorial wing of the forest department for using Spectacled Cobra, protected species under Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule 2. They were produced in court yesterday and court gave forest department their custody for a day to know and find the people who supplied snake to them. They will be produced in court again today. When I had assisted the Anti Poaching Unit of the Forest Department for primary investigations at the Film City in October last year the actress made us wait for an hour with her rude staff which did not cooperate and all of them had misled the forest department stating that it was VFX /Graphics and not a real snake. However forensic reports in January this year revealed that the snake was real and the responsible people have started facing the heat. Posing for entertainment with a protected species which is one of the top venomous snakes of the country is unethical, illegal and misleading.” \nWhat do you conclude of this report? Do you think Shruti should plead guilty or is it unfair to get her under the scanner for unintentionally committing the crime? You can drop your thoughts in the comments below and we’ll be back with more updates right here.
