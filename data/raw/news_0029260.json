Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nJudge Buscombe said Lawson “giggled” when police spoke to him in hospital after the crash where he told them, “It worked, it got rid of the car”.\nLawson ended up as an involuntary mental health patient for seven months in the wake of the crash and the judge said medical assessments found he was an undiagnosed schizophrenic who smoked three “cones” a day in the 12 months prior.\nHe said Lawson was suffering paranoid delusions at the time and believed he had grandiose “giant powers” to drive like a lunatic.\nJudge Buscombe also found him guilty of driving with an illicit drug in his system and disqualified him from driving for five years.\nJudge Buscombe said he afforded Lawson a 25 per cent discount for his guilty pleas and found his “moral culpability” was reduced because he was clearly psychotic at the time.\nCrash victim Kristyn Rourke (centre) with family and friends leaving Gosford Court after Kayden Lawson was sentenced to 2.5 years.
