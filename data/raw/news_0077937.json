Most patients with such an advanced condition only live for six months but half of the trial group are still alive nine months since the trial began, and a third may be cured.\nDimas Padilla, 43, of Orlando, who was warned his case was worsening after chemotherapy stopped working, is now in complete remission after undergoing the therapy last August. \nAfter learning his cancer was probably terminal he said: \"I was thinking how am I going to tell this to my mother, my wife, my children,\" he said.\nAfter CAR-T therapy he saw his tumours \"shrink like ice cubes\" and is now in complete remission.\n\"They were able to save my life,\" Mr Padilla added.\nFive cancer red flags to never ignore H owever there are still concerns that the treatment has significant side effects, and can even kill some patients, as it puts the immune system into a state of over-drive. During the trial two people died from the therapy, rather than their cancer. \nOf the study participants, 13 per cent developed a dangerous condition where the immune system overreacts in fighting the cancer, and roughly a third of patients developed anaemia or other blood-count-related problems.\nNearly one third also reported neurological problems such as sleepiness, confusion, tremor or difficulty speaking, but these typically lasted just a few days.\nThe scans show how cancer has disappeared after just three months, and the remission has continued F ull results will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference in April and the company plans to seek approval from European regulators later this year.\n\"It's a safe treatment, certainly a lot safer than having progressive lymphoma,\"said the cancer institute's Dr Steven Rosenberg,\nOther companies, such as Juno Therapeutics, have had to halt trials into CAR-T treatments following patient deaths.\nIn numbers | Cancer in the UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:13:01.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
