The collection is called—you guessed it—Yeezy Season 5. It will hit the runway on February 15 at 5PM. \nBacklash from the fashion community has already bubbled up as two shows are already on the calendar at the exact time West will be showing his new gear. Assembly and Marchesa are already confirmed in 5PM time slots on the 15th, while Thom Browne's women's show is scheduled for 6PM (itself a potential issue because West doesn't exactly have a track record of punctuality or commute-friendly locations for his own fashion shows). \nAnd to say West has had a bumpy few months in the wake of his last fashion show would be an understatement. In case you need a reminder, the rapper canceled his sold-out tour, spent some time in a hospital recuperating from exhaustion, met with President Trump , and dyed his hair blond ). \nWhile Yeezy Season 3 is currently in stores, there's been no update as to if or when his Yeezy Season 4 would ship (or if he even made any menswear for it). You can file West's Calabasas Adidas line and rumored new Yeezy sneakers under TBD status as well. But whether or not West decides to show clothes that actually hit store racks or not, there's one thing that no one—even West's biggest detractors in the fashion world—can deny: Yeezy Season never fails to inject a new level of excitement into the fashion week calendar.
