Others thought George should receive a special icon award for his contribution to music.

Robbie Williams, The 1975, Skepta and Little Mix, so any one of them could take part in the tribute. \nOr it could be a surprise star not announced beforehand. \nOver at the Grammy Awards in the US, it was Adele who honoured George during that show’s tribute to the global star. \nShe performed a version of Fastlove in his memory, but called for the performance to be stopped when she went off-key during the first chorus. She then started again and pulled off a flawless performance. \n\"I f**ked up, I can’t do it again like last year,” she said, visibly upset. \n\"I'm sorry, I can't mess this up for him.\" Adele pays tribute to George Michael (Photo: REUTERS) \nGeorge was 53 years old when he died on Christmas Day. \nAs ever, fans in the UK can watch all the action on ITV with an exclusive broadcast, while Clara Amfo, Laura Jackson and Alice Levine will host live from the red carpet and backstage either side of the main show on ITV2. \nHowever, that's not all - the BRITs will also air live on YouTube at 7.30pm, which will be fronted by the platform's presenter-in-chief Casper Lee. \nGeoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI & BRIT Awards said: \"We are always looking for ways for The BRITs to reach as wide an audience as possible given the global interest and huge international artists taking part in the show. \n\"It’s really exciting for us that so many people around the world will get the chance to celebrate the UK’s biggest night in music live as it happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:19:47.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
