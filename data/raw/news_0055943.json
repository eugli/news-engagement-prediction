How such a centre might work best in practice, or even if it necessary seems worth debating”.

We continue to be passionate about revealing hidden histories and highlighting the unsung contributors to our region's music story. \n\"We feel a music centre should reflect this and explore the social and political histories that intertwine with music. We also believe that a centre of this kind is only relevant if it looks forward. It must support and inspire fledgling musicians, artists and other emerging talents. It must present and attract a diverse range of voices\". \nTickets for the debate cost £3.78 including booking fee and are available via Eventbrite . \nThe Manchester Music Legacies debate is donating all ticket proceeds to The Horsfall , whose work to improve mental health and well-being for young people through engagement the creative arts.
