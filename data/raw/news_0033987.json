Johnson and Tyler Thompson. \nHacksaw Ridge has already taken home a number of awards in the past year, including the Capri, Hollywood best director and producer awards as well as director of the year at the Hollywood Film Awards. \n“Mel Gibson delivered an exciting, well-cast and beautifully executed motion picture that has struck a chord with audiences and critics through the world.
