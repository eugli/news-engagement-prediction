College officials then found CCTV footage of the man which suggested he had accessed the grounds without a security pass. They sent out an email on Friday with a CCTV still warning that although interactions with the individual had been ‘amenable’, any sighting of him should be reported. It said: ‘This is a serious reminder that this wonderful and safe environment in which we live and work can be taken advantage of. College bursar Annette Duffell defended the email, saying staff were just asking people 'to be a bit vigilant about who they let in' 'We must all do our bit to maintain vigilance against unauthorised persons in the college.’ Mr Nylander, who attended Regent’s Park College at Oxford, said he had entered the college late at night to pick up a key from a friend’s office and then became locked in the building. He said when he realised he was stuck, he worked on his laptop until the gates were opened in the morning. Last year Mr Nylander dressed up in chains outside Codrington Library to protest the founder, Chris Codrington, who made his fortune from the slave trade When a friend at the college showed him the email, he posted it on the Facebook campaign group ‘Race Matters’, where he received dozens of messages of support. However, Annette Duffell, the college bursar, said: ‘As far as the college was concerned, we had an intruder on our premises and so we issued a picture. ‘Given this person was not a member of our college and not with anybody, we needed to circulate something so that we could identify who it was and ask people to just be a bit vigilant about who they let in. ‘We know the students of our college and we have photos of them all. There are only 200, so we knew he was not a member of our college. Mr Nylander was a leading campaigner in the 'Rhodes Must Fall' movement and has also interned for Labour MP Julie Hilling ‘It was purely a security issue. Anything else is conjecture. We were responding as we would to any overnight security issue.’ Mr Nylander, who attended the £11,000-a-year private school Manchester Grammar, has interned for Labour MP Julie Hilling. He was a leading campaigner in Oxford’s ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ movement which called on the university to remove a statue of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College. Last year he dressed in chains and stood outside All Souls College in protest against the Codrington Library and commemoration of its founder, Christopher Codrington, who made his fortune from the slave trade. The poet, musician and actor – who starred as Othello in a university production – said CCTV incident was ‘part of a very worrying trend’ across Oxford University. He said other black students had been stopped and asked for ID when entering their colleges, while porters were said to keep photographs of the few black students at the front desk as a security measure.
