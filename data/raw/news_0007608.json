By Burgess Everett , John Bresnahan and Seung Min Kim 01/31/17 07:19 PM EST \n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen. We prefer not to. But that’s one of the options that’s open,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch said. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Print \nSenate Republicans are open to gutting the filibuster if Democrats block President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick — and they just might have the numbers to do it. \nInterviews with nearly 20 key Republicans this week – from “old bulls” to party leaders to junior members — shows the GOP is reluctant to deploy the so-called nuclear option but deliberately not ruling it out. The downside, of course, is that any temporary advantage they’d gain now could come back to haunt when Democrats eventually return to the majority. Story Continued Below \nBut if unilaterally changing Senate rules is the only way to break a potential Democratic blockade, Republicans might go there. Only one GOP senator interviewed, moderate Susan Collins of Maine, explicitly said she would not. \n“What goes around, comes around … do we want to do something that will accrue to the benefits of the Democrats?” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading skeptic of the nuclear option. But he gave an open-ended answer to his own question: “Of course I’m concerned, but … if they block it then I think we have to sit down as a conference and say, ‘OK, what are all the aspects of this situation and what do we want to do?’” \nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), the party’s chief vote-counter, was more blunt: “They’re going to lose. We’re going to confirm the president’s nominee ... We ought to reserve all options.” By Josh Gerstein \nMany Republicans are concerned about the never-ending cycle of partisan gamesmanship that's gripped the Senate the past decade. First Republicans threatened to filibuster judges, then Democrats actually filibustered one. When Republicans responded in kind, Democrats killed the filibuster for all executive-branch nominees except those to the Supreme Court. \nNow, Republicans are weighing whether to do away with the 60-vote threshold for high court picks, too. \nIf the pattern continues, it could ruin much of what makes the Senate unique. \nIf Democrats block Trump’s nominee and Republicans employ for the nuclear option, the margin for error is slim. Republicans believe Vice President Mike Pence can break a tie on a such a vote, which means Republicans can lose two of their 52-member caucus. They’re already down one with Collins, who said she's “not a proponent of changing the rules of the Senate.” \nFew are actively pushing Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take the ultimate step. But conservatives such as Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and even more pragmatic lawmakers like Rob Portman (R-Ohio) are holding out the threat as a break-the-glass option in case 41 Democrats oppose Trump’s nominee. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), a four-term senator, likened the technique of changing the rules by a simple majority to a “Hail Mary on fourth down.” By Seung Min Kim \nIf Republicans tried and succeeded, it would destroy a supermajority hurdle that both parties have long viewed as a moderating influence on the nation’s courts. In fact, there’s a huge danger of Trump’s nominee leading to the death of the Senate’s long-held minority rights. \nIt could also backfire on Republicans when they're back in the minority someday. \n“It’s risky in terms of what the precedent this creates in the long term,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP leader. \n\"We're not planning on (the) nuclear option or anything else except to get this person [confirmed], based upon the proposition and the precedent,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which will hold hearings on Trump's selection. \nIndeed, if the Supreme Court rules are changed, the Senate’s legislative filibuster would be the next target. Other than its slower pace, that would leave little to distinguish the Senate from the majoritarian House. \nRepublicans are much more comfortable expressing confidence that the nominee will be confirmed than the possibility of upending Senate rules. But in most of their statements, there's an underlying threat: that if Democrats don’t play this right they could be forced to swallow not only this nominee but potentially another one later in Trump’s presidency that could remake the court into a far more conservative body. \n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen. We prefer not to. But that’s one of the options that’s open. All I can say is, we’re going to fill that seat,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the most senior Senate Republican. By Josh Gerstein \nThe overwhelming preference of Republicans is to somehow convince eight Democrats to get on board. Democrats say this is theoretically possible, but expect opposition to quickly build and won’t rule out ultimately blocking Trump’s nominee. \nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who along with McCain and Collins joined the so-called \"Gang of 14\" to prevent weakening the filibuster in 2005, refused to even entertain the wrenching decision that Republicans may face in the next few months. But unlike Collins, he won’t say that he opposes the nuclear option if necessary. \n“I don’t think we’ll have to cross that bridge. I’m sure we will get cloture on the nominee,” Graham said. “I’ve always been worried about changes. But apparently I’m more worried about it than all of the Democrats because they changed the rules.” \nParty leaders are working to get their talking points straight. They don’t want to turn off Democrats early in the process by openly brandishing the nuclear option. \n“I’m not saying at this point what it’s going to take because I don’t know what it’s going to take,\" said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). \"I’m just saying we’ll get him or her confirmed.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:29:55.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
