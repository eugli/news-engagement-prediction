Gunalan shortly after four police 4WD vehicles together with a Special Task Force On Organised Crime (Stafoc) team arrived there at 1.40am.\nThe cameraman is believed to have aroused suspicion for hanging around the IPFN where the mortuary is located. The mortuary, which is holding Jong-nam's body, has been a focal point of journalists covering the case.\nA KBS spokesman said the cameraman was detained after he was found to be without any identification documents or passport. \n\"Police released him half an hour later after we brought and showed them his documents,\" he told reporters here.\nMeanwhile, Dang Wangi police chief ACP Mohd Sukri Kaman told Bernama that the presence of Stafoc personnel was not to escort Jong-nam's eldest son, Kim Han-sol, who was expected to arrive at IPFN to identify his father's body and for DNA testing.\nA large group of local and international journalists had gathered at IPFN since 5pm Monday in anticipation of Han-sol's arrival but he has not been seen so far.\nJong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed on Feb 13  by two women who splashed a chemical on his face at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2) departure hall. He was about to leave for Macau. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:21:09.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
