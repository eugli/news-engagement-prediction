(Photo: Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe New England Patriots have been burned time and time again by incredible, insane, out-of-this-universe catches in various Super Bowls they've been a part of (including two losses).\nThanks to Julian Edelman, they were finally on the receiving end of one. And it might be one of the greatest catches in NFL history.\nWith the Pats down eight and facing a 1st-and-10 from their own 36, Tom Brady threw up a pass to Julian Edelman that seemed to hang in the air forever. As three Falcons defenders converged, Edelman went between the legs of one of them. As the ball nearly hit the ground, he miraculously snagged it OUT OF MID-AIR.\nsdflka;sdjf;kzjdfc;alksejf;lkasdjf;lkasjdf;lkjasdf;lkjasdlfk;cjasd;lkfjaslkdf #SB51 pic.twitter.com/GCkEJilvzV \n— NFL (@NFL) February 6, 2017 He caught this pic.twitter.com/CWRTddEe5I \n— Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) February 6, 2017 There are no words to describe that catch accurately. Given how much time was left and what an insane piece of receiving that was, it's an all-timer of epic proportions.\nIt now joins some of the catches the Pats were one the wrong end of, such as:\nThe Helmet Catch.\nThe Mario Manningham Catch.\nThe Jermaine Kearse juggling grab (even though it led to an eventual Patriots win).\nJust incredible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:24:10.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
