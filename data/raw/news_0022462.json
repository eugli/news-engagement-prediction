Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAmazing footage has been released of a tiny baby inside its mum's womb showing incredible never-seen-before detail thanks to new technology. \nThe astonishing video is one of the first in the world to use algorithms, magnetic fields and radio waves to create extra-high quality images of a tiny foetus. \nThe clip is of the baby at 20 weeks - about halfway through the average pregnancy - and is so detailed it shows the little one fiddling with its umbilical cord, stretching its arms in the womb and turning its head from side to side. \nAnd despite its heart being smaller than a penny, it can been seen beating in the scan. The video scan ends with the cheeky little one giving its mum an enormous kick with both legs, causing her belly to wobble. It was captured by the iFIND project, a London-based group of medical experts from around the world who made the world-first tech in a bid to improve ante-natal scans for all mums-to-be . The baby can be seen in incredible detail (Photo: ChannelMum / SWNS) \nDr David Lloyd, Clinical Research Fellow at King's College London and part of the iFIND project, said: \"Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they're still in the womb really isn't that easy. \"For one thing, they're very small.

The new algorithm stabilises the moving image to get the best clearest image (Photo: ChannelMum / SWNS) \n\"It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors.

It is the most cutting-edge scan available to date and is possible due to an algorithm developed by the team. \nIt automatically copes or 'corrects' small fetal movements made by the baby during the scan to create clear images. \nNormally if a baby moved rapidly in a conventional scan, just like the baby in the footage, you would get an unusable image and the mum might have to return for a re-scan. The baby can be seen playing with the umbilical cord (Photo: ChannelMum / SWNS) \nMedics hope to develop the technology so it will eventually involve four probes which automatically move around the top of the mum's tummy to get the best image.
