The league is pushing a series of changes it hopes will be approved unilaterally by teams .\nBraves’ Freeman: Stop trying to change the rules\nWhile Manfred wouldn’t discuss proposed changes specifically, here are some of what has been publicly voiced as potential changes.\nThe strike zone Hall of Fame Braves manager Bobby Cox had regular discussions - often leading to his ejection - with umpires about the strike zone. SCOTT ROVAK/AP • The league has considered restoring the lower edge of the strike zone from just beneath the kneecap to its pre-1996 level — at the top of the kneecap.\nPitch clock A 20-second pitch clock has been used in Triple-A baseball for two seasons. Bill Wippert/AP • The league wants to install a 20-second pitch clock. Violators of the clock are penalized with balls and strikes. The pitch clock has been used at Triple-A and Double-A games for the past two seasons. According to MILB.com, the clocks helped shave nine to 15 minutes off the average game time.\nThe no-pitch intentional walk • The signal from the dugout to the umpire would allow a team to call for an intentional walk without the pitcher having to throw pitches. The downside is moments like this are less likely to happen:\nLimiting mound visits Mike Foltynewiez (center) in his Braves debut and first major league appearance as a starter in 2015, gets a visit from then pitching coach Roger McDowell in the first inning. Brant Sanderlin • Another reported proposal calls for a limit to the amount of mound visits coaches and catchers are allowed to make. The number pitched is three per game.\nExtra-base runner to start extra innings Rob Foldy/Getty Images • Starting runners on second base in extra innings will be experimented with during the World Baseball Classic and perhaps at some short-season Class A leagues, though Manfred concedes the special-purpose rule would likely not be used in the major leagues.\nWhich of these baseball speed-up rules do you favor?
