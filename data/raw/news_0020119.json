Its featured attraction is the Hall of Presidents, a reverential overview of American history that includes animatronic renderings of every American leader. As is the case whenever a new president takes the oath of office, the theater is temporarily closed to accommodate the introduction of a Donald J. Trump figure. \nThe Hall of Presidents is set to reopen in late June. But Liberty Square visitors can enjoy a decidedly non-somber, irreverent take on the country's story with “The Muppets Present… Great Moments in American History.” The live show, which opened a few months ago, puts the waka waka in George Washington. \nPresented periodically throughout the day, the approximately 10-minute performance takes place outdoors in the square. A (human) town crier in Colonial-era garb speaks and sings an introduction. He is joined by Sam Eagle who appears through a window cutout in the eave above the Hall of Presidents. The uni-browed, earnest, ultra-patriotic character tries to keep the proceedings solemn. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Matt Stroshane, Disney But when Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and The Great Gonzo take their places in the second-story windows of the adjacent Heritage House building, well, all solemnity pretty much goes out the window. Matt Stroshane, Disney Fullscreen The gang performs a rousing \"Great Moments in History\" song. Kermit, in a tricorn hat, assumes the role of Thomas Jefferson. He has to inform Miss Piggy that there is no role for her, since the show is about the Founding Fathers. She inserts herself into the proceedings anyway as \"Queen Georgette.\" Matt Stroshane, Disney Fullscreen Of course, it ends on an earnest, upbeat note with Kermit invoking the true meaning of the founders' call for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Cue the unfurling of the Stars and Stripes. The midnight ride of Paul Revere gets a Muppet makeover in a second show.

Gene Duncan, Disney The Muppets are no strangers to Disney World. They've been bringing their characteristic brand of silliness to Disney's Hollywood Studios for years in Muppet*Vision 3D. Scott Miller, Disney In other Muppets-related news, the Italian restaurant located next to the Muppet*Vision 3D theater has been renamed PizzeRizzo. Matt Stroshane, Disney The diminutive, buck-toothed Rizzo the Rat is the new proprietor of the quick-service eatery, which serves pizza, subs, salads, and treats such as cannolis.
