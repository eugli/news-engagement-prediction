He was Quote: d by the college Thursday as saying: \"I'm so happy. This is what I wanted — to continue in school and row for the crew team. I love OCC.\"\nJoshua Recalde-Martinez, the former president of the Orange Coast College Republicans club who posted the video online, declined to comment Thursday. He said he and O'Neil were waiting to hear from their attorney.\nIn a letter Feb. 9, Victoria Lugo, interim dean of students at OCC, informed O'Neil of his suspension for one \"primary (fall/spring) semester in addition to the summer\" and other disciplinary actions, including that he submit a written apology to Cox and write a three-page essay on why he recorded Cox's class, how he feels about his footage going viral online and his reaction to its causing \"damage to Orange Coast College students, faculty and staff.\"\nOCC spokesman Juan Gutierrez said Thursday that \"all the sanctions are lifted.”\n“The student has been in class during this process and continues to be in class with no interruptions,\" he added.\nO'Neil and attorney William Becker of Freedom X, a Los Angeles-based law firm dedicated to \"protecting conservative and religious freedom of expression,\" held a news conference Feb. 15 outside the college's administration building to discuss the incident.\nO'Neil called Cox \"a good teacher\" but said she \"directly attacked\" conservative students like him.\n\"I was scared I'd have repercussions on my grades because she knew I was a Trump supporter,\" said O'Neil, who later added that he received an A in the class.\nIn his notice of appeal, O'Neil, a Newport Harbor High School alumnus, detailed his account of what happened in class Nov. 15, a week after Trump's election: \"She ... went into how terrible the election was and how our nation had just been attacked. After two minutes of this, I pulled my phone out and started recording because I was terrified that my grade would drop to a B because I had missed the last Tuesday class for the election. ... She then said that we are back to being in a civil war. I felt as if all the eyes in the room were on me because in the past I have worn Trump gear and my signed Trump hat that I had gotten at the Anaheim rally.\"\nIn O'Neil's two-minute video , Cox spoke to her class about Trump and now-Vice President Mike Pence , saying: \"Our nation is divided. We have been assaulted. It's an act of terrorism.\"\nCox, who is gay, referred to Trump as a \"white supremacist\" and to Pence as \"one of the most anti-gay humans in this country.\"\nThe incident attracted national media attention after O'Neil shared his video with the Orange Coast College Republicans.\nIt created a nationwide debate between those who said Cox had academic freedom to express her views in a private setting and those who argued that her statements went too far.\npriscella.vega@latimes.com\nTwitter: @VegaPriscella", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbas.com/jive/prod/lanews/stylesheets/fonts.1q2w3_1477f3b552599ac1d39c4f798c7e232c.min.css", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a50ebb/turbine/tn-dpt-me-occ-student-20170215", "http://www.orangecoastcollege.edu/student_life/deanofstudents/Pages/CCCD-Student-Code-of-Conduct.aspx", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5wUAaIdF6c", "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&division=7.&title=3.&part=48.&chapter=7.&article=1.", "https://d2ne9hs4xtfl62.cloudfront.net/v2/js/subscribe_form.js", "https://twitter.com/vegapriscella"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:58:59.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
