(PTI) \nConnaught Place traders are planning to submit a memorandum to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) asking for more time to complete the formality of getting a structural safety certificate for their respective shops. \n“The NDMC gave us 15 days to complete the process. We will ask for more time for submitting these structural safety certificates,” New Delhi Traders Association president Atul Bhargava told HT. \nThe move came after two incidents of roof collapse in CP’s C and L blocks on February 2 and 10 . On February 14, NDMC asked traders to submit documents, including self declaration by the owners and attestation by the structural engineer that the particular shop space doesn’t deviate from the sanctioned building plan and items on rooftop are there with necessary permission.

We have consulted structural engineers who have said that the whole process will take 40-45 days. So we need more time,” Bhargava said. \nAccording to him, one of the major problems is that the property owners are not allowed to maintain their shops. \n“They have to go through multiple processes. Under the Delhi bylaws 6.4.1, every shopowner can maintain his premises, conduct repairs if required. The NDMC has put a stop to it. They say get clearance from the Heritage Conservation Committee. The committee says matters related to the outside structures only should be referred to them. This process needs to be simplified,” Bhargava said. \nThe NDMC had earlier banned use of rooftops in Connaught Place due to safety concerns after a part of the roof in C block near the popular Jain Book Depot collapsed on February 2.
