Thurston could sit out Premiership Games, Cook steps down as England's test captain \n\"There has definitely been interest from them (French rugby) and for me, it's the timing of it and whether I want to chance my arm at it,\" said Hayne, who suffered a minor knee injury over the weekend at the NRL Nines. \n\"Everything is an option, I don't like to live in narrow vision. \n\"I played rugby when I was growing up. As a kid I did a lot of sports. That's why it pisses me off when everyone carries on when someone changes sports. \n\"As kids, we are encouraged to try every sport we can, so as an adult, why should that change? \n\"That's my stand on things.
