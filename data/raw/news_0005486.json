Credit Scott Olson/Getty Images On Sunday, the chief executive of Expedia Inc. , Dara Khosrowshahi, an Iranian immigrant, sent an email to the company’s employees condemning President Trump’s executive order banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. On Monday, the company — which is based in Bellevue, Wash., and is the world’s largest online travel firm, with more than $72 billion a year in annual bookings across its 30 brands — filed a declaration as part of Washington State’s lawsuit against the president. (Amazon did the same.) Mr. Khosrowshahi said 1,000 Expedia customers were affected by the ban. The state’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, announced the suit earlier that day, making Washington the first state to take action against the executive order. In a news conference, Mr. Ferguson said that he was suing the president over the ban; the lawsuit, which also names the Department of Homeland Security and top Trump administration officials, asks for a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the ban. Expedia’s declaration, filed by the company’s general counsel, Robert Dzielak, outlines the damage the ban could have on the company and on the travel industry as a whole. “Expedia believes that the executive order jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry,” the company said. \nAdvertisement In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Khosrowshahi spoke about the declaration. Edited excerpts are below. Q. How did Expedia get involved with the lawsuit? A. The State of Washington let us know on Sunday that the suit was something they were considering and asked for our support. We are generally not aggressive against issues that do not relate to our company, but this is travel, our soul and spirit, and we felt we had to respond. Honestly, it was not a debate whether we should we be involved. How will a temporary restraining order against the ban, as requested by the State of Washington, help Expedia? The declaration is about helping our employees and the 1,000 or so Expedia travelers who are currently affected by the ban. Internally, the order has raised a fair amount of anxiety among our employees about where they can travel. We are a United States-based company but a global brand, and we have people flying to Asia, Europe and other parts of the world to do their jobs. Also, although we recruit talent from the United States to join Expedia, we also look for talent from around the world, and the ban makes it more difficult to recruit employees from the seven countries that are part of the ban.
