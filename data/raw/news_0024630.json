He laughed at 8:52 and then, at 8:54, he 'screams and startles me'.\nThere were 'weird commercials' at 8:56 — a time when dad clearly took a break from his over-the-top reactions, too.\nHer father seems to have been a Falcons fan, as he was very happy when they were winning and cried at the end of the game\nThen, at 9:21, 'dad fights with dog', at 9:23 'dad does his evil laugh', and at 9:29 he screamed again.\nAt 9:49, when it looked like the Atlanta Falcons were going to win, she noted that 'Dad is the happiest person'.\nBut the game went into overtime at 10:30, and by 10:30, her note simply reads: 'Dad cries'.", "external_links": ["http://i.imgur.com/KZ0pJrv.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-07T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:08:07.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
