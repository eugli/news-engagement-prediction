I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran... I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight, my absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US.   Anousheh Ansari read out a statement on behalf of the absent Asghar Farhadi at the Oscars, following his winning the Best Foreign Film Award \n“Dividing the world into ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. “Filmmakers can turn their cameras to shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various national and religions.

Thankyou.” It was a politically-charged night in general, with several stars, both recipients and presenters, lining up to make their feelings known about the American president and his policies.
