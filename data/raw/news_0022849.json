Her advocacy for privatizing public education could eject students — LGBT or not — from the protection of federal laws.\" \nQueer and gender-nonconforming students face unique circumstances in schools, with increased rates of bullying alongside issues like access to gender-appropriate bathrooms. Guidance issued by the Obama administration protects many of those students — and that's just one of the many things that advocates worry could change under DeVos' leadership. \nA request to the White House for comment on DeVos' confirmation did not receive an immediate response. \nDeVos has maintained that the majority of attacks on her LGBTQ record are inaccurate, and a January New York Times article quoted the general counsel of the Michigan Republican Party as saying that DeVos — serving as the party chairwoman at the time — personally insisted upon appropriate accommodations for transgender call center worker in the late 1990s. \nBut friend to the transgender community or not, DeVos has some work to do, LGBTQ advocacy groups say. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, the education secretary has failed to distance herself from the conservative agendas of groups she has funded in the past. \n\"We continue to call on her to disavow disturbing anti-transgender statements and positions of organizations she has been a major donor to, including statements that transgender people are 'broken' and that transgender people should not be teachers,\" Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement emailed to NBC News. \nIn a tweet on Tuesday, DeVos thanked the Senate for confirming her — painful though it was — to lead the Education Department. \n\"I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary,\" DeVos tweeted. \"Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students. \nFollow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .
