Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control over the peninsula to Ukraine.\" Haley's remarks were notable for the stark difference between her rhetoric and Trump's. On the campaign trail, the President hinted he might recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. And at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, he said it was \"too early\" to discuss sanctions. Haley was speaking at an emergency UN meeting about a sudden upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army forces.

However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.\" \"The sudden increase in fighting in eastern Ukraine has trapped thousands of civilians and destroyed vital infrastructure and the crisis is spreading, endangering many thousands more,\" Haley added. \"This escalation of violence must stop.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:15:19.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
