And Stephen Curry had one of those nights in the Warriors’ 144-98 victory over the Clippers at Oracle Arena. \nMORE: Heat grab seventh straight against Pistons, 116-103 \nThe stage was set for something big – primetime, nationally televised matchup in one of the NBA’s premiere venues – and Curry stepped into the spotlight to say the least. \nAnd at no time was that more evident than at the end of the first half when Stephen Curry knocked down a 51-footer to beat the buzzer. \nThe shot sent Dub Nation into a frenzy, and it turns out Curry was just getting started. Curry shot 9-for-15 from distance, finishing with 43 points despite not playing in the fourth quarter. And oh yeah, he was supposed to be injured, too. Considered questionable with left lateral quad soreness, Curry didn’t show any signs of laboring through any pain. \nBlake Griffin led the Clippers with 20 points and JJ Redick added 13 points for the night.
