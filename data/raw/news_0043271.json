Laura Shedd does, too. \nBoth have lost their hair, but not their humor, on the long slog through cancer. \nBrown could put it on a bumper sticker: \"I went bald and I survived!\" \nShe says that with a laugh and with the perspective that only a serious illness can bring. \n\"A year ago, I didn't have a hair on my head. I didn't realize how important my hair was to me. Then when I didn't have it, I really had to laugh through that,\" she said. \"Really? Hair is this important to me?\" \nShe can laugh now because she's been through the worst of it. Her hair has grown back, and she's finished months of chemo and radiation. But she's here to tell you that laughing throughout the dark days is even more important. \nThe two women discovered that truth with help from Cancer Support Community , an Indianapolis nonprofit that provides free counseling, wellness classes, even a supper club and the kind of camaraderie that might be hard to find elsewhere. \n\"This place has been my laughing and my crying place,\" said Shedd, diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago. But mostly, she said, \"It is a place of joy.\" \nMost people who walk through the doors of the center, 5150 W. 71st St., have already received a cancer diagnosis. \"But here you're not treated as a diagnosis,\" Shedd said. \"You're treated as family, as a friend. We have fun, we laugh.\" \nSo it's no surprise that the organization plans its major fundraiser of the year around comedy. Laughing Matters, featuring former talk show host and comedian Jay Leno, takes the stage at Hilbert Circle Theatre on March 11. Tickets are $49.50 to $89.50 and include a preshow event designed to introduce attendees to Cancer Support Community's free programs. \nBrown, 50, and Shedd, 57, will be there, laughing until they cry, they hope. \n\"In the craziness of cancer, this place lets you release and be crazy and be laughing even though when you walk out the door, it's a little more gray,\" Shedd said. \nEric Richards, president and CEO of the nonprofit, points to a book called \"Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient,\" by Norman Cousins as a guide to the power of humor. \n\"When we're with people, we laugh more,\" he said. \"Whether that be watching a movie together or a Jay Leno show, laughter is a big part of who we are organizationally and what we try to offer.\" \nLora Hayes, executive vice president and a therapist with the organization, said in one of the support groups she leads, a woman brings a joke to each meeting. \n\"What a blessing to be able to laugh together,\" she said. \"When people laugh, their blood pressure goes down, it reduces stress, creates connections and increases your ability to fight cancer because it helps your immune system.\" \nBrown acknowledges that her yearlong cancer journey has not been easy. But she is quick to look at the bright side. \"Look at all of these wonderful people I wouldn't have met if I hadn't been diagnosed.\" \nAnd it turns out there are benefits to being bald and facing death, she said. \n\"I'm comfortable in my own skin.\" Noteworthy \nBlue Breakfast: Coburn Place hosts its annual Blue Breakfast from 7 to 9 a.m. March 1 at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center, 7001 W. 56th St. Tickets are $65 at coburnplace.org/blue-breakfast-tickets .
