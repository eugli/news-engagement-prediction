Residents in the village of Sahaji were trying to escape the fighting as Iraqi forces advance on western Mosul. ISIS is in control of hills between Sahaji and Mosul, Iraq's second city.

Police including rapid response forces have liberated the Hawi al-Jawsaq area, an open agricultural expanse, and are now advancing into al-Jawsaq neighborhood, which sits right next to the Tigris River.

Federal Police elite units are also clearing the remaining pockets of resistance in western Mosul's al-Tayaran neighborhood, just north of the Mosul International Airport runway. Iraqi forces seized control of the airport overnight Thursday. On Sunday, Iraqi forces launched a new bid to retake the western parts of the city after declaring the east had been liberated last month. The International Rescue Committee warned Friday thatthis part of the operationcould be the \"most dangerous phase\" for civilians as Iraqi troops seek to secure densely populated areas amid ISIS resistance. \"This will be a terrifying moment for the 750,000 people still in the west of the city, and there is a real danger that the battle will be raging around them for weeks and possibly months to come,\" said Jason Kajer, the Iraq acting country director for the humanitarian group. \"Everything must be done to keep civilians out of the firing line, and as Iraqi forces reach individual neighborhoods, people must be given the opportunity to escape the city safely.\" CNN's Kareem Khadder and Ingrid Formanek reported from Irbil, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.
