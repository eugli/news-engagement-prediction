His remarks came at a discussion on Bangladesh-Canada relations, marking the 45 years of diplomatic ties. \nEconomic Affairs Adviser to the Prime Minister Mashiur Rahman, Canadian High Commissioner Benoit-Pierre Laramee and Executive Director for South Asia of Global Affairs Canada Robert McDougall, also a former Ottowa envoy in Dhaka, were also present. Chowdhury, a death row convict in the Bangabandhu assassination case, is now a fugitive in Canada. Dhaka has requested Ottowa on several occasions to extradite him, but it was turned down citing legal issues. The Canadian legal system does not allow the deportation of any foreign citizen who might face the death penalty in his home country. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, after her last year’s visit to Canada, said the country agreed to discuss the issue with Bangladesh. Noor Chowdhury Canada was one of the first Western countries to recognise Bangladesh soon after its birth. Diplomatic relations were established on Feb 14 in 1972. The then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau had supported Bangladesh’s War of Independence. Hasina, during her visit last year conferred the 'Friends of Liberation War Honour' award to him posthumously which was handed over to his son, Justin Trudeau, who is now the Canadian prime minister.\nShahriar said the 2016 visit had generated a “new thrust” in Bangladesh-Canada relations, and hoped that it would reach “a much elevated level” in coming days. \nThe two-way trade crossed $2 billion last year which is dominated by Bangladesh’s duty-free exports of readymade clothes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:15:33.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
