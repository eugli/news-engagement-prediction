First he leads an unconstitutional effort to lead California out of the US through Calexit. Then he acts with depraved indifference towards the 2 million people living between the Oroville Dam and Sacramento. Brown has 25 billion dollars to spend on programs benefiting illegal aliens, but he has no money to spend on a dam that had identified very serious issues as long 12 years ago. Brown has the money to open a Calexit embassy in Russia, but has no money to evacuate 2 million people in harms way, even as a precaution. Why is Brown avoiding the media? Why did Brown’s Department of Water Services rescind the original evacuation order, yet offer no evidence as to why this was done? Why hasn’t Brown offered help and provide money to facilitate repairs on the levees in S. Sacramento that have already led to some evacuations?\nThe National Weather Service\nShould there be a sense of urgency with “5-7 inches of rain” being forecasted in the next 48 hours for the Oroville area by the National Weather Service? Why isn’t the silent Governor-in-hiding, Jerry Brown, who has seized control of the situation as well as the media press releases, paying at least some attention to the National Weather Service forecast and issuing his own risk assessment statements in conjunction with the weather report and then moving to protect the potential victims?\nWith 2 million lives at risk, it is surprising that the National Weather Service (NWS) would not make this the LEAD STORY, especially since they acknowledge that they are “concerned” about the Oroville Dam, but presented this concern, as the readers just witnessed, as an after-thought.\nRegardless, of where the NWS placed this weather report in their broadcast, shouldn’t this be enough evidence that the region should be evacuated as a precaution? (Author’s note: Please note that the recorded forecast will undoubtedly update – however, I don’t see the situation changing as originally reported by the NWS).\nOther Dams In No Cal In light of the attention that the Oroville Dam situation has brought into the public view, several other dams in Northern California are at risk as well. The most prominent dam that could be joining the Oroville Dam on the endangered list is Mt. Shasta.\nAccording to the Sacramento Bee , the state’s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta, is also approaching its capacity. Lake Shasta has reached a very dangerous level of 95% of capacity and is presently releasing maximum water outflows just prior to the present series of storms which are ripping through the area. Subsequently, this situation is out of control and virtually, the entire Northern region of California is in grave danger.\nMaps Demonstrating the Growing Risk to ALL of No. Cal\nTo Better Assess the Potential Damage if Oroville and Shasta Fail, Find both on the Map.\nIf the Oroville Dam fails, it is open season on Sacramento. And with the already failed levees and present level of flooding, the results would be catastrophic.\nShasta Dam\nIf the Shasta Dam fails, the I-5 Corridor will cease to exist.\nFor future reference, please note that the Shasta Dam, among other rivers, flows into the Sacramento River.\nIf the Oroville Dam breaks it will wipe out Sacramento. The same is true for Redding if the Shasta Dam fails.\nIf Shasta and Oroville Dams Both Fail, the Entire Central Valley of California Will Cease to Exist with Regard to Human Activity\nIn 2008, a risk assessment looked at what would happen if there was a breach in Shasta Dam. The result would devastate the entire northern Central Valley. “The Sacramento River and its tributaries would overtop levees and banks. Massive flooding in the low lands and along the river route would occur to about Knights Landing where it would lose momentum.”\nThe same assessment projected a similar fate for the rest of the Central Valley if the Oroville Dam failed. the rest of the Central Valley would be devastated.\nHow far south will the flood waters go? I am not sure. But I do know that the flood from Shasta and the flood from Oroville, should they occur in the same time frame, would meet in S. Sacramento where the levees are already failing, courtesy of Gov. Brown’s neglect.\nWe will know more by mid-week. Let’s hope Northern California gets a reprieve in the weather forecast and the workers are able to save the Oroville Dam.\nIn case you missed my interview with No Cal radio personality, Paul Preston, you will want to listen as it provides a lot of contextual material for this report.\nP lease Donate to The Common Sense Show\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND DON’T FORGET TO “LIKE” US\nThis is the absolute best in food storage.
