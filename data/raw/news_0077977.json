We’ve always been big believers in the newspaper,” his wife Paula Douglas said, adding: “People always ask me, ‘How do you know that?’ I say, I read the paper.\".\nRelated:\nHow a right-wing Ferndale fringe group is building a multimedia empire\nTrump again calls media 'enemy of the people'\nPaula Douglas said she is a color consultant to paint stores and her husband works for one of the car makers, so neither is directly involved with the media. But she has faith and trust in media reporting, especially by reporters for traditional newspapers and their websites, Douglas said.\n“You guys brought down (Sen. Joseph) McCarthy, you brought down Nixon, you’ll bring down Trump too,” she said.\nPresident Donald Trump has used various phrases to describe the media including \"fake news,\" the \"opposition party\" and the \"enemy of the people.\"\nThe Douglases shot photos and videos of the event and sent them to the Detroit Free Press on Sunday as the demonstration was taking place. Many attendees to the rally carried signs and some passing motorists honked.\n“We welcome anybody who, regardless of their political persuasion, supports a free press,” Robert Huschka, executive editor of the Detroit Free Press, said after the rally. “It’s a foundation of our democracy.”\nInformation about the rally was posted on the Metro-Detroit Political Action Network Facebook page. It was billed as \"Emergency Rally: Protect the truth.\" The group states it is a non-profit organization of volunteers that promotes solidarity, humanity and well-being for all people in the metro Detroit area.\nSteve and Nancy Wildern of Grosse Pointe Park attended, with Nancy Wildern holding a handmade sign that stated: \"A free press supports democracy!! 1st Amendment right.\"\n\"There was a sense of alarm and has been for weeks about the treatment of the legitimate press,\" she said. \"When some of the major media outlets were shut out of the press briefing, that really sent up a flare.\"\nEditorial:\nDonald Trump's latest step toward tyranny\nThe Wilderns, who are Democrats, said they learned of the rally through a town hall meeting in Bloomfield Hills. Another mention at the town hall meeting, Nancy Wildern said, was to subscribe. Nancy Wildern said the couple again started up its subscription to the Detroit Free Press and the New York Times and are considering a subscription to the Washington Post.\n\"We feel that these are the places we're going to get the truth, where we're going to get that kind of ... investigative journalism that will be lost if it becomes a free-for-all of opinions,\" she said.\nSteve Wildern added: \"I think they're trying to isolate the legitimate investigative reporting. I think they scream fake news because they're afraid of real news.\"\nOn Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer barred the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed, Politico, BBC and CNN, among others, from a scheduled media briefing. Representatives of other media outlets were admitted in addition to Breitbart, Washington Times and One America News.\nBuy Photo Nancy Wildern of Grosse Pointe Park holds a sign she brought to a rally Feb. 26, 2017 for a free press outside the Sterling Heights plant where the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News are printed.
