Source: Perform O'Keefe bags 12 as Aussies demolish India \nIndia are famous for preparing 'minefield' pitches to suit their world-class spinners, but this time it backfired spectacularly. \nLed by left-arm off-spinner Steve O'Keefe's record haul of 12 wickets, the Aussies recorded their first win in India since 2004. O'Keefe ripped through India. Source: Twitter \nA staff member of the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium (MCA) has claimed the ground staff were ordered to prepare a \"rank turner\" by team management. \n\"When the MCA refused...the senior member of the team management took the issue to the state association curator Pandurang Salgaoncar,\" the MCA member told the Indian Express. The Aussies examine the pitch before play. Image: Twitter \n\"When he too resisted, the matter was placed before the BCCI curators (Parsana and Daljit), but even they were a tad reluctant. Then, the BCCI management (not the Committee of Administrators, the cricket board employees) came into the picture. \n\"The ground staff had been ordered to remove the grass completely. Things were hijacked from the local curators.\" Close Smith hails 'greatest win in Aussie history' UP NEXT VIDEO Smith hails 'greatest win in Aussie history'.

It'll be interesting to see what they come up with in Bangalore,\" Smith said after Australia took a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series. \n\"It was certainly a wicket that was probably more likely to suit the Indian players. I think it evened up the contest a lot more. Image: Instagram \n\"We saw the way our spinners bowled on that, they were able to generate some good spin and natural variation.\" \nWarne shared similar sentiments on broadcaster Star Sports. \n\"We know India prepare those pitches that turn,\" he said. \n\"But if they take it too much, suddenly it becomes even for both sides.

We just didn't play good cricket,\" India's skipper said. \n\"They exploited it better than us.
