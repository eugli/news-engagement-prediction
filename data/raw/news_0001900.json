But the Terps might not have won without him. (Don Markus) \nJunior center Michal Cekovsky, subbing in for Dodd, helped alter a shot at one end by Ohio State center Trevor Thompson, then beat Thompson down the court for a dunk off a feed from Trimble. \nThe Buckeyes wouldn’t go away. Trailing by one with the ball, junior guard Kam Williams (Mount St. Joseph) drove the lane, but Dodd blocked him emphatically. It led to a breakaway dunk by Huerter with a little over three minutes left. \nJackson picked up where he left off Saturday at Minnesota. He made his first five shots, including three 3-pointers, to help the Terps get off to a better start against the Buckeyes than they did against the Golden Gophers. \nAfter taking an early 15-10 lead on Jackson’s second 3-pointer, Maryland cooled off and got a bit sloppy, specifically Trimble. Three straight turnovers, two by Trimble, allowed Ohio State to take its first lead, 16-15, on a layup Williams. \nThe lead changed seven times and the score was tied twice in the next 10 minutes. A 3-pointer by junior guard Jared Nickens, who also converted a 4-point play two possessions early, pushed Maryland ahead 38-36. \nA layup by freshman guard Anthony Cowan made it a four-point lead for the Terps. Tate, who led the Buckeyes with 13 points in the first half, missed the front end of a one-and-one with 35.4 seconds left. \nJackson finally missed in the closing seconds on a corner 3-pointer, but redshirt sophomore forward Ivan Bender got position on Tate and was fouled while grabbing an offensive rebound. He made both ends of a one-and-one with 2.9 seconds left to make it 42-36. \nMaryland finished the first half shooting 14-of-30 from the field, including 7-of-16 on 3-pointers. Jackson had 13 points; Cowan added eight points and three assists. Trimble had just two points, with three assists and three turnovers. \nFor all the talk this season about the Terps being a terrific come-from-behind team in the second half, they have also been great front runners. Maryland went into Tuesday’s game 12-0 when leading at halftime. \ndon.markus@baltsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:25:18.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
