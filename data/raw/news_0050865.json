Now, very few, John McCain to his credit, but very few have had the courage to oppose him even though they know he’s doing a lot of things that are against what America is all about.”\nHe added, “My prediction is, if he keeps on this path, which is likely, I don’t think he will change, within three, four months, you’ll see a whole lot of Republicans breaking with him. That’s the salvage of America. That’s the hope of America.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n Chuck Schumer , Donald Trump", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/pamkeyNEN", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchuck-schumer-the-hope-of-america-is-republicans-break-with-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Chuck+Schumer%3A+%E2%80%98Hope+of+America%E2%80%99+Is+Republicans+Break+With+Trump", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchuck-schumer-the-hope-of-america-is-republicans-break-with-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Chuck+Schumer%3A+%E2%80%98Hope+of+America%E2%80%99+Is+Republicans+Break+With+Trump", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchuck-schumer-the-hope-of-america-is-republicans-break-with-trump%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Chuck+Schumer%3A+%E2%80%98Hope+of+America%E2%80%99+Is+Republicans+Break+With+Trump&shortener=bitly"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:13:50.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
