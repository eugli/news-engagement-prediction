(PTI) \nNarendra Modi is perhaps the first Prime Minister who is not respectful of his predecessors, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday. \nGandhi’s comments at an election rally in Uttarakhand came a day after Modi took a jibe at his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, over corruption scandals in the previous UPA regime. \n“...He should learn (how to treat former PMs),” Gandhi said in Sitarganj. “Whatever it is, Manmohan Singh was an elected Prime Minister. He was the prime minister of the country.” \nModi said on Wednesday that Singh’s image remained clean even though many scams took place in the country.

He wants to be in news. It seems if he is now in news for a single day, he loses sleep,” news agency ANI quoted Gandhi as saying. \nAfter Modi’s remarks in the Upper House, Gandhi had posted on Twitter that the events in Parliament were shameful. \nHe tweeted that when a “Prime Minister reduces himself to ridiculing his predecessor-years his senior, he hurts the dignity of the parliament & the nation”. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:40.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
