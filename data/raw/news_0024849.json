[sic] Awkward: Charlotte's fans went wild over the snap as they wondered whether or not she could have edited the image A third wrote: '@charlottegshore Photoshop gone wrong,' while another said: 'Photoshop. Skirting board LOL.' Yet some defended her saying there was a more reasonable explanation for the way the picture looked. One said: 'There's no photoshop there's a cut out in the wall, behind her there will be a corner.' That makes sense: Charlotte later shared an explanatory video saying what had caused the wonky skirting board She said 'For all those saying it's an epic photoshop fail, it does look weird, because it's a corner,' as she stepped to one side She repeated: 'It's a corner, a corner,' as she continued to demonstrate That solves it then: No doubt the video put everyone in their place as Charlotte showed them what was what Not having it: Charlotte hit back again on social media to deny she had used photoshop and pointed them in the way of her recent explanatory video Another said: 'there isn't any photoshop' A third wrote that regardless, she looked incredible: 'I admire your workout motivation and wish to replicate it.' Charlotte later posted a video of herself standing in front of the exact same spot of wall to prove the skirting board was wonky because it was a corner and not because of photoshop. She also posted a rather angry comment on the social media site, criticising those who suggested she had photoshopped. Just pals? Charlotte has been recently linked to cheeky chappie Stephen Bear, although he has denied this She wrote: 'Every1 who said photoshop fail are thick . Look at my recent video you saddos.' The snap comes just days after Stephen Bear continued to deny rumours that he's dating Charlotte, despite admitting she is 'funny, witty, clever and gorgeous'. The Ex On The Beach star, 27, claimed that they weren't together because of timing, but couldn't resist cheekily quipping that she was pregnant with his child. Not a thing? Stephen Bear is still continuing to deny rumours that he's dating Charlotte, despite admitting she is 'funny, witty, clever and gorgeous' Water baby: Charlotte took to social media to share a video of herself in the shower Bugs bunny: The reality star played around with her favourite filter Daring to bare: Charlotte updated her fans about her personal hygiene The CBB star told OK! Magazine : 'Charlotte ticks a lot of my boxes – she's funny, witty, clever, she's got all the right attributes. 'But as I'm filming Celebs Go Dating it's a case of right girl, wrong time. But who knows what will happen in the future.' Making light of the situation, he then joked: 'She's pregnant with my baby!' Stephen insisted he's single as he prepares to appear on dating show Celebs Go Dating, but added that after the series he would ask Charlotte out as she's 'gorgeous'. It comes as Charlotte packed on the PDA with her rumoured boyfriend at the MTV Brand New gig at Camden's Electric Ballroom last Friday night. Cheeky! The pair seemed to take their rumoured romance to the next level, as they were pictured giggling and cuddling in bed on Snapchat last week Speculation: Charlotte hid under the covers with just her hand visible clutching her phone in the video The pair have been linked romantically for months, but appeared to confirm their relationship earlier this week by sporting matching 'His and Hers' jumpers - which Bear was still sporting in Camden. An insider told The Sun : 'Bear and Charlotte have been snogging loads on set for Just Tattoo Of Us and have hardly kept it a secret to the crew. 'It's clear they are besotted with each other.' However, with Bear set to appear on Celebs Go Dating, his rumoured romance with Charlotte throws a spanner in the works. A source said: 'Bear is doing Celebs Go Dating which puts him in an awkward position to be in a relationship. More than friends? They grey close while filming MTV show Just Tattoo Of Us 'This is why they’ve been keeping things under wraps as much as possible in public, even though it’s clear they are together and have strong feelings for each other.' And last week Charlotte and Stephen seemed to take their romance to the next level, as they were captured giggling and cuddling in bed. Stephen sent the romance rumour mill into overdrive as he larked around with the Geordie Shore star in a steamy Snapchat video - but deleted the clip minutes later. In the racy video, Stephen seemed to be topless as he got cosy with a laughing Charlotte, who hid under the covers. The pair seemed suddenly shy as they tried to conceal themselves under the duvet. Rumour has it: Stephen sent the romance rumour mill into overdrive as he frolicked with the Geordie Shore star in a steamy Snapchat video - but deleted the clip minutes later Steal Charlotte's casual style in a T-shirt from Topshop £15 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:29:33.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
