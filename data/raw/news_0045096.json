(ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nWhen asked about how distressed the birds got, Mr Leishman said: \"It obviously has some stress, no doubt. \n\"Who wants to be caught in a big net and have what's like a big gold ring put around their finger?\" \nHe later added that he had not noticed any long-term effects in the birds after catching the same ones on subsequent occasions. Recording the data \nMost of the birds caught already have bands on their legs and have hand-written record cards which Mr Leishman stores in old metal drawers in the back of his van. \n\"Well there were no computers when I started,\" he laughed. \n\"It is much easier with cards ... I'll enter the information into the computer later when I get home.\" Photo: A white-browed scrubwren has its beak-to-head measurements taken. (ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nJoining Mr Leishman this week were PhD students Vicky Austen and Corey Callaghan, who along with wildlife ecologist John Martin caught and recorded 22 birds. \nFor each one they identified the species, recorded any visible features, then measured the bird's weight, wing span, tail and head-to-beak length before letting it go. \nAmong the captures were a few superb fairy-wrens, white-browed scrub wrens, a grey fantail, an eastern yellow robin, a bell miner and a red-browed firetail. \nThe smallest of them, a brown thornbill, weighed just six grams. \nThe team was most excited though with an unbanded 38-gram azure kingfisher. \nIt was only the second kingfisher Mr Leishman had seen in his 30-odd years of work. \n\"There is a level of pleasure when you've found that birds are still there. \nSo far, Mr Leishman has captured thousands of birds and recorded more than 180 species in the gardens. Tracking changes \nMr Leishman has honed his talent for recognising bird calls and the ability to spot the tiniest of wings in the tree canopy. \nBut he has also witnessed first hand significant changes to the diversity of birds as a result of residential and industrial development and the effects of climate change.

(ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nIn his 30 years at Mount Annan, Mr Leishman has seen rainfall decline, land clearing, habitat modification and the botanic gardens slowly \"closed in\" by the construction of the neighbouring M5 and surrounding housing estates. \nDr Martin said researchers were working hard to stop the garden becoming \"an island\", which would severely reduce cross pollination and the migration of animals, including three species of kangaroo in the area that frequently move along the green corridor between between Mount Annan and the Nepean River. \nMr Leishman's 30-year records, which he has started writing up into a scientific paper, are vital in the understanding and monitoring of bird populations in the area. \nOne of the most notable changes has been silvereye birds which have significantly declined in numbers across the Cumberland Plains, partly due to the growth of African olive — an exotic noxious weed food source.

(ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nOther species though have been driven out by newcomers like the bell miners which only started appearing in the Mount Annan gardens in 2011. \n\"In my lifetime, they've been dispersing from the Nepean, to Revesby and Scheyville National Park,\" Mr Leishman said. \n\"They're common right down the coast, but they're not a good thing. \n\"Like the noisy miners they're an aggressive bird; they feed on insects and they drive the honeyeaters out.\" \nSome populations like superb fairy-wrens have remained steady given their ability to \"fit in with human habitation\", Mr Leishman said. \nWhile checking the nets, Mr Leishman fondly recalled one of the oldest birds he encountered — a yellow thornbill that weighed about seven grams and which he caught multiple times over 16 years. \n\"Most yellow thornbills from hatching period, probably only live for three months,\" he said. \n\"Most birds have a very short lifespan, but there are a number of individuals, once they know the area, they are able to live for a fairly long period of time.\" Handing over to the next generation \nAt 76, Mr Leishman said he had no plans to hang up his binoculars or his nets anytime soon, although he does hope to pass on his knowledge to someone willing to dedicate themselves to bird banding at Mount Annan for another few decades. \n\"Thirty years seems a reasonable amount of time and I would hope that someone may come back and look at [the data] and do some comparisons,\" he said. \n\"I don't think the prognosis is good, I think we'll have some big changes in the bird population. \n\"We have some critically endangered birds in Australia, and at what point do we do something about it? \n\"You leave it too long and you won't have enough birds to work with and enough diversity to work with.\" \nThat comment proved unintentionally ironic at noon when the team packed up the nets and the tools and headed to lunch. \nAs he reviewed the list of birds, Mr Leishman appeared slightly disappointed. \n\"You get your good days and your bad days,\" he said. \n\"Twenty-two is below average.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:15:06.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
