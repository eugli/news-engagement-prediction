Shaquille O’Neal’s war of words with Golden State Warriors center JaVale McGee appears to be over, and it sounds like the peacemaker was Shaq’s mom. \n“Just say Shaq’s mom called him, told him, ‘Stop this silliness. Leave him alone.’ So that’s the end of the beef,” O’Neal told The Undefeated . “You won’t be hearing about it from my side anymore. Mama has spoken.” \nThe feud blew up last week, when O’Neal yet again made McGee the focus of his popular TNT blooper reel “Shaqtin’ The Fool.” McGee and Shaq went back and forth on Twitter, and some of McGee’s teammates – including Kevin Durant – and Warriors coach Steve Kerr stood up for the backup center. The Warriors reportedly asked TNT to address the situation with O’Neal. \nBut it looks like all that was needed was O’Neal’s mom – Lucille O’Neal – to intervene. \n“It’s not funny anymore, seeing the things they’re saying to each other,” Lucille said. “They need to squash this and move on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:53:39.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
