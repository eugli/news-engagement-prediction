Credit Monica Almeida   Lin-Manuel Miranda might earn EGOT status someday, but he was denied his chance on Sunday. Just 12 people have completed the sweep of winning an Emmy, Grammy , Oscar and Tony. Mr. Miranda, nominated in the best original song category for “How Far I’ll Go” from “Moana,” had the chance to fill in his missing Oscar. No such luck. “City of Stars” from “La La Land” took the prize. Had he won, Mr., Miranda, 37, would have been the youngest to complete the four-part collection. He has three Tony awards , not to mention the many others his musicals have earned. He has two Grammys for the staff recordings of “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” and won an Emmy for the music and lyrics at the 2013 Tony award show. With his Pulitzer Prize for “Hamilton,” he would have become just the third person to win the so-called PEGOT, joining the composers Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch. While Mr. Miranda made no progress toward the EGOT, Viola Davis moved a step closer to it on Sunday with her win for best supporting actress. She lacks a Grammy, but became the 23rd person to win an Oscar, Emmy and Tony.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:11:35.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
