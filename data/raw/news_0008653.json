Trump also hung up on the one hour call, 25 minutes in. \nSeems familiar. \nImage: fox \nThe U.S. president castigated Turnbull's plan (agreed upon during the Obama administration) to transfer refugees from Australia's detention centres to America, which he apparently called it \"the worst deal ever\" and stating that it was akin to exporting \"the next Boston Bombers\" to America. TURNBULL:President Trump may i congratulate you on - TRUMP: We'd like to proceed with the refugee dealTRUMP: \n— Colley (@JamColley) February 2, 2017 \nThe details of the phone call are a staggering revelation, considering the U.S. and Australia are extremely close allies. Australia's military has fought as an ally alongside the U.S. in numerous conflicts, and shares intelligence with the government as part of the \"Five Eyes\" program. Australia is also home to a number of military bases with stationed troops. \nWhat's going to happen to the two countries and their friendship? Is Australia going to have to eat lunch sitting in a toilet cubicle because she's not wearing pink? \nWill Americans boycott Australia's finest food export, the Bloomin' Onion from Outback Steakhouse? \nOr will our newfound frienemie status simply mean Australians will stop being asked to put \"shrimp on the barbie?\" \nJokes aside, Turnbull told a press conference on Thursday morning that the relationship between the two countries is \"very strong.\" \nHowever, he didn't deny any aspects of the report. But we get it, why would you admit you'd been humiliated? \nJust like the blossoming yet shallow friendship between mean girls, it seems relations between the U.S. and Australia aren't as bankable as they were when we were all in grade school. And that's a scary thought. I made a Top 100 Possible Trump Administration Foreign Crises list & I gotta admit \"Rupturing US-Australia Relations\" was NOT on there. \n— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 2, 2017 Who'd have thought it was possible to blow the US-Australia relationship? It's childproof. But not Trumpproof. https://t.co/r2rOtESKRV ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:30:27.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
