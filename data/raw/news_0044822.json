Jones , USA TODAY 9:32 a.m. ET Feb. 21, 2017 7 Shares \nYour first celebrity beef of 2017. Yes, really. (Photo: AP/Wireimage) \nSay Goodbye to that Chris Brown-Soulja Boy matchup. \nThe artists exchanged fighting words on Twitter last month, with Brown deciding he was done with the #TwitterFingers and calling for a hands-on boxing match, a push that proved irresistible to heavyweights like Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield as well as petty-weights like Floyd Mayweather and rapper/actor/producer 50 Cent. \nBut, according to Soulja, Brown is now dodging the highly-anticipated bout. The rapper took to Twitter Monday to insult Brown and inform his followers that the singer declined to sign off on the fight. \"Chris brown manager (called) my manager last night (and) said the fight is off and he's not signing (the) contract,\" he wrote . \"Don't ask me about the (expletive) no more.\" \nFans can, however, ask him about his mixtape, Big Soulja , which debuted the same day the rapper revealed the fight was canceled. \nA coincidence or heavy-hitting PR? You be the judge.
