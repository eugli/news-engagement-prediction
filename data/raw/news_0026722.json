They totally suck. And I'll take Steve Miller on my team over u any day. https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017 \nJoe maybe it's time we start talking about who you really are. What do you think? https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017 \nSteve Miller works 18 hour days serving the country and the @POTUS What do you do? Basically talk to yourself & @morningmika Nobody watches! https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017 \nHannity's tweets didn't blunt Scarborough's criticism of the Trump adviser. \nDuring his show on Tuesday, Scarborough characterized the comments as \" horrendous ,\" and speculated that Trump would be impeached if he failed to respect court rulings. \n\"You really need to go back and read the Constitution,\" Scarborough said . \"And seriously, the White House has got to stop embarrassing themselves by putting this guy on.\" \n\"If that sort of thinking were enacted into policy, we would have impeachment proceedings in the next six months. Donald Trump would be impeached if they did not adhere to...what the courts were saying,\" he added. \nDespite Hannity's pronouncement as a show that no one watches, both television anchors are important figures in Trump's media orbit. \nWhile Hannity's unwavering support for Trump yielded him access on the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump often tunes in to \"Morning Joe,\" and occasionally fires off tweets about the show's topics. His viewership has become so well known that policymakers and advertisers have taken to addressing the president directly on the show's airwaves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:25:37.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
