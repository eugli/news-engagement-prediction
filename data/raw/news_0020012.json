Roy Cooper (D), according to a temporary restraining order that a three-judge panel released on Wednesday. \nFormer North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed House Bill 17 after it was introduced by Republican lawmakers in December. \nThe law requires that Cooper’s Cabinet picks be approved by the state’s GOP-controlled Senate. It also prevents Cooper from appointing anyone to the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees or the state Board of Education. \n“We need to put these partisan confirmation games behind us and get on with repealing HB2, raising teacher pay and getting better jobs for North Carolinians,” Cooper said in a statement Wednesday. “The court is absolutely correct in their decision and should not be intimidated by threats from legislative leaders.” \nCooper said in December that he was willing to sue Republicans over those bills . \n“They will see me in court,” he said during a press conference. “And they don’t have a very good track record there.” Related...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:03:47.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
