Kolff ferry with all its riders down into a watery grave on November 22, 1963. Because this was the very same day that President John F. Kennedy was killed , this horrifying incident didnâ€™t get the attention it deserved. \nThis oversight would be absolutely tragic, if it were only true. The story is actually part of an elaborate prank by Staten Island resident Joe Reginella of Toxic Teddies , who built a mysterious memorial to the memory of the poor ferrying souls lost that day. \nThis is an animation which I created as part of my semester abroad at the University of Salford. Thanks for the inspiration Joe Reginella! \nThe video Straub used as her source.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:34:43.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
