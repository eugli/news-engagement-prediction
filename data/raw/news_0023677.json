The £60million witch-hunt against British veterans of Iraq is to be scrapped. The ‘poisonous lies’ peddled against them by legal parasites will come to an end, the Defence Secretary declared last night Michael Fallon said the Iraq Historic Allegations Team, which once had 3,600 claims on its books, will have its caseload slashed to just 20 The move ends a nightmare decade for troops accused of misconduct. And it represents a major victory for the Daily Mail, which has campaigned for Ihat to be reined in. Writing in this newspaper today Sir Michael: Savages Phil Shiner, the human rights lawyer struck off over his ‘tank-chasing’ tactics Vows to end the ‘slew of claims’ brought against Afghan veterans Reveals he is planning to protect soldiers from being hounded in future Pledges to examine potential injustices against troops who served during Northern Ireland’s Troubles The news was welcomed by the Chief of the General Staff, Sir Nicholas Carter. He said: ‘A significant number of claims made against our soldiers have not been credible’ The announcement was welcomed last night by the Chief of the General Staff. Sir Nicholas Carter said ‘a significant number of claims made against our soldiers have not been credible’. The taxpayer-funded Ihat inquiry was set up in order to ensure that allegations of misconduct against British soldiers were dealt with in the UK rather than being pursued at the International Criminal Court. But it has been mired in controversy after ‘tank-chasing’ lawyers deluged it with vexatious claims. Despite a 145-strong team investigating the cases for nearly seven years, there has not been one prosecution Sir Michael writes: ‘We are now close to putting behind us most of the poisonous lies which have plagued our armed forces over the past decade.’ Remaining Ihat cases will be cut to include only those based on credible allegations. Thought to number about 20, they will be handed over to military police, saving taxpayers millions. Most will be dealt with by next year. The vast majority of Afghan cases being investigated by Operation Northmoor will also be thrown out. A defence committee report, which was rushed out yesterday, said Ihat had become a seemingly ‘unstoppable self-perpetuating machine, deaf to the concerns of the armed forces, blind to their needs, and profligate with its own resources’. The unit was handed 3,668 allegations of murder, torture and wrongdoing by British troops since 2010, when it was set up. The vast majority were from the now defunct firm Public Interest Lawyers, led by disgraced lawyer Mr Shiner. Despite a 145-strong team investigating the cases for nearly seven years, there has not been one prosecution. But hundreds of soldiers – many suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and who have already been cleared by military police – were hounded relentlessly. Sir Michael says Mr Shiner was able to ‘exploit vulnerabilities in our legal system’, exacerbated by EU court rulings and ‘fuelled by legal aid intended for genuine causes’. Ihat was originally due to finish its work at the end of 2019 – to the tune of £57million –but will now all but wrap up this year. Sir Michael and the Justice Secretary Liz Truss are pressing ahead with further measures to deal with the problem of abuse allegations ‘once and for all’ Sir Michael will also wind up Operation Northmoor, which is examining 675 allegations of abuse in Afghanistan. Many of those claims come from human rights firm Leigh Day, which faces a disciplinary tribunal later this year. Sir Michael and the Justice Secretary Liz Truss are pressing ahead with further measures to deal with the problem of abuse allegations ‘once and for all’. The Government announced last year that the UK would derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights when it comes to future wars to stop lawyers mounting ‘industrial-scale’ claims. Sir Michael Fallon said: ‘We will tackle this serious imbalance and ensure a fair, balanced and proportionate approach to investigating the past’ But Sir Michael says other measures would be put in place to protect veterans. Addressing mounting claims against veterans – many in their 60s and 70s – who served in Northern Ireland, the Defence Secretary says many served with ‘great bravery and distinction’. He says it is ‘wrong’ that historic investigations into Army killings during the Troubles have almost entirely focused on them rather than terrorists. Some 90 per cent of the killings are thought to have been committed by terrorists. ‘We will tackle this serious imbalance and ensure a fair, balanced and proportionate approach to investigating the past’ he adds. Last month the Mail revealed that ministers were pushing for a bill that would put an age cap on suspects and force police to treat historic cases from Northern Ireland with ‘proportionality’. Under the proposals, there would be an upper age limit on those who could be investigated, a five-year time limit on how long an inquiry can last, and a limit on maximum sentences for anyone found guilty. Discredited probe into British soldier abuse claims 'directly harmed the defence of our nation', say MPs The body set up to investigate claims that British soldiers abused Iraqis – and the resulting explosion of litigation or ‘lawfare’ – have ‘directly harmed the defence of our nation’, senior MPs said yesterday. A group of cross-party politicians said the Iraq Historical Allegations Team was ‘unfit for purpose’ and threatened to hinder the ability of soldiers to defend the country. A scathing report by the Commons Defence Select Committee, published hours before Sir Michael Fallon announced that Ihat would close, found a catalogue of disturbing failings. The body set up to investigate claims that British soldiers abused Iraqis – and the resulting explosion of litigation or ‘lawfare’ – have ‘directly harmed the defence of our nation’, senior MPs said yesterday The report said Ihat ‘has become a seemingly unstoppable, self-perpetuating machine and one which has proved to be deaf to the concerns of the armed forces, blind to their needs, and profligate with its own resources’. The Mail has revealed how ex-detectives working for Ihat have turned up, out of the blue, at the doors of soldiers and quizzed them and their families about their role in incidents a decade ago. In one case a British soldier was threatened with arrest at his military base. Following a Mail campaign to end the witch-hunt, MPs began the inquiry. A group of cross-party politicians said the Iraq Historical Allegations Team was ‘unfit for purpose’ and threatened to hinder the ability of soldiers to defend the country Yesterday the committee concluded that Ihat had ‘lost the confidence’ of service personnel, MPs and the wider public. The report added: ‘Ihat, and the subsequent explosion of so-called “lawfare” in the United Kingdom, has directly harmed the defence of our nation. Unless the MoD learns the lessons of Ihat, the armed forces will be hindered in their ability to defend the nation and the national interest.’ It said that while the cost to the taxpayer had been significant, the ‘psychological and actual cost to the individual soldiers is arguably greater’. ‘Their lives have been put on hold and their careers damaged, sometimes for years, because of allegations made against them – in many cases without any credible supporting evidence. Yesterday the committee concluded that Ihat had ‘lost the confidence’ of service personnel, MPs and the wider public ‘The effects of this on the British military are profound and enduring’, the report said. MPs found the process was ‘eroding the bonds of trust between those who serve, and their civilian masters’. This newspaper revealed how an Iraqi agent, named Abu Jamal, was being paid £40,000 a year by Ihat as he drummed up cases against British troops for law firms. The agent – whose son told the Mail that he had handed over 1,000 claims of wrongdoing by troops to law firms – was subsequently sacked. The report concluded: ‘Although the MoD told us that it had stopped payments when it became aware of this, the fact that it continued for such a lengthy period of time represents a serious failing for which the MoD must take responsibility.’ Johnny Mercer MP, chairman of the sub-Committee inquiry, said: ‘Throughout this process there has been an almost total disregard of the welfare of soldiers and their families MPs said that legal firms were ‘empowered’ by the Ministry’s approach to Ihat. It also attacked the use of ‘intimidatory tactics’ by Ihat contractors. The report said the use of covert surveillance was ‘deeply disturbing’. Johnny Mercer MP, chairman of the sub-Committee inquiry, said: ‘Throughout this process there has been an almost total disregard of the welfare of soldiers and their families. ‘The MoD must take the responsibility for allowing this to happen. They could have discriminated between credible and non-credible cases yet lacked the will to do so.’ SIR MICHAEL FALLON: Members of our armed forces were victims of a charismatic conman who exploited vulnerabilities in the legal system Last week the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found that Phil Shiner should be struck off because of his reckless campaign of false and exaggerated allegations against our armed forces. That decision was made possible because two years ago I took the unprecedented step of directing officials to assemble and submit evidence of this dishonesty This intervention was justified by the gravity of what the £31 million Al Sweady public inquiry revealed about Mr Shiner’s behaviour. I was not prepared to let someone who pursued false accusations of torture, murder, and mutilation against our armed forces get away with it. The decision to strike off Philip Shiner was made possible because two years ago I took the unprecedented step of directing officials to assemble and submit evidence of this dishonesty, writes Sir Michael Fallon (pictured) Last week the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found that Phil Shiner should be struck off because of his reckless campaign of false and exaggerated allegations against our armed forces Mr Shiner’s downfall will have been painful to behold for those in the human rights lobby who lionised him. But as is often the case with charismatic conmen, it was not just naïve campaigners whom he fooled. For too long he and others were able to exploit vulnerabilities in our legal system, exacerbated by the seemingly relentless rulings that expanded the reach of the European Convention of Human Rights into combat zones and fuelled by legal aid. This has damaged the reputation of our armed forces and in too many cases has forced blameless military personnel to relive painful events of many years ago. For too long he and others were able to exploit vulnerabilities in our legal system Mr Shiner’s allegations were on an industrial scale. Thousands had to be examined and in some cases investigated, under unprecedented scrutiny by the High Court and the International Criminal Court. Let me be clear – there was no alternative. Anyone who thinks that Ministers or civil servants have the authority to direct or to influence the decisions of criminal investigators or prosecutors does not understand our justice system, where independence is crucial. The investigation into the Iraq allegations has been carried out by a special unit called the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) set up by the previous government. The criticism they have faced and the questioning of their motives and those of MOD officials are deplorable. Prior to the damning ruling on Mr Shiner, Ihat was already close to completion of the first phase – that of winnowing out thousands of allegations which would not justify a full investigation. We are now at a new stage – the beginning of the end. As Mr Shiner’s involvement has poisoned so many of the allegations, the Director of the Ihat has concluded that by the summer the number of cases which should be investigated will be greatly diminished, much below the existing target of 60 to around a third of that. Rather than investigations continuing until the end of 2019, the remaining investigations could be completed as early as next year Therefore I have decided that the work of Ihat as a separate unit should end, with investigations progressively reduced and reintegrated into the service police system. Rather than investigations continuing until the end of 2019, the remaining investigations could be completed as early as next year. In parallel, the Royal Military Police who are examining 675 allegations of abuse in Afghanistan, are in the process of discontinuing work on around 90 per cent of them. Many of these claims come from another law firm — Leigh Day — that worked with Mr Shiner on the Al Sweady allegations. We are now close to putting behind us most of the poisonous lies which have plagued our armed forces over the past decade. We are now close to putting behind us most of the poisonous lies which have plagued our armed forces over the past decade But this is not enough. The government will ensure that our armed forces overseas are no longer subject to human rights claims that undermine their ability to do their job. I am working with the Justice Secretary to deal with this problem once and for all. Some measures have already been announced, including the presumption that we will derogate from the European Court of Human Rights in future operations when it is right to do so. When it comes to Northern Ireland, legacy investigations have focused almost entirely on former police officers and soldiers. This is wrong, and we will ensure a fair approach to investigating the past. There will be occasions in the future where allegations against our armed forces need to be investigated. Anyone facing allegations will be offered improved welfare support as well as continue to receive free independent legal support. Together these safeguards should ensure that our armed forces never again have to face such reckless campaigns of denigration.
