A + A - These gut-healing dishes will help you get over stomach infections. Picture courtesy: Pinterest/EAT SMARTER/detoxdiy.com \nEvery time the season changes (and these changes are quite harsh in India), we get more prone to infections and viral fevers. For any foodie out there, stomach infections are the worst. \nThis isn't just because of the fact that we won't be able to taste absolutely delicious anything before the bug says goodbye for good. Food recommended during this period is usually devoid of any masalas or spices, chillies are a big no-no, and dare you even crave a bite of anything made of flour. \nSo what are your options during this bout of sickness? Get better as fast as you can, and make sure you get a good dose of these four fermented dishes. Just like the Indian staple dahi or yogurt (which you should have regularly), these easy recipes work as probiotics. Because of the fermentation they go through, these dishes are packed full of healthy bacteria that your gut needs. \nAnd you know what? They taste absolutely delicious. \nAlso read: 3 haldi (turmeric) recipes that are as warming as tasty \nKimchi \nThis Korean wonder is all about taste and health benefits.

Cover the whole thing with cling film, and let it rest for a week. Shift the sauerkraut into mason jars, along with its water, and let it rest for another week.
