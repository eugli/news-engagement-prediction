I know that place quite well,\" Smith said upon arrival in India. \n\"I've never played a Test match there. I'm sure it's going to be a little bit different to a T20. \n\"But it's still nice to go somewhere that you feel quite comfortable in and you've spent a lot of time out in the middle, hopefully I can spend a lot more time out in the middle there.\" IPL experience may help Aussies Photo: The Australians admit conditions are different but think their IPL experience may stand them in good stead. (AAP: Paul Miller) \nDavid Warner, who captained Hyderabad to the IPL title last year, Smith and Maxwell headline a 16-man Australian Test squad stacked with IPL experience. \nThere are few similarities between the lucrative T20 league and Test cricket in the world's second-most populous nation. \nThe format is different. The pitches are prepared differently and the demands are not comparable. \nMaxwell, however, is confident Australia's IPL experience will count for something during the next six weeks. \n\"The wickets aren't exactly the same ... (but) the training conditions are probably something you get out of the IPL,\" Maxwell said, having made his Test debut during Australia's calamitous tour of India in 2013. \n\"The IPL practice wickets are probably more similar to what you're going to face in the Test matches over here, with a bit of wear and tear and variable bounce. \n\"So I think having those guys (with IPL experience) in our squad is only going to help, and with the experience of playing in front of these crowds.\" \nMaxwell added the heaving atmosphere is the biggest similarity. \n\"The crowds are very vocal, they're screaming the whole time,\" Maxwell said. \n\"It's one of my favourite places to tour, just with how much they love their cricket and how excited the crowds are, it's a hell of an experience.\" \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:39:07.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
