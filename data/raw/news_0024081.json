We were all holding on to each other. \n“I was saying to the guy behind me ‘don’t let me go, if one goes we’ll all go.” \nThe cabbie said it felt like they were holding on for around 15 minutes, but in reality the police arrived after around five, turning up alongside the RNLI and fire brigade . \nShe was rescued and taken to a place of safety, while a shaking Mr Teague drove home, feeling “a bit emotional”. \nThe cabbie, who has been operating in the capital for 17 years, was given a hero’s reception and a round of applause by other taxi drivers at a café in Victoria station at the weekend. \nAnd it is not the first time he has saved a life, jumping in a Kent river to help a drowning eight-year-old three years ago. \nBut he told the Standard: “I’ve said to the other drivers we’d all do the same. \n“I’m just glad I was there. It was the right place, right time I think. You’d hope everybody would do it.\" \nThe London Fire Brigade confirmed they were called to Lambeth Bridge at 8.43pm on Friday to assist the Met Police. \nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.
