Jo Stevens had resigned last week. \nIn total, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position. \nIain Watson, BBC political correspondent, said a \"sizeable\" Labour rebellion could grow further if amendments were not passed. \nA Conservative Party spokesman said the rebellion showed \"Labour can't speak for themselves, let alone speak for the country\". Analysis \nBy Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent \nIn truth, the substance of the government's white paper will be similar to the speech the prime minister gave last month, setting out her priorities for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU. \nOnly one Conservative MP - the former Chancellor Ken Clarke - voted against the principle of leaving the EU last night but some of his colleagues are more likely to defy their government on the detail. \nLabour, however, appears more divided. \nThree shadow cabinet members refused to support triggering Article 50 and stepped down before the vote. \nJeremy Corbyn is yet to decide whether to discipline the 10 junior shadow ministers who rebelled, or indeed the three whips who were supposed to impose party discipline rather than flaunt it. \nWith the possibility of two more shadow cabinet members going next week, Mr Corbyn will have to decide whether to relax his instruction not to block Brexit if Labour's amendments are defeated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:30:50.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
