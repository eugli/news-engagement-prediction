Janet Nguyen from the house floor , saying he was troubled and unsettled by the tense events that unfolded. \n\"Members, last Thursday was not one of the finest moments of the Senate,\" he said. \"As the leader of this body, I take full responsibility for what transpired and in making sure that it never happens again.\" \nRepublican lawmakers commended the statement. But they blasted what they described as the majority party's infringement of free speech. They demanded a formal apology for Nguyen and called for the resignation of De León's chief of staff, who they said made inappropriate comments about the incident to the media. \nNguyen (R-Garden Grove), a Vietnamese refugee, on Thursday was escorted from the Senate floor by sergeants-at-arms after she tried to offer what she said was a different historical perspective on the late Tom Hayden and his opposition to the Vietnam War. \nReading a letter to Secretary of the Senate Daniel Alvarez, Sen. Jean Fuller (R-Bakersfield), leader of the Senate Republican Caucus, called for a complete and transparent investigation. \nFuller said Nguyen spoke from the heart when she said Hayden's being honored triggered outrage among the constituents in her district's Vietnamese community, where memories of the war were still raw. \n\"Brutality of the Vietnamese Communist party continues to haunt the collective memory of the Vietnamese American community,\" Fuller said. The letter was submitted to the Senate journal through a unanimous vote. \nBefore the start of session, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle shook hands with Nguyen as she entered the chamber for her first time back since her ouster last week. Some Republican lawmakers embraced her and whispered words of approval and encouragement. \n\"Thursday's events were shocking and distressing,\" she later said. \"But what happened today on the floor reaffirmed by faith in America's deep belief in the Democratic process.\" Latest updates ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:58:19.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
