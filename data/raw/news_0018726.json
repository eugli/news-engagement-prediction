(Fox News via AP) \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday said Kellyanne Conway has \"been counseled\" after she appeared to violate federal ethics regulations by promoting Ivanka Trump's fashion brand. \n\"Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we're going to go on,\" Spicer told reporters at his daily briefing. \"She's been counseled on that subject and – that's it.\" \nSpicer's abbreviated comments came after Conway, a senior counselor to President Donald Trump, told viewers of \"Fox and Friends\" on Thursday to \"go buy\" Ivanka Trump's brand. Her appearance followed the president criticizing Nordstrom in a tweet for dropping the first daughter's clothing and accessories brand from its stores. \n[ OPINION: Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway Declare War on Nordstrom to Defend Ivanka ] \n\"Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you,\" Conway said. \"I hate shopping, I'm gonna go get some myself today.\" \n\"It's a wonderful line,\" she said. \"I own some of it. I fully – I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody, you can find it online.\" \nEthics experts pointed out that Conway appeared to violate part of the Code of Federal Regulations barring a federal employee from using \"his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.\" \nDemocratic lawmakers have pressed for a congressional investigation into blurred business lines between the White House and the first family. While Ivanka Trump has said she would resign from her role as a vice president at the Trump Organization and step away from her eponymous fashion brand, ProPublica reported last week that her name still appeared on documents for Trump-branded entities. A Trump Organization attorney told ProPublica that necessary filings were imminent.
