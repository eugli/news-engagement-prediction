Plus, if you choose a high-quality powder, there’s no difference in how it impacts your muscle growth or retention compared to loading up on meat, says Men’s Health nutrition advisor Alan Aragon, M.S. \n“There’s really nothing easier than this to bump up your protein intake,” he says. “One scoop has 20 to 25 grams of protein, about the same amount as 3 to 4 ounces of meat.” \nHe recommends Gold Standard whey protein . If you’re vegetarian or vegan, Raw Fusion , a mix of plant-based protein, is a great option. Plus, it’s a simple way to switch things up if you get tired of whey, Aragon says. Once you’ve found a powder that works for you, throw a scoop into one of these smoothie recipes for a quick meal on the go. 4/13 Getty Images Load Up On Quinoa \nIf you’re into stir-fry or burrito bowls, swap out your rice or noodles for quinoa, says Keri Gans, R.D.N., author of The Small Change Diet . Half of a cup of these grain-like seeds will get you 4 grams of protein and nearly 3 grams of fiber—that’s compared to only 2 grams of protein and less than 1 gram of fiber you’d get from regular white rice. 5/13 Getty Images Go Nuts With Granola \nGranola is a great way to add crunch to your oatmeal or yogurt, but most store-bought versions are heavy on carbs and light on protein. Enhance your favorite mix by adding a handful (or about 1/4 cup) of nuts like peanuts or almonds to your serving, suggests White. This boosts your favorite granola (White recommends the Bear Naked Granola , which already contains 4 grams of protein per serving) by 7 grams of protein. \nWant to go all out and make your own? Check out this easy homemade granola recipe and add an extra half-cup of nuts to increase the whole mix by 15 to 18 grams of protein. 6/13 Getty Images Try the Best Bar Ever \nKeep a stash of protein bars handy if you tend to get hungry in the afternoon. Be cautious here: Many protein bars are just candy bars in disguise and come loaded with sugar and empty calories. Aragon recommends The Best Bar Ever . It’s created with a blend of whey, casein, and whole-food ingredients like nuts. It packs in 20 grams of protein. 7/13 Getty Images Sub the Sour Cream \nA baked potato isn’t the same without sour cream, but you can barely notice the difference when you use plain Greek yogurt instead, says Chris Mohr, Ph.D., R.D. You’ll get 3 to 4 extra grams of protein in a couple of tablespoons, a punch of probiotics for your gut health, and save yourself unnecessary calories, too. 8/13 Getty Images Dip With the Right Chips \nSubstitute your greasy potato chips for a handful of alternative chips made completely from beans , suggests Marie Spano, R.D., a sports nutritionist for the Atlanta Hawks. Just a couple of ounces of these chips yield 10 grams of protein. That’s compared to the measly 4 grams regular potato chips would offer. Plus, they’re also full of fiber, which helps keep you feeling full so you don’t over do it, she says. 9/13 Getty Images Treat Your Sweet Tooth \nWhile yogurt will never replace ice cream, it can still satisfy your cravings for dessert. One cup of plain Greek yogurt yields about 20 grams of protein; mix it with part-skim ricotta cheese, honey, and walnuts for a sweet treat, suggests Aragon. 10/13 Getty Images Perfect Your Pasta \nIf you’re really craving pasta, opt for one made from black beans and other legumes, Spano says. Your average serving of white spaghetti serves up about 7 grams of protein, but a couple of ounces of black bean spaghetti will bump you up to 25 grams. \nPair it with this homemade pesto recipe and you’ve got the perfect dinner. 11/13 Getty Images Say Cheese \nThere are some benefits to eating full-fat cheese , so sprinkle some shredded Parmesan onto salad, pasta, or any other of your favorite dishes to punch up the protein, flavor, and calcium, Aragon says. Three tablespoons of shredded parmesan will add nearly 6 grams of protein to your meal. 12/13 Getty Images Top Your Salads With Edamame \nGans recommends adding these green soybeans to any salad to make it more filling: Just one cup of edamame will add a whopping 18 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber to your meal. \nIt tastes great as an appetizer, too. Try this recipe to give it punch of flavor. 13/13 Getty Images Sprinkle In Some Seeds \nIf you like to keep things simple with cereal in the morning, adding in hempseeds is a mindless way to up your protein intake, says Mohr. Three tablespoons will get you 10 grams of protein—combine that with the 8 grams of protein you’re already getting from your milk and 5 to 9 grams in a healthy cereal and you may actually stay full ‘til lunch.
