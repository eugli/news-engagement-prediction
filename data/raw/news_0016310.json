Brinkley was on the cover of the 1979, 1980 and 1981 editions of the magazine, but hasn't featured at all since 2004. \nBut now she's back alongside her two daughters, Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Brinkley Cook. \nPeople spoke to Brinkley about the shoot: \n\"My first thought was, 'At my age? No way!'\" she tells PEOPLE exclusively in this week's issue. \"When I turned 30, I was like, 'This is the last time I'm posing in a bathing suit!' When this issue comes out, I'll be 63. I thought, 'Those days are over.' But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, 'One last go!'\" A photo posted by Christie Brinkley (@christiebrinkley) on Feb 6, 2017 at 6:22pm PST \nSwimsuit 2017: Turks & Caicos Christie Brinkley Turks & Caicos 09/14/2016 SWIM158 TK5 Credit: Emmanuelle Hauguel Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/63-year-old-christine-brinkley-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-pictures-daughters-bikini-pictures/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:27:08.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
