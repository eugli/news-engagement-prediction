Thompson and \" Lincoln Heights \" star Zachary Williams were in 1 of the 2 vehicles swallowed up by a 20-foot sinkhole that ended up closing Laurel Canyon, which connects Hollywood with the San Fernando Valley. \nZachary -- who was behind the wheel of his mom's Honda Odyssey -- says the earth literally moved under their feet, as the back tire hit the growing hole in the road ... disabling it. They scrambled to safety as they watched the Honda disappear into hole filled with rainwater. \nThey jumped into Good Samaritan mode as they saw a woman in another car who was trapped as it plunged into the sinkhole.
