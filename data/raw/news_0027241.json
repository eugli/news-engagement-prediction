The GiveDirectly programme is based on the idea of a universal basic income and seeks to ensure a regular, long-term, reasonable amount that is available to everyone. The programme has already kicked off in one village.

Some 40 villages will receive money for a long-term period of 12 years, 80 will receive it for two years while a third group of 80 villages will receive a lump-sum payoff. \nThe GiveDirectly programme is based on the idea of a universal basic income and seeks to ensure a regular, long-term, reasonable amount that is available to everyone. \n\"Even though we know that cash transfers in developing countries help reduce poverty and improve outcomes for families, these have not been tested on a long-term basis or with a universal beneficiary pool,\" Mr Omidyar’s handlers wrote on Medium in a post explaining the importance of the programme. \n“Cash transfer programs can potentially help to address bigger issues facing our society, such as rising income volatility, lack of secure benefits, social instability, and the changing nature of work,” they added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:34:56.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
