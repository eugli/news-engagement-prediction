Can you actually give up something you live and breathe?\" Akhil said in an interview.\n\"I don't even understand retirement in sports. Those who say they have retired, are they saying that they have given up on something that is practically a part of them? I don't know about others but you will never hear 'Akhil Kumar retires'. Till I am alive, I won't ever be called retired,\" Akhil said.\nThe boxer, who enjoyed a rockstar image in his amateur days thanks largely to a perilously low guard and rhythmic ring craft, promised not to let go any of that showmanship when he competes in the professional arena.\n\"Over all these years, I have understood the difference between hard work and smart work. But be assured, I am not going to give up any of my original style. My low guard won't change but that doesn't mean that I would have a weak defence,\" Akhil explained.\n\"In the end, it's about that one punch, which makes or breaks a boxer. Rest all is talk,\" he added in his inimitable style.\nThe outspoken former Commonwealth champion was last seen in competitive action at the 2013 World Championships before injuries and niggles hampered him.\nMindful of the perils that await him on return to the ring, Akhil said he has been working extra hard on his fitness.\nTo help him and his protege Jitender Kumar be in perfect shape for the April 1 debut against yet-to-be-named opponents in Mumbai, the duo's promoters, IOS Boxing Promotions, will be flying in a trainer from Manchester.\n\"Fitness is the focus for me. I have to ensure that my punches have power because the size of the gloves is smaller in professional boxing. I am working on my stamina as well to be able to last the increased number of rounds,\" he said.\nAkhil will be competing in a super lightweight four-round contest on April 1.\nAway from boxing, spiritualism has caught Akhil's fancy and he has been busy reading up on mythology.\n\"It gives you a sense of calm. It's not that I am a vociferous reader, I read at my own slow and sweet pace but it is something that I enjoy. And I am fascinated by mythology, I want to know more,\" he said.\n\"Plus, I have also been brushing up my Hindi. I am most comfortable conversing in Hindi and I want to master the language. I really like the Hindi oratory skills of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bollywood actor Ashutosh Rana ,\" he signed off with a trademark 'Dhanyawaad' (Thank you).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:45:51.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
