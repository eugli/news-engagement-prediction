It looks like a black widow on steroids, basically. The Eastern brown snake is the world's No. 2 most venomous snake, capable of killing a full-grown human. \nThese two monsters faced off in some warehouse in Australia, and it was seriously terrifying. \nThe snake appeared to get trapped as the redback spider went for the attack. It stood no chance despite the much larger body and deadlier bite. The spider won. \nBut really, how did these people just stand to the side as this was going on? How can they ever show up to work again at that building knowing that deadly snakes and spiders can show up at any moment? \nAll of that is horrifying.
