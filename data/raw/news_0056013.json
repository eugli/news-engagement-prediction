In particular, he instructed the secretary to look into whether these seminaries were set up in compliance to relevant rules and regulations. \nSindh to begin ‘grand operation’ against militants, terror outfits \nChief Minister Shah also reviewed progress of the investigation in the gruesome suicide bombing at the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan which killed 88 people. \nHe was briefed on the movement of the suspected suicide bomber and the presence of his facilitators in the city with the help of CCTV footage. \nThe chief minister was informed that investigators have obtained a record of phone calls made from the shrine before and after the blast, which has provided some solid clues in the case. \n“If we successfully worked out this case then we would be able to stop such incidents in future,” Shah said. \nThe chief minister also issued clear directives for the security of soft targets. He was informed that police and other agencies have deployed officers in plain clothes at important locations and have improved CCTV coverage. He was also informed about raids in different districts of Sindh and the arrests made so far. \nSindh pulls the plug on anti-sectarian operation \nShah constituted a committee under the DG Rangers with senior officers of police and other agencies to make security plans, hold regular meetings and share alerts. The committee will share day-to-day reports with the chief minister. \nThe meeting was attended by Sindh Chief Secretary Rizwan Memon, IGP Sindh AD Khawaja, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Naveed Kamran Baloch, Additional IG CTD Sanaullah Abbasi, Deputy DG Rangers Brigadier Nadir Hussain, Home Secretary Qazi Shahid Parvaiz, DIG Hyderabad Khadim Rind, provincial heads of intelligence agencies, SSP Dadu, senior officers of CTD and other officials. \nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22 nd , 2017.
