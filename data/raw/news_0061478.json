I’ve got plenty of money,” Patrick told USA TODAY Sports. “I do it because I love it. Just like why I’m still racing, because I love it. I don’t have to race if I don’t want to race. \n“Would you sign up for 40 weeks of this if you didn’t want to do it? No way. Nobody does. It’s punishment if you don’t want to be there. I believe in myself and I believe I have things to do in NASCAR.” \nPatrick has finished 24th in each of the past two Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series seasons, with six top-10s — and a career-best of sixth in 2014 at Atlanta — in 154 races. Stewart-Haas Racing competition director Greg Zipadelli expressed confidence in Patrick and second-year crew chief Billy Scott but emphasized she has the equipment to succeed in the No. 10 Ford as she begins her fifth full season at NASCAR’s highest level. \nPatrick’s performance has been scrutinized throughout her career, specifically in relation to the sponsorship funds she has been able to exert as one of racing’s most recognizable and marketable personalities. The recent exodus of primary sponsor Nature’s Bakery has called into question Patrick’s potential longevity if this signals a wane in her power to woo benefactors. Aspen Dental has taken over some of the vacated races but voids remain as the season begins. SHR has filed a breach of contract suit against Nature’s Bakery, which contends Patrick violated terms of their deal by promoting competing products on Instagram. \nMORE NASCAR: Dale Earnhardt Jr. 'scared to death' blurry vision from concussion would end career \n“In business, I’ve learned, unfortunately, you’re going to have challenges and you are going to have situations where you don’t get what you’re supposed to get and it’s just a part of business,” Patrick said. “You can exhaust your energy worrying about it, being mad about it and fighting, it or you can look forward and be positive and cut your losses and move on. For me, that’s more my approach. As far as the legal stuff with Nature’s Bakery, that is on the team side and that is their battle to fight. As far as my situation looking forward, it’s about looking forward and being positive.” \nPHOTOS: Danica Patrick's NASCAR career Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
