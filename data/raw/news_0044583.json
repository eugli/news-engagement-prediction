And Toadie’s starting to twig Katie Baillie for Metro.co.uk Monday 20 Feb 2017 7:00 am Willow wants out (Picture: Channel 5) \nWillow could be on the verge of blowing everything as her mum’s scam pretending to be Dee Bliss hots up. Not only that, it looks like Toadie is starting to catch on. Neighbours spoilers: Is Fake Dee actually the real Dee Bliss? \nAndrea Somers, pretending to be Dee, has managed to scam Toadie out of a load of money to pay for Willow’s tuition to become a fighter pilot. \nNow she’s working on breaking up Toadie’s marriage so she can have him for herself too. Dee is trying to win Toadie (Picture: Channel 5) \nBut as their scam gets more convoluted – Willow now has to give another DNA sample – Willow is ready to get out. \nAs Dee and Toadie chat about their past, Dee slips up. She tells him she never thought of motherhood before Willow. Toadie then points out she was pregnant with Darcy’s baby when she slipped and suffered a miscarriage, just before she and Toadie got together. \nToadie is clearly rocked by her slip of the tongue, although she tries to cover it by blaming her amnesia. \nIn order to get a bank loan for the tuition fees, Toadie needs Willow’s birth certificate, and asks for his name to be put on as father. He also says the bank needs a DNA test, and Dee is weirdly cagey about it, saying Willow just hates doing them. \nDee then has to cook up a plan to get another swab from Nell and swap it for the one they’ll have to take from Willow – who says she doesn’t want to go through with it. \nShe tells her mum she wants to pull the plug, but Dee insists everything they’ve done so far is to earn them the lives they deserve. Paige’s parents know (Picture: Channel 5) \nElsewhere, Paige’s parents twig who is the father of her baby after she tells them he is married. \n‘I found her with Jack after the balloon accident,’ Brad tells Lauren. ‘He’s married to God. \nCat’s out of the bag, Paige. \nScenes air in the episode airing on Tuesday February 21. \nWe think this is a dazzling story and so do you!
