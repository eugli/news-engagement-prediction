Poor Rosie looked like an old mop when she was handed in to vets \nThe shih tzu, thought to be aged between three and six-years-old, had no microchip or ID tag when she was handed in to vets on Tuesday afternoon, January 31.

Once we’d removed the fur, it revealed a number of sores and wounds to her skin.

Poor Rosie must have been so uncomfortable. \n“Bathing and grooming your pet dog is an important part of caring for them, just like walking them and taking them to the vets. Rosie, who had a haircut, is now in the care of vets \n“Rosie has not ended up like this overnight so must have been suffering for some time.” \nOfficers are now urging anyone who might recognise her or know where she has come from to get in touch with the RSPCA by calling their appeal line on 0300 123 8018. \nTo find out more about the charity, visit www.rspca.org.uk/give or text LOVE to 87023 to give £3.
