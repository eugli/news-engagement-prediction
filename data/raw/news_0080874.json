The whole thing is a racket for lawyers. Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP \nBut the claimants argued sending them back would expose them to “inhuman and degrading treatment”. \nThe Court of Appeal ruled in favour of then Home Secretary Theresa May, who said the asylum seekers could be deported to Italy because the country “was not in systemic breach of its international obligations to treat asylum seekers with dignity”. \nBut the refugees then took the case to the Supreme Court and Lord Justices Lord Neuberger, Lord Kerr, Lord Carnwath, Lord Toulson and Lord Hodge, allowed the appeal. GETTY The Home Office lost over 1,500 such court cases, costing the taxpayer upwards of £15m in 2015/16 \nThey ruled if there is a “real risk that he will be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, his or her removal to that state is forbidden”. \nAnd the lawyers who fought the case billed the Government for £602,806. \nOfficials settled it for £395,500, paying the barristers £330 per hour. \nThe Home Office faced additional costs of £215,223, taking the total bill to £610,723.

It shouldn’t be with lawyers on£330 an hour.” \nTory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: “I think it is totally unacceptable. \n“Now we are leaving the European Union we can set all of our own laws and cases like this will become more watertight, and if its challenged in court, we’ll simply change the laws in our own Parliament. GETTY The four refugees, from Iran and Eritrea, first claimed asylum in Italy and then the UK \n“Lawyers like to hold things up so they can charge bigger fees and I definitely think the whole process of how these cases are heard should be examined. \n“It will mean there is more money available to be spent on other areas the Home Office covers, fundamentally keeping our streets safe, whether that be through police or counter-terrorism.” \nThe Supreme Court judgement revealed the three Eritrean nationals were “left homeless and destitute in Italy”. \nTwo of the women claimed to have been repeatedly raped in the Mediterranean country and the Iranian man, who said he was a political prisoner in his own country, said he would be homeless if he was sent back. GETTY Officials accused lawyers of drawing out the case to charge higher fees \nHe added he is psychologically disturbed after being tortured in the Middle East country. \nFigures revealed the Home Office paid out £15.8million between April 2015 and March 2016. \nThis has soared from the £1.6million spent in 2013/14. \nThe department has also paid out £7,344,968 building cases which it went on to lose. GETTY The Iranian refugee said he was a political prisoner in his home country and would be homeless there \nLast night a Home Office spokesman said: “It is right that we defend cases where we consider it in the public interest to do so. \n“However, we have an independent judiciary and the nature of litigation means that the outcome cannot be predicted. \n“If we are not successful in a particular case, it does not mean we were wrong to defend the case or incur the costs of doing so. \n“We robustly negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer when required to pay adverse costs.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:15:55.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
