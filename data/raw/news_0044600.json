The award, given by the Union Ministry of Mines, is in recognition of the work in the field of geo-environmental studies. While Kessarkar will receive the award in the category of ocean development and marine geology for her significant contributions in the field of earth sciences, Saha will receive the award in the category of 'young scientist award' for his significant contributions to geosciences. Kessarkar has made important contributions to marine sedimentology through her work on past climate change, provenance and health of the estuaries. She has successfully decoded sea surface temperatures and salinity of the Arabian Sea for the past sixteen thousand years, which in itself is unique as there are no instrumental records for this data. She was also responsible for the new finding that precipitation was much higher thousand years ago than the present day. \"This is the reward of all the research done in the past ten years, and it feels great. I don't think any female Goan scientist in the past has received this award,\" she said. Saha has made significant contribution in the field of petrology and geochemistry research in India. His petrological and geochemical work on felsic and mafic rocks has thrown light on the intra-oceanic subduction processes, tectonics of greenstone belts and ophiolites.
