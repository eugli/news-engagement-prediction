The singer/designer/philanthropist/actress will accept the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award on campus at the esteemed Boston university at a ceremony next Tuesday. The honor comes after Rihanna's charitable work with her Clara and Lionel Foundation Scholarship Program, named after her grandmother and grandfather, and her efforts in promoting education and allowing for students from Caribbean countries to attending colleges in the U.S. She has also supported the Global Partnership for Education and the Global Citizen Project and headlined last year's festival in New York. \"Rihanna has charitably built a state-of- the-art center for oncology and nuclear medicine to diagnose and treat breast cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados,\" said the Harvard Foundation's director S. Allen Counter. Rihanna will be presented with the award at 4 p.m. at Sanders Theatrer on Feb. 28. Members of the Harvard community can grab their tickets to the ceremony at the Harvard University Box Office, 10 Holyoke St.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:58:23.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
