Picture: Facebook Jamie McKinnell AAP Share on Twitter \nTHE Sydney lonely hearts fraudster who swindled about $2 million from lonely men she’d met through dating services has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars. \nSanaa Derbas, 42, last year pleaded guilty to 11 fraud-related offences after tricking the seven victims into lending her money which she used to fund her gambling and cocaine habits, and to build a house. \nBetween 2008 and 2014, the Sydney mother of four told the men she had a wealthy Egyptian grandfather but in order to receive his wire transfers she needed money for taxes, bank charges and solicitor’s fees. \nThe victims initially transferred money to Derbas for hotel rooms before she offered excuses for not meeting them, including sick relatives and various calamities. \nAs her lies became increasingly elaborate, Derbas posed as different relatives who contacted the victims. \nDerbas told one man her young son had died of swine flu, while she requested money from others to pay for her dead mother’s funeral.

She also acted as a carer for her mother and brother, who had a mental disability, Mr Jones added. \n“There has been a substantial change in her life and her environment since these matters in 2008,” he said. \nIn sentencing Derbas, Judge Paul Conlon said her “intricate web of lies” demonstrated a talent for impersonation. \nHer offending involved “calculated cunning and guile” and she was “utterly determined” to bleed victims of funds, he said. \n“Those she targeted were largely vulnerable people,” Judge Conlon said. “The victims were all simple men who lost sums of money that was, of course, significant to them.” Derbas was handed a three-and-a-half-year sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months. \nShe began sobbing in the dock and pleaded with the judge as a large contingent of family members looked on. \nThe courtroom became tense when a young family member threatened the media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:27:37.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
