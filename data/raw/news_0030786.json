St. Louis has won five of its last six games overall. Berglund's hat-trick gives him six goals in his last five games and 17 on the season.\nShea Weber and Max Pacioretty scored for the slumping Canadiens (31-18-8), who are 1-4-1 in their last six.\nThe Canadiens controlled most of the play and outshot St. Louis 30-22 but lacked finish around the net.\nThe Blues went ahead 3:49 into the game when Jeff Petry lost his stick and Alex Pietrangelo had an open shot that Berglund got a piece of as it went past Al Montoya, who lost balance and fell in his crease just before the shot was taken. It was the first goal Montoya allowed at the Bell Centre this season in four appearances.\nWeber tied it at 16:39 with a blast from the right point that handcuffed Jake Allen.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-12T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:35:56.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
