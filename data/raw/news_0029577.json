According to the folks at VentureBeat, HMD Global – a Finnish company that’s currently in charge of making Android-based Nokia smartphones – will be unveiling three new Nokia smartphones during MWC 2017. \nThe three will be officially known as the Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and the Nokia 6 – unveiled earlier this year – will all make its global debut in Barcelona. \nThe Nokia 5 is rumoured to be equipped with the same SoC (Qualcomm Snapdragon 430) as its larger brother, the Nokia 6. When it comes to screen real estate, the Nokia 5 is expected to be fitted with a 5.2-inch 720P display. In addition, unlike its more powerful sibling, the Nokia 5 will only come with 2GB of RAM along with a 12MP rear camera. And, like the Nokia 6, the device may not be priced modestly at €199 (about RM938). \nNext up is the less powerful Nokia 3 smartphone, which apparently is HMD Global’s entry-level Android smartphone. Unfortunately, the specifications of this particular smartphone is not yet known. That said, VentureBeat reports that the Nokia 3 may come with a price tag of €149 (around RM662). This Is Our First Look at the LG G6; Launching on 26 February 2017 \nBoth devices, however, don’t come with the same machismo as the legendary and indestructible Nokia 3310 smartphone. It looks like HMD Global will be re-releasing a “modern” and refreshed Nokia 3310 – expect a candy bar phone with weeks-long battery life. Not much is known about the specifications of this phone, but the refreshed 3310 may come with a price tag of just €59 (approximately RM278). Image: The Huffington Post \nIt’s worth noting, however, that all four of HMD Global’s upcoming Nokia-branded smartphones are said to be targeted mainly for the European market, according to VentureBeat. Availability in other regions was not mentioned. Regardless, all will be revealed at the company’s MWC 2017 event in just a few weeks’ time.
