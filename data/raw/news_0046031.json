The Gators have also eclipsed their victory total from the 2015-16 season, with 22 wins on the year this season.\nInstant Analysis now takes a closer look at Florida’s road victory.\nIT WAS OVER WHEN: Florida led by as many as 12 in the second half, but Mississippi State eventually cut its deficit to four points and soon tied it up at 52-52 with 2:24 to go – on a play where Canyon Barry left the game and limped to the bench after suffering what appeared to be an ankle injury.\nThen, center Kevarrius Hayes came through late with a number of important plays. After scoring quickly on a layup, Hayes grabbed the rebound on the other end on a missed three-point attempt by the Bulldogs. Justin Leon then missed his shot from downtown, but on the next possession Hayes logged an important block, as Leon got the rebound and was fouled with 28 seconds left.\nLeon went 1-of-2 at the free throw line, but Misssissippi State once again missed a three-point attempt on the ensuing play. Kasey Hill was fouled, and he too went just 1-of-2 at the foul line. However, Florida led by 56-52 with 18 seconds left and was in control.\nTHEY STOLE THE SHOW: Point guard Chris Chiozza provided a spark off the bench Saturday, with 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting (2-of-3 from three). Meanwhile, Hayes stepped up in his first start since Egbunu suffered a torn ACL this past Tuesday against Auburn, recording nine points, 10 rebounds and four contests while making a number of key plays late in the contest.\nTHESE STATS DON'T LIE: The loss of Egbunu was felt in the paint Saturday. Although the Gators managed to outrebound the Bulldogs 42-38 (and 31-26 on the defensive glass) – thanks to double-figure rebounding performances by Hayes and Devin Robinson - Florida was outscored in the paint 36-22.\nHowever, Mississippi State went just 36.1% shooting, with a 2-of-23 clip (8.7%) from downtown. Comparably, Florida shot 38.5% from the field but 5-of-18 on threes. The Gators hit 12-of-19 free throws (63.2%), while the Bulldogs went just 6-of-13 (46.2%) from the charity stripe.\nMeanwhile, Hill is now the 52nd player in school history to join the 1,000-point club, after scoring nine points today against Mississippi State. He accomplished the milestone with a free throw with 18 seconds remaining.\nWHAT A PLAY: Kevarrius Hayes and Chiozza made their way onto the highlight reel early on during the second half. On an inbounds pass, Chiozza lofted the ball to Hayes, who caught the ball over I.J. Ready and threw down a two-handed, alley-oop slam to lift Florida to a 36-31 lead with 16:29 left.\nAir Hayes... clear for takeoff.\nWatch now https://t.co/W3KNTObmmH pic.twitter.com/wJaTyqsvVq\n— Gators M-Basketball (@GatorsMBK) February 18, 2017 THE BOTTOM LINE: Despite a slow start, a number of turnovers and an array of careless mistakes on the defensive end, Florida pulled out a win Saturday on the road behind a gutsy effort. This was easily the closest victory of its eight-game winning streak, and the Gators avoided dropping what could have been a trap game. With Florida entering a crucial week, Barry’s ankle injury will be one now to keep an eye on.\nNEXT UP: Next week could end up determining whether the Gators could earn an SEC regular-season crown in Mike White’s second year with the program. Florida will host No. 21 South Carolina (20-6, 10-3 SEC) on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. ET in the O’Connell Center (ESPN) and then square off against No. 13 Kentucky (21-5, 11-2 SEC) in Lexington next Saturday at 2 p.m. ET on CBS.\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dmuf6n7qrhc1dgnpiade)", "https://t.co/W3KNTObmmH", "https://t.co/wJaTyqsvVq", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/aefqc4qbva8ccj32bera", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dmuf6n7qrhc1dgnpiade", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/aefqc4qbva8ccj32bera)", "https://twitter.com/GatorsMBK/status/833049033195257857"], "published": "2017-02-18T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:09:50.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
