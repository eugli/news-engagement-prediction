SIGN UP NOW > \nRULES \nWHILE the JLT Community Series will see some tried-and-true pre-season experimentation, we’ll also get our first chance to look at the changes made for the 2017 premiership season. \nThe third man up in ruck contests is banned, with all stoppages restricted to two nominated ruckmen. \nA stricter interpretation of deliberate rushed behind will be applied. But solely for the pre-season, a free kick won’t be given when a behind is judged as deliberate. Instead when deliberate rushed behinds occur a behind will be recorded and play will be resumed via a ball-up 14 metres out from goal. \nMeanwhile a modified interpretation on high tackles, with the intention of allowing shruggers, duckers and arm lifters to receive fewer free kicks, will be implemented. \nTeams will be allowed to have eight players on the bench with unlimited rotations, while the Supergoal — worth nine points when kicked from outside of the 50 metre arc — is back as well. \nIn the first three weeks of the pre-season competition quarters will be 20 minutes, with the first 15 minutes having no time on except after goals and for significant delays in play. In the last week of the JLT Community Series matches will revert to the regular length. The third man up has been banned for 2017.
