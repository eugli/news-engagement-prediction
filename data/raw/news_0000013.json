A little push-start had him set to make his way towards his final destination. All he needed to do was carry the pillow and look adorable, but with so many people watching it was a lot of pressure just like it would be for any child. Although all eyes were on him, he kept his level of confidence down the aisle until a better idea popped into his head.\nFor this young boy, all the attention he was receiving seemed to go unnoticed. In that moment he was like a little celebrity as camera lights flashed at him to capture the moment, but he didn't seem to give much thought to it. After all, he was a toddler with plenty on his mind. When his destination came closer than ever, it appears the attention was noted after all. He decided to do a trick before all the wedding guests that took them all by complete surprise. He started off so polite, but then something wild grabbed a hold of his actions.\nIt didn't matter if people laughed and it didn't matter what consequences would follow his daring move. All he knew was that more fun was available and it all depended on what he could pull off with the pillow he was holding. When the maid of honor, along with the entire wedding party was all in reach, he made his move. Watch how the guests respond to his hilarious plan in the video below.
