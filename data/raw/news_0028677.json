The Royals have not confirmed the deal, which is reportedly pending a physical. Wood gets final out of Game 6 WS2016 Gm6: Wood retires Kipnis, sends WS to Game 7 Travis Wood gets Jason Kipnis to pop up to Addison Russell to end the game, sealing the Cubs' 9-3 Game 6 win \nThe Royals went into the offseason with a mandate from ownership to trim payroll from last year's record $145 million. But after the Hammel and Wood deals, the Royals' 2017 payroll instead likely will surpass last year's total. \nWood has expressed a desire to start and likely will compete for the fifth spot in the rotation behind Danny Duffy , Ian Kennedy , Jason Vargas and Hammel. \nWood would compete with right-hander Nathan Karns , acquired in the offseason from Seattle for Jarrod Dyson , and Chris Young for the final rotation spot. \nIf Wood loses that battle, he would be a valuable piece to the bullpen, where he went 4-0 last season with the Cubs and had a 2.95 ERA in 77 appearances. \nWood pitched primarily as a starter his first five seasons, two with the Reds and three with the Cubs. He has a 4.19 ERA in 133 career starts. has covered the Royals since 1991, and for MLB.com since 2015. Follow him on Twitter @FlannyMLB .
