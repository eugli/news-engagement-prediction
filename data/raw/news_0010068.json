Jade McDaid, 27, was trying on bras in the changing rooms of her local store in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. When she finished she glanced up to see a hand holding a smartphone over the top of her cubicle. She quickly tried to cover up before leaving the unmanned changing rooms to find a member of staff. Despite telling security, the man was allowed to leave through a staff exit with whatever he managed to record. 'I feel embarrassed and completely violated,' said Mrs McDaid, who works in customer services. 'As I was trying on bras, he would have had full view of my breasts and they let him leave. I don't know what made me look up but it just kind of felt like I was being watched. 'I was just in utter shock. I could not believe it. The cubicle is quite high so he would have had to stand on the seat in order to get the phone above. 'I quickly tried to cover myself up before leaving to get a member of staff. My nana Joan was the first person I could find and she went off to find someone, as there was no staff around. 'Two other customers came over and I told them not to go in, and what had happened. There was about six of us including staff and a security guard waiting for him to come out. I felt so humiliated, I could barely look at him.' After waiting a few minutes for the man to leave, he hung some trousers on a rack before walking away. Jade McDaid was trying on bras in the changing rooms of her local store in Barnsley, South Yorkshire Mrs McDaid realised the same man had been in the underwear section while she was browsing but she did not think anything unusually of it with Valentine's day so close. The security guard at the store began to follow him but Mrs McDaid said he kept his distance. Another customer, who had been waiting with Mrs McDaid, attempted to stop the man herself but shouts for security to stop him failed to stop the man leaving through a staff exit. The man left Asda unchallenged and with the footage, while a distressed Mrs McDaid had to wait for the store manager to call the police.
