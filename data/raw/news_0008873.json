The 27-year-old university student appeared in court Monday on six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder.\nLaval University professor Khaled Belkacemi, 60; butcher shop owner Azzeddine Soufiane, 57; Aboubaker Thabti, 44 ; Abdelkrim Hassane, 41; Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, and Ibrahima Barry, 39, were killed in the attack.\nDetails on the six victims of the mosque attack In addition to the six men who died, five others were admitted to hospital with gunshot wounds. Two of them remain in critical condition but all are expected to survive.\nAs of Tuesday evening, more than $325,000 had been raised online to cover funeral costs and other expenses for the wives and children of the victims.\n‘Words hurt’ \nOn Tuesday, the province’s premier and opposition leader linked the targeting of the mosque to Quebec’s ongoing debate about religious accommodation, which included a proposal by the Parti Quebecois to ban civil servants from wearing religious symbols.\nQuebec Premier Philippe Couillard, a Liberal, warned Tuesday that: \"Badly chosen words hurt, sometimes for life, and we have to be careful of that.” He said there is a \"danger\" of normalizing racism and xenophobia, by dismissing it as freedom of speech. \"People feel that they have a licence to do this, and we have to be extremely cognizant of it,\" he said. \"Words can be knives.\"\nOpposition Leader Jean-Francois Lisee, meanwhile, said he regrets his comment during last year’s PQ leadership campaign that a burqa could conceal a firearm. \"It was not a good idea to bring that into the Quebec debate,” Lisee said.\nQuebec Muslims have continued to be targeted since Sunday’s shootings. Montreal's dedicated hate crime unit reported receiving 14 hate-related calls since Sunday night, compared to 55 for the entire seven-month period from last May to December, according to Chief Philippe Pichet.\nPolice have stepped up security around mosques in Montreal and Quebec City following the attack, which   Trudeau and Premier Couillard have both labelled a \"terrorist attack.\"\nExperts suggest that although it appears to have been a terror attack, it should be classified as a mass shooting until police offer evidence that the acts were based on political ideology or religious beliefs.\nThe shooter \nBissonnette was arrested Sunday around 9 p.m. at a bridge near the city's downtown core.\nPolice say the suspect called 911 to turn himself in, saying he was armed and \"wanting to collaborate.\"\nBissonnette's neighbours and classmates described him as a person with few friends, who spent most of his time with his twin brother. They also told CTV Montreal he was frequently bullied.\nThe 27-year-old had been studying political science at Laval University, after switching into the program from anthropology.\nWhat we know about the mosque shooting suspect Bissonnette's archived Facebook page shows he was interested in a number of right-wing nationalist figures, including U.S. President Donald Trump and French politician Marine Le Pen. Le Pen came out against the shooting on Tuesday, calling it \"deplorable.\"\nBissonnette also followed Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, two philosophers who have strongly criticized all forms of religion.\nHe was also known in the community and on Facebook for espousing anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and other ultra-conservative viewpoints.\nBissonnette was enrolled as a cadet in the Quebec City area from 2002-2004, but did not receive any military training. The Department of National Defence says it has no record of him participating in marksmanship programs.\nMixup over second arrest \nPolice initially reported two individuals had been arrested Sunday in connection with the shooting.\nThe second individual, whom Quebec media identified as Mohamed Belkhadir, was arrested amid the confusion at the mosque, after he fled at the sight of what he thought was a gunman. Belkhadir was reportedly helping a wounded friend after the shooting when he mistook an armed police officer for a shooter, and took off running. Police gave chase and apprehended him, but later determined that he was a witness.\nBelkhadir said after the incident that he doesn't blame police for their reaction.\nRelated Stories 'More questions than answers': Was mosque shooting an act of terror?
