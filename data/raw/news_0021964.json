Finally, when OPS opened his eyes - and mouth - Sasikala's power play appeared to have gone horribly wrong. \n\nIt was a usual Tuesday evening on the Marina. Beachgoers, couples, evening walkers and vendors - all were lazing around by the bay in the balmy breeze till the hum was broken by O Panneerselvam's entry. Amid the confusion over V K Sasikala's swearing-in ceremony, the governor's absence from Chennai, O Pannerselvam, known as the man who had hitherto taken orders, seized the day by the night. \n\nAfter sitting for more than 40 minutes next to Jayalalithaa's memorial, OPS opened his eyes and started wiping his tears. The eerie silence was broken by questions from reporters and pleas from security personnel to keep calm. He remained patient till reporters settled down. OPS spoke in an emotion-filled voice. \"I was forced to resign,\" he said, and went on to name his colleagues who pulled the rug from under his feet. After dropping a bombshell at the dead night, he left for his residence making his cabinet colleagues fend for themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:15:11.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
