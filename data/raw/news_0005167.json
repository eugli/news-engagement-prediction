Editor Advertisement \nUnless the government explain in detail the calculations made that lead to the 6.9 million White Paper, no matter how they try to sell it and assure us with the grand plans of land use and MRT new lines etc, it just does not bite. \nWe may be able to accommodate the 6.9 M population with 700,000 more homes, but all in pigeon holes of 50 stories high blocks almost side by side, is not what we see as quality living. Quality living is not how many homes is being built and how long the train lines will be, it is how well the homes are built and how the environment is like without one looking out of the window and all one sees is human beings and another block of HDB flats all over the place. \nI hope they get the point. Human well-being involve the use of open green spaces and space with few people to balance the urban lifestyle. Stop using technocrats to develop and shape Singapore. We need more than technocrats and scholars to shape Singapore's future. We now need social scientist on board to give balance to this government. Truthfully speaking, the cabinet is made up of too many generals, lawyers, unionist, civil servants, doctors and businessmen. Singapore is more than a sum total of these professions. \nChan \nA.S.S.
