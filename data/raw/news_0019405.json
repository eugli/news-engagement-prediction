The cult hero is a favorite amongst comic book fans, so many have been at a loss as to why Booster Gold has remained notably absent from DC’s “Rebirth” initiative. For months, readers have been scanning every page and panel of DC Comics’ for the yellow-and-blue clad hero. And, now, it looks like the hero could be making a comeback soon. MORE: A Burning DC Rebirth Question: Where Is Booster Gold? \nOver on Twitter, Dan Jurgens riled up fans about Booster Gold’s pending addition to DC’s “Rebirth” storyline. The artist, who created the hero back in 1986, took to Twitter to hint at the news. \n“Feels good to stretch the drawing muscles again. Won’t tell you who,” he wrote. “But the character’s initials are BG.” \nObviously, the tweet has gotten fans of the hero fired up. There’s no word on whether Jurgen’s character will be the same iteration of Booster Gold that fans love or how the hero could make his way into the line-up. But, for now, the glimmer of hope Jurgen has given is more than enough for fans. \nLast year, ComicBook.com’s Russ Burlingame wrote an in-depth piece looking into why Booster Gold had been kept away from “Rebirth.” \n“The fact that Booster has appeared so rarely in the post-Flashpoint DC Universe is as aggravating for his hardcore fans as it is baffling: the last volume of Booster Gold ended at #47 (but also included a #0 and a #1,000,000 -- and was ended not by low sales but by the Flashpoint reboot itself. 49 issues isn't only a respectable run for any comic, it's damn near unheard-of for a relatively minor character like Booster in the current comics marketplace,” he wrote. \nFeels good to stretch the drawing muscles again. Won't tell you who.But the character's initials are BG. — Dan Jurgens (@thedanjurgens) February 7, 2017 \nIn the future, Booster Gold may be given more credit by mainstream audiences who are more familiar with heroes thanks to their cinematic presence. Zack Stentz, who wrote Thor and X-Men: First Class , signaled his work on a Booster Gold screenplay for Warner Bros. \nThere is no official release date yet for Booster Gold and no director officially attached. The film will be executive produced by Greg Berlanti who oversees several of DC's TV shows for The CW (Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, DC's Legends of Tomorrow), and FOX (Black Lightning).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:42:41.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
