After faltering early in Super Bowl LI , the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons in overtime. \nA comeback of such epic proportions warrants an equally epic celebration. Luckily, the Patriots did not disappoint, with photos capturing plenty of beautiful moments players shared with their families after the game. \nHere are a handful of those lovely Kodak moments. Martellus Benefit's family thrived after the Super Bowl \nBennett's daughter, Jett, stole the show at his postgame news conference, and also joined her dad in a pair of Instagram posts.

But the moment gains even more weight when you learn that Hudson was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2015. \nImage: Getty Images \nNate, a testicular cancer survivor himself, said it gave him a new perspective on life. \n\"The air we breathe is precious and to be at this game is a sign that you aren't always able to choose what you get, but you get some amazing things in life,\" he said leading up to the Super Bowl.

Tom Brady is #FamilyGoals \nAs if winning his fifth Super Bowl ring and fourth Super Bowl MVP award wasn't enough, Tom Brady showed off his beautiful family as well. The New England Patriots quarterback posted this photo on Instagram early Monday, calling his family, \"My everything.\" A photo posted by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 6, 2017 at 7:07am PST \nAfter the game, cameras swarmed Brady, who kept his family close by. \nBrady with his wife Gisele Bundchen and daughter Vivian. \nImage: Kevin C.
