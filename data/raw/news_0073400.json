Spring practice kicks off on March 7, meaning this time next week we'll be two days from coaches and players taking the field officially. \nBecause of that, our spring preview continues, today with... Tight ends The familiar returns \nUnlike much of the Ohio State roster, there will be little to no difference between the tight end position last fall and in 2017. \nRedshirt senior Marcus Baugh is by far the most experienced of the group and is coming off his best year as a Buckeye. After playing behind Jeff Heuerman and Nick Vannett , Baugh finally got his chance to be at the top of the depth chart. He responded with a 25-catch, 269-yard, two-touchdown season that that earned him honorable All-Big Ten honors. \nA.J. Alexander was the only other tight end to have any sort of impact in 2016. He finished the year with four receptions for 27 yards after coming to OSU in 2015 as the nation's 16th tight end according to the 247Sports Composite. The future is bright \nWhile both of those two have shown ability, the excitement for Buckeye fans should come in the potential of three four-star class of 2016 tight ends who are yet to showcase their ability in scarlet and gray. \nJake Hausmann is a Cincinnati product who was the fourth-ranked tight end in his class according to the 247Sports Composite. He was all-state as a senior at Archbishop Moeller, capping off a 95-reception, 1,349-yard, 17-touchdown high school career. \nLuke Farrell , out of Perry, OH, was the N0. 7 tight end in the class. As a senior at Perry, Farrell was named second-team all-state by the Associated Press and second-team all-USA Ohio by USA Today after catching 33 passes for 446 yards. \nMaple Heights' Kierre Hawkins played running back, wildcat quarterback, wide receiver and on defense to go along with his tight end duties. He was named third-team all-state by the Associated Press and the country's 11th-ranked tight end. \nAll three of these prospects excited the offensive coaching staff when they arrived at Ohio State and just because they didn't play during their first year on campus doesn't mean that potential is gone. A new philosophy \nA year ago, when co-offensive coordinator Ed Warinner moved from overseeing the offensive line to tight ends, the thought was he might get his position group more involved in the offense. While Warinner did this to some degree, tight ends caught seven more passes than the previous year, the group as a whole was not as active as discussed. \nWarinner is no longer with the program and Kevin Wilson has been hired as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. The Buckeyes are looking to expand the passing attack and the tight ends could have a role in that. \nWith all the talent at the position, Baugh, Alexander and the three second-year players, it would stand to reason to get these players involved more. If the Scarlet and Gray are to improve the passing game going forward, it should provide more opportunities for some players. Why not these talented tight ends? What spring could mean \nWith the need to get the passing game on track, it would make sense to have any potential pieces of that puzzle as large participants in spring. With that said, the coaching staff won't want players with high snap counts from last season run into the ground. They know what they have in Baugh, so he may not play as much in spring, but the others could get a chance to show their worth. \nIf enough is demonstrated from these players, or someone can showcase they can be a factor both receiving and blocking, Ohio State might feature a tight end more in the offense in 2017 than the program has had in recent memory. \nWhat's next for the Buckeyes?
