Ben Cardin last week, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch rattled off his favorite past justices. One was Robert Jackson, who dissented in a landmark case that allowed for the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. \n“He obviously did his homework with me,” Cardin (D-Md.) said of Gorsuch afterward. “He knew I would be favorably inclined to that type of discussion.” Story Continued Below \nIn nearly 60 meetings since he was nominated just three weeks ago, the Colorado appellate judge has chatted up senators about fishing and rafting. He’s distanced himself from the president who nominated him, Donald Trump, while lavishing praise on the jurist who could have had the job he now seeks: Merrick Garland. \nGorsuch and his allies are engineering a full-court charm offensive to win over Democrats soured by the GOP’s yearlong blockade of Garland, President Barack Obama’s final nominee to the Supreme Court. And there are signs it’s working — if not generating outright Democratic support, at least leaving the minority with little to latch on to so far. \nThe Senate Republican Conference even went so far as to post a video on Instagram of Gorsuch petting a furry Shih Tzu, with the caption: “One more reason you’ll love Judge Gorsuch: He loves dogs.” \n“He did a very good job in the meeting with me,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is being heavily courted by the pro-Gorsuch side, said in an interview. “He presents himself very well. I mean, he is very, very professional. Very smooth.” \nGorsuch isn't there yet: He still needs to win over eight Democrats and keep all 52 Republicans in line. There are 10 ripe Democratic targets: Senators up for reelection in states Trump won. But two of them have already said they would oppose Gorsuch. \nGorsuch has taken positions that Democrats say are problematic, such as siding with Hobby Lobby in its challenge of Obamacare’s contraception coverage requirement. But his biggest liability remains Trump, whom Democrats will seize on during the confirmation fight. Judiciary Committee hearings on the high court nomination start March 20 and are expected to last three or four days. By Rebecca Morin \n“We’re in a very chaotic time right now with a president who is really testing the separation of powers,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, said last week after meeting with Gorsuch. “I think we have to be very careful about what we are doing about judicial nominees today because of that.” \nWell aware of his political hurdles, Gorsuch is making every effort to leave a good first impression with senators. \nDuring his meeting with Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Gorsuch told the Illinois senator that he hoped he would be half the nominee that Garland was. Gorsuch mentioned that he accepted a speaking invitation before the Federalist Society to talk about criminal justice reform, a cause dear to Durbin. \nThe judge even shunned a National Review article he penned in 2005 charging that “liberals have become addicted to the courtroom.” Of the article, Gorsuch said he “wishes it would just disappear,” Durbin recalled. \nAsked whether he felt Gorsuch was saying these things merely to appease Democrats, Durbin responded: “This is a political world and that’s where he’s seeking his approval.” \nStill, Durbin said he would not rule out supporting the 10th Circuit judge for the Supreme Court, saying, “He has a hearing to get through and more questions to be answered.” \nGorsuch’s team is aiming to sit down privately with upward of 70 senators, or at least accommodate everyone who wants to meet with him. Since he was nominated by Trump on Jan. 31, Gorsuch has met with 58 senators, said former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Gorsuch’s so-called sherpa, or guide, through the confirmation process. \nSome swing-vote Democrats, such as Chris Coons of Delaware and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have asked for follow-up meetings to further explore Gorsuch’s record. \nTester, too, remains open to backing Gorsuch. The moderate Montana senator, who is up for reelection in 2018, said he pressed the nominee on the independence of the judiciary during his own sit-down and was pleased with Gorsuch’s answers. \nThat meeting occurred just after Trump blasted the judge who issued an injunction against his travel ban as a so-called jurist. Gorsuch called such remarks “demoralizing” and “disheartening” in repeated conversations with senators. That’s bought some goodwill from Democrats, although some are skeptical that the comments were choreographed to address one of the main question marks surrounding Gorsuch. \n“His reaction to that was positive, from my perspective,” Tester said. “Hopefully that was not pre-planned. If I ever found out it was pre-planned, I would vote against him in a minute.” (Ayotte said the comments weren’t stage-managed.)
