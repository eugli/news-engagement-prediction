Read More \nThe day after the FSA’s visit, the restaurant purchased a second vacuum packer and new clingfilm dispensers, as well as plastic aprons - worn over normal aprons - and plastic gloves. Andrew Nutter, pictured earlier this year \nThis week, Mr Nutter thanked customers for their loyalty since the inspection and told the M.E.N: “As we’ve previously stated, at The Bird at Birtle we take our health, safety and hygiene practices very seriously.” \nThe restaurant was handed a food hygiene rating of one - the second lowest score - following the December inspection, which meant ‘major improvement’ was necessary. \nThe inspector noted cleanliness in the kitchen was ‘reasonable could be better’ while food handling practices were criticised. \nThey wrote: “Risk of indirect and direct cross-contamination due to poor practices in the kitchen.” The Bird at Birtle \nThe report noted there were ‘no real controls in place’ in the kitchen’s ‘dual function area’ and suggested staff needed guidance on e-coli, a stomach bug, which ‘needs to be addressed’. \nThe same clingfilm roll was being used for both cooked and ready-to-eat foods while there were no plastic aprons or gloves, says the report. \nIt said there was inadequate procedure for cooling foods while notes at the end of the report again referred to ‘poor practices and controls’ in the use of the vacuum packing machine. \nStaff were ‘aware of all the issues and in some instances pointed them out’, according to the inspector, who adds: “Business has grown too quickly and management have not adapted to cope and adjust food safety procedures accordingly.” \nThe restaurant was launched following a £1m transformation amid a fanfare in June with special guests including Coronation Street star Antony Cotton, Hollyoaks favourite Kieron Richardson, selfie queen Karen Danczuk.

Read More \n“We were missing numerous forms of documentation, training logs and risk assessments. This has now been rectified, all other recommendations that were provided to us at the time - the majority of which related to paperwork - have also been actioned. \n\"The restaurant has also purchased additional kitchen equipment to exceed recommendations from the council. Andrew Nutter \n“We have worked closely with the council who have since revisited and are more than satisfied with the changes we’ve implemented. We are now awaiting a re-inspection. By law the council have to wait for three months before an official re-inspection can occur. They will then visit the establishment randomly to re-score. \n“At this point we hope to be achieving a rating that reflects our excellent processes and practices. \n“If any of our customers are concerned, we urge them to come and talk to us. We will happily show our them exactly how we work and the environment we work in. Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our loyal customers and friends who have supported us over these challenging past few weeks.” Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:44:41.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
