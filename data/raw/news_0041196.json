During a speech at Saturday night’s rally in Florida, President Donald Trump mentioned several countries that were having security issues — including Sweden, which apparently surprised the Swedes, BuzzFeed reported.\n>> Read more trending news\nSpeaking before a raucous, enthusiastic and cheering crowd in Melbourne, Trump said “we’ve got to keep our country safe.”\n“You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible,” Trump said. “You look at what’s happening in Brussels, you look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice, take a look at Paris.”\nOn Twitter, Swedes seemed confused.\n“Ask your president what happened in Sweden yesterday,” Jens Lennarttson tweeted. “We missed it.”\nSoon, #LastNightInSweden and #swedenincident began to trend on Twitter. People started tweeting to @Sweden, which is run by a different citizen each week, for answers. School librarian Emma Johansson was at the controls during Trump’s speech, and she assured tweeters that all was well in Sweden.\nTrump, discussing terror, seamlessly mentions incident \"last night in Sweden\".\nThere was NO \"incident\" in Sweden last night. pic.twitter.com/XtcC4PRiNU\n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 19, 2017 No. Nothing has happened here in Sweden. There has not ben any terrorist attacks here. At all.

So it's incorrect information on top of incorrect information.\n— @sweden / Emma (@sweden) February 19, 2017 Johansson was referencing an interview that Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran on Friday night's broadcast of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" with documentarian and media personality Ami Horowitz, who presented a clip from a new film documenting alleged violence committed by refugees in Sweden. The segment went on extensively about a supposed crime surge in Sweden and its links to immigrant populations, Business Insider reported.\nJohansson later said she compiled several tweets and provided a link to them.\nI repeat, please read this tweets I made on it, they're linked: https://t.co/22ocf6vzJF https://t.co/4BLUhxjGYe\n— @sweden / Emma (@sweden) February 19, 2017 Terrible news about the events in the #swedenincident .
