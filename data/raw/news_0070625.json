Lannan knew Cox’s wife, a ceramic artist, through their interaction at MudFire Clayworks in Decatur, Georgia. So, she reached out to Cox for his aerospace expertise. \nCox quickly agreed to help for two reasons: “They’re making a movie about space,” he said. “And, they’re making a movie about the engineers — not the astronauts.” Production still from Hidden Figures .

Principal photography on the behind-the-scenes film began in Atlanta in March 2016 and finished in May. \nSince its December release the film has grossed more than $160 million worldwide and has been nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress (Octavia Spencer). \nOnce Cox was on board, the set decorator sent him keywords from the script so he could see what math the characters were talking about. \n“I’m one of the people who — on the second or third time watching the movie — will pause the movie and look at what’s on the board,” Cox said. “So you want it to be right.” \nTo get it right, Cox went into NASA’s technical research database online and pulled documents that were published around that time — 1961 and 1962.

Goddard, is one of several vintage textbooks provided to film set decorator by Adam Cox. \nSo, Cox gathered approximately 30 books — some from his own collection and others borrowed from colleagues including his advisor, Regents Professor Dimitri Mavris. He chose books on math, structures, thermal analysis, and aerodynamics that engineers probably would have had in their office in the early 60s. The books were placed around the film sets. \nCox and his wife saw the movie a few weeks after it opened. Naturally, he looked to see if his contributions made it on screen. They did. \n“It's a great movie,” Cox said. “I'm proud to have had any part in it, especially one related to making it all historically and scientifically accurate.” VIDEO: scene from Hidden Figures The real life \"hidden figures.\" Left to right: Mary Jackson , Katherine Johnson , and Dorothy Vaughan . Photo credit: NASA Behind the Scenes with Adam Cox Photo of Adam Cox by Burak Bagdatli “I want to work for NASA and design things” is what Adam Cox wrote at age 10. He forgot he wrote that until he recently found it while looking through some old papers. \nCox grew up in Tullahoma, Tennessee, located in the southern middle part of the state, about halfway between Nashville and Chattanooga. He said he never wanted to be an astronaut, but he was always interested in the space program. \nHe was an intern with NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in 2011 while getting a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Tennessee Tech. During his internship, he got to watch the launch of the STS-133, the last mission of the Space Shuttle Discovery, from about three-and-a-half miles away. \nCox came to Georgia Tech in 2012 to pursue a master’s degree in aerospace engineering. \nIncidentally, the week he arrived at Tech for orientation, the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons had been transformed into “Google's headquarters” for filming another movie — The Internship , starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. \nNow in his second year of the Ph.D. program in aerospace engineering, Cox works in the Aerospace Systems Design Lab where he has done research for NASA, Boeing, Lockheed, and Airbus. He is working on his thesis proposal and hopes to earn his Ph.D. in spring or summer of 2018. \nCox said he doesn’t have a specific dream job, but he has experience in structural, manufacturing, and systems analysis and design. He is open to all opportunities, including working behind the scenes at NASA.
