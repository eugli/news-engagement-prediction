His criticism of Corbyn mirrored that made by Blair, who last week said “the debilitation of the Labour party is the facilitator of Brexit”. Many pro-EU Labour MPs blame Corbyn for not campaigning strongly enough for a ‘Remain’ vote. The Labour leader has in the past been eurosceptic - although he opposed Brexit at the referendum. His order that Labour MPs vote in favour of Brexit in parliament led to several resignations, including shadow business secretary Clive Lewis. Corbyn is facing a key test this week when votes go to the polls in Stoke and Copeland by-elections. Both seats are currently held by Labour, but the party is in a tough battle with the Tories and Ukip to retain them. Last night, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson re-opened internal party battle lines when he said he was working “every single day” to bring about Corbyn’s downfall. His comment came hours after a new ICM/Guardian opinion poll gave the Tories an 18-point lead over Labour.
