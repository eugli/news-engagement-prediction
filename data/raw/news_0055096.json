Then he's dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant.

The controversy led to Yiannopoulos resigning as an editor from the Breitbart News website, losing a book deal reportedly worth more than $200,000, and having a high-profile speech event canceled.\nHe has since apologized for the remarks and blamed the controversy on a \"cynical media witch hunt.\"\nMaher was criticized by his some fans and by some high-profile liberals for hosting Yiannopoulos, both when the booking was announced and after the show, for what many saw as a too-soft interview of the conservative provocateur.\nAsked by the Times what he thought of Yiannopoulos, Maher described him as an attention-seeker.\n\"He's the little impish, bratty kid brother,\" said Maher. \"And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner GOP lawmaker says protesters seeking '19 seconds of fame' \"You have a lot of people who are going to a town hall with no sense of decorum,\" Rep.
