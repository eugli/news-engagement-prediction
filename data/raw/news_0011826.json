February 5, 2017 Getty Images Whoever said acne was a teenage problem—and that after adolescence, you've got smooth, clear skin forever—was totally lying. Acne lingers long beyond puberty and is caused by a myriad of common skin problems. Pimples may pop up if acne runs in your family or because it's right before that time of the month. Breakouts may even appear after a day's worth of oil and bacteria build up on your face. While genetics and hormones are beyond your control, what you can rein in is your skincare regimen. It's time to step away from that same tube of spot cream you've been using since high school because there's a slew of new items in the beauty aisle to help clear up your skin. Courtesy of brand And an anti-microbial pillowcase that keeps bacteria at bay. We do most of our acne fighting in our sleep—after all, we're usually too busy covering it up during the day to actual heal any zits. SkinLaundry, a NYC facial bar (whose products just dropped at Sephora , too), has the SleepCycle Clean Sleep Pillow Case ($30, skinlaundry.com ), to fight breakouts while your sleep. It's charged with negative silver ions, which makes it anti-microbial—that means your pillowcase has less bacteria. Although there's no way to measure the difference, your skin will be noticeably smoother after sleeping on one for a few nights. Plus, it lasts up to 50 washes—that's almost a whole year of good skin. Courtesy of brand A protective patch that your can wear under makeup. If you have any kind of inflammatory acne—think red, puss-filled bumps—these stickers are life changing. Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers ($8, amazon.com ) are thick, gel covers that work like a sponge, absorbing oil and puss. You can actually see it working because the translucent patch turns white when the dressing needs to be changed. Bonus: It'll keep you from touching your zit, and you can even apply makeup over it, too. Courtesy of brand A LED light that kills acne-causing bacteria. When Mindy Kaling talks, we listen. And after she waxed poetic about the Tria Acne Clearing Blue Light ($149, triabeauty.com ), we knew it had to be a total bump-blaster. While dermatologists have been using LED light in-office to treat acne for over a decade, it's only recently that the FDA cleared the same technology for hand-held, at-home use. \"The P. acne bacteria produce special light-sensitive compounds called porphyrins,\" Dr. Whitney Bowe, a board certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. \"When you shine specific wavelengths of these compounds, the porphyrins are excited and then killed.\" A cleanser with the pH-balancing properties of baking soda. If blackheads are the bane of your existence, it's likely because of enlarged pores. Get the gunk out and shrink 'em with the proven power of baking soda, which is known to dry out any greasy spots. Instead of whipping up your own DIY recipe, try the new Biore Baking Soda Liquid Pore Cleanser ($7, ulta.com . Not only does this \"scrub\" deep clean without irritating skin, but since baking soda is amphoteric—meaning it's pH neutral—it helps to balance your skin's pH, another possible cause of acne. Courtesy of brand An acid-packed product that deflates cystic breakouts. \"Nodules and cysts are deeper than any other type of acne lesion,\" says Dr. Bowe. \"They're filled with a combination of puss and fluid, but don't try to pop them.\" By doing so, you'd be rupturing their contents deep in the skin and could likely cause scarring. For angry zits like these, Renee Rouleau Anti-Cyst Treatment ($42.50, reneerouleau.com ) is a miracle worker thanks to lactic acid and ethyl lactate, which help dissolve cell-blocking pores and decrease bacteria, respectively. Within hours of using, you'll see that big, bad cyst slowly creeping its way back down. Courtesy of brand A charcoal mask that clears out clogged pores. Despite our penchant for pudding, this is not the edible kind. Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment ($38, sephora.com ) contains activated charcoal (duh) that absorbs all kinds of impurities and clears out clogged pores. It also contains willowherb, an ultra-soothing ingredient to reduce any post-treatment inflammation. The spatula for application that comes with it makes the whole treatment feel, well, pretty luxurious. Keep a jar of it for a rainy spa day at home. A salicylic acid spot treatment that won't dry out your skin. Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment ($12, target.com ) was released last year, and it's the best spot treatment we've ever used, which is some seriously high praise. Not only does it contain the classic salicylic acid, which exfoliates and decreases inflammation, says Dr. Bowe; but it also contains sandalwood oil to calm inflammation and counteract any dryness from the active ingredients. This treatment is a major steal: It's super affordable and it works on every type of zit including blackheads, whiteheads, and even angry papules. A zinc-infused serum that controls oil. Appriya Mineral Complex Serum ($239, appriya.com ) is basically perfect skin bottled. Because it's a serum, the formula has several hydrating ingredients like aloe and horse chestnut extract. But it's also got zinc, which reduces sebum production, along with evening primrose seed extract, a natural anti-inflammatory. Just one or two drops does the trick, so here, a little goes a very long way. Skin Getting on a plane?
