She Went With A Familiar Name Source: Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images By Amy Sciarretto 2 hours ago \nFor her 2017 Super Bowl Halftime performance, Lady Gaga brought it . But did anyone really think she wouldn't ? Mother Monster rocked the stage during her 13-minute performance. Her entire look was dramatically Gaga and she opted for sparkly silver makeup that looked like a masquerade ball mask over her eyes. It matched her long-sleeved, silver, and statement shouldered bodysuit and boots. She also painted her pout with bright and classic red lipstick. So, who did Lady Gaga's makeup for Super Bowl 51 and what products were used? \nGaga's makeup artist for The Big Game was Sarah Tanno , who also did the singer's makeup last year when she performed the National Anthem. Tanno recently posted a photo of Gaga from Super Bowl 50 , during which she rocked a sequined, custom, and red Gucci suit, with matching sparkling eyeshadow. Tanno's caption asked fans what type of makeup they should do for the Halftime Show. \nTanno clearly had been thinking about Ma Monster's look for weeks and she opted to do high drama eyes and lips. When Gaga sat to perform \"A Million Reasons\" at the piano, she revealed lashes for days. \nGaga also wore Marc Jacobs Beauty products, as well. The brand confirmed beforehand in an Instagram post that Gaga's look would be created by Tanno using their repertoire of cosmetics.

Gaga slayed the Super Bowl. Her look was dramatic in all the right ways. Source: marcbeauty on Instagram \nHere was the pre-game confirmation. Since Marc Jacobs Beauty is sold at Sephora, you can replicate or create a variation of Gaga's Super Bowl 51 look for more IRL circumstances! \nWhile Gaga's makeup is so often dramatic, as it was during her performance at The Big Game, I love that her Super Bowl press conference look was so... soft and wearable.
