Tigard athlete Braden Lenzy announced that he has committed to Notre Dame, becoming the eleventh member of Notre Dame‚Äôs 2018 class, and the fifth addition since Feb. 13. Lenzy is the seventh Rivals250 player to join the Irish class.\nGod, Country, Notre Dame! #IrishBouND18 üçÄüçÄ pic.twitter.com/NQDPdRLWsm\n‚Äî Braden Lenzy (@blspeedy21) February 23, 2017 Lenzy knew when he visited South Bend on Feb. 11 that Notre Dame was the place he wanted to be. It felt like home.\n\"The family feel honestly,\" Lenzy said of why he chose Notre Dame. \"When I was there I felt so welcomed and it was just so easy to see myself there.\"\nLenzy is a big addition to the class. Rivals rates him as the No. 21 athlete in the class of 2018, and the No. 238 overall player in the nation.\nFollowing his junior season, Lenzy was named to OregonLive.com's 6A All-State second team as a defensive back, and a was an honorable mention as a wide receiver. Notre Dame is recruiting him to play the X position in its offense, and it sold him on the opportunity for early playing time ... and touches.\n\"Outside receiver and to get the ball in space and play early,\" Lenzy said, referring to what Notre Dame sold him on from a football standpoint.\nA two-way player, Lenzy built strong relationships with wide receiver coach DelVaughn Alexander and defensive backs coach Todd Lyght . He will begin his career on he offensive side of the ball, and taking him away from that spot could be difficult.\nOregon and Indiana obviously have significant distance between each other, but Lenzy and his family have deep ties to the Hoosier state, and he stated from the beginning that distance would not play a factor in his decision. His father - Melvin Lenzy - is a native of Ohio and a Purdue graduate.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BGI_CoreyBodden", "https://twitter.com/BGI_LouSomogyi", "https://twitter.com/blspeedy21/status/834579680430694400", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IrishBouND18?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BGInews", "https://twitter.com/BGI_MattJones", "https://t.co/NQDPdRLWsm", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/llt5epx0mrt177lzvsb1)", "http://bluegoldonline.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/blueandgoldillustrated", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/me3r1vvpn40wiarojtsc", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/me3r1vvpn40wiarojtsc)", "https://twitter.com/BGI_CoachD78", "https://twitter.com/BGI_DMcKinney", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/llt5epx0mrt177lzvsb1", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/blue-gold-illustrated-notre/id429677585?mt=2"], "published": "2017-02-23T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:04:27.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
