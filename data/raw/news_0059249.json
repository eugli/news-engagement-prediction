Tickets for the two opening days have already sold out, suggesting interest in Diana will never die. \nThe exhibit doesn't include everything she ever wore; she auctioned off many of her outfits for charity before she died, and more were auctioned to collectors after she died. But there are 25 outfits, plus designers' sketches of their outfits. \nSome of these frocks were especially memorable, if for nothing else than that they were all too reflective of deep-1980s fashion. \nTake a look: \nThe White House dress \nPrincess Diana, watched by President Reagan and wife Nancy, dances with John Travolta at the White House, on Nov. 9, 1985.

The next day, dramatic photos of the two poised on the dance floor dominated front-pages around the world. \nThe White House dress on display in exhibit of 25 dresses and outfits worn Princess Diana, in 'Diana: Her Fashion Story' at Kensington Palace in London.

Diana turned to Walker again a year before her death for this red day suit to launch an AIDS charity appeal in 1996. Walker called these outfits a \"royal uniform\" for Diana, who was an early leader of the campaign to fight AIDS and support its victims. \nAlways aware of the snapping paparazzi, Diana smiles as she walks past them in London in October 1996 in this poppy-red Catherine Walker suit.

The boxy suit by Emanuel, designer of her wedding gown, featured a coat and skirt in green, blue and black wool, plus a big hat. The look was supposed to be trendy at the time but critics did not consider it one of Diana's fashion successes. \nPrince Charles and Princess Diana in Venice in 1985, and the blue tartan jacket by Emanuel in the exhibit.

At the time, in August 1981, Charles wore the traditional kilt worn by royal men while in Scotland; Diana wore a casual, comfortable brown tweed woolen day-suit by designer Bill Pashley. \nPrince Charles and Princess Diana in Scotland on their honeymoon in 1989, and her brown tweed suit by Bill Pashley in the exhibit.
