Beyoncé and Jay Z's adorable 5-year-old daughter (and soon-to-be big sister !) attended the show dressed as a miniature version of late singer and fashion icon Prince , and the level of cuteness sent us into brief cardiac arrest. Blue sat on her dad's lap in the audience just like she did at the 2014 VMAs . Although her pint-size suit wasn't Prince's signature purple color, the white ruffled shirt and pendant were a perfect way to honor him. Not exactly a surprise after seeing how she slayed her Michael Jackson costume a few years ago!
