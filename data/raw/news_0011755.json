Making the best of it, she moved on to the traditional promo for the musical guest, declaring, “I’m sorry, and Alessia Cara is also here, and I’ll never come back!”\nAs the show segued to the next sketch, she was seen pacing in frustration as cast members Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant offered reassuring hugs.\nEarlier in the monologue, Stewart reflected on old, pre-presidency tweets by Donald Trump condemning her for cheating on boyfriend and “Twilight” co-star Robert Pattinson. The opening scene brought back Alec Baldwin as Trump, making impolitic calls to world leaders under the guidance of advisor Steve Bannon, costumed like the Grim Reaper. Baldwin will host next week’s episode.\nLater in the show, frequent host and Plainfield native Melissa McCarthy made a surprise cameo with a bravura takedown of White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Never cracking a smile, the unhinged spokesman bellowed arguments about the use of the word “ban,” locked up CNN’s correspondent in a cage and assaulted pushy reporters by using his lectern as a battering ram.\nDescribing the crowd that witnessed the announcement of a new Supreme Court justice earlier in the week, the mock Spicer insisted that “the men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left AND right!”\n“SNL” writer Katie Rich, the Chicagoan whose jokey tweet referencing Trump’s young son Barron stirred outrage on social media, was again absent from the credits, signalling her indefinite suspension two weeks ago remains in effect.\nAs for Stewart’s f-bomb, it was nothing new for the show that for 42 seasons has toed a line between edgy comedy and a signal that’s usually (although not always) live:\n• In 1979, Paul Shaffer was playing a music producer prone to using the word “flogging” during his frequent tirades. At one point he forgot to say the euphemism and said the real thing.\n• A running gag in a 1981 episode spoofed the “Who Shot J.R.?” plotline on “Dallas” by offering that someone had pumped some lead into cast member Charles Rocket. During the goodbyes in the show’s final moment, he shouted, “I’d like to know who the f— did it!,” as host Charlene Tilton went wide-eyed. Most of that disastrous cast was axed after the next weekend’s episode.\n• As he anchored Weekend Update in 1997, Norm Macdonald remarked on a weird catch in his throat with, “What the f— was that?” Later that year he was slid off the Update desk, for a variety of reasons.\n• The one-season run of featured player Jenny Slate is best remembered for the 2009 scene — on her very first episode — where she was supposed to repeatedly say “frickin’ ” and eventually slipped up. She has gone on to a successful character actor career on TV and in movies.\n saturday-night-live Kristen Stewart", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nup_177124_0002-e1486270300264.jpg?w=100", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-21vw", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-5-29-13-am.png?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-12-37-48-pm.png?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/8n96_d001_12151r_cmyk.jpg?w=100"], "published": "2017-02-05T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:10:08.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
