I must say to the credit of the ADMK, they sat quietly. One of the MLAs was beaten up, but still he kept quiet. Anybody who displayed Gandhian character, at least in this incident, was the ADMK and it was the DMK which evicted the Speaker from the chair. It was all done by the DMK and it has discredited itself. It is not something new for DMK. It has done before when they tried to disrobe Jayalalithaa in the Assembly in 1990,\" Swamy told ANI. \nSwamy further hailed the decision of the Tamil Nadu Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao to appoint Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the Chief Minister of the state, adding that Rao did the wrong thing by not giving vote of office to V.K Sasikala. \n\"It was very clear from day one that the numbers are with Sasikala. At the time when Sasikala was qualified, the Governor did the wrong thing by not giving her vote of office. But, anyway, after some time he had made up his mind. He is a man of honesty, integrity, learning and he comes from a good family. So, I think, perhaps those whom he felt friends might have influenced him, but he ultimately came on the right line and did exactly what I thought should be done.\" \nPalanisamy yesterday won the vote of confidence with 122 MLAs supporting him amidst the uproar in the assembly. \nThe Tamil Nadu assembly witnessed a huge ruckus yesterday during the floor test with DMK working president M.K. Stalin alleging that his shirt was torn off when the assembly police forcefully evicted his party MLAs and the Speaker tore of his shirt himself and blamed the MLAs of the DMK for it. \n\"We were told that assembly will reconvene at 3 p.m., but at 2 p.m. police came and tried to forcefully evict us. My shirt was also torn,\" Stalin said. \nEarlier, the Congress staged a walk out from the assembly, while Speaker P. Dhanapal ordered the assembly police to evict the (DMK) MLAs from the house as soon as the assembly resumed functioning after getting adjourned following an uproar over the secret ballot process. \n\"You tore my shirt and insulted me. I am doing my work abiding by the law,\" Speaker Dhanapal was quoted, as saying to the MLAs. \nPalanisamy took oath as Tamil Nadu`s 13th Chief Minister on Thursday. A total of 31 other All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MLAs were also sworn in.
