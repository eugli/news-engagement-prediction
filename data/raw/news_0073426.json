The Counting On stars recently returned to Central America , but rather than being focused on their mission, people seem more concerned with how they're funding it. \nSpecifically, people are being critical of the couple openly asking for donations to cover their living expenses while living in the tropical area. \nIn a blog post, the Dillards asked fans to consider donating to their cause, saying, \"We hope you'll consider partnering with us in this mission ... In addition to the ministry outreach expenses, there are always monthly expenses for groceries, utilities, fuel, healthcare, etc.\" \nMore from CafeMom: Jill Duggar & Derick Dillard Respond to Jessa's Unusual Baby Name Choice \nThey also assured fans that they live frugally, and only need about $24,000 to cover costs for this leg of their trip. Which seems like a lot to us, considering that they plan to return to the states in just a few months to have their second baby boy, due in July. But you know, maybe it costs more to live in a developing nation like El Salvador than we realize. \nAnyway, fans asked why they should be asked to donate, instead of Derick and Jill self-funding. They do get paychecks from TLC after all, not to mention the fact that they are able-bodied adults who just spent half a year in the states on a mission trip sabbatical. \n\"Sorry Dillards, but I don't want to hear your moaning about having to take donations, when TLC is sending your wife checks for being on camera,\" stated one commenter. Another responded, \"Her parents are those famous debt-free millionaires ... Plus you have the physical ability to work! Not everyone does.\" \nMore from CafeMom: Jill Duggar May Be Even More Sick Than Her Ailing Husband \nOf course it's not just the money that has fans questioning their return to Central America. As we said, Jill is pregnant with her second child ... so why is she putting her baby at risk by traveling to a Zika virus hotbed? The CDC has recommended that pregnant women not travel to well-known Zika territories, since the virus has been shown to cause severe birth defects or even death in unborn children. \nWe're not saying that the Dillards shouldn't follow their hearts to minister to the people of El Salvador. But maybe they should think twice about asking their fans to fund it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:18:01.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
