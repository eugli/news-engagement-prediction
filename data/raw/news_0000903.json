(@theveilbrewing) on Jan 22, 2017 at 4:25pm PST \nOreo . . . beer? Yes, it's now a thing, thanks to The Veil Brewing Co. in Richmond, VA. The brewery just released a chocolate milk stout called Hornswoggler ($17 per 4-pack) that is \"conditioned\" (fermented) with \"hundreds of pounds of Oreo cookies,\" Veil Brew Co. says in a recent Instagram post. They also note that there may be \"some residual fermentable sugars from the cookies in the beer\" — aka Oreo friggin' icing , which can be seen in the photo below. This means the beer needs to be consumed ASAP and kept extremely cold. Fox reports that the canned Oreo beer is sold out , but according to the brewery, you can still order it on tap , at least for the next few days. If a spontaneous trip to Virginia isn't in the cards, you can always start eBaying like a mad person or try New Belgium + Ben and Jerry's Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Dough-Flavored Ale . The Veil Brewing takes dessert beer to the next level. 'Hornswoggler' Choco milk stout, aged on Oreo cookies.
