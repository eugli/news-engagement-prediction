She posted a photo of the vandalised door on Facebook on January 31, saying: \"Was it religious or political or just nasty?\"\n\"The thing is,\" she added, \"this isnâ€™t my community. This is happening in my community, but I will not judge my community based on the worst of actions.\"\nMs Zettle says she prepared to paint over the swastika, then had a change of heart: \"I decided that some random idiot was not going to make me paint my door and I wanted to answer back,\" she wrote, adding: \"Look, usually blind optimism and this level of naivete make me a little nauseous, too.\"\nS he then covered the symbol with a piece of cardboard, on which she'd written a quotation from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, spoken by the character Dumbledore: \"Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.\"\nExplaining her reasons for sharing the photos on Facebook, Ms Zettle said: \"What I really want is for people to see that this happened in our community. It happened to someone they know. And so maybe the next time they hear something in line at the grocery store they will say 'no, thank you...not here, not today, not ever.'\"\nThe next day she replaced the sign with a quote from Martin Luther King: \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\"\nMs Zettle added a Martin Luther King quote to the door Credit: Erin Zettle T hanking her friends and community for rallying behind her, Ms Zettle wrote: \"Having the quote on the door ... helped, in a cathartic way. So I changed it up, and I think I'll keep changing it.\"\nWatch | Protester disrupts Trump speech with swastika golfballs 01:15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:34:10.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
