And a Vancouver outfit with only seven notable players under 25, including defenceman Chris Tanev and goalie Jacob Markstrom, both 24, had missed the playoffs for the first time in six years.\nDraft-day deals Top scorers Henrik and Daniel Sedin were 33, and leading the transition by helping their younger teammates adapt to the NHL game, along with fellow forwards Chris Higgins, 30, and Ryan Kesler, 29.\n\"We needed to bring in a new core group of players in the 22-28 range,\" Benning recalled. \"There was a gap in talent that needed to be filled so we could be competitive and the kids could develop in a competitive environment.\"\nFive weeks later, Benning went to work on the draft floor in Philadelphia, making four trades and adding right-wingers Derek Dorsett (28), Nick Bonino (26) and Linden Vey (23) along with defencemen Luca Sbisa (25) and first-, second- and third-round picks in that draft.\nHe would later acquire left-winger Sven Baertschi from Calgary at the March 2015 trade deadline and dealt Bonino that summer to Pittsburgh for centre Brandon Sutter. Last February, Benning added more depth up the middle, picking up Markus Granlund from Calgary for 2013 first-round pick Hunter Shinkaruk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:10:46.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
