The world is more beautiful the more you accept,\" followed by the hashtag #weaccept. \nPreviously, CEO Brian Chesky offered \"free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S.\" on behalf of the company following the ban announcement. \nI n a statement , the tech company, whose app helps people find lodging, doubled down on that offer: \"Today we're setting a goal to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need.\" \nThere has been a growing rift between the Trump administration and several large US companies, especially in the technology sector, which include many immigrants in their ranks and have lobbied for fewer immigration restrictions. \nNo matter who you are, where you're from, who you love, or who you worship, you deserve to belong https://t.co/WufQUWkYXs #weaccept — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) 6 February 2017 \nT he statement, signed by the company's founders, acknowledged \"challenges\" faced by the company in the past. \n\"The painful truth is that guests on Airbnb have experienced discrimination , something that is the very opposite of our values.
