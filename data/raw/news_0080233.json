Abu Sayyaf extremists in the Philippines have released a video of the beheading of Kantner. The brief video circulated Monday, Feb. 27, by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, is the first sign that the brutal militants proceeded with their threat to kill Kantner in the southern Philippines after a Sunday ransom deadline lapsed. (SITE Intel Group via AP) \nPresident Duterte apologized to the German government on Tuesday for the death of a German hostage whose gruesome beheading over the weekend was publicly released by the militant Abu Sayyaf group. \n“I am very sorry that the hostage, a national of your country, has been beheaded,” President Duterte said in Malacañang. “I sympathize with the family, I commiserate with the German people. There is nothing wrong in admitting a failure, but it is a matter of policy that we do not surrender to the demands of paying ransom.” \nHe stressed that a massive military operation has been going on in southern Jolo island to crush the Abu Sayyaf, which on Monday released a short video showing the death of Jürgen Kantner. The gunmen had given his family and the German government until Sunday to pay a P30-million ransom. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs assured the German government that Manila would do its utmost to bring the perpetrators to justice. \n“We condemn, in the strongest terms, this cruel and inhuman act by the Abu Sayyaf group and reiterate our firm resolve to oppose terrorism in all its forms,” foreign affairs spokesperson Charles Jose said, adding that Manila was “greatly saddened” by the development. \nHe called Kantner’s kidnapping and beheading a “senseless act of violence.” \nKantner was seized three months ago while traveling with his partner, Sabine Merz, on their yacht near Jolo island. Merz was found dead aboard the couple’s yacht. Both had previously been held by Somali pirates in 2008, and released after ransom was reportedly paid. \nA video released earlier this month by the Abu Sayyaf showed Kantner appealing for his life, saying the gunmen would behead him if they did not receive a ransom. \nLast year, the Abu Sayyaf beheaded two Canadian hostages. \nThe Philippine National Police on Tuesday urged the public to stop spreading the video of Kantner’s beheading, saying his family and friends deserved respect at this time of grief. \n“As we mourn the loss of Mr. Kantner, we earnestly appeal to netizens, internet subscribers and mobile phone users to please refrain from propagating the video clip of Mr. Kantner’s murder,” PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos said. \nGov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao on Tuesday urged Muslims in the south to “stop pretending” that abductions were not happening in their communities and actively help authorities by speaking out against the Abu Sayyaf. \n“This is not the first act of terror that the ASG (Abu Sayyaf group) has committed,” he said. “And this will not be the last if we continue to turn a blind eye and deaf ears to the crimes of those who betray our faith and our people.” \nHe said the Abu Sayyaf has been espousing “jihad” or religious war based on the wrong interpretation of Koranic verses. \nAlso on Tuesday, President Duterte presented before the media Rexon Romoc, 8, who was freed by the Abu Sayyaf after being held for seven months. He was abducted along with his parents, who were subsequently released after paying ransom. \nPresidential peace adviser Jesus Dureza said the child was freed after officials in Sulu interceded on his behalf. — WITH REPORTS FROM JEANNETTE I.
