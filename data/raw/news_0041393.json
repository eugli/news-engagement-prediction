The price China’s rural bachelors must pay to get a wife \nThe same study four years ago, which maps out the average cost of betrothal gifts in cities across China, found that a groom only had to give 10,000 yuan in cash and other gifts to gain his prospective in-laws’ blessing. \nThe exchange of betrothal gifts has been part of Chinese wedding tradition since ancient times. However, China’s population control policies along with some Chinese families’ traditional preference to have sons rather than daughters have created a demographic imbalance. \nThe increasing shortage of women in recent years has caused the groom’s family to pay significantly more for betrothal gifts. \nThe increase in cost is most acutely felt by families in the north, particularly in provinces surrounding Beijing. A man in Baoding in Hebei Province told the newspaper that each groom in his village has to give cash in different coloured notes, which symbolise a colourful wedding and marriage. \nHe said in order to achieve that each groom ends up paying the bride’s family a cash gift made up of 10,000 five-yuan bills, 1,000 100-yuan bills and an additional stash of 50-yuan bills. The total amount given is always a minimum of 150,000 yuan, he said. \nWhat price true love? - groom in China pays bride’s parents millions for permission to marry \nHowever, the study revealed that the cost of betrothal gifts in some southern cities has levelled and even started to fall compared with four years ago. \nIt suggested that brides in the south may have a higher chance of marrying somebody whose families have lived in the same area for sometime. This meant a daughter would stay in the district and her family would be less inclined to demand more money as a betrothal gift, the report said. \nThe study showed that the cost of betrothal gifts in Shanghai has remained about the same over the past four years. Yingde, a city in Guangdong province, has experienced a 90 per cent drop in the cost of betrothal gifts over the past 35 years, with the groom having to pay less than 20,000 yuan in cash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:04:18.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
