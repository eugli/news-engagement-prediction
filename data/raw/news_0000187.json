AP/Aaron Favila, File \nMANILA, Philippine — President Rodrigo Duterte will issue a formal order limiting the number of security aides of local executives, saying too many bodyguards allow them to commit abuses. \nDuterte noted that some mayors are involved in illegal drugs but they remain untouchable because of their political connections and security aides. \n“I will go back to the Alunan doctrine. They are only allowed one or two security,” the president said during the oath taking of newly promoted military generals Tuesday in Malacañan. \nHe was referring to Rafael Alunan III who served as Interior secretary of former President Fidel Ramos. \n“Mayors and governors if you are afraid to die, you resign,” Duterte said. \nDuterte said politicians who are accompanied by several vehicles are likely to be involved in illegal drugs. Headlines   \n“Especially in Mindanao, I do not want to offend but that is true. When you travel with 10 cars, you have 10 cars, all of them armed, almost all of them have drugs and that has been proven time and again,” he said. \nDuterte has instructed Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to draft the order. He said he is ready to comply with the Alunan doctrine as he does not need too many bodyguards. \n“If they say the president should be included, it’s okay. I traveled (via) commercial (plane), I do not need any…Basta may tao lang mag-tingin sa akin sa likod, one in front, tapos na (As long as there is someone looking out in front of me or behind me, I’m contented with that),” he said.
