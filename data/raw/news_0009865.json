Bernstein via Getty Images \nWASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) does not think President Donald Trump has committed any impeachable offenses ― yet. \nPelosi held a press conference on Monday with the top Democrats on the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters of California and other Democrats to discuss Trump’s recent efforts to undermine financial regulations. \nWaters got a question about a recent comment where she said her “greatest desire is to lead him right into impeachment.” \nAsked if it was appropriate to be talking about impeachment, Waters said she had not called for impeachment yet. “He’s doing it himself,” she said. \nWaters mentioned Trump’s travel ban and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “He is leading himself into that kind of position, where folks will begin to ask, ‘What are we going to do?’ And the answer is going to be, eventually, ‘We’ve got to do something about it.’” Waters said. “We cannot continue to have a president who’s acting in this manner. It is dangerous to the United States of America.” \nPelosi was then asked if she agreed with Waters, and while she agreed that Waters’ litany of complaints were “grounds for displeasure,” she stopped short of advocating impeachment. \nPelosi said Trump had acted in a way that is “strategically incoherent, that is incompetent, and that is reckless.” \n“And that is not grounds for impeachment,” Pelosi continued. “When and if he breaks the law, that is grounds for when something like that would come up.” \nPelosi then tried to get back on the subject of Trump slashing banking regulations and targeting the Dodd-Frank banking law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats dinged Trump for signing two items on Friday ― one directive that curtails elements of Dodd-Frank , and another memoranda that allows financial advisers to steer investments toward products that benefit them, not the consumer. \nDemocrats argued that Trump had campaigned on the message that he would be tough on Wall Street, but now was cozying up to bankers and trying to aid their interests at the expense of another potential market collapse. \nAs Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said, “On the issues of Wall Street and big banks, Trump sounded like he was Bernie Sanders. He’s not creating an administration that looks like Goldman Sachs.” \n“Instead of fighting for hardworking families abused by our economy as he promised in the campaign,” Pelosi said, “the president and his billionaire cabinet have abandoned Main Street to enable Wall Street’s corrosive profiteering of the banks on the back of hardworking Americans.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:46:58.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
