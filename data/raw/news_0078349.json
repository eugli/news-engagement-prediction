The areas in Permatang Damar Laut and Batu Maung which will be affected by water disruption on Saturday are marked in yellow. The red markings indicate connection works on the seven water supply pipes. \nThe areas affected are Residence@Southbay, Kampung Batu Maung, Lengkok Batu Maung and nearby areas, Sunway Mutiara, Taman Bidara, Medan Batu Maung and nearby areas, Taman Sunway Tunas Jaya, and Taman Gembira. \nPenang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) chief executive officer Datuk Jaseni Maidinsa said about 12,000 people would be affected and advised residents in the affected areas to store adequate water during the disruption. \n“Affected consumers are advised to store sufficient water for the over 12-hour period. \n“The disruption is necessary as we will be connecting seven water supply pipes in Permatang Damar Laut and Batu Maung. \n“These pipe connections are necessary to accommodate the ongoing JKR road upgrading works in the area,” he said in a press statement yesterday. \nJaseni said the works required a temporary shutdown of the 600mm mild steel pipeline delivering water supply to those areas. \n“All seven connections at seven separate locations will be carried out simultaneously. \n“This is to ensure precise and timely completion, as well as resumption of normal water supply as scheduled within the 12 hours,” he said. \nJaseni said the seven pipes would divert the water supply delivery system from piling and construction sites. \n“It will also ensure that the water supply in these areas will not be adversely affected by JKR’s ongoing works and expedite the completion of the Batu Maung to Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah road upgrading works,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:01:50.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
