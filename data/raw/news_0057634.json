Omolade, a businesswoman, accused her husband of always drinking to stupor, adding that whenever she scolded him, he would turn it to a fight. \n“My husband always comes home around 1:00 a.m., drunk and whenever I cautioned him, he fights me,” she said. She, however, denied stealing her husband’s money and lamented that he used to call her a barren woman. \n“My husband always calls me a barren woman but I had three children during the 13 years of our marriage, but they all died,” she said. \nThe respondent begged the court not to grant her husband’s wish that she still love him. The court president, Mr Adegboyega Omilola, ordered the respondent to release the petitioner’s car key within one hour. \nHe later adjourned the case to April 4 for further hearing.
