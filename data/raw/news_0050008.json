By Matt Miller Feb 21, 2017 The Game of Thrones actors have become rich and famous award winners thanks to the unbelievable success of HBO's fantasy series. But that doesn't mean this all comes without a price. According to Page Six , the weather conditions on the set of Season Seven have been pretty damn horrible the past few weeks. \nThey have been shooting amid 100-mph winds and a minus 25 Centigrade (minus 13 Fahrenheit) wind chill. A source on the set said, \"Daylight is scarce here [five to six hours a day]. Super jeeps are needed to bring in equipment, and much is then transported by hand ... The actors are made up and dressed in hotels and driven to location 90 percent ready to shoot ... Shelter is provided by 'Russian tents' that are anchored down, and able to be heated, and [can] withstand 100 mph winds.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Not fun! According to the report, the winds have been so bad that it has been difficult to record dialogue between characters. Last Summer, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss pushed back the Season Seven premiere date . \"We're starting a bit later because at the end of this season, 'Winter is here' and that means that sunny weather doesn't really serve our purposes any more,\" they said. \"So we kind of pushed everything down the line, so we could get some grim grey weather even in the sunnier places that we shoot.\" Well, they got exactly what they wanted. But hopefully this extreme weather didn't put the show behind schedule again. On the bright side, sacrificing his health for his art got Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar. All he had to do was sleep inside a dead animal and nearly die . Alternately, everyone who's filming on that islet off the coast of Spain is probably enjoying themselves.
