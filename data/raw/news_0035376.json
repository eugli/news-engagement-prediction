Immediately after water exposure, the skin is maximally hydrated, and while some of that hydration will evaporate quickly, moisture levels can be sealed in with a thick moisturizer.\" \nLighter moisturizers will suffice in the spring and summer, since there's more humidity in the air. For the colder months ahead, though, you'll want to swap in a heavier-duty option. \n\"In general, a winter moisturizer should be a thicker cream rather than a gel or serum-type moisturizer, unless your skin is oily,\" Dr. Tanzi said. \nEveryone's skin is different. Some people are prone to getting blemishes, while others have extremely dry skin year- round. There's no miracle moisturizer that works wonders on all skin types. So we talked with Dr. Tanzi about the key ingredients to look for in a winter moisturizer and found great options for every skin type.
