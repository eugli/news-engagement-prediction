TNN | Feb 8, 2017, 09.50 AM IST Highlights India, the top ranked Test team, have gone 18 matches without defeat This is Bangladeshâ€™s first Test in India, more than 16 years on from when they made their debut in the five-day format With Ajinkya Rahane returning, Karun Nair will have to make way and Jayant Yadav will return, taking the place of the injured Amit Mishra NEW DELHI: Mushfiqur Rahim , captain of the Bangladesh cricket team, has sought to play down comparisons between the upcoming one-off Test match against India in Hyderabad and his country's inaugural Test match against India back in 2000. But despite his strong views of this not being a historic match, there is an air of uniqueness hovering this match starting February 9 because it is Bangladesh's first Test in India, more than 16 years on from when they made their debut in the five-day format. Why Bangladesh have not been invited to play a Test on Indian soil remains a matter of conjecture - financial value is the likeliest reason - but Mushfiqur is determined to change perceptions of his team and force the BCCI to invite his team more often. Bangladesh are coming off successive defeats in New Zealand, but assume a tougher cloak in Asia and did, after all, beat England in their last Test at home in October. Getting his players to produce that sort of cricket is paramount for Mushfiqur, especially given the nature of this one-off Test.

They last won an overseas Test in Zimbabwe in 2013, and overall have only won three of 44 away Tests, the other two being against a severely depleted West Indies in 2009. India, the top ranked Test team, have gone 18 matches without defeat. At home, under Kohli, they have swept South Africa, New Zealand and England. They have Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja as forces to reckon with, and other players capable of turning matches in a session. They intend to continue an unbeaten home season with victory here, and then against Australia who will land soon for four Tests. The odds are stacked against Bangladesh.
