DeMarcus Cousins (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:08 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:08 p.m. ET \nThe DeMarcus Cousins saga in Sacramento may soon take another turn. \nAccording to The Vertical , the Kings have held trade discussions with the Pelicans involving Cousins, who is currently in New Orleans for the All-Star game. \nMORE: Wizards reportedly could be active before trade deadline \nCousins has gone through a lot in Sacramento — from requesting a trade in 2016, to fighting with coaches, to ultimately making peace with the Kings organization earlier this season. But it appears it's the Kings have doubts about the three-time all-star's future in Sacramento. \nMichael Scotto of Basketball Insiders reported Sunday that the Pelicans and Kings have discussed a Cousins trade for New Orleans' 2016 first-round pick Buddy Hield and multiple Pelicans first-round draft picks. \nAcquiring Cousins to pair up with Anthony Davis — both former Kentucky stars — is an interesting move for New Orleans, one that could present a handful of problems. Both big men prefer to play facing to the basket, sometimes even on the perimeter. Neither are especially good ball-handlers in the open court, which means the Pelicans would still need to find the towering duo a distributor to set up shots. \nCousins signed a 4-year deal worth nearly $66 million before the 2014-15 season. He is under contract for the remainder of this season and next season, when he will make just over $18 million. The Pelicans would likely want assurances from Cousins in regard to a contract extension before pulling the trigger on a trade. \nCousins' agent, Jarinn Akana, held firm that Cousins is not going anywhere. \n\"We met with Vlade Divac (vice president of basketball operations and general manager of the Kings) and ownership, and they assured us and DeMarcus that he's not being traded,\" Akana said, via The Vertical. \"As far as we're concerned, nothing has changed.\" \nSacramento (24-33) entered the All-Star break ninth in the Western Conference standings. \nTrading Cousins would likely end any hopes of making the postseason, but they are not title contenders, anyway. \nThis rumored trade will have a lot of moving parts, but it's worth watching with New Orleans desperate to help Davis, and Sacramento urgent to fix a struggling franchise.
