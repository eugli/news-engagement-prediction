He suggests owners install Murphy beds that can be stowed away when guests arrive.\n\"You'd still have a massive living room,\" he said.\nThere are 40 units on the two main floors as well as a penthouse that looks perfect for an intergalactic crime lord, which happens to be owned by the building's architect, Sasa Radulovic.\n\"On a day like this I guess we're taking the brunt of it. In summer it's gorgeous,\" said Penner. \"You can see the sky.\"\nBut will extraterrestrials take the bait and move in to the Disraeli mothership?\n\"I've met a few of the owners and very few of them seem to be from another planet, so I guess that will remain to be seen,\" said Penner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:19:37.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
