At least 20 children are believed to be among the dead, the head of Sehwan’s medical facility Moeen Uddin Siddiqui said.\nAt 3.30 am the shrine’s caretaker stood among the carnage and defiantly rang its bell, a daily ritual that he vowed to continue, telling AFP he will “not bow down to terrorists”.

This is an attack on our identity & culture,” said Twitter user Zahraa Saifullah.\nPakistan has seen a dramatic improvement in security in the past two years, but multiple attacks this week - most claimed by the Pakistani Taliban - has undermined the growing sense of optimism.\nThe assaults underscore Pakistan’s struggle to stamp out extremism, which was stepped up after the country’s deadliest ever attack, a Pakistani Taliban assault on a school in Peshawar in 2014 which left more than 150 people dead - mostly children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:35:56.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
