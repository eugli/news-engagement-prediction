To make sure that if they are a 5-year-old, that maybe they're with their parents and they don't pose a threat. But to assume that just because of someone's age or gender or whatever that they don't pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.\" \nThe boy, who was identified by Senator Chris Van Hollen as a US citizen who lives in Maryland. \nVan Hollen said it was \"outrageous\" the boy had been held for so long.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:42:33.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
