There'll also be a look at how the film was able to recreate a young Princess Leia as well as Grand Moff Tarkin , as well as a guide to Easter eggs hidden in the film that connect it to the greater Star Wars universe. \nThe lack of deleted scenes is puzzling, since such scenes were even included in early trailers. It's possible a later 3D release could contain such scenes. \nAnd while director Gareth Edwards can be heard on the DVD trailer admitting, \"I never, ever thought that I'd be lucky enough to be directing a Star Wars movie,\" there's no mention made of a director's commentary included either. \nAnd it wouldn't be a Star Wars film without home video controversy, as YouTube user Daniel S. slyly pointed out in the trailer's comments, writing, \"(At 23 seconds in), K-2SO shot first.\" \nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team reminds us why tech is cool.
