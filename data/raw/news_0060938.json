Or is it the case that indifferent people are everywhere?\"\nThe comment was given more than 6,000 \"likes\".\nOther users joked that the building would be haunted as the victim would not rest in peace because of resident's lack of sensitivity.\nAnother popular comment on social media, addressed to the dead worker, said: \"Do drop the property owners a visit from time to time.\" - South China Morning Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:36:30.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
