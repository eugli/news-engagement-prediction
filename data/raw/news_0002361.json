(Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) \nWe’re enduring a strange phase of the season that involves considerable downshifting and opening of the throttle with no opportunity to set the engine on cruise control. The Waste Management Phoenix Open is the fifth of 13 tournaments in Segment 2 of PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO. Yet, it’s the only event during a four-week stretch for which all switches in fantasy scoring are flipped on. \nIf you’re in a rut like I am, remember that you lose less ground in weeks when only actual scoring and bonus points contribute to team totals. It’s in tournaments like the WMPO when you absolutely need to get four golfers to the cut and final round. With only 132 golfers competing, 70 (or 53 percent) are guaranteed four rounds, so because you can’t play behemoths like Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas every time they play, this is a logical time to sit one or both out. \nMy roster for the Waste Management Phoenix Open (in alphabetical order): Keegan Bradley \nYou’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. \nOthers to consider for each category (in alphabetical order): Scoring : Russell Knox; Brooks Koepka; Phil Mickelson; Pat Perez; Patrick Reed; Jordan Spieth; Justin Thomas Driving : Billy Horschel; Zach Johnson; Russell Knox; William McGirt; Pat Perez; Jordan Spieth; Robert Streb; Justin Thomas; Bubba Watson Approach : Roberto Castro; Zach Johnson; Phil Mickelson; Kevin Na; Jordan Spieth; Justin Thomas; Tyrone Van Aswegen Short : Jim Herman; Russell Knox; Brooks Koepka; Phil Mickelson; Bryce Molder; Pat Perez; Patrick Reed; Jordan Spieth; Justin Thomas \nPower Ranking Wild Card \nBubba Watson ... I’ll never pretend to know or understand much about how equipment influences execution, but it’s fair to be concerned about certain changes. The lefty’s recent shift in the golf ball he now uses is one of them. His scores at Kapalua were uninspiring – 72-72-71-71 – since his actual scoring average in his previous 14 rounds there was 69.57. Granted, if there’s one talent on the planet who could make anything curve on command, he’s it, but until he exhibits competitive consistency, he sets up as a trap at TPC Scottsdale where he’s finished no worse than 15th in the last five editions. That stretch includes T2s in 2014 and 2015. Draws \nPatrick Rodgers … As the second-year TOUR member recycles through his travels, he’s going to determine where he’s comfortable. Combined with his pedigree, it’s only a matter of time before he breaks through for victory. Shared the 54-hole lead at Torrey Pines and placed T4, so he made the trip to Arizona with another injection of confidence. Can also tap into the good vibes of a T17 in his debut at TPC Scottsdale last year. For the week, he ranked T6 in greens hit, 12th in proximity and ninth in strokes gained: tee-to-green. \nPatrick Reed … If the Power Rankings included an “Others Receiving Votes” section, he’d have landed there. While a force with which to be reckoned almost every time out, he hasn’t yet cracked the top 15 at TPC Scottsdale, with a T19 in 2014 the better of two results. And while an illness has prompted an early withdrawal from the ISPS HANDA World Super 6 Perth Match Play (Feb. 16-19), it hasn’t prevented a continuation of consistently strong form on the PGA TOUR. \nKevin Na … A gem across the board. Just one MC in 11 appearances that have yielded six top 25s. T24 last year. Now, if he doesn’t make noise, there could be reason to doubt him moving forward. He’s struggled since late October, but he deserves at least one more chance to prove otherwise. \nWebb Simpson … For the time being, gamers get one more reliable stop before he retreats from the smattering in whom we have elevated confidence. Since 2011, he’s gone T8-T8-10th-T14 at TPC Scottsdale where any wavering in his putting is hidden a bit with greens on which everyone is still riding the learning curve. He’s also connected five cuts made since the Shriners, including a T13 at Waialae three weeks ago. \nBilly Horschel … You know he’ll be fired up this week. The 30-year-old hasn’t missed an appearance when eligible on merit. It’s been a mildly lucrative experience, too, as he’s 3-for-4 with a pair of top 25s. He’s scored 5-under 279 in both editions after the redesign. What’s more, like so many of his fellow PXG endorsers, this is a home game for his equipment. He’ll be in his element as a focus of attention and with the opportunity to reciprocate on the business side. \nWilliam McGirt … What do you get when you combine a horse for a course with a course for the horse? This guy. Perfect in five trips with three top 25s and an actual scoring average of 69.00. Under par in every first and last round at TPC Scottsdale he’s played. \nLouis Oosthuizen … Pretty much the same approach in advance of his T41 at Torrey Pines last week. He’s making his debut at TPC Scottsdale where his ball-striking should carry him into the weekend. On an aside, I’m already amused by the possibilities that await when he emerges from the tunnel at the par-3 16th hole. From his nickname, Shrek, to the various mispronunciations of his surname, there’s no telling what he’ll hear. Hopefully, he’s going into the event with an open mind! (Yes, I’ve purposely ignored other examples because anyone reading this also has access to the Internet for research material.) \nRobert Streb … Constantly teasing us, but cuts made are valuable in PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO and in DFS, so we’ll happily take the bait. Tied for ninth at Torrey Pines for his fifth consecutive payday and he’s 2-for-2 at TPC Scottsdale with a T10 in 2015 and an actual scoring average of 69.38 in eight rounds. Fades \nRickie Fowler … This is quite a quandary, so it’s a good thing that there’s an ample array of chalk figures from which to choose. For the second straight year, he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open after a long trip from Abu Dhabi. Last year’s playoff defeat at TPC Scottsdale was emotional but it was also a bounce-back from the fatigue at Torrey Pines. The 28-year-old has gone through stretches like this during which he reaches for the extremes on the spectrum. It works out for long-term investors, but those with a short attention span are quick to pile on. \nJ.B. Holmes … He’s only eight rounds into his season, but the inconsistency with which he was saddled in the second half of 2015-16 hasn’t gone anywhere. And while his precision will improve, he’s currently 214th on the PGA TOUR in greens in regulation. TPC Scottsdale holds a special place as the site of two wins, including his breakthrough in 2006 – yes, it’s been 11 years now – but only the daring will ignore his current struggles. \nMatt Kuchar … This is the latest in a calendar year that he’s opened his schedule since 2006, which is the last season in which he wasn’t fully exempt. Hasn’t missed a cut in his last four visits to TPC Scottsdale dating back to 2009, but hasn’t contended in the last three, either. Anyone who’s read me for any length of time knows that he’ll be a mainstay in the Power Rankings, so my only advice right now is to remain patient. He’ll come through for us later, time and again. \nBrian Harman … The lefty has really been feeling it in 2017 with a respective T20, T3 and T9 on the board thus far. That suggests that he’ll fare better than he ever has at TPC Scottsdale where he’s registered no better than a T32 in 2013. Placed T66 and T58 in two tries on the redesign, failing to put four rounds together in both. Give him a look in DFS, but understand that you’ll be battling against the contingent planning to ride his recent wave. \nMarc Leishman … This is relative in the context that he’s seeing the redesign for the first time and had little success in five trips prior. At the very worst, just give him the week to adapt and hopefully extend the kind of form that has manufactured five consecutive top 25s worldwide. \nSean O’Hair … With a respective T10, T11 and T9 in three starts since the Shriners three months ago, it’s reasonable to assume that he’ll record a personal-best finish at TPC Scottsdale as he did two weeks ago at the CareerBuilder. The problem is that the target isn’t all that difficult. He’s just 4-for-9 with one top 40 (T25, 2009) in Arizona. It simply hasn’t been a track that has fit his eye, regardless of the design. \nLuke Donald … First competition of 2017 and first appearance in Scottsdale in eight years. Meanwhile, a runner-up finish at the 2016 Wyndham Championship remains his only top 25 anywhere in nine months. \nChez Reavie … Here’s one former Sun Devil who has not found magic at TPC Scottsdale. Zero top 40s among just three cuts made in eight appearances. This means that something will give as the 36-year-old strides in with top 25s in his last four starts, including a T8-T12 spurt since the holiday break. \nKevin Chappell … Predictably missed last week’s cut in what was his first start since the birth of his second child. Now takes aim at TPC Scottsdale where he’s missed three of five cuts and traded two 65s and a 68 with a 74, 75 and 76 in six rounds on the redesign. \nCharley Hoffman … Although he finished T54 at Torrey Pines, there has to be some satisfaction that he made the cut on the number with a birdie-birdie finish on the North Course in the second round. It could be the swivel point he needs to get back on track, but we need to let him continue on that path alone for the time being. This is supported by the fact that he didn’t finish inside the top 50 at the WMPO in any of his last five tries. \nSteve Stricker … An impressive 108th in the Official World Golf Ranking and relevant given he’s already exempt into the Masters, Open Championship and THE PLAYERS. However, while he can beat par rolling out of bed with that putting stroke of his, the WMPO figures to serve merely as an opportunity to shoo away the cobwebs as this is his first meaningful competition in five months. He’s also missed the cut in his last three trips here dating back to 2008. Perhaps most importantly in the short-term, the 12-time PGA TOUR champ will turn 50 on Feb. 23. How sporty will he look as an option in PGA TOUR Champions One & Done presented by SERVPRO? We’ll be treated to that soon enough. Returning to competition \nSi Woo Kim ... Recurring back soreness has forced him out during two starts already this season (Mayakoba, Farmers). He also withdrew early from the Sony. In between all of that, he missed the cut at Seaside and placed T30 at the 32-man SBS. He’s only 21 but there aren’t many worse things physically for a golfer than a back injury. Notable WDs \nCharles Howell III … One of the most surprising decisions in recent memory for multiple reasons. First, he had made 15 consecutive appearances at TPC Scottsdale. Seven resulted in a top 25, including last year’s T24. As gamers are fondly aware, he also doesn’t mind staying busy, so this will be his first week off since restarting his season at Waialae. And lastly, he’s been dynamite in his last six starts with three top 10s and nothing worse than a T15 (Shriners). \nDerek Fathauer ... Since opening the 2016-17 season with a T15-T3 burst, he’s just 2-for-5 with no top 35s. And he’s yet to score par or better in four rounds at TPC Scottsdale, two on either side of the redesign.
