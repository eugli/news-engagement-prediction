Photo courtesy KTVI \nMARISSA • The body of a woman found in a landfill here has been identified as 23-year-old Brandy Morrison of the 5600 block of Hiller Place in St. Louis. \nPolice say Morrison was fatally shot in the 6100 block of Laura Avenue in St. Louis sometime between Friday and Monday. \nPolice looking for Morrison found her body at the landfill after suspecting that her body had been put in an alley trash container in St. Louis. They traced the trash collection route to the landfill, according to Marissa Police Chief Tom Prather. \nPrather said a cadaver dog team located the body about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday in Waste Management Inc.'s Cottonwood Hills landfill, about 30 miles southeast of downtown St. Louis. Waste Management Inc. takes trash from the St. Louis Refuse Department. \nThe Illinois State Police and the St. Clair County coroner’s office also are working on the case. \nMorrison's family reported her missing Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:34:40.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
