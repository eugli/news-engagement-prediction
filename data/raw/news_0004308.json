But the 300-run man has done well not to lose his amiable ways. \nA month and half since the Karnataka batting star created history in Chennai, he now gears up for his next Test match for India. Karun made the squad for the upcoming Bangladesh Test but finding a place in the playing XI is no guarantee. \nWith a fit again Ajinkya Rahane, also the vice-captain back, he is likely to win his place back. Rahane did lose some touch in the first three Tests against England but he has been by far India's best all weather performer. \nSo will only the second Indian to score a triple Test ton also become the first ever to be dropped after that feat? \"I am not thinking about it. Anything could happen. Whenever I get opportunity I should be ready,\" Karun tells India Today. \nThe great leveller that cricket is, Karun's two domestic matches since that triple resulted in four failures. That should be enough to shed any complacency creeping in. \"It's a game and I have to enjoy it. Not always can you score big. I am looking to learn every game and try to put the best foot forward for the next one. The results will take care.\" \nKarun's follow up scores after his 303* in the Ranji trophy semi-final and the Irani trophy have been 14, 12, 28, 7. He shrugs off suggestions that the burden of expectations may have played a part. \"Not at all. Every player has his own expectations and every player wants to do well in all the games. Those expectations are the most important. To me outside expectations don't matter. I have my own standards I have set and am working hard to live up to them,\" he insists. \nNor does he get weighed down competing for a middle order slot in the No. 1 side. \"It's great for me. I have been very lucky as soon as I joined the team we became no.1. When I joined the Ranji team we became Ranji Champions for two years in a row,\" he says. \nIn the playing eleven or not, Karun promises the Indian team will be switched on for the remaining part of the home Test season where they have been unbeaten. \n\"We are the No. 1 team. A lot of the players have been committed to white ball cricket. But the team will be switched on come time for Bangladesh and Australia,\" he affirms.
