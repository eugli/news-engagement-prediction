However, the survey — dubbed the “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey” — tends to lead participants in a certain direction by the way the questions are phrased.\nView Story Trump slams Democrats, media at press conference In a wide-ranging and rambling news conference, President Trump puts “fake news” and “real leaks” on blast.\nThe survey appeared to be similar to what experts in the industry describe as a “push poll,” a kind of negative campaign technique in which the questions are skewed to sway people to a particular candidate.\nFor example, in a part on the president’s controversial travel ban, one question asked: “Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump’s temporary restriction executive order?” No other information on the poll was provided.\nAdvertisement\nPublic opinion on Trump’s travel ban has been split in recent polls. A Morning Consult/Politico survey showed that 54 percent of respondents did agree with Trump’s travel ban.\nHowever, other polls show the majority disagreeing with Trump’s travel order. A CNN/ORC poll found 53 percent opposing the executive order. A Fox News poll found that 52 percent surveyed disapproved of the ban, compared to 46 percent who were in favor of it. And a Quinnipiac University poll found 51 percent of participants disagreed with the order.\nAnother question asked, “Do you believe that people of faith have been unfairly characterized by the media?”\nOther queries seemed to attack the mainstream media and accuse it of severe liberal bias, including questions like: “Do you believe that the media purposely tries to divide Republicans against each other in order to help elect Democrats?” and “Do you believe that the media creates false feuds within our Party in order to make us seem divided?”\nOne of the questions even appeared to defend the Trump administration’s tendency to grant White House press credentials to pro-Trump blogs or favor pro-Trump media outlets in press briefings : “Do you agree with the President’s decision to break with tradition by giving lesser known reporters and bloggers the chance to ask the White House Press Secretary questions?”\nOne question even seemed to call for the Republican Party spending “more time and resources “ to hold “the mainstream media accountable.”\nThe survey also included a request for funds at the end.\nThe e-mailed survey came after Trump blasted the media in an extraordinary press conference, accusing it of being ‘‘out of control’’ and calling recent reports about his campaign’s connection to Russia “fake news put out by the media.”\nRelated Watch clips from Trump’s extraordinary press conference Trump asks black reporter to set up a meeting with Congressional Black Caucus Donald Trump attacks haven’t hurt network, CNN says Trump administration says it will revise travel ban What does Trump’s crackdown on immigration mean for restaurants?
