The BJP came close with 82 seats. \n\nAny party or combine will need 114 corporators for a simple majority. \n\nAcross Maharashtra, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party made major gains in elections held for municipal bodies. The Shiv Sena victory came in Thane. \n\nBJP Mumbai president Ashish Shelar said the party had bagged 82 seats in Mumbai and had the support of four independents and that it was in a position to claim the crucial post of mayor. \n\n\"This is a historic victory for the BJP ... We are only three seats less than the Shiv Sena ... The credit goes to the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis,\" he said. \n\nAn aggressive Shiv Sena had snapped ties with the BJP ahead of the municipal elections and its leader Uddhav Thackeray had expected the Sena to win at least 100 seats, if not an outright majority. \n\nThe BMC, which is also the country's largest municipal body, has an annual budget of Rs 37,000 crore in 2016-17. \n\nThe Congress trailed at a distant third in Mumbai, forcing its city unit chief Sanjay Nirupam to accept moral responsibility. He has offered to resign from the post. \n\nThe Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) of Raj Thackeray, Uddhav's estranged cousin, finished with seven seats. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) bagged nine seats and the Hyderabad-based Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen three. \n\nThe BJP's solid gains came in other major cities of Maharashtra. \n\nThe BJP raced towards victory in the Pune Municipal Corporation , pushing the ruling NCP to a poor second spot. The Shiv Sena, the MNS and the Congress fared poorly in the state's cultural and IT capital. \n\nThe contest was close in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation near Pune, with the ruling NCP leading in 27 seats and the BJP at the second place with 21 seats. \n\nThe Shiv Sena was on way to retaining control over the 131-seat Thane Municipal Corporation. \n\nNagpur appeared to be going the BJP way, with the party leading in 70 of the civic body's 151 seats, the Congress in 20 and the NCP and Shiv Sena in one seat each. \n\nIn Nashik, the BJP appeared set to bag the 112-member civic body. The BJP was faring well in Amravati too, Election Commission officials said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:53:35.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
