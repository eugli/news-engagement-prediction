Pregnant girls under the age of 18 numbered 59,717, making for 7.01% of the 8,43,857 pregnant women in the state. \n\nGynaecologists say curiosity, increasing incidence of rape, promiscuity, early marriages in some communities, and decreased awareness about contraception are the primary reasons for teenage pregnancies. However, they are appalled by the trend, given the inherent risks faced by such young would-be mothers. \n\nDr Gayathri Karthik, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Manipal Hospitals , said: \"The main cause is ignorance about the consequence of an experiment stemming from curiosity, the 'cool' factor or sexual abuse. Awareness of safe contraception can go a long way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\" Doctors say promiscuity itself may be a result of peer pressure, lack of parental guidance or substance abuse. \n\n\"Internet too plays a major role by exposing us to various cultures, which produces a compelling need to have boyfriends and girlfriends. This relationship is healthy for overall development, but sometimes crosses the limit due to ignorance or wrong judgement, and leads to an unwanted pregnancy,\" explained Dr Gayathri. \n\nExplaining the negative impact of early pregnancy, Dr Thejaswini, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, Whitefield, said: \"Teenage pregnancy is like a child having a child. The body isn't ready for child-bearing both physically and mentally. The pelvis isn't ready for child birth, and can lead to obstructed labour. Such girls are also more prone to malnutrition and pre-eclampsia.\" \n\nFor greater good \n\nEvery year, we record the number of pregnant women in Karnataka. This year, the number of pregnant teenagers across the state indicated high-risk data. The situation should be immediately dealt with to curb teenage pregnancies for the greater good of women's health \n\nDr Rajkumar N, deputy director, maternal health department \n\nPainful experiences \n\nSeventeen-year-old Roshni (name changed), who was 14-weeks pregnant and underwent abortion at a city clinic, had to be rushed to the emergency department of a hospital in a state of haemorrhagic and septic shock. Tests revealed bleeding in the abdomen and a doubtful perforation of the uterus. To save her life, doctors had to perform laparotomy â€” a surgical incision into the abdominal cavity for diagnosis or in preparation for major surgery. The procedure showed a big tear in the uterus which was sutured. \n\nPreeti (name changed), 17, pregnant for six weeks, took pills without the doctor's advice. She was brought to a hospital with severe abdominal pain and fainting attack. She was found to have an ectopic pregnancy in which the fallopian tube had ruptured causing internal bleeding; her case had to be managed surgically. Preeti ended up losing her fallopian tube as the bleeding couldn't be stopped. \n\nRise in early terminations affecting health: Doctors \n\nBengaluru: Bengaluru is witnessing a spurt in the number of teenage abortions, which in turn is leading to threatening health conditions, say doctors. \n\nDr Geeta Komar, consultant obstetrics and gynaecology at Columbia Asia Hospital, Whitefield, said: \"The impact of abortion on a teenager's health can be both physical and mental. Physically, the impact can be adverse if the procedure isn't done the right way. Teens may visit a small medical set-up to ensure secrecy.\" \n\nAccording to Dr Geeta, infections are common in cases where abortion isn't done properly. \"The very act of undergoing an abortion has mental consequences on the teenager, including guilt and shame. Correct medical procedures for abortion are necessary to avoid medical complications,\" she added. \n\nSaid Dr Manisha Singh, consultant gynaecologist and IVF specialist at Fortis Hospital: \"Termination at an early age could lead to risk of infertility, scarring of uterus and infection, and blockage of fallopian tubes.\" \n\nMANY IMPLICATIONS \n\nTeenage pregnancy-related health complications include increased risk of pre-eclampsia (high BP), preterm delivery, anaemia and low birth weight \n\nIncreased school dropout rates, illiteracy, social stigma, isolation from society, unemployment and monetary dependency on others \n\nSevere stress and depression among youngsters \n\nHOW NOT TO FALL FOR IT \n\nThere are many ways to prevent adolescent pregnancy, including encouraging sex education, abstinence, providing education about birth control, promoting community service activities and teaching skills to cope with peer pressure \n\nParents need to keep channels of communication open with children so that kids can clear their misconceptions \n\nTeachers should educate children on the need for restraint, use of contraceptives, and safe interventions in case of mishap. They should talk to boys and girls separately and together to explain the consequences of indiscretion, birth control measures and the availability of safe abortion methods \n\nPolicymakers play a major role in designing curriculum, making contraceptives available, preventing availability of over-the-counter (OTC) termination pills, setting up of confidential termination and STD clinics and adolescent health clinics \n\nGrim picture: How districts fare \n\nDistrict Pregnant woman registered in MCTS \n\nRamanagara 10,660 840 \n\nChamarajanagar 10,448 1,427 \n\nTIMES VIEW \n\nBengaluru Urban's dubious distinction points to an alarming trend and reflects the casual attitude of adolescents towards reproductive health. Many are ignorant of the perilous consequences of teenage pregnancies, which could affect both the would-be mother and unborn child. While it's natural for teenagers to be curious, they shouldn't rely on the internet for answers. The onus of guiding them lies on parents and teachers, who need to shed inhibitions and open channels of communication. Steps like inclusion of sex education in the school curriculum and pre-marital counselling can go a long way in helping directionless youngsters. However, these measures largely hold good in an urban scenario. Archaic practices like early marriage need to be eradicated to bring about a change in rural Karnataka.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:43:24.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
