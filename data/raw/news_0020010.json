Opposed by half the Senate, she faced criticism for her antipathy toward public schools, even ridicule for lack of experience and confusion during her confirmation hearing.\nPresident Donald Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, \"Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!\"\nDeVos was sworn in hours after the Senate vote by Pence, who told the new Cabinet member: \"I wasn't just voting for you. Having seen your devotion to improving the quality of education for some of our most vulnerable children across the nation for so many years, I was also casting a vote for America's children.\"\n\"I can tell you, my vote for Betsy DeVos was the easiest vote I ever cast,\" Pence said.\nDeVos released a statement promising to champion the interests of all students. \"Partnering with students, parents, educators, state and local leaders, Congress and all stakeholders, we will improve education options and outcomes across America,\" she said.\nShe now takes the helm of a department charged with implementing laws affecting the nation's public schools with no direct experience with traditional public schools. Her opponents noted that she has no experience running public schools, nor has she attended one or sent her four children to one.\nDeVos also will have to address several hot-button issues in higher education, such as rising tuition costs, growing student debt and the troubled for-profit colleges, many of which have closed down, leaving students with huge loans and without a good education or job prospects.\nClose attention also will be paid to how DeVos deals with sexual assault, freedom of speech on campuses and LGBT rights.\nAhead of Tuesday's vote, emotions ran high as constituents jammed senators' phone lines. Protesters gathered outside the Capitol, including one person in a grizzly bear costume to poke fun at DeVos. At one point during her nomination fight, she said some schools should have guns because of the threat of grizzly bears.\nDemocrats and labor unions vigorously fought the nomination, suggesting that DeVos would defund traditional public schools by diverting taxpayers' money to charter and private institutions. They cited her financial interest in organizations pushing for charter schools, though she has said she will divest those interests.\n\"It's telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,\" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers . \"That's because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools; a full-throttled embrace of private, for-profit alternatives; and a lack of basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school.\"\nDeVos supporters, however, saw her confirmation as an occasion to breathe new life into a troubled American school system and a chance to shift power from Washington to the local level.\n\"She has been a leader in the movement for public charter schools â€” the most successful reform of public education during the last 30 years,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Education Committee. \"And she has worked tirelessly to help low-income children have more choices of better schools.\"\n  DeVos Vows to Be 'Tireless Advocate for All Students' \" \nTrump Attacks Travel Ban Challengers, Says 'Bad High School Student' Would Understand Order The Note: Warren Silenced in the Senate \" \nDepartment of Defense Seeks Space at Trump Tower \" \nPresident Trump: I Get 4-5 Hours of Sleep \" \n8 Attacks on WH Terror List Involve Restricted Countries \" \nHouse Oversight Chair Says Trump Didn't Want to Discuss 'Oversight' in Meeting \" \nJudges Focus on Whether Trump's Immigration Order Is Muslim Ban \" \nKellyanne Conway Defends White House's Credibility: We Have 'High Regard' for Facts \" \nTrump Claims US Murder Rate 'Highest' in '47 Years' Despite FBI Data Showing Otherwise \" \nGovernment's Own Warnings to Law Enforcement Often Cite Media Reports Trump Says Don't Exist \" \nSenate Confirmation Hearings: Everything to Know \" \nA Look at Trump's Cabinet Nominees Top Putin Critic Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Barring Him From 2018 Presidential Run   \nValentine's Day Dance Canceled Over Ordinance Banning Dancing Near Church", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:35:28.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
