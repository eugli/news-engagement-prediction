5:39pm \nT his selection of the finest classical recordings available, which first appeared in 2009, is the most authoritative and entertaining guide of its kind. However, after five years any guide needs sprucing up a little. I didn’t want to compromise the inimitable style of the original, so rather than revise it, I’ve added some ideas of my own. \nThere are now two new suggestions in each category, and three brand-new categories. The result is an even fuller map of classical music recordings. There are more landmarks, while whole areas which were blank are now filled in. Time to go exploring in this rich area of musical experience. Ivan Hewett (2014) \nThe Classical Rules \nVariety is the spice of life \nNo single conductor or performer is good at everything. Buying up the works of only one maestro is silly, so don’t do it – or mention you ever did it. \nNames don’t matter \nNote down all the most obvious choices – for conductors: Karajan, Ashkenazy and Levine; for piano, Kissin and Lang Lang – and throw everything you have by them away. There are exceptions (Karajan’s opera) but by and large these strutting maestros have bought space in your brains by being shrewd, not musical – though the two can go together (Bernstein). \nLearn to speak German \nFor German repertoire remember the six Ks: Knappertsbusch, Keilberth, Kempe, Klemperer and father and son Erich and Carlos Kleiber. And never forget Furtwängler. Hunt them down and drop them into conversation. Subtly. Try alliteration. \nBuy British \nBe sure to have something by each of three British Bs: Beecham’s Haydn or Mozart; Boult’s Brahms or Berg; Barbirolli’s Verdi or Vaughan Williams. \nThe greatest players \nPianist names to know: Lhévinne, Friedman, Lipatti, Solomon, Curzon, Ogdon, Haskil, Richter, Moravec, Argerich, Hough. In pianophile company, you can never talk about the French Vichy collaborator Alfred Cortot enough. \nString theory \nString quartets to know: Busch, Hollywood, Végh, Hungarian, Griller, Amadeus, Guarneri, Talich. \nThe label matters \nIf you want to get the very best, there’s no avoiding the biggies: DG, EMI, Decca and Sony’s RCA Red Seal. No collection, however, would be complete without several items from Hyperion, Bis, Harmonia Mundi and Pentatone. Naxos often offers hidden gems. \nBuy vintage \nFor the most ambitious social climbers among you, scratchy old reissues are a must. Try Dutton, Testament and Naxos Historical. \nThe new classics \nLate 20th-century composers you should profess to like: Boulez, Messiaen, Ligeti, Grisey, Birtwistle, Stockhausen, Xenakis, Berio, Dallapiccola. And those that you might actually enjoy: Messiaen, Ligeti, Rautavaara, Silvestrov, Adams, Reich, Glass, Copland, MacMillan. \nNames to avoid \nKarajan, Ashkenazy, Kissin, Lang Lang, Maazel, Mrs Mills and Richard Clayderman. Forget you ever knew these people. \nOPERA \nPrincess Margaret once described opera as fat people shouting at each other, which also seems a good description of my local Greggs. Opera, like Greggs, gets a lot of bad press. But contrary to popular belief, opera, like Greggs, isn’t that expensive, or very highfalutin, much of it being about as accessible as a strawberry tart. So tuck in. \n1) Beethoven – Fidelio (conductor: Otto Klemperer) \nBeethoven’s opera is heart-stopping in the theatre but also a sublime, uplifting musical experience without that staging; not many operas convey as much of a message in 'tone’ alone. Though the Fidelio discography is large, few recordings stand out as this one continues to, nearly half a century after it was first captured in stereo. Otto Klemperer’s lofty conducting evokes the transcendental spirit and Jon Vickers’s anguished Florestan is all suffering strength. With a great line-up also including Christa Ludwig and Gottlob Frick, this Fidelio is timeless. Buy now \n2) Mozart – Così fan tutte (conductor: Bernard Haitink) \nBeneath its unruffled, Mediterranean surface, Mozart’s sublime yet cruel comedy comes to life in Bernard Haitink’s interpretation from Glyndebourne, with a cast including Carol Vaness and Claudio Desderi. Buy now \n3) Mozart – Die Zauberflöte (conductor: Otto Klemperer) \nThe dialogue may be cut, but no CD collection should be without Mozart’s 'opera for everybody’ or a cast that includes Lucia Popp’s Queen of the Night and Nicolai Gedda’s Tamino. Buy now \n4) Puccini – Tosca (conductor: Victor de Sabata) \nThe greatest of all Toscas, Maria Callas is captured at her legendary best, urged on by a distinguished cast and conducting of dramatic sweep. Buy now \n5) Rossini – La Cenerentola (conductor: Riccardo Chailly) \nFrom high spirits to deep pathos, La Cenerentola ('Cinderella’) holds in perfect balance everything we love most about Rossini. The cast is led by an ebullient Cecilia Bartoli on her best form. Buy now \n6) Strauss – Der Rosenkavalier (conductor: Erich Kleiber) \nWitty yet wistful, Erich Kleiber’s interpretation with the Vienna Philharmonic of Strauss’s masterpiece is a classic boasting a dream cast. Buy now \n7) Tchaikovsky – Eugene Onegin (conductor: Semyon Bychkov) \nRussia’s greatest opera, amid strong competition, Tchaikovsky’s 'lyric scenes’ have not been better served on disc than by the idiomatic conducting of Semyon Bychkov and a cast including Dmitri Hvorostovsky’s fresh-voiced Onegin. Buy now \n8) Verdi – Don Carlos (conductor: Claudio Abbado) \nThe most epic yet most human of Verdi’s operas, Don Carlos exists in multiple versions, but this (in its original French) is one of the best and features Plácido Domingo in the title role. Buy now \n9) Verdi – Falstaff (conductor: Herbert von Karajan) \nThe richly detailed orchestration of Verdi’s final opera blazes out under Herbert von Karajan’s baton, and Tito Gobbi’s multifaceted Fat Knight leads a cast of singers that strike sparks off each other. Buy now \n10) Wagner – Der Ring des Nibelungen (conductor: Daniel Barenboim) \nOne of the greatest works of art ever conceived, Wagner’s Ring has been well served on disc, but this features Daniel Barenboim’s theatrically astute conducting, and a magnificent cast including John Tomlinson and Anne Evans. Buy now \n11) Debussy – Pelleas et Mélisande (conductor: Pierre Boulez) \nCompared to the fortissimo vocal outpourings of most operas, this twilight tale of love and betrayal in a lonely castle is all hints and whispers. But you can feel the suppressed violence. Buy now \n12) Britten – Peter Grimes (conductor: Steuart Bedford) \nIn some ways Britten never surpassed his first opera, a story of a conflicted fisherman cut off by his unfeeling neighbours. This performance, recorded by the same cast that performed the opera on Aldeburgh beach last year, has a real salty tang. Buy now \nCONCERTO \nConcertos involve one – or sometimes two or three – musicians facing off against the orchestra. Composers often tackle this form in one of two ways. They offer up a delicate, almost operatic interplay between the two factions, like in Mozart, or a down-and-dirty mud fight. \n13) Rachmaninov – Piano Concerto No 4 (soloist: Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli) \nIt was the legendary Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli’s recording that decisively changed the fortunes of Rachmaninov’s Fourth Piano Concerto. Long considered the ugly duckling of Rachmaninov’s concerto output – a last and less than convincing grasp of Russian Romanticism composed at a time (1926) when the world had moved on – the work won its proper place in the wake of Michelangeli’s 1957 landmark recording. The Italian pianist coupled this with another unsurpassed interpretation, of Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G. \n14) Beethoven – Piano Concertos Nos 3 and 4 (soloist: Mitsuko Uchida) \nEven in a crowded field, Uchida’s performances stand out for their sense of drama. \n15) Beethoven – Violin Concerto (soloist: Itzhak Perlman) \nThe greatest of all violin concertos, Beethoven’s long work needs the breadth of vision that Perlman is able to supply. \n16) Brahms – Piano Concertos Nos 1 and 2 (soloist: Leon Fleisher) \nBrahms’s epic piano concertos receive appropriately big and sweeping performances from Leon Fleisher and the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell. \n17) Elgar – Cello Concerto (soloist: Jacqueline du Pré) \nElgar’s masterpiece is also a monument to the passionate playing of Jacqueline du Pré. \n18) Grieg and Schumann – Piano Concertos (soloist: Stephen Kovacevich) \nA great coupling, the A minor piano concertos of Grieg and Schumann are played with poetic brilliance by Kovacevich and the conductor Colin Davis. \n19) Mozart – Sinfonia Concertante, K 364 (soloists: Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman) \nOne of Mozart’s most sublime works, this double concerto for violin and viola inspires a lively musical conversation between two great string players. \n20) Mozart – Piano Concerto No 23 in A, K 488 (soloist: Solomon) \nRecorded in the mid-Fifties, Solomon’s Mozart remains unsurpassed. \n21) Rachmaninov – Piano Concerto No 2 (soloist: Sviatoslav Richter) \nSviatoslav Richter’s almost mythical reputation in the West was made before he could travel beyond the Iron Curtain by this powerful 1959 recording with the Warsaw Philharmonic. \n22) Sibelius – Violin Concerto (soloist: Leonidas Kavakos) \nMixing technical bravura and poetic lyricism, Kavakos and the leading Sibelius conductor, Osmo Vänskä, play this concerto twice, as this fascinating disc includes the work’s even more demanding original version. \n23) J S Bach – Concerto for Two Violins (soloists: Rachel Podger and Johannes Pramsohler) \nThe slow movement of Bach’s double concerto is so sublimely beautiful it would be many people’s Desert Island concerto movement. The other two movements are full of sinewy counterpoint, which in this new recording has tremendous energy. \n24) Shostakovich – Piano Concertos nos. 1 and 2 (soloist: Marc-André Hamelin) \nShostakovich struck a new, sardonically gleeful tone in his youthful 1st piano concerto. The second written after Stalin’s death strikes a very different, more reflective note. They’re played with jaw-dropping brilliance by Marc-André Hamelin. \nPIANO SOLO \nOnly one instrument can survive on its own for long enough to sustain our interest and achieve any level of profundity: the piano. Composers have concurred and today it is the instrument with the largest repertoire. \n25) Chopin – Martha Argerich (The Legendary 1965 Recording) \nOnly 24 when she was captured playing at Abbey Road, Argerich performs with such intensity that it scarcely feels like a studio recording. Her volcanic energy can leave you scrambling to keep up, but the Third Sonata is breathtaking in its spontaneity and the smaller works are richly imbued with Polish spirit. \n26) Albéniz – Iberia (Alicia de Larrocha) \nAlbéniz’s masterpiece has never been served better on disc than by the authentically Spanish pianism of Alicia de Larrocha. \n27) Bach – Goldberg Variations (Glenn Gould) \nOne of the greatest pianists of the 20th century, Glenn Gould devoted his first major recording to the Goldbergs, but the more introspective version, made in 1981, is widely considered to be his finest. \n28) Bartók – Romanian Folk Dances (Zoltán Kocsis) \nThe folk roots of the composer’s work are encapsulated here as part of a dazzling all-Bartók recital by this brilliant Hungarian pianist. \n29) Beethoven – Hammerklavier Sonata (Rudolf Serkin) \nRudolf Serkin’s Hammerklavier stands out for its prodigious power and introspection. \n30) Brahms – Klavierstücke Op 116-119 (Wilhelm Kempff) \nA delectable distillation of Brahms’s late style. \n31) Debussy – Préludes Books 1 & 2 (Krystian Zimerman) \nDebussy’s Préludes are brought into vivid, witty and poetic focus by the brilliant Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman. \n32) Rachmaninov – 24 Preludes (Vladimir Ashkenazy) \nRich in their vein of Russian melancholy, the Preludes demand poetry and technical bravura, and receive both here. \n33) Schubert – Sonata in B flat, D 960 (Clifford Curzon) \nSchubert’s late masterwork is well served on disc, but no collection should be without the wondrous beauty of Curzon’s playing. \n34) Schumann – Fantasy in C (Sviatoslav Richter) \nSviatoslav Richter illuminates the three contrasting movements of Schumann’s grand work, mixing luminosity of tone with virtuosity of touch. \n35) Rossini – Péchés de Viellese (Stefan Irmer) \nRossini, a piano composer? Some mistake surely. In fact in his old age, after he’d given up writing operas, Rossini wrote several volumes of “Sins of Old Age”, quirky piano pieces with titles like “Hygienic Prelude.” They’re witty, but not as light as they seem. \n36) Prokofiev – Piano Sonatas nos. 2 & 9, Visions Fugiives etc. (Sviatoslav Richter) \nRichter was one of the greatest pianists of all time, and on this CD his deeply felt, utterly unshowy art reveals the sarcasm, fury, and childlike innocence of Prokofiev’s music. \nEARLY AND BAROQUE \nMuch Baroque music (1600-1750), essentially posh pop – neat melodies over big basses – attracts sell-out crowds of hippies, organic food wholesalers and Sloanes. The audience is splashy and flashy, the get-up as attention-seeking as the shrill trills coming from the stage. Early music (dawn of man – 1600) draws in a more consistent and genuinely bearded sort who just want to space out to Gregorian chant. \n37) Vivaldi – The Four Seasons (Fabio Biondi, Europa Galante) \nBiondi puts so much colour on the cheek of this over-exploited old thing that it comes out looking like Grayson Perry. With Biondi’s reimagining, an airing out of the textures, a rebalancing of the harmonies, Vivaldi’s musical mind is laid out for all to see. \n38) John Dunstaple (Orlando Consort) \nAccording to the liner notes, 'Dunstaple was the most influential English composer outside England before the Beatles’. The Orlando Consort lay out Dunstaple’s easy lyricism and inventiveness in a way that realises the truth of this statement. \n39) Josquin des Prez – Missa Pange lingua (The Tallis Scholars) \nDes Prez was Beethoven, Schoenberg and Stravinsky all rolled into one, developing and shaping new forms that became vital to the polyphonic progress of music. The Tallis Scholars carve out the mysteries of his masterpiece, the Missa Pange lingua, like master butchers. \n40) Tallis – Spem in Alium; Lamentations; Mass and Motets(Magnificat) \nThis is Thomas Tallis at his most compelling. His famous kaleidoscopic 40-part motet, Spem in Alium, swoops and soars in the most deeply satisfying way possible. \n41) Buxtehude – Organ Works (René Saorgin) \nHarmonia Mundi’s clean, vivid recordings of Saorgin playing five baroque organs perfectly captures the power of these remarkable works. \n42) Claudio Monteverdi – L’Orfeo (Emmanuelle Haim, Le Concert D’Astree) \nThis is little more than a renaissance riot, lurching giddily from one excitable dance to another, passing by shadowy recitatives, sighing ariosi from a stellar cast, drum outbursts worthy of Varese and meaty ritornelli swathed in lavish orchestral ornamentation. \n43) Purcell – Dido and Aeneas (Andrew Parrott, Taverner Choir and Players) \nA beautifully quiet recording, the first to be done on period instruments. The choir is stylish, the orchestra breezy. But Emma Kirkby’s Dido is the real draw; a more direct, subtle or affecting lament isn’t to be found on disc. \n44) Bach – Brandenburg Concertos (Trevor Pinnock, The English Concert) \nThis is pure, unadorned Bach, delicately presented, lightly inflected and left to speak for itself, which it does with unsurpassed eloquence. \n45) Battista – Pergolesi Stabat Mater (Rinaldo Alessandrini, Concerto Italiano) \nThis is a recording in which every last drop of musical juice has been squeezed from the score. As a result, the text, one of the most moving in the sacred canon, is more sharp and poignant than ever. \n46) Couperin – Les Concerts Royeaux (Jordi Savall, Le Concert des Nations) \nThe charm of Couperin’s little character pieces is beautifully caught by this Catalan group. Think of Watteau’s paintings of sad clowns and rosy-cheeked young ladies dressed as shepherdesses in a shady bower, and you’ll get the feel of it. \n47) The Mirror of Narcissus (Christopher Page, Gothic Voices) \nThe composer of the music on this disc, Guillaume de Machaut, was born around 1300, which makes his the oldest music on this list. Gothic Voices make these songs sound perfectly aristocratic and gravely melancholic, as they should be. \nCHORAL \nChoral music, with its penchant for extremes, organ accompaniments and intermittent hallelujahs, will drive your neighbours mad. Britain has always loved choral music, possibly because it allows us all to come together and have a sing-song with minimal contact. \n48) Bach – Mass in B Minor (Andrew Parrott, Taverner Consort and Players) \nThe issue of authenticity in classical music is a viper’s nest. Parrott’s 1985 recording came out at the height of the pitched battles between romantic traditionalists and the vanguard period performers. Mere mention of the words 'period instruments’ would and did lead to spats; when Rattle brought the issue up on the phone to Karajan, the maestro hung up. Bravery was necessary then to record a performance of the Bach B Minor with an unheard of four-man choir who doubled as soloists. It worked, however. And how. \n49) Bach – St Matthew Passion (William Mengelberg, Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Toonkunst Choir) \nMengelberg’s hypnotic 1939 St Matthew Passion is a testament to how Bach was once performed. The result is a recording of such communal conviction, power and authenticity that, arguably, it reaches down into the spiritual heart of the work more deeply than any other. \n50) Handel – Messiah Pinnock (The English Concert and Choir) \nThis has been a critics’ favourite for nearly two decades for the spirited way the choral get-togethers explode into life. The soloists – Auger, von Otter, Chance and Tomlinson – are consistently fine. \n51) Mozart – Requiem (John Eliot Gardiner, Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists) \nThis is a powerfully expressed performance, in which period authenticity is not allowed to dim argument or tone. In fact, the added tremulousness afforded the smaller ensemble is bracing, bolstering the fear at the heart of this work. \n52) Schubert – Complete Sacred Works (Wolfgang Sawallisch, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Choir) \nThere is something of the magic of the stumbled-upon local service about this recording. The playing and singing is, of course, in a different league but there is still the feeling that you are eavesdropping on something private and special. \n53) Berlioz – Requiem (Leonard Bernstein, Orchestra Nationale D’Ile de France, Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra) \nListening to Berlioz’s Requiem, so dark, mysterious and vast, is like crawling around an ocean floor. Bernstein heightens these oceanic mysteries, exploring every nook and cranny of the enormous Madeleine church, in which he recorded the work, with his inimitable and enormous sound. \n54) Mendelssohn – Elijah (Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, New Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus) \nDe Burgos is acutely aware of the dramatic and dynamic demands of this fine, snaky bit of neo-Baroquery. But with Gwyneth Jones, Janet Baker, Nicolai Gedda and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as soloists, the final quartet becomes a particular highlight. \n55) Brahms – A German Requiem (Otto Klemperer, Philharmonia Orchestra and Choir) \nKlemperer’s is not a fashionable recording, but it’s still the best. Things proceed slowly, organically and thickly, like some enormous lusty river about to spill out into the sea. \n56) Rossini – Petite Messe Solennelle (Marcus Creed, RIAS Kammerchor) \nRossini’s Petite Messe is neither little, nor solemn, nor particularly liturgical, Napoleon III is reputed to have said. But it is a joy, particularly in this original version for two pianos and harmonium, in which Creed lets things burr along attractively. \n57) Verdi – Requiem (Carlo Maria Giulini, Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus) \nGiulini’s annual performance of Verdi’s Requiem at the Royal Albert Hall through the Fifties and Sixties was a point of repeated pilgrimage. Here we get a remarkable glimpse of what all the fuss was about. \n58) Poulenc – La Figure Humaine (Swedish Radio Choir) \nFrancis Poulenc could be the great choral composer of the 20th century. Building up the tension in La Figure Humaine to the great shout in praise of freedom at the end is tough, but the Swedish Radio Choir pull it off magnificently. \n59) Arvo Pärt – Berliner Messe (Polyphony) \nEstonian composer Arvo Pärt is often lumped in with the other “new spiritual” composers, but he’s several cuts above most of them. Polyphony sing his tremendous De Profundis and a group of mysteriously simple pieces including The Beatitudes with total authority. \nCHAMBER \nAnything that can be done within a chamber or small room – except singing, playing the piano or performing the Swanee whistle – chamber music attracts a quiet, pale, intensely earnest crowd. Possibly because, being intimate and discursive, chamber works can often be good substitutes for human company. \n60) Beethoven – Late String Quartets (Busch Quartet) \nFor some, the quartets have become a religion, to be worshipped, not just listened to. The recorded shrine that most true believers return to again and again is the 60-year-old EMI set from the peerless Busch Quartet, whose lively tone balances the play and profundity that infect every bar of these five final works. \n61) Bach – Cello Suites (Pablo Casals) \nFor 150 years, Bach’s cello suites – condemned for being dry – lay in obscurity. A teenage Casals found a copy in a second-hand shop and unveiled them to an astonished world. The recorded testimony – over 60 years old – is a modern miracle. \n62) Bach – Complete Violin Sonatas and Partitas (Nathan Milstein) \nAuthority and rightness pervade this cycle of Bach partitas and sonatas. Milstein’s rendition of the epic chaconne is one of the great musical journeys. \n63) Haydn – Op 76 String Quartets (The Lindsays) \nNever has the musical natter between the four performers of a string quartet so joyously unfolded as in this classic recording from Britain’s finest string quartet. And what chit-chat. Haydn’s Opus 76 set – quiet, modest and tender – are right, royal charmers. \n64) Beethoven – Complete Violin Sonatas (Martha Argerich, Gidon Kremer) \nPairing Argerich and Kremer up for the Beethoven violin sonatas is like tossing a match into a box of firecrackers. Beethoven would surely have smacked his Viennese thighs with hearty approval at their brazenly hairy ride. \n65) Schoenberg, Schubert – Verklärte Nacht; String Quintet(Hollywood String Quartet) \nThe luminous traversal of Schoenberg’s extraordinary late romantic see-saw sextet by America’s first and greatest string quartet – with two reserves from the Hollywood orchestras where they all earned their pay – is exquisite. Indeed, the composer was so impressed he agreed to do the liner notes. \n66) Bartók – Complete String Quartets (Tokyo String Quartet) \nBartók opened the string quartet up to the wilds in these six masterpieces; the players scratch, beat and slide their way through insistently feral terrain. The Tokyo Quartet deliver the perfect balance of measure and madness. \n67) Elliott – Carter String Quartets One to Five (Pacifica Quartet) \nThese five modernist spinning tops, compelling vortexes of ordered chaos and chaotic order, span five decades of the 101-year-old Carter’s epic career. The Pacifica Quartet’s intense renditions, recorded last year, are already a modern classic. \n68) Mozart – Complete String Quintets (Talich Quartet) \nOn top of the Talich’s perfectly judged music-making is a projected sound of unbelievable warmth and realism. So don’t leave the CD on while you’re out; you’ll think a string quartet has broken into your flat. \n69) Brahms – Schubert Piano Quintet Op 34; Piano Quintet 'The Trout’ D 667 (Amadeus String Quartet, Clifford Curzon) \nThe palpable buzz of these joyously unchecked performances by two titans of the last century demonstrates exactly why live recordings are so often preferable to studio ones. Both performances have rarely been bettered. \n70) Debussy & Ravel – String quartets (Alban Berg Quartett) \n“Don’t change a note of your quartet,” said Debussy to Ravel. He was right; it’s perfect, and has a relaxed charm very different to his own. This CD also has Stravinsky’s ground-breaking Three Pieces for String Quartet as a bonus. All are played with fierce concentration by the Berg Quartet. \n71) William Lawes – Consorts to the Organ (Phantasm) \nWilliam Lawes, who died in a Civil War battle, composed these pieces for five or six viols and organ in the 1630s. They’ve been described as a peak of chamber music, worthy to stand alongside Bach’s Musical Offering and Haydn’s string quartets Op. 33. Phantasm make them sound phantastic, appropriately. \n20th CENTURY \nContinental 20th-century classical music is mostly violent, knotted and raw. And it’s likely that, if you decide to buy any for a loved one, they’ll think you want to kill them. \n72) Stravinsky – Rite of Spring (Sir Simon Rattle, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) \nMuch is said of the Rite of Spring’s unpredictability, brutality and force, but little successful is ever done to effect it. How is a conductor to recover the Rite’s initial, terrifying blow – a blow that had crowds tumbling out of auditoriums all over Europe – in a world where such artistic volatility has become quite the convention? And how does one square the intricacies of the musical detail with the primal force of the whole? Rattle shows us how to slow the ritual down, carve it up and shine a light on every last savage detail. \n73) Debussy – La Mer (Serge Koussevitzky, Boston Symphony Orchestra) \nThere’s a salty taste to Koussevitzky’s Thirties recording, a gritty, dirty sting to the sonic wave that puts all competition to shame. No one gets even close to this sort of realism, which brings to life the hollow clang of metal hulls in port as well as the soaring swells of the open seas. \n74) Charles Ives – Symphony 2 (Leonard Bernstein, New York Philharmonic) \nBernstein was a devoted musical patriot, making committed recordings of many of the great American symphonies of Harris, Piston, Schuman and Copland. This one, of Ives’s wistful, folk-filled Second, is arguably the finest. \n75) Bartók – Orchestral Masterworks (Sir Georg Solti, London Symphony Orchestra) \nBartók was Solti’s piano teacher in the Thirties and, to the last, Solti reveals what a dutiful pupil he is, with a performance of Bartók’s orchestral works that adheres to the spirit and the letter of the score. \n76) Dmitri Shostakovich – Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (Mstislav Rostropovich, London Philharmonic Orchestra) \nThis brutish opera, one of the 20th century’s most compelling, on the consequences of a boring bourgeois life, brings musical royalty together, husband and wife team Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich, for a vivid performance. \n77) Olivier Messiaen – Vingts Regards sur l’Enfant Jesus (Yvonne Loriod) \nMessiaen and his wife, Yvonne Loriod, were the God-fearing sort; they had no discernible vices and owned one book – the Bible. The consequence is a very focused performance of Messiaen’s almost improperly vivid, sensuous and at times demonic work. \n78) György Ligeti – Études (Pierre-Laurent Aimard) \n'Topsy-turvy’ doesn’t begin to describe the nature of these skittish, poly-rhythmical prowlers. They’re the études Chopin might have written if he’d lived in Timbuktu. Aimard’s renditions – energetic and precise – are without rival. \n79) Louis Andriessen – De Staat (Lucas Vis, Nederlands Blazers Ensemble) \nFrom Gregorian chant to bebop and back. This is the journey we take with Andriessen on his buzzy, brassy, politically underpinned modern, Minimalist masterpiece, performed with precision and guts by his fellow Dutchman. \n80) Pierre Boulez – Répons, Dialogue de L’Ombre Double (Boulez, Ensemble InterContemporain) \nBehind the po-faced complexity of Boulez’s music is a very French obsession with beauty and colour. Nowhere is this more true than in Répons, in which musical lines, mirrored and mangled by computers, tumble from trill to trill, like birds on a manic migratory journey. \n81) Kurt Weill – Berliner Requiem (Philippe Herreweghe, Ensemble Musique Oblique) \nKurt Weill, son of a synagogue cantor, had to flee the Nazis to the US. By then he’d written a string of masterpieces including the wonderful Berliner Requiem. It can sound harsh and angular, but Herreweghe makes it soft-edged and deep. \n82) Edgar Varèse – complete works (Riccardo Chailly, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra) \nAlmost every work on this double-CD set is a honed masterpiece, from the primitivist “jungle” Offrandes to the stark sounds of Désert, the first piece to mingle electronic sounds with an orchestra. Chailly has done his research, and collated every manuscript, to make this the definitive recording. \nSYMPHONY \nThe Symphony is the grandest musical form. It’s what every composer had to write to be taken seriously, and you could spend a lifetime exploring this one genre. Here are a dozen examples, from the “father of the symphony” Joseph Haydn right up to Shostakovich. \n83) Beethoven – Symphonies 5 and 7 (Carlos Kleiber, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra) \nRhythm lies at the heart of these two extraordinary symphonies. While the Seventh sees 'the apotheosis of the dance’, in the words of Wagner, the Fifth sees the climax of the rhythmic motif, as the famous knock of fate is passed from one movement to another, the composer turning the idea again and again in his hands, moulding new shapes out of the primal clay. Kleiber unlocks the dynamism in the works like no one else. \n84) Haydn – Symphonies 93-104 (Sir Thomas Beecham, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) \nTwo of music’s greatest pranksters, Haydn and Beecham, rollick through Haydn’s toe-tapping London symphonies as if in some Ealing Comedy. There’s wit and grace here to spare. \n85) Mozart – Complete Symphonies (Karl Böhm, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) \nKarl Böhm was a crowing Nazi who once stopped a rehearsal to watch Hitler’s 1923 beer hall putsch. His pioneering Mozart cycle, by contrast, is all self-effacing sophistication. \n86) Berlioz – Symphonie Fantastique (Zubin Mehta, London Philharmonic Orchestra) \nBerlioz’s only symphony is the first of the romantic era and arguably the most inspired; a love-driven, opiate-ridden flight of fancy. Indian conductor Zubin Mehta shapes and guides the winds to perfection. \n87) Brahms – Complete Symphonies (Kurt Sanderling, Dresden Staatskapelle) \nSanderling’s reading of Brahms is an unsentimental one and the symphonies are shot through with passion and pulse. The recording is vivid, the East Germans’ playing first-rate and the musical control masterful. \n88) Tchaikovsky – Symphonies 4, 5 and 6 (Evgeny Mravinsky, Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra) \nThese Russian recordings aren’t just overpowering, they’re terrifying; shifting pace with force and abandon, one moment tossing you out into the waves, the next gently washing you to shore. \n89) Bruckner – Complete Symphonies (Günter Wand, Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra) \nNothing less than the heavens are charted by Bruckner in these nine works. The trajectories of intergalactic objects can be heard in the fizz of the strings and roar of the brass lines that rain down on our ears. \n90) Sibelius – Complete Symphonies (Sir Anthony Collins, London Symphony Orchestra) \nCollins had made his name composing scores for the RKO studios, earning three Oscar nominations, before Victor Olof invited him to record with the London Symphony Orchestra. The result was a Sibelius cycle that is yet to be bettered. \n91) Shostakovich – Symphony 10 (Vasily Petrenko, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic) \nThe young Russian maestro and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic have finished their complete recording of Shostakovich’s symphonies, and it’s knock-out. They reveal the taut, grave tragedy and the demonic energy of the Tenth, perhaps the greatest of the lot. \n92) Mahler – Symphony 9 (Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) \nAbbado’s live performance of Mahler 9 is a haunted, desperate thing which, from the first aborted climax to the washed-up final lines, reveals him to be someone who plumbs deeper into the soul of the work than any other conductor. \n93) Leonard Bernstein – Symphony 2 (Age of Anxiety) (Leonard Bernstein, Israel Philharmonic) \nThe symphony doesn’t have to be totally abstract, and in the 20th century rarely is. This one was inspired by WH Auden’s poem which traces the stories of four New Yorkers trying to sort out their lives. Bernstein brings it to life in a way no other conductor quite manages. \n94) Carl Nielsen – Symphonies 4 and 5 (Sir Colin Davis, London Symphony Orchestra) \nAt the climax of Danish composer Carl Nielsen’s 4th symphony (the Inextinguishable), a side-drum does its best to destroy the symphony, while the orchestra strives to keep it going. It’s a tremendous moment, especially in this recording. \n20th-CENTURY ENGLISH \nEither pastoral and free flowing or loud and brash, the music attracts adherents who are quite embarrassed by the existence of the other and try not to mingle. \n95) Vaughan Williams – Symphony 5 (Dona Nobis Pacem LPO/ BBCSO/ Vaughan Williams) \nTwo rare examples of the composer conducting his own music. The symphony was recorded (off the air) at a Prom in 1952 when he was 80. He knew just how his music should sound and projects the great symphony’s darker moments as well as its radiance. \n96) Elgar – The Dream of Gerontius, Sea Pictures (Janet Baker, Richard Lewis, Kim Borg, Hallé Orch & Sheffield Philharmonic Choirs, LSO/Barbirolli) \nNotable for Janet Baker’s Angel and for her classic singing of Sea Pictures. \n97) Elgar – Symphony 2 and Short Pieces (BBCSO/Boult) \nAdrian Boult recorded this symphony several times but this, his first, made in 1944, is the best. The short pieces include Sospiri and his orchestration of Chopin’s Funeral March. \n98) Elgar – Violin Concerto (Yehudi Menuhin/LSO Elgar) \nHistoric – made in 1932 when Menuhin was 16. It is still the most satisfying interpretation because of Elgar’s conducting. \n99) Elgar and Vaughan Williams – Barbirolli Conducts English Music for Strings (Sinfonia of London, New Philharmonia) \nThe Elgar includes Serenade, Elegy and Introduction and Allegro; the VW, the Tallis Fantasia and Greensleeves. Wonderful playing. \n100) Britten – War Requiem (Galina Vishnevskaya, Peter Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Bach and other Choirs, LSO/ Britten) \nA best-seller after the 1962 Coventry premiere and still a harrowing experience. This reissue has an indispensable recording of Britten rehearsing. \n101) Delius – Brigg Fair, Appalachia etc (LPO/Beecham) \nBeecham had a magic touch with this music and these pre-1939 performances still cast a spell. \n102) Turnage – Twice Through the Heart, Hidden Love Song, In Torn Fields (Sarah Connolly, Gerald Finley, LPO Marin Alsop) \nThree gripping works by this contemporary composer. Connolly is spellbinding as the wife who kills her violent husband. \n103) Finzi – Dies Natalis (Toby Spence and Scottish Ensemble) \nIf Finzi had written nothing else this rapturous cantata, beautifully sung here, would ensure his immortality. \n104) Tippett – A Child of Our Time (Faye Robinson, Sarah Walker, Jon Garrison, John Cheek, CBSO & Chorus/Tippett) \nMoving and topical 1939 oratorio with negro spirituals as chorales. Tippett conducts and the soloists were his choice. \n105) Gustav Holst – Egdon Heath etc. (David Lloyd-Jones, Royal Scottish National Orchestra) \nThere’s so much more to Gustav Holst than The Planets, as this compilation disc shows. It contains his Somerset Rhapsody, his subtle evocation of the Middle East Beni Mora, and his stirringly bleak and grand evocation of Egdon Heath, inspired by Thomas Hardy. \n106) Benjamin Britten – Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge etc. (Benjamin Britten, English Chamber Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra) \nThere’s a whole sub-genre of “English string music”, and Britten’s Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge is a peak in the tradition. Britten was the all-round musician, and this recording of him conducting his own music come up as fresh as a daisy, despite its age. \nSONG \nOne fat person shouting in a small room. That’s how Princess Margaret might have described song. Songs sung in German are called lieder. In French, chansons. The song crowd’s natural habitat is the Wigmore Hall, in London. \n107) Schubert – Winterreise (Fischer-Dieskau/Gerald Moore) \nPerhaps the greatest of all song cycles, sung by a master at the peak of his power. Every changing mood of the traveller through the winter landscape – his despair, false hopes, elation, memories – is limned in subtle detail and gradations of vocal tone by the German baritone. Included in EMI’s Great Recordings of the Century series, this classic disc is one of dozens of this masterpiece, all with some claim on our attention, but this has it all. \n108) Schubert, Wolf (Irmgard Seefried) \nRich selection by this unforgettable soprano who went to the heart of each song in this recital recorded live in London in 1962. \n109) Schubert (Bernarda Fink) \nOne of today’s outstanding mezzo-sopranos, Fink sings a selection of familiar and unfamiliar with superb insight and lustre of tone. \n110) Schubert – A Voyage of Discovery \nTwenty-six songs, with singers who include Felicity Lott, Peter Schreier, Thomas Hampson and many more, accompanied by Graham Johnson. A real treat. \n111) Schubert (Lucia Popp) \nSixteen lieder sung by the late Lucia Popp with Irwin Gage at the piano. Like Seefried, this soprano melts the heart with her artistic insights and her ability to make the best-known songs sound fresh. \n112) Schumann, Brahms (Kathleen Ferrier) \nWhich collector could bear to be without the great English contralto’s performance of Schumann’s Frauenliebe und leben recorded not long before her early death in 1953? Also included are Brahms’s Four Serious Songs and Alto Rhapsody. \n113) Strauss (Christine Brewer, Roger Vignoles) \nThe American soprano, with Vignoles as her partner at the piano, contributes Volume 1 of the Complete Strauss Songs edition. Of the 19 tracks, some are rare items. \n114) Wagner, Mahler (Kirsten Flagstad, Vienna Philharmonic) \nThe Wesendonck Lieder and Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder and Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen, in their orchestral versions, imperiously sung by the Norwegian soprano. The Wagner is conducted by Hans Knappertsbusch, the Mahler by Sir Adrian Boult. \n115) Un Frisson Français (Susan Graham) \nThe American mezzo Graham sings chansons by 22 French composers from Berlioz to Ravel and others in a recital that covers a century of French song. \n116) Brahms, Schumann (Lorraine Hunt Lieberson) \nThe artistry of this American mezzo, whose death aged 52 in 2006 is still profoundly mourned, lives on in this disc that captures the unforgettable magnetism of her personality as well as the unique timbre of her voice. \n117) Schoenberg (Pierrot Lunaire) \nSchoenberg’s 21 songs describing the lurid adventures of “Moon-struck Peter” are nightmarish at first, but become beautiful with repeated hearings. Stravinsky described them as “the mind as well as the solar plexus of 20th-century music”. \n118) Edvard Grieg – Songs (Anne-Sofie von Otter) \nForget Peer Gynt – the songs are where the real genius of Edvard Grieg lie. Some of them are melancholy and artful, some are rumbustious and folky. Swedish soprano Anne-Sofie von Otter gets to the heart of them. \nORCHESTRAL \nThe orchestra must be the richest musical medium ever created. It’s a shape-shifter, one minute evoking ancient Rome, the next a stormy sea, the next a futuristic landscape. And – just to add the fascination – every orchestra is different. \n119) Richard Strauss – Ein Heldenleben (Fritz Reiner, Chicago Symphony Orchestra) \nFritz Reiner’s partnership with RCA Victor in the Fifties was one of the greatest in recording history. On this disc, you’ll find the noblest and fleshiest musical incarnations of Strauss’s Hero ever recorded. \n120) Dvořák – The Water Goblin etc. (Simon Rattle, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) \nWater Goblins, Noon Witches, Golden Spinning Wheels, Wild Doves – the titles of Dvořák’s four late tone-poems tell us we’re going to be plunged into the world of Slavic fairy-tales. Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic paint them in vivid colours. \n130) Aaron Copland – Appalachian Spring (Aaron Copland, London Symphony Orchestra) \nNo composer captured the heart of white rural America better than the gay Jewish New Yorker Aaron Copland. His performances with the LSO catch the sense of space, the loneliness and the sober joy of the music. \n140) Smetana – Ma Vlast (James Levine, Vienna Philharmonic) \nToo much Czech charm, you might be thinking, to have Smetana’s tone-poems as well as Dvořák’s? Not really. Smetana’s great series of tone-poems are very different, and Vltava has a fabulous tune that makes any patriotic Czech feel tearful. And quite a few Brits too. \n141) Bizet – L’Arlesienne Suites 1 & 2 (Sir Thomas Beecham, French National Radio Orchestra, RPO) \nSir Thomas Beecham’s caressing, lively, characterful way with Bizet’s L’Arlesienne has never been bettered. And on this CD Bizet’s terrific Symphony in C is thrown in for good measure. \n142) Tchaikovsky – The Nutcracker (Valery Gergiev, Kirov Orchestra) \nThis music reminds you of what Christmas was like as a child. Every piece comes as a delicious treat, familiar and unexpected at the same time - especially in this fantastically vivid performance from the Kirov Orchestra and Valery Gergiev. \n143) Ravel – Daphnis and Chloe etc (Pierre Monteux, Orchestra and Chorus of the Royal Opera Covent Garden) \nThere’s no more purely sensuous ballet score than Daphnis and Chloé, and this great recording under Pierre Monteux, one of the great conductors of the last century, does it proud. \n144) Scriabin – Prometheus, Symphony no 3 (Evgeni Svetlanov, USSR Symphony Orchestra) \nJust because Scriabin was a half-crazed egomaniac doesn’t mean he wasn’t also a fine and subtle composer. This excellent CD brings togethr two of his best orchestral works, which open a door onto a strange fervently mystical landscape. \n145) Manuel de Falla – The Three-Cornered Hat (Ernest Ansermet, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande) \nManuel de Falla captured the soul of Spain in his ballets, and this recording with two great Spanish soloists – pianist Alicia de Larrocha and soprano Teresa Berganza – is a classic in its own right. \n146) Anton Webern – Six Orchestral Pieces etc (Robert Craft, Philharmonia Orchestra) \nWebern was the master of the miniature. He could “express a novel in a sigh” according to his teacher Schoenberg. This CD contains a good slice of his entire output, including his Six Orchestral Pieces, which say quiet, tiny things with a huge orchestra. \nNEW FACES \n“The silver-haired maestro” is increasingly taking a back seat to a new generation of young virtuosos. Some of these have a brilliant technique and not much else, but the best of them have a huge personality to match. \n147) Patricia Kopatchinskaja (Violin Concertos by Bartok, Ligeti and Eötvös) \nThis 37 year-old Moldovan has been described as “the most exciting violinist in the world.” Her recording of these three concertos has a wonderful rhapsodic air, as if she’s making them up on the spot. \n148) Alina Ibragimova (complete violin and piano music by Ravel) \nAnother brilliant young female violinist, but Ibragimova’s fiercely dramatic style is very different to Kopatchinskaja’s rhapsodic waywardness. These recordings of Ravel, made with French pianist Cedric Tiberghien, are electrifying. \n149) Mahan Esfahani (harpsichord works by Bach, Byrd and Ligeti) \nSo you think you hate the harpsichord? Iranian-born American harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani will make you think again. He makes the music so vivid you forget the instrument’s limitations. \n150) Igor Levit (late piano sonatas by Beethoven) \nThe sheer beauty of sound Igor Levit conjures from the piano is astonishing, and he creates a totally convincing narrative shape for these profound and sometimes puzzling works. \n151) Elena Xanthoudakis (arias by Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti) \nThis bubbly Australian soprano is following in the footsteps of her great compatriot Joan Sutherland, with a superb debut album of bel canto arias. \n152) Cameron Carpenter (Revolutionary; transcriptions of music by Chopin, Ellington, Liszt etc.) \nCarpenter is the organist purists love to hate. He’s flamboyant in every way, from his sexuality to his on-stage string vests to his colourful organ registrations. This album Revolutionary was the first organ CD to be nominated for a Grammy. \n153) Benjamin Grosvenor (Dances: music by Bach, Albeniz, Granados etc) \nThis British pianist has been hailed as a reincarnation of the poetic, very personal style of pre-war virtuosos like Cortot. This new album is an intriguing compilation of dance music for piano, cleverly programmed and brilliantly played. \n154) Miloš (Aranjuez: guitar music by Falla and Rodrigo) \nHis smouldering good looks help, but this Montenegran guitarist is a genuinely superb musician, whose superstar status is doing wonders for the classical guitar’s popularity. \n155) Mark Simpson (Prism: contemporary works for clarinet) \nFar too talented for his own good, Mark Simpson excels as a composer, conductor and clarinetist (in which role he became BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2006). On his debut album he plays contemporary works for clarinet, including one of his own. \n156) Aisha Orazbayeva (The Hand Gallery) \nOne of a new breed of musicians who avoid the usual career paths and genre boundaries, the Kazakh-born violinist and composer’s second CD has music by Feldman, Steve Reich and herself, plus pop songs by John Cale and Elvis Presley, all recreated on the four strings of a violin. \nIN THE CRACKS \nNot all classical music is written for orchestras and string quartets and pianos. Not all of it is written in serious genres like sonata and symphony. Not all of it is written by dead European males. Here’s a sample of the wonderful music that falls in the cracks. \n157) Stravinsky – Les Noces (Soloists of Mariinsky Theatre) \nIn modern times composers have often invented new combinations of instruments. Few make such an unmistakable, brilliant sound as the four pianos and percussion of Stravinsky’s ballet Les Noces. \n158) Ernesto Nazareth – Piano Works (Marcelo Bratke) \nBrazilian composer Ernesto Nazareth wrote elegant little salon pieces, but don’t dismiss him. “When I heard the music of Ernesto Nazareth, I finally understood the Brazilian soul,” said the French composer Darius Milhaud. \n159) Chopin/Godowsky – Etudes (Boris Berezovsky) \nLeopold Godowsky was one of those heroic virtuoso composer-pianists from the pre-war era. He took Chopin’s Etudes, already fantastically difficult, and made them harder, just for fun. \n160) Percy Grainger – works for wind-band (Royal Northern College of Music Wind Orchestra) \n“Grainger is the master of us all,” said Benjamin Britten, referring to the Australian composer’s uncanny skill at arranging folk-songs. This CD has some wonderful examples, plus Grainger’s own powerfully original Hill Song no. 2 \n161) Revueltas – Sensemayá (Michael Tilson Thomas, New World Symphony Orchestra) \nWhen European modernism crossed the Atlantic and mingled with native Latin American music, something extraordinary happened. Sample it on this disc of Latin American orchestral music. \n162) Franz Berwald – Grand Septet (The Gaudier Ensemble) \nClassical music swarms with composers who may not be top rank but have something interesting and individual to say. The Swedish composer Franz Berward is one, as this charming disc of chamber pieces shows. \n163) Messiaen – Turangalîla (Chailly, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra) \nClassical music has spawned lots of odd instruments, some of which make truly strange and wonderful sounds. One of them is the ondes martenot, which sounds like a visitor from outer space. Hear it on Messiaen’s great orchestral work Turangalîla. \n164) Clara Schumann – Piano Concerto in A etc (Veronica Jochum, Bamberg Symphony Orchestra) \nWomen composers form the hidden side of classical music, only now being uncovered. Clara Schumann was one of the finest composers of the mid-19th century. In some ways she was better than her famous husband Robert. \n165) Music for Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain (David Munrow, Early Music Consort of London) \nDavid Munrow was a great pioneer in the revival of ancient, obsolete instruments. On this fascinating CD there’s a whole menagerie of them, and the music they play is fascinating too. \n166) The Jazz Album (Simon Rattle, London Sinfonietta) \nAlmost a hundred years ago, classical music was bitten by the jazz bug. This album has the classics of the new classic/jazz hybrid, from Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud and George Gershwin. \nAnd our final two choices are… compilations \nContrary to popular belief, buying a box set or compilation album need not be a compromise. Many of the finest recordings will be found behind their flimsy naff cardboard walls and you’ll often discover that they’re the gift that keeps on giving. Within these pages, we have a number: The art of Nathan Milstein, Simon Rattle’s Stravinsky and Beecham’s Haydn. \nEarly and Baroque music does particularly well in this format. Handel, for example, is very well served by the compilation set, allowing you to hone in on your favourite aria. Good examples include Scholl’s Ombra mai fu on Harmonia Mundi or Ciofi and DiDonato’s duetting on Virgin. The naff-sounding Handel Gold from Decca and DG is especially good. \nIn the bargain basement, a little more discernment and care is needed. Belart have an album called 100 Classical Hits that are hits only in the very narrow sense of the word: the fist-to-the-ear sense. The contents of Victor’s The Only Piano Album You’ll Ever Need, similarly, doesn’t do full justice to the title. In fact, I’d replace the word 'ever’ with 'never’. \nVirgin TV’s Best Classical Album in the World… Ever! , on the other hand, isn’t bad at all, with some very decent conductors and soloists.
