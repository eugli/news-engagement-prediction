According to the EPSB, remuneration of trustees has been frozen since the 2010-2011 fiscal year. \nTrustees with the EPSB have been receiving annual honorariums of $30,315 compared to $40,000 with the Edmonton Catholic School Board and $45,000 given to trustees with the Calgary Board of Education. Trustees voted to increase their annual honorariums to $36,523 and to tie future increases to external economic measures based on Statistics Canada’s consumer price index instead of relying on trustee recommendations. \n“Through the research that we had commissioned, we saw that the Edmonton Public School Board trustees were in fact well below what our colleagues in the metros are being remunerated, in terms of an honorarium,” Michelle Draper, the EPSB’s acting chair, said. \nThe change to trustee remuneration will take effect once the new board is sworn in following the Oct. 16, 2017 election. Trustee remuneration will be reviewed annually. \nTrustees are tasked with governing students’ education through school boards by communicating decisions it makes to students, parents and staff, setting educational goals for its jurisdictions, creating policies and standards for staff and students, adjudicating policy or decision appeal and lobbying governments on educational issues. \n“Our schools are complex, our children are growing in numbers – we’re going to have almost 100,000 students – 11 new schools (are) opening, the role of a trustee brings different knowledge, experience, professional expertise… we wanted to make sure that we’re being fairly remunerated,” Draper said. \nThe EPSB has 95,642 students and has a $1.161-billion budget for 2016-17. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:21:59.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
