'The venue did not have the correct licence and the owner will be prosecuted. The tourist from the UK has been warned about this.' Crime-ridden Pattaya is home to thousands of brothels, massage parlous and strip bars. Police are desperate to clean up the city's image after a series of high-profile crimes. In a separate clampdown in Indonesia, condoms were swiped from shops in an attempt to 'prevent promiscuity'. The man was caught in bed with the prostitute as part of a Valentine's Day clampdown Although Thai officials are attempting to clean up the country's image, the government handed out pills it calls 'very magical vitamins' to prospective mothers to boost the country's falling birthrate just before Valentine's Day. Government workers started distributing Â£22,00-worth of prenatal vitamins Tuesday to women between the ages of 20 and 34. The pills contain folic acid and iron and the giveaway is part of a program called 'the campaign for red-cheeked Thai women to have children for the country using very magical vitamins'. Thai officials also handed out fertility pills Fewer Thai couples are getting married, and are doing so later in their lives, meaning fewer children each year. Dr Wachira Pengjuntr, director of the Department of Health, said: 'The Thai way of life is changing. 'Thai women are receiving higher education and the newer generation is placing a higher value on being single.' Thailand's population grew by only 0.4 percent in 2015, down from 2.7 percent in 1970. If the trend continues, the population will stop growing in 10 years, Wachira said. The campaign is also hosting wedding ceremonies as Thais consider Valentine's Day to be an auspicious day to get married. Worrawut Ploywong and Priyapat Ploywong were among the couples tying the knot Tuesday. 'As for having babies, I want to have them as soon as we can and as many as we can,' said Worrawut, a wing commander in the Thai air force. 'We wish for many souls to be born.' Less than three hours away on a plane, Indonesian authorities raided convenience stores and seized condoms in a major city to stop teenagers having casual sex on Valentine's Day. Indonesian officials raided shops and swiped condoms to stop teenagers having casual sex It is the latest crackdown on the holiday in the Muslim-majority nation. The mayor of Makassar, a conservative city on central Sulawesi island, led public order officers in the raids late Monday on the eve of the celebration. Mayor Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto said he was not against the sale of condoms but that outlets needed to be careful about whom they were sold to. 'Valentine's Day is often misused by teenagers to have casual sex, this can destroy the morality of the nation,' he was quoted as saying in local media. Iman Hud - head of the local public officers, similar to police but with fewer powers - said convenience stores had been failing to check teenagers' IDs to see whether they were at least 18 years old, the age of consent, before selling them condoms. 'We are doing this to prevent promiscuity,' he said, adding that hundreds of condoms were seized in the raids in the city of 1.3million. It was the latest expression of anger at Valentine's Day in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, where Islamic clerics and some pious Muslims use the occasion to criticise what they see as Western decadence. On Monday teenage pupils, including girls in headscarves, staged a protest outside a school in the city of Surabaya, chanting: 'Say no to Valentine!' Celebrating the romantic holiday has also been banned by authorities in some parts of the country, as it is every year. Despite some objections, many in Indonesia mark the occasion, particularly in major cities where cards and chocolates are widely available. Most in the country practice a moderate form of Islam.
