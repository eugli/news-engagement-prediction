Jessa (Duggar) Seewald recently confessed that one of the things making it easier is how hands on Ben has been with their two sons . \nThe Counting On stars welcomed their second son, Henry Wilberforce, on February 6. The little guy joined big brother Spurgeon, who is practically still a baby himself at 15 months old. \nMore from CafeMom: Unmarried Teen Duggar Sister Rumored to Be Pregnant \nJessa told PEOPLE magazine that they are already dividing and conquering when it comes caring for their newborn son. She feeds him, and Ben is on diaper duty. \"He's gotten so good he could do it with his eyes closed!\" she revealed. \nBen also opened up about having more than one kiddo, saying, \"Right now we have two kids and there's two of us, so it's man-to-man coverage.\" Eventually though, he joked they'll have to \"switch it up to a zone defense\" when they start adding more to their brood. \nMore from CafeMom: Jessa Duggar Opens Up About Her Home Birth Experience With Baby Henry \nIt's awesome that Ben is such an involved dad, especially considering that they've talked a lot about their plans for a big family. No word on if Jessa is thinking about having 19 of her own like her mom Michelle, but she's definitely not done with just Spurgeon and Henry. \nBen and Jessa seem to have transitioned into parenting two so well that we can't help but see them with at least a few more little ones running around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:20.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
