A few hours before the game, Pope Francis delivered a short message to fans about the worldwide importance of the biggest football game of the year. On this special day, we bring you a very special message from Pope Francis ( @Pontifex ). #SB51 pic.twitter.com/LtNlcpCnYy \n— Houston Super Bowl (@HouSuperBowl) February 5, 2017 “Great sporting events like today’s Super Bowl are highly symbolic, showing that it is possible to build a culture of encounter and a world of peace. By participating in sport, we are able to go beyond our own self interest – and in a healthy way – we learn to sacrifice, to grow in fidelity and respect the rules. May this year’s Super Bowl be a sign of peace, friendship and solidarity to the world. Thank you!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:13:53.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
