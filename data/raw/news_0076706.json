So, he trained on wheels and was able to score a spot in the qualifying round in Lahti 2017 to represent his home country. \nJust a little something to get you through the final hours of your actual work week here since tomorrow is Friday so it’s not like you’re going to really be doing anything anyway. Sometimes you just need a little pick-me-up on a Thursday afternoon when the week is dragging along and Adrian Solano is here to provide that for us. Just look at him go. \nNow I’d love to get up here and make fun of this guy for sucking, but I can’t. Because I’ve got nothing but respect for Adrian Solano right now. Dude has never seen snow before in his life and still went out there to compete against some of the best skiers in the world. Granted, it looked like he spent most of the morning in the lodge boozin’ it up before he hit the slopes. Nothing wrong with ripping a few shots on the lift, bombing down the hill and then spending the rest of the day slugging Bloody Marys in the lodge trying to hit on some mountain babes. But yeah. He’s never been on snow before, trained for this event regardless, went out there, sacked up and at least attempted to do it. Nothing but respect for that. Doesn’t mean I’m not going to laugh at those spills though. \nP.S. – Really need a Cool Runnings 2 with the Venezuelan Ski Team. \nDouble P.S. – Stupid Sexy Flanders. \nh/t Blackburn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:20:48.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
