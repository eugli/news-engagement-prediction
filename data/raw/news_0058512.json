A general view of an eye shadow palette. Credit: ITV News \nYou may never of heard of it. It's an ingredient that has evaded the headlines. Yet mica has pride of place in Britain's thriving beauty business. It adds a sparkle to eye shadow, make-up, nail varnish and much more. \nITV News research shows that some of the biggest manufacturers in cosmetics admit there's a problem. \nHowever, we've also found there are already big questions about the industry's new plan to tackle its problems in sourcing ethical mica. \nThe big cosmetics firms have known about the risk of child labour in mica mining for years. Yet it was only this month that companies came together to form a \" responsible mica initiative \". It brings together some of the biggest firms in the sector and it's estimated the project will take five years. Archive photograph of models applying nail varnish.

Thanks to these efforts, our supply chain of Indian mica is now almost completely secured.\" An archive photograph of a stylist at work.

But at Lush they found that it can also be part of a complex mix of materials used to make colour and shine in this industry. \nIt's what the company began to call the \"murky world of mica\". It still aims to remove all natural mica - and Lush does not knowingly buy it. What they learned shows how hard it is for cosmetic companies to make firm guarantees on mica content.

Credit: PA \nIt's estimated that around 25% of world production of mica comes from illegal collection - and that 70% of India's output is from unethical sources. \nThat's a potential image problem for an industry that thrives on the way things look.
