After playing Wolverine for more than a decade, Hugh Jackman is gracefully bowing out of the role with one final parting shot. Logan is slated to hit theaters next month, leaving fans both excited and sad to see the leading actor’s last hurrah. The character of Wolverine has become a popular once thanks to Jackman’s work, and the X-Men Cinematic Universe has heavily used the mutant. With Jackman out, many have thought about which actor could take over the role as 20th Century Fox surely continues their expansion. And, now, the director of Logan has pitched in his thoughts. \nDuring an interview with Bad Taste , James Mangold was asked who he would choose to replace Jackman as Wolverine. Perhaps jokingly, the director answered with the following straight-faced line: “I don’t think anyone should ever play Wolverine again.” \nContinuing, Mangold went on to say, “I’m not going to cast Hamlet. Maybe someone else in ten years can play him.” \nOf course, recasting the character would be difficult one. Much like Robert Downey Jr. and Iron Man, Jackman has become closely linked to his X-Men role. However, the star has admitted he’s come to terms with the role being passed onto others. Speaking to the New York Times, Jackman said, “The character will go on. Someone else will play it, for sure.” \nAre you excited to see Logan ? Let us know how hyped you are with our anticipation rankings! Currently, the film is #6 on our site! \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men, are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet. \nLogan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green. \nLogan hits theaters on March 3, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:50:37.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
