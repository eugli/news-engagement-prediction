(Photo: azcentral.com)\n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A 7-year-old girl was impaled by an arrow after she slipped walking up a hill at a Mesa archery range on Sunday, according to Rural Metro Fire Department.\nBystanders told officials they had seen the girl walking with a quiver of arrows on her side about 1:30 p.m. before she fell forward onto one of them, according to department spokesman Shawn Gilleland. The 2-foot arrow was lodged in the girl's neck at least an inch deep, Gilleland said.\nAccording to a press release from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, the girl was participating in an archery event at Usery Mountain Regional Park, moving from one target to another when she fell.\nAn off-duty Glendale Fire Department captain and paramedic was helping the girl when Rural Metro crews arrived, Gilleland said. She was \"conscious and alert\" at the time, he said.\nCrews used a \"big wheel\" — a basket that allows crews to safely transport patients down a mountain — to take the girl off the trail. Her injuries were not life-threatening, and she was taken to a local hospital with the arrow secured in place, Gilleland said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91e7e4486d48f725fd8e2aa594352708ce4b3e5c/c=86-183-867-772&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/04/08//1397001225002-azc-thisjustin.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2lkxtFx&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/04/08/1397001225002-azc-thisjustin.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2lkxtFx&text=Arrow%20lodges%20in%20girl%E2%80%99s%20neck%20after%20fall%20at%20Mesa%20archery%20range&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/04/08//1397001225002-azc-thisjustin.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-20T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:31:42.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
