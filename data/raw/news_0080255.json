Farhadi won “Best Foreign Film” for his production “The Salesman” but did not accept his award in person because of the administration’s legally entangled travel ban. \n“I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war,” Ansari said on behalf of Farhadi, according to Fox News . \nHenderson took issue Monday with the Hollywood left’s “self-righteous” behavior, noting its own lack of “inclusion” and “diversity”: \nI think it’s also pretty hypocritical. I mean, Hollywood, probably one of the biggest purveyors of racist, ageist, sexist imagery across the globe, across the decades. So this idea that they should get up there and lecture anyone about inclusion, about diversity, I mean, it’s laughable. In the history of the Academy Awards, one African-American woman has won Best Actress. The Oscars has been around for 90 years. These sort of self-righteous, smug liberals, I mean, it’s really hypocritical. \nIn 2002, Halle Barry became the first black woman to win the Oscar for “Best Actress,” earning the award for her role in “Monster’s Ball.” A number of black women have won for “Best Supporting Actress.” \nMultiple black actors have also taken home the Oscar for “Best Actor,” including Forrest Whittaker, Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx and Sidney Poitier. \nMahershala Ali, who is black, became the first Muslim actor ever to win any Oscar. Ali won “best actor in a supporting role” for playing “Juan” in “Moonlight,” according to CNN .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:06:48.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
