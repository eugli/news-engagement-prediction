While these cases do show what is expected to be the final design of the LG G6 and they do appear to be fairly accurate representations of the phone, it’s nothing that hasn’t been seen before as the LG G6 has leaked quite a few times over the past couple of weeks. That being said, the phone design in the images for the case does match up with previously leaked images of the phone itself including various renders, so it’s likely that the design here is correct. \nIn regards to the phone design, the LG G6 is pictured with the camera sensors on the back of the device on both sides of the LED flash module with the fingerprint sensor just below it, and just like previous leaks it shows the phone in two different color options, which look to be a silver and a black or dark gray model. As for the case itself, it comes in four different colors which includes a Rose Gold, Smoke Black, Ink Black, and a Clear option. These are listed as Tough Cases by Ringke, so that means that they were designed to allow a lot more protection for the LG G6 when placed on the phone. \nThe cases have been military tested and have an MIL-STD 810G rating against drops so you can feel safe that a little drop won’t be the end of the line for your device. In addition to the tough exterior, the case is also designed to stay somewhat slim so you won’t be bulking up your phone a whole lot by adding this extra layer of protection. The case also features a lifted bezel so the camera sensors on the back as well as the fingerprint sensor and the display will all be safe from damage should the phone fall flat. The case also features port closures for both the headphone port and the charging port down on the bottom. Although the LG G6 has not yet officially been announced, you can still pick up the cases for the phone, and right now Amazon seems to be offering them at a steep discount with the price currently being set at $11.99 down from $30, although the cases won’t be in stock until March 31st according to the listing, which may also allude to the release date of the LG G6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:23:25.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
