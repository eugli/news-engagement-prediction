He conducted the President's daily intelligence briefing, prepared Trump for phone calls with the leaders of Nigeria and South Africa, and sat in talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, part of which centered on refugee policy. Until Monday, the White House expressed only faith in Flynn, a retired general who caused deep consternation among career National Security Council staff during his brief tenure. It wasn't until late in the day, after Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Trump had \"full confidence\" in Flynn, that signs of trouble emerged. Reports emerged that Justice Department officials had warned the White House last month that Flynn could potentially be blackmailed by Russia. Spicer, appearing in a West Wing hallway after the President brushed off the questions about Flynn, said that Trump was \"evaluating the situation\" with input from Pence. Spicer was reading from a statement he had just composed in the Oval Office with Trump and chief of staff Reince Priebus, whose own standing in the administration recently emerged as a subject of speculation. Trump, aware of DOJ warning, asked Flynn to resign after loss of trust As the different descriptions of Flynn's position emerged, Conway darted into Spicer's office, leaving a few moments later. Just before 6 p.m. ET, the press secretary told reporters that Trump wanted to make known he was assessing Flynn's actions. \"That is the statement the President wanted to express,\" Spicer said, ending any incertitude about whether Flynn was still in good standing. The evaluation, it turned out, didn't require long. Seen in the Oval Office for a final time just before Trump swore in his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at 8 p.m., Flynn handed over his resignation letter to Trump shortly after the President requested he step down. \"Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador,\" Flynn wrote in the letter, which was made public at 11 p.m. ET. \"I have sincerely apologized to the President and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology.\" For Trump, a stalwart believer in loyalty who's been taking advice from Flynn for the better part of two years, it was an unpleasant and early entry into the world of West Wing reshuffles. White House officials said Tuesday the decision was necessary. \"The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust, and the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security adviser,\" Spicer said. \"The President decided to ask for his resignation and he got it.\" But even for a man who's public image has been lassoed to the act of terminating employees, the first high-profile sacking left a bad taste. \"Outside of 'Apprentice,' Trump does not relish firing people,\" one administration official said.
