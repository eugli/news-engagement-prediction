Which credit card was used by the Modi government for these advertisements?\" Sisodia asked. \n\nHe also asked for details of companies and individuals across the world awarded the contracts for the advertisements. \n\n\"When we talk about people's issues, it is corruption. When he (Modi) talks (Mann ki Baat), it is patriotism. Why this difference?\" \n\nSisodia said if Modi had the CBI to seize files of the Delhi government, then he (Sisodia) would use RTI to access files from the Prime Minister's Office. \n\n\"We will place both files before the people and they will decide who is using public money for the right purpose and who is misusing it.\" \n\nThe \"Talk to AK\" campaign was an interactive session of Kejriwal, under which people could reach out to the leader through social media.
