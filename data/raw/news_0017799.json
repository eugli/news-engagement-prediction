Sebastian Murdock Reporter, The Huffington Post \nThe woman in charge of all U.S. public schools was blocked from entering one by protesters on Friday morning. \nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos attempted to enter Jefferson Middle School in Washington, D.C., but protesters barred her way up the school steps. WATCH: Sec. Betsy DeVos physically blocked by protesters from entering DC school--turned away and left. — ABC 7 News - WJLA (@ABC7News) February 10, 2017 \nIn video obtained by ABC 7, DeVos can be seen immediately turning back from the school and walking to her vehicle. \n“Giving your money to senators and buying your way into the position ― you should be so proud of yourself!” a man can be heard shouting at her. \nHe was likely referring to the fact that DeVos has made significant financial contributions to the campaigns of GOP senators who confirmed her and their affiliated super PACs.﻿ \n“Go back!” he continued as DeVos got back into the vehicle. “Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!” \nThe same protester can then be seen blocking a vehicle as it tries to leave the parking lot. Video by Fox 5 news later shows him being detained by police. \nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, tweeted that she did not condone the protest, though she had previously called DeVos’ confirmation a “sad day for children.” Just heard a protester blocked & almost knocked Secy @BetsyDeVos down at Jefferson.We don't condone such acts.We want her to go to pub schls — Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) February 10, 2017 \nDeVos relied on a tie-breaker by Vice President Mike Pence to be confirmed for her Cabinet position. Her nomination for secretary of education sparked anger from citizens who believe she is unqualified for the job. \nDeVos was ridiculed for recently saying that guns in schools might be necessary to ward off grizzly bear attacks . Her critics also assert that she is unfamiliar with basic education concepts and laws because she never attended a public school, doesn’t send her children to public schools, and has never formally worked in public schools. \nIt’s unclear if DeVos found another way into the school she was attempting to visit on Tuesday. \nHow will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?
