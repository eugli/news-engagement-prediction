Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and “Democrats united across the country” will become his “worst nightmare.” Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD \n— Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017 \nAnd while Perez probably thought he tweeted a snarky comeback, Democrats thought otherwise. \nLiberals who replied to Perez’s tweet took issue with his statement that Democrats are “united.” Many, in fact, believe the Democratic Party is currently deeply divided — and it showed during Saturday’s chairman vote. \nPerez, thought to be a moderate who represents the politics of Obama and Hillary Clinton, narrowly defeated Ellison, who represents the extremely liberal-wing of the DNC, on a second ballot. The election, and the run-up to Perez winning, proved Democrats are far from united. \nAnd Democrats were quick to inform Perez of that fact on Twitter Saturday: @gohomeben @TomPerez @keithellison Yes, I'm sure Trump is shook by the \"corporate cash first, working class last\" strategy again. \n— Rain Duran (@RainDuran) February 26, 2017 @TomPerez @keithellison I'm done with democrats.
