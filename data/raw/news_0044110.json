Engelbert Banqui, head of the Cabatuan Police Station, said Roger Someros, 37, and Roger Ebarle, 43, were dead on arrival at the Ramon Tabiana Memorial District Hospital in Cabatuan while Juan Baron Jr., 43, died while undergoing treatment at the Iloilo Mission Hospital in Iloilo City. \n“Juan Baron Jr., Roger Ebarle and their group were drinking beer by the roadside when Roger Someros and seven others passed by. Barangay Kagawad (Village councilman) Jonathan Baron offered beer to Someros and he later joined them,” Banquillo confirmed. ADVERTISEMENT \nLater, Someros indiscriminately fired his gun, reportedly a. 45-pistol. Councilman Baron and Ebarle tried to pacify Someros who resisted, sparking a fight that led to a series of gunshots and ended up with Someros, Ebarle and Juan Baron Jr. lying on the ground and bloodied. \nSomeros sustained stab wounds in the abdomen, chest and the back of his body. Juan Baron Jr. was wounded in different parts of the body while Ebarle sustained gunshot wounds in the head and chest. \nPolice said they were still in the process of identifying everybody who participated in the fight. \n“It’s a family conflict. We could not yet name the suspects. We hope the family will allow the autopsy of the bodies so that we can establish the causes of deaths and possibly help pinpoint the suspects,” Banquillo said in an interview over RMN Iloilo Radio Station. \nBarangay Jelicuon Montinola was celebrating their annual fiesta on Monday. The fight happened right outside their barangay plaza where a benefit dance (commonly known as benayle) was ongoing.
