The ad ends before they reach their final destination, and asks viewers to go to the company‚Äôs website to see the conclusion of the journey that was too controversial for TV.\nSuper Bowl Ad: 84 Lumber (1:33) A mother and daughter take a journey in this Super Bowl ad for 84 Lumber.\nIt was, in fact, too hot for TV. CBS rejected the original commercial from the construction-materials company as too political. In the extended video online, the pair end their journey against a massive border wall. The girl unfolds the scraps she‚Äôs collected, which turn out to be a hand-weaved American flag. The pair then find an enormous door in the wall, which opens up and they enter their new country. ‚ÄúThe will to succeed is always welcome here,‚Äù the ad says.\nMany never saw Part 2 of the commercial ‚Äî 84 Lumber‚Äôs website crashed, apparently from overuse, immediately after the ad aired.\nSome on social media were quick to denounce the commercial as promoting illegal immigration and called for a boycott of the Pennsylvania-based company.\nGlad to see 84 lumber encouraging illegals to break our laws & sneak into our country. Forgot to include the cartel smugglers tho. #Deport\n‚Äî Jeremy Nolt (@RealJeremyNolt) February 6, 2017 The 84 lumber add is just propaganda for \"legal\" immigration and for border walls, it's stupid and regressive\n‚Äî Guacboi (@Beckhambinho) February 6, 2017 I won't be shopping at 84 Lumber again. Too bad. Was great place. Adios. #SuperBowl #84Lumber\n‚Äî Thomas Paine (@Thomas1774Paine) February 6, 2017 Others interpreted the commercial as merely showing people striving for a better life.\n84 lumber company just reminded all of us. Who we all... really are. And how we ALL got here #84lumber\n‚Äî Carlos Espinoza üá∫üá∏ (@Espinoza91C) February 6, 2017 To anyone who missed the point of the 84 Lumber commercial, it was simple and uncontroversial.\nIllegal immigrants are humans.\nThat's it.\n‚Äî #NeverTrump #Ex-GOP (@Trump_Truther) February 6, 2017 84 Lumber had the gutsiest commercial ever!
