Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time Ibra on Martial \nThe big Swede, who himself has scored 20 times for Man Utd since arriving from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, told reporters, via manutd.com : \"When he (Martial) plays, he is playing well. He isn’t a guy that speaks a lot; he is quiet and very professional. \n\"He always tries to do his best, trains hard and that is paying off, just like in this match (against Watford). I think it depends on every individual and what kind of person they are and their approach, how open he is.\" \nThe 35-year-old striker continued: \"It is different for every person. He is not going around with his head down. He is training hard, he gives a lot of energy and he wants to play, which is normal. \n\"When we eat breakfast and he is beside me or if he passes me, we talk. I think everyone talks to everyone. It is not like you try to cheer him up; it is a good atmosphere and the guys are all good guys, very professional.\" Promising signs from Martial \nOn the 21-year-old's display in the win over Watford, which took United to within just two points of the top four, Ibrahimovic added: \"He was creating good chances. \n\"I felt he tired in the second half because he was running a lot and he hasn’t played every game, but he played well. He scored a nice goal and it’s good for him and his confidence and the team.\" \nBoth Zlatan and Man United supporters will hope that Martial can carry that form into the club's next game this Thursday, where he'll be up against familiar opposition in the form of French side Saint-Etienne in the Europa League Round of 32 first leg. \nWhat do YOU make of Mourinho's man-management of Martial this season? Will the French talent eventually become a regular under the \"Special One\" at Man Utd? Have YOUR say in the comments box below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
