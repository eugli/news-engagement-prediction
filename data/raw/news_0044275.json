Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nBut the fiscal repair benefits should not be over-stated. Even with their tricks, wealthier taxpayers already carry a heavy burden of personal tax revenue. And the design of such rules is extremely problematic because fairly distinguishing legitimate work expenses - say the cost of a ute - from those that are not, is anything but straightforward. \nFor small businesses, sole traders, this is critical. \nShould Labor embrace the idea, it will win plaudits but put at risk its hard-won reputation as pro-aspirational, pro-wealth accumulation, pro-business. \nSure as eggs, the government will tag the move as creeping socialism, and of course, as typical of a party that never sees a problem that cannot be fixed with more taxes. \nAnd if Malcolm Turnbull is captive to his conservative right wing, Bill Shorten increasingly appears vulnerable to the charge of being in thrall to the left. \nWhether it be climate policy - where he is struggling to reassure voters that his 50 per cent renewable commitment is affordable, or other policies, a gathering Coalition narrative paints Shorten as a populist, every bit as desperate to neutralise his green-left flank as Turnbull is to manage One Nation and the Nats on his right. \nMeanwhile the middle gets thinner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:33:50.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
