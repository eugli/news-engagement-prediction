In case you'd ever wondered. 23/02/2017 15:30 Sarah Ann Harris News Reporter, The Huffington Post UK \nStorms in the UK have only been given names in recent years - but there’s actually a very good reason this is now done. \nThe Met Office , in partnership with Ireland’s Met Éireann forecaster, began naming storms in autumn 2015. \nThe pilot scheme began with Storm Abigail in November and saw 11 storms given human names.
