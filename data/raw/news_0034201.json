ICE officials called last week's raids routine and said they were not done at the direction of the White House. Reports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps or “roundups” are false, dangerous and irresponsible. \nRamirez has permission to remain in the United States and work through the Deferred Action and Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program authorized by President Barack Obama in 2012. \nRamirez's attorney, Mark Rosembaum, denied in a statement that Ramirez admitted to being in a gang. \n\"Mr. Ramirez did not say these things because they are not true,\" Rosenbaum said. \"And while utterly implausible and wholly fabricated, these claims still would not be sufficient evidence that Mr. Ramirez is a threat to the public safety or national security.\" \nThe court documents blacked out a picture of the tattoo, but Ramirez's lawyers said it reads \"La Paz BCS.\" La Paz means \"Peace\" in Spanish and is also the capital of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, where Ramirez was born.
