(right) Madhukar Reddy Bengaluru: Jyothi Uday, who survived the attack, looked relieved when she got to know about the arrest of the accused. She told reporters that she was happy that finally her assailant was nabbed.\n\"I came to know about it after my colleagues told me. I am really happy that finally he is arrested after three years. When I saw his visuals of the TV, he appeared more or less like the same person who attacked me. However, I will identify him if the police call me,\" she said. The attack still has its impact on her, as even after years she feels pain in the right side of her body.\n\"Sometimes I feel there is no energy left in me and get easily exhausted,\" she said, advising women to be watchful whenever they enter ATM kiosks. Even her husband, Mr Uday, said they are finally happy that the assailant is nabbed and urged for stringent punishment to him.\nThe incident\nOn Nov. 19 morning, Jyothi Uday, then 39-years old, entered the Corporation Bank ATM to withdraw cash to purchase clothes for her daughter Aatmika, whose birthday was on November 22. But, the assailant attacked her with a machete several times after rolling down the shutters.\nLying in a pool of blood for more than three hours, she fell unconscious. It was only when a few schoolchildren noticed blood stains at the entrance of the ATM that the incident had come to light. She was immediately shifted to a hospital. After more than a month's battle between life and death, she recovered and was discharged on Dec. 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:27:57.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
