We all got to see another side to you that you don’t always let us see, and we appreciate that. All us artists here f**king adore you,” she said, marking her second f-bomb of the night (after using a previous speech to apologise for her first). \n“You are our light.

I always have, and I always will,” she told Beyonce, who herself was fighting back tears.
