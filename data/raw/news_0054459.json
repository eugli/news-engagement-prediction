Clarice’s naturally strong exuberance has taken a hit after a sudden and traumatic upheaval of her life. As she adjusts to the new people and places that are suddenly ‘home,’ Clarice is slowly becoming herself again. Blink is an established character from the X-Men comics with the power of teleportation. She was previously played by Fan Bingbing on the big screen in X-Men: Days of Future Past . \nChung is no stranger to FOX comic book shows, having appeared in the most recent season of Gotham as Valerie Vale. She joins Blair Redford ( Satisfaction , Switched at Birth ), who is set to play the role Sam, described as “the strong-headed Native American leader of the underground network.” \nThe still untitled X-Men TV series will focus on two ordinary parents who discover their children possess mutant powers. Forced to go on the run from a hostile government, the family joins up with an underground network of mutants and must fight to survive. \n“Developing a Marvel property has been a top priority for the network–and we are so pleased with how Matt Nix has led us into this thrilling universe,” said FOX’s David Madden of the show last year. “There’s comic book adventure, emotional and complicated relationships, and a rich, existing mythology from which to draw. With the brilliant production crew behind this project, it has all the makings of a big, fun and exciting new series.” \nBryan Singer, having directed four of the X-Men films, including the first and second films in the core series and the two most recent entries ( X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse ), is set to direct the pilot episode of the series. Matt Nix is writing the series, which will be produced by 20th Century Fox Television and Marvel Television, with 20th Century Fox handling physical production. \nWhat other X-Men characters would you like to see appear on this new X-Men series?
