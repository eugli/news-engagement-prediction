Salah Abdeslam, 26 (Photo: AFP) \nGunmen killed 89 people at an Eagles of Death Metal concert at the Bataclan theatre, three suicide bombers struck outside the Stade de France during a football match, and there were more mass shootings and a suicide bombing at bars and restaurants. \nLast month a prime suspect once known as the ‘Man in the Hat’ who was allegedly involved in terror attacks on Paris and Brussels was formally charged with a range of terrorist offences. \nMohamed Abrini, 32, faces multiple life sentences after a brief appearance in front of a judge in the French capital. \nUnder conditions of utmost security, he arrived in Paris from Brussels in an armed convoy and was taken in a specified court that deals with terrorist defendants in the centre of the city. \nA prosecuting source said: \"As part of the investigation following the November 13 2015 attacks in Paris, Mohamed Abrini was handed over to the French judicial authorities for a period of one day.\" \nAbrini, a Belgian passport holder, was caught in Brussels in April last year after also being linked with the March 22 attacks on the Belgian capital.

He fled from the airport, allegedly without detonating a suitcase bomb he was carrying, along with his accomplices Najim Laachraoui and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, who both died. \nAbrini grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels with Salah Abdeslam. Abdeslam also dumped his suicide device, and ran away before being arrested in Brussels later on. \nHe is currently in a high security prison near Paris, awaiting trial. Abrini, of Moroccan origin, was also caught on camera at a petrol station north of Paris two days before the November 13 attacks with prime suspect Abdeslam. \nBelgian authorities have charged Abrini with ‘participation in the activities of a terrorist group and terrorist murders’ following the atrocity in Paris. \nInvestigators said he briefly visited Syria last year and his younger brother Suleiman, 20, died there. A State of Emergency was imposed in France following both attacks, and the country remains on the highest state of alert.
