How do we do that? By filling the mind with something all-consuming but which triggers no emotion whatsoever. These strategies should help. Try them all and pick the one you like best. People respond differently to each — it’s a personal choice — but pick one with the least possible overlap with your everyday life so that you minimise the potential for triggering associated worry (accountants, for instance, might want to avoid the numerical strategy, in case it causes stress about work). NUMBER CRUNCH Studies show the old trick of counting sheep has only limited success in the real world because it’s just too simple. It’s all too easy to visualise fluffy sheep leaping over hedges and stiles while simultaneously wondering about next month’s mortgage repayment, your child’s falling marks at school, or your imminent hip operation. Instead, try counting backwards from one thousand in sevens (1,000, 993, 986, 979 . . .). Sounds tough, right? That’s because it’s meant to be. Actually, it doesn’t matter if you get the numbers wrong or lose your place, you just have to be mentally consumed by the task. If you get in a muddle, simply start again. You’ll know very quickly whether this is going to work or not. If it doesn’t, and you get to the point that you know sleep will not come, give up and get out of the bed. In my experience, however, this rarely happens. Most of the time, your brain will reach either a point of overload or an extreme level of boredom, and choose sleep as the desired alternative. Fool yourself into sleeping like a baby by actively trying to stay awake a little bit longer ‘A’ IS FOR... This game again requires agility of thought to consume the restless mind, but contains no emotional triggers to generate anxiety. Choose a category such as cities of the world. Pick a city — say, Amsterdam — then pick a city that starts with the last letter, M. Now find a city that starts with that: Madrid, for example. After that, you can go on to Dusseldorf, and then Florence, and then Edinburgh . . . You get the gist. You might prefer to list animals, foods, colours, or items of clothing — as long as there are lots of choice options. Another way of doing this is to list cities, authors, or foods alphabetically (artichoke, banana, cabbage . . .) as long as it’s a bland sort of task, but not too easy. BLUE MANGOES Start by selecting a category, such as fruit, and pick your favourite. If you choose mango, I want you to imagine the most perfect mango in the world — one where the skin is a shiny green at the bottom, then blends into a pale yellow, before fading into red. The stalk is small and brown, peeking out from the top with one green leaf attached. Once you have the item absolutely picture perfect in your mind, the fun begins — now you need to mentally turn the mango blue! Push your imagination to create a picture of the colours, shades and dimensions you might see if it were. What colour is the stalk now, what about the leaf? Once your blue mango is complete, turn it purple and give it a spiky skin. Just let your imagination run wild and fill your brain. WHY POPPING A PILL WON'T HELP Some sleeping pills can work, but their success is normally down to a combination of the placebo effect and lucky coincidence (file photo) The difference between acute and chronic insomnia is in the length of time you suffer. Acute can last from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. Chronic is defined as insomnia for three nights a week, lasting three months or more. In my experience, it is people in a bout of acute insomnia who tend to rush to the pharmacy in search of pills. Beware. Some of these remedies can work — but in my view, their success is normally down to a combination of the placebo effect (you think you’re taking a sleeping pill, so you go to sleep) and lucky coincidence (you just happened to have a good night’s sleep). It may even be that your insomnia was easing off anyway: acute insomnia doesn’t last for ever. If something works for you every time, then lucky you — by all means continue. But do avoid any remedies that contain antihistamines, as their active ingredients (diphenhydramine hydrochloride, for example) can leave you feeling drowsy, even through to the following day. It’s a fallacy that your GP will instantly prescribe a sleeping pill. In fact, they are given out much less often nowadays than they once were, and the doctor will try to look for an underlying cause instead. Are you suffering from depression? Anxiety? Problems with your immune system? Impaired thyroid function? If nothing crops up, the GP may send you away with a leaflet about sleep hygiene (habits to help beat insomnia, including removing technology and pets from your bedroom). In some circumstances you might be prescribed a limited course of sleep medication to getyou through an acute period of insomnia, if it’s severe. If you are starting my plan, and want to do so without medication, talk to your GP first. If you do stop, it’s best to be off sleeping pills for two weeks beforehand, as your sleep diary needs to reflect true sleep patterns unaffected by drugs (do make sure you stop prescribed sleeping medication in consultation with your GP, who will be able to advise on reducing the dosage gradually). Be warned that many common prescription drugs for conditions unrelated to insomnia can impair sleep, while others can make us more fatigued during the day. So, before starting my plan, make sure you ask your GP whether your medication could be affecting your sleep. DON’T TRY TO SLEEP If mind games don’t work for you, there’s a strange psychological paradox that shows the more you try not to think about something, the more likely it is to pop into your head. Try not to think about pink elephants — and a clear image of a pink elephant will fill your mind. We’ve found we can use this phenomenon to cunningly trick your brain to sleep. The most important thing is not to actively try to stay awake as this requires effort that will lead to tension (which may indeed keep you awake). You just need to concentrate on staying awake a little bit longer. So, get into bed as normal, turn the lights out and get everything ready for sleep. But instead of closing your eyes, keep them open. Now, let go of any thoughts about getting off to sleep; instead ask yourself to stay awake for an extra few minutes... You should notice your eyes starting to feel heavy and you may find yourself yawning. It might be tempting to shut your eyes at this point, but don’t; just ask yourself to hang on to wakefulness that little bit longer. A few more minutes, that’s all . . . Try this when you go to bed and if you wake up in the middle of the night. You might be surprised at how effective it is. HOW TO RATIONALISE YOUR WORRIES... When you’re short on sleep it’s very easy to find yourself catastrophising about how tired you are likely to feel the next day and the awful things that might happen as a consequence. This horrible anxiety swiftly gets out of control, given free rein by the nocturnal brain’s looser grip on rationality and logic. This is why even the simplest issue or event can appear potentially disastrous at night. If you know you are prone to night-time over-worrying, try this technique to help you turn down the dial. You will need a pen and pad and a calculator (unless you are really good at maths). Do it in the daytime while you’re fully awake. This is going to seem complicated, but it’s really not — and the results are fascinating. When you’re short on sleep it’s very easy to find yourself catastrophising about how tired you are likely to feel the next day and the awful things that might happen as a consequence (file photo) 1. First, write down the worst possible thing that could happen to you as a consequence of not sleeping. Could you look after loved ones properly, for example? If you were so tired you weren’t able to function fully, would you still be able to manage at work? Don’t hold back. 2. Take the thought on to the next, even more catastrophic, stage. What would actually happen if you couldn’t look after loved ones properly, or you couldn’t manage at work? What would that mean in the short and long-term? What’s the worst-case scenario? This might seem a strange exercise to do while fully awake in the cold light of day, but that’s because your brain is now at its most logical and rational. What we’re doing here is taking you to the place you reach at night, where we find those irrational, catastrophic thoughts that keep you from sleeping. 3. Now, think hard about that fear you feel in the middle of the night and give me your best guess about the likelihood of it actually happening. How certain are you, as a percentage, that it might really come to pass? Remember, we’re talking about the percentage you feel at night, in the grip of that sleepless panic. Many report a 70 per cent certainty, or even higher. 4. The next step is to work out how many nights you’ve suffered insomnia. There are 365 nights in a year, but insomnia doesn’t tend to happen every night, so take an average of how many nights of sleeplessness you experience in a typical week, then multiply that by 52 to get your total number of nights per year. Then multiply that by the number of years you reckon you have suffered insomnia. If you suffer four nights of insomnia a week, and you’ve been suffering it for 11 years, then that would be 4 x 52 x 11 = 2,288. 5. Now here’s the tricky maths: work out your catastrophised risk by multiplying the ‘likely’ percentage of the bad thing happening with the number of nights of insomnia you’ve ever had. So if you are 70 per cent sure of losing your job on 2,288 nights of insomnia (70 per cent of 2,288 nights) and this were a rational and logical thought, you would have lost your job on 1,602 occasions. 6. Next to this, jot down how many times your worst fear has actually happened — in reality. Remember, it only counts if you believe the event was a direct result of your insomnia. Divide that number — if it’s ever actually happened — by your total number of nights with insomnia and write the answer in the next column. 7. The difference between these numbers shows the extent of your sleep-related catastrophic thinking. For many people, this logical, ordered process, resulting in a clear demonstration of the absurdity of their night-time fears, is enough to dial down the anxiety significantly and help them get to sleep. 8. Next time you’re lying awake at night and you start thinking about the awful consequences of insomnia (for example, losing your job or failing to look after someone properly) go back to your calculations and remind yourself of the real situation. BANISH YOUR NIGHTMARES People with sleep problems are much more likely to remember their dreams — and if your insomnia is linked to anxiety, those dreams are likely to be vivid, frightening and even violent. Although dreaming is normal for everyone, waking frequently in the night increases the chance of you recalling dreams. And if your sleeplessness is triggered by anxiety — or in itself causes it — raised levels of stress hormones such as cortisol can make us wake more often and increase the negative content of dreams. Worse, studies suggest that intense and distressing dreams can actually wake us at night, leading to a destructive spiral of poor sleep and terrifying nightmares. How can you break this vicious circle? Professor Ellis and his team think it may be possible to influence, even change, your dreaming patterns to boost sleep quality. A technique called Imagery Rehearsal Therapy has already been used successfully to help victims of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who are often plagued by vivid nightmares. Studies have indicated that if trauma survivors can be guided to change how their nightmare ends, then replay the new dream with the non-scary ending, they can reduce the number, and severity, of nightmares they suffer. First, while they are awake, people are told to imagine a new, happy way for their bad dream to end. They are then asked to replay the new scenario repeatedly in their minds, an exercise that in itself helps lift the spirits and reduce anxiety. This, in turn, reduces nocturnal anxiety, so encouraging better sleep. That is why we have included a dream-recording section in your sleep diary. When you remember a bad dream, jot it down immediately. Next morning, take a few moments to change the outcome of that dream — make it positive, happy or just silly. Remember that your new dream scenario doesn’t have to be logical or rational. Rewrite your dream in a way that takes away its sting and, ideally, makes you smile. If your dream was about children trapped in a burning building, say, envisage them carried to safety by a unicorn. If you dreamed of being chased by evil men with guns, imagine them slipping on banana skins and the guns turning to sausages. Nothing is too fantastical. Writing down your nightmares is a recognised way of putting them in perspective — but talking them over helps, too, and so does dwelling on the new happy endings. Go over your new dream in your head at intervals throughout the day to reinforce the positive pattern. Better still, chat about it with someone just before bed. LOUISE ATKINSON ...AND HOW TO RELAX One clever way to relax your body and therefore ease the build-up of anxiety that might be stopping you from sleeping is called progressive muscle relaxation. This is a great one to try when you find yourself lying stiff and tense in bed at night. Although it’s designed to reduce physical tension, the mental concentration required means it’s a useful way of relaxing the mind, too. Start at the top of your body with your forehead. Tense up your forehead, as if you were really puzzled or surprised, and hold that for a count of five. Slowly, over a count of ten, relax the muscles. Now focus for a second or two on the difference between tensing and relaxing and how your forehead feels. Move to your eyes, scrunching them tightly shut; hold for five seconds and then release over a count of ten. Remember to focus on how this feels and the difference between the two sensations before moving on to the nose. Again, scrunch your nose up, as if you are smelling something really bad, and then slowly relax. Move on to the main facial muscles — the lips, chin, cheeks — and scrunch, relax and review. Take your time, breathing deeply the whole time. Repeat the process with your shoulders, arms and hands, working systematically down your body via your chest, abdomen, hips, buttocks, legs and feet. With practice, you should be sound asleep before your reach your knees. I'VE STOPPED WAKING UP AT NIGHT - THANKS TO A MANGO! Jo Gordon, 47, has started to think of a mango in order to help her get to sleep Jo Gordon, 47, books castings for models and actors. She lives in Cheshire with husband Steven, a 52-year-old company director, and they have three children between them. Jo says: I’ve had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember but always assumed it was genetic. My mother — who has passed away — was a very bad sleeper, and so are my father and my son. I’ve seen doctors dozens of times but they only ever prescribe sleeping tablets, which I refuse to take because they are so addictive. The one time I did take them, I still hardly slept — and woke up in the morning feeling worse than ever. Other treatments I’ve tried over the years are herbal tablets, pillow sprays, Himalayan salt lamps (which are thought to relieve stress) and crystals under the pillow. They all ended up in the bin. Nothing worked. My problem is I’m such a worrier. On a bad night, I can wake about ten times, and after the fourth or fifth time I’ll get up and find something to do, like clean the kitchen cupboards. I have a burst of energy and need to do something. At other times I’ll just lie there — but that’s when I worry. In the darkness I have a series of terrible thoughts, such as whether my children will be in an accident or the dog will die in the night. It’s horrible when I look at the clock and get this mounting feeling of dread that it’s 1.30am and I don’t know when I’ll sleep again. I have no idea why I’m like this. Nothing has happened in my past to make me worry about traumas like these. But some nights I only get two or three hours’ sleep and feel dreadful in the morning. I only begin to feel human again after two double espressos and a shower. I know that if I sit down before that, I’ll never be able to get back up. I was willing to try anything to beat my insomnia. If Professor Ellis had recommended dancing with sheep, I’d be looking for the nearest field. Thankfully, his advice was more sensible. I now have a warm bath and go to bed at the same time every night — but there were other tips that I’d never even thought about. The first thing he told me to stop doing was reading my Kindle before going to sleep. I tend to sit in bed doing this until I nod off with the Kindle still in my hand. But he suggested that I remove all electronic devices from the bedroom. The first time I did this, I didn’t get to sleep until 2.50am — but that’s because it takes several days for the mind to learn that reading is not the cue to go to sleep any more. It’s improving, slowly. I used to be a Zumba teacher and exercise nearly every day, often at night, too, thinking that if I could tire my body out I’d go to sleep. But Professor Ellis said that, ideally, I should stop any exercise a good two hours before bed. I’ve stopped turning the light on when I go to the bathroom in the night, too. Instead I just open the blind and let in a little light from outside. But most interesting was his suggestion for how to stop myself having terrible thoughts. He asked me to picture a mango. I even bought one so I could look at it and get a proper mental image. When I start having catastrophic thoughts, I must think of the mango and imagine it changing colour. Then I have to think about the peel coming off slowly. The idea is to make your mind think of something completely unrelated to your worries, that you wouldn’t normally think about, then just focus entirely on that. It’s about clearing your mind. I have to say, I wasn’t convinced that I could stop my brain flicking from mango to images of the kids in a car accident — but I was willing to try anything, and in fact it’s a technique that works when you get used to it. My insomnia cure is a work in progress, but for the first time in years I feel hopeful it will succeed. JILL FOSTER How to stop snoring keeping you awake We all know and dread it. You’re just nodding off when suddenly your partner starts up. Rattle, wheeze, whistle, snort . . . You shove them in the back. They stop. Grateful, you sink back into the pillow, only to hear moments later . . . Rattle, honk, sigh, snort. Until, furious, you give up the fight and take the spare duvet to the sofa. Snoring leaves you frazzled, whether it’s your partner’s cacophony or your own strangled breathing causing you to sleep lightly or even, periodically, wake up. Snoring is primarily caused by vibrations of the soft palate and other tissue in the mouth, nose and throat that become partially blocked at night (file photo) It can take many forms, but snoring is primarily caused by vibrations of the soft palate and other tissue in the mouth, nose and throat that become partially blocked at night. Depending on the location of the blockage, you might be a nose snorer, a mouth snorer, a throat snorer, or even a tongue-base snorer (where your tongue drops to the back of your throat at night, causing an obstruction). Many people have a ‘multifactorial’ problem that combines more than one loudly vibrating airway location. You might inherit a propensity to snore, but things can get louder and more disruptive as we get older (when muscles become slack), gain weight (more pressure on our delicate tissues), enter the menopause (losing the hormones that helped protect us), and can be exacerbated on any given night by alcohol and smoking. If it’s your partner’s racket keeping you awake, the quickest and cheapest solution is a pair of soft-foam earplugs to block the noise. But there are a number of other remedies that can help depending on what kind of snorer you, or your partner, might be. Your problem could be nose-based if it’s not easy for you to breathe through your nose with your mouth closed. Try pressing one nostril closed and breathing through the other nostril.

If one or both your nostrils collapse slightly when you inhale deeply, you might benefit from trying nasal strips or nostril dilators. The former are thin strips of sticky tape that athletes use to hold their nostrils open (£4.95 from pharmacies or snoreband.co.uk). They can also help relieve nasal congestion caused by colds and allergies. The dilators (try Mute, £16.99 from Boots) are tiny reusable plastic tubes that you insert into the nostril overnight to hold the space open. If your snoring is caused by congestion and allergies such as hayfever, a seawater nasal spray (from pharmacies) can also help. DO I HAVE SLEEP APNOEA? If you aren’t sure whether or not you’ve got insomnia, but you regularly wake up in the morning feeling unrefreshed, or you feel exhausted during the day, sleep apnoea could be to blame. It’s a very common condition that affects as much as a quarter of the adult population, where the tissues of the upper airway and the soft palate slump and droop when you are asleep, partially or totally blocking your supply of air. People often think that sleep apnoea is a form of snoring but, in fact, it’s quite different physiologically. Most of us will experience it occasionally — probably much more frequently than we realise — often when we’ve got a cold or have had too much to drink. Alcohol, cigarettes and even some sleeping pills can make things worse. Although most people assume sleep apnoea strikes mostly men, and usually gets worse with age as muscles slacken, it can affect women too, and at any age. In both sexes, it’s made worse by weight gain, which puts more pressure on the wind pipe. The hormonal changes of menopause can also make women more susceptible. Just like snoring, you rarely notice it in yourself — but that’s where the similarity ends. Sleep apnoea typically follows a pattern of shallow breathing accompanied by loud snoring, followed by, in some cases, a relatively brief moment where you stop breathing altogether as the airway is shut off. After a few seconds, levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream start to build and oxygen drops. Thankfully, this chemical imbalance triggers a natural survival response whereby the diaphragm and chest muscles send a signal to the brain to wake up. A surge of adrenaline is released and the heart kicks in with a super-strong beat that wakes you up, so tensing the muscles in the soft palate and re-opening the airway. The result will be a loud snort, gasp or choking noise as you grab for breath. If you’ve got sleep apnoea, you may not even consciously notice these sudden awakenings, but they can affect your sleep — and your health. Even if you have ‘mild’ apnoea, you could be waking up multiple times throughout the night. And studies show the drop in oxygen, followed by the huge surge of adrenaline that gets the heart beating very hard, can put a strain on your heart during the hours when it should be at rest. Other symptoms that might indicate apnoea include morning headaches, a dry mouth or sore throat in the morning, increased blood pressure, unexplained weight gain, and/or episodes of heartburn. WHAT CAN I DO TO ALLEVIATE IT? Unfortunately, these symptoms can also explain a whole host of other illnesses, so have a chat with your GP before coming to any conclusions. Even if a diagnosis is confirmed, your GP may not be able to help, but may put you on a waiting list to see a specialist, or prescribe a nasal spray suitable for long-term use, which can ease congestion and thereby encourage you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth. The problem is gauging the severity of your apnoea. Anything less than five events per hour of sleep is considered ‘normal’; more than five but fewer than 15 events per hour is ‘mild’; while more than 15 but fewer than 30 is ‘moderate’. And you’ll only be seriously considered for NHS treatment if your apnoea is affecting your ability to function during the day. In many of these cases, a special breathing machine (called CPAP or ‘continuous positive airway pressure’ device) can be worn at night. Alternatively, studies have shown that singing lessons can help train the muscles of your throat (see singingforsnorers.com for self-help CDs). One 2006 study showed that regular playing of the didgeridoo also improved symptoms. Breathing exercises can also be useful. If you’re overweight, slimming down may help relieve pressure on the airways, and in many cases of mild apnoea, a specially designed mouth guard (called a ‘mandibular advancement device’) might be worth a try. If I could give them out to patients free on the NHS I would. Experiment with different types — they can vary in cost from £10 to up to £400 for a fully customised version (ask your dentist). Cheaper mouth guards need to be replaced regularly — at least as regularly as your toothbrush. Try the Stop Snoring mouthpiece (£44.99) from snorewizard.com. These mouth guards are rather like a rubber gum shield, in that they cover your teeth, and you soften them to fit by immersing them briefly in boiling water. The idea is you wear the guard at night and it shifts your lower jaw slightly forwards into an ‘underbite’ position. Although this may feel odd (even painful) at first, the guard can hold your airway open and could reduce the number and severity of your apnoea episodes. If you suspect you have sleep apnoea, I don’t recommend the more intense parts of my insomnia plan (stimulus control or sleep rescheduling) until you have it under control as the additional — though temporary — sleep deprivation could make life difficult for you.
