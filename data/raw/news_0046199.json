Fans have been clamoring for Jackman to be adorned in it, and it was even teased in an alternate ending for The Wolverine . The iconic costume was teased in an alternate ending for The Wolverine (2013). (Photo: 20th Century Fox) More Logan and The Wolverine director James Mangold told Screen Rant why Jackman hasn’t worn the costume in his movies. He’s of the opinion that heroes who wear branded costumes are narcissistic and want credit for what they did. “Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit, particularly canary yellow, and kind of prance about doing good deeds and have people go, ‘Oh my God! It’s the Wolverine!’” he shared.\nMangold also suggested that fans wouldn’t actually like it if they got what they wanted. “I somehow feel that if somehow we ever put Hugh [Jackman] into one of those outfits, people would not be happy,” he shared. “Essentially, it’s something that lives on the page and I’m not sure could live anywhere else.”\nJosh Gad Enlists the Help of Chris Pratt, J.J.
