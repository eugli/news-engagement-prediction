Sun Feb 19 2017 21:21:21   21:21:21 GMT+0000 (GMT) Joe Baiamonte Joe Baiamonte in football \nIn one of the more unexpected transfer rumours of the season, Manchester United are looking at bringing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Old Trafford in a £30m deal that could see Chris Smalling head in the opposite direction. \nChamberlain is believed to be frustrated at the Emirates Stadium and with Jose Mourinho looking to bolster his midfield options following the January departures of Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin, the former Southampton youngster could be an ideal option. \nThe United boss' primary targets, according to The Mirror are Chelsea duo Willian and Nemanja Matic, although the Portuguese manager doesn't expect the Blues to relinquish the pair to the Old Trafford outfit and is already making contingency plans, of which Chamberlain is seemingly a large part. \nChamberlain has struggled to make an impact in North London during his six year spell in North London. A £15m arrival from Southampton in 2011, big things were expected of the midfielder, who was a surprise inclusion in Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad at the age of 18. \nLike most Arsenal players, Chamberlain has had his issues with injuries over the past few years but, at 23 years of age and with the pace, power and direct style Mourinho prefers, Chamberlain still has plenty of time left to fulfil his potential. Are the Ox's days at the Emirates numbered? Image: PA \nAs for Smalling, Arsene Wenger has expressed his interest in the England centre half on several occasions and a deal was strongly rumoured to be happening when Louis Van Gaal took over as United manager in 2014. \nHowever, Smalling ended up proving himself to be one of the Dutchman's most valuable assets during his two years in charge. Under Mourinho, however, Smalling's place in the first team has been far from guaranteed due to the arrival of Eric Bailly, injury and the revivals of Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones. \nShould Arsenal maintain their interest in Smalling, Mourinho will look to leverage a deal for Chamberlain, worth somewhere in the region of £30m. 'Mike Smalling' could be set for a return to London with The Ox heading in the opposite direction.
