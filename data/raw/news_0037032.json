Will Federal Territories PAS Youth chief Khairil Nizam Khairudin also make a police report about the abuse? \nAnonymous #21828131: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) should investigate the abuse of APs given to elected representatives. \nIf these anomalies are overlooked, very soon we will have these jokers using APs to import expensive cars, or use them for a short while and sell them for a quick profit. \nI am sure one of the stringent conditions for use of this AP is for the personal use of the elected representative only and none others. \nNegarawan: \"RM90 million is a lot of money. If we had in fact received RM90 million, we would use to uphold Islam and help the rakyat, not buy cars,\" said Khairil Nizam. \nIndeed, RM90 million is a lot of money, but the fact remains that Hashim did buy a Porsche under his own name. \nWhat is the level of spirituality of this person and his family, who are not satisfied with a normal family car but instead chose to splurge on a supercar? Why didn't he use the proceeds from the AP \"to uphold Islam and help the rakyat\"? \nFellowMalaysian: Hashim is the spiritual leader of PAS, a major Islam-based political party. He explained the controversy by claiming that the Porsche Cayman was bought under his name because of his entitlement to a AP permit. \nEven if his story is true, this old hoary ought to keep himself well out of anything that is as glitzy and raunchy as a Porsche. \nEven if the son is driving, imagine the disbelief and incredulity it will create in the streets of Kota Bharu or Kangar if Hashim is seen in the Porsche. \nPAS is Porsche's oxymoron and the pair is as incongruent as heaven and earth. \nFT mufti shows data to warn Muslims of V-Day ills \nExistential Turd: If a rapist can be absolved of his crime by marrying his victim, what then is the problem if lovers get intimate and later marry each other? \nApropos to earlier comments, it is inconceivable that all the out-of-wedlock births were conceived on Valentine's day, or for that matter, in February. Federal Territories mufti Zulkifli Mohamad al-Bakri is making a frivolous connection between the two. \nSpeaking of lying with statistics, one can probably make all kinds of connections with out-of-wedlock births. Zulkifli omitted to mention the ethnic group that made up the bulk of this statistics. \nIn any case, one can make a stronger correlation between religion and out-of-wedlock births. By his own argument, they must then renounce their religion to save themselves from out-of-wedlock sex. \nOdin Tajué: Zulkifli, let me get your statistics right. According to you, there were: \n1) 526 cases of baby dumping between 2000 and 2015; \n2) 16,270 teenage pregnancies between 2012 and 2015; \n3) 532,158 births out of wedlock between 2005 and 2015; and \n4) 3,980, or 28.8 percent out of 13,831 teenagers, ‘conceived’ out of wedlock. \nNow, that is shocking indeed. I shall ignore the fact that you have not provided the period related to the fourth item; it is not important. \nI shall focus on only one utterly simple point. And it is this - have all the procreators in question procreated in the night after celebrating Valentine’s Day? \nJust to make things clear for you, what I mean is, did they celebrate Valentine’s Day - it does not matter where - went somewhere to fornicate at the end of the celebration, and the males’ spermatozoa fertilised the females’ eggs? I shall presume that they did not do it right under the dinner table where they dined during the celebration. \nIf they have fornicated as a result of celebrating Valentine’s Day, do you have proof to support your inference that they did both? And that is to say, they celebrated the occasion and fornicated? \nIf you do not have proof, then you have merely made an assumption to support your statement. \nKeturunan Malaysia: Zulkifli, there is a saying, \"Food for some, poison for others.” But do allow \"others\" to decide for themselves... and the others in this case, include the Muslims. \nDon't underestimate the intelligence of others, more so using yourself as a yardstick to measure others. \nYou are given a whole wide God-created world, more so a whole-wide God-created universe, but you yourself are making it smaller and smaller and ending up by blaming everyone at your whims and fancies. \nAnonymous#007: The main lessons we need to teach our youths and society is that sex needs to be consensual. That sex could lead to pregnancy. \nThat an unplanned pregnancy could lead to emotional, financial and other complications if the couple involved is not aware or unable to bear the responsibility of bringing up a child in a healthy environment. \nWe cannot put any judgement on these. These three lessons are independent of one another, and have nothing to do with religion whatsoever. It is nature. It is respect. It is science. It is common sense. Nothing more, nothing less. \nIt is the unplanned pregnancies that normally results in baby-dumping. Not celebrating Valentine's Day, or kissing, or holding hands in public. \nVijay47: Zulkifli, I am sure that Muslims will be relieved that a person of your standing, the mufti of Federal Territories no less, have warned them of the dangers hidden within that decadent Western celebration of Valentine's Day. \nI, ever the curious scientist though some prefer to describe me as \"busybody\", have been doing some research on my own which lead to startling conclusions. \nBetween March 24, 2004 and Feb 14, 2017, a total of 867,943 persons died in Malaysia from various causes but excluding those who died laughing. \nRelating these statistics to known events in Malaysia, I have irrefutable evidence that these deaths were caused by the celebration of Christmas, Hari Raya, and Deepavali. I am not sure about the effect of Chinese New Year because I haven't quite figured out the Chinese zodiac. \nMy theory is further proven by the fact that in those years when there was no Christmas, Hari Raya, or Deepavali, nobody died.
