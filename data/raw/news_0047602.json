I can’t do it! I’m scared!” \nThis led to a scuffle between the manager, his co-workers and Annop, who insisted on getting his money’s worth. \nThe fight escalated and the manager was punched in his face. \nThe enraged manager then left but allegedly returned with a revolver and shot Annop in the abdomen. \nPolice arrived later and arrested the manager for attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms. \nAnnop was rushed to hospital for treatment. \n> The daily also reported that a South Korean man forced his wife and their son to predict winners in horse races by meditating. \nThe man, known only as Seo, from Jeju Island, would assault the two when their predictions fell through. \nSeo, who has been convicted for child abuse, began forcing his wife to meditate and predict horse-racing winners in 2008 after his release from prison. \nThe report said the man was a religious fanatic, convinced that meditation could enable devout believers to predict the future. \nWhen his wife ran away three years later, he forced his 13-year-old son to take over the role by locking him up in a room for up to 14 hours a day to meditate and reveal the names of the winning horses. \nSeo also reportedly hit the boy with a wooden sword when the boy failed to obey his orders. \nHis acts were uncovered when his daughter ran away from home after witnessing what happened to her brother. \nSeo was later arrested and on Monday, was jailed four-and-a-half years by the local court, which castigated him for being the world’s worst father for committing inhumane and unspeakable acts against his children. \n> Found in translation is compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).
