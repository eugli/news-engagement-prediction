Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale appealed to President Trump to declare a major emergency for the area and by evening Gov. Jerry Brown told reporters he had held a conversation with a Trump Cabinet member he declined to name.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing 150,000 bottles of water, 20,000 blankets and 10,000 cots to support residents affected by the evacuation.\nA day after the urgent Sunday evening evacuation, officials with the state agency responsible for operating the dam remained confounded by the failure of the spillway that was supposed to be the dam’s backup plan.\nNew storms could imperil Oroville where 200,000 were evacuated\nAs the highest dam in America, the main structure is built of 85 million cubic yards of earth and remains sound, officials say. But just over a week ago, a hole appeared in the concrete spillway off to its side and quickly grew as the surging water blasted off chunks of loose concrete and hurled them downhill.\nWith that channel damaged and storm-driven runoff swelling the reservoir, officials insisted the emergency spillway would be prepared for service. It had never been used before, and began to erode dangerously — leading to the concerns of a failure and the order to evacuate.\nAt a news conference around midday Monday, State Acting Director of Water Resources Director Bill Croyle admitted his agency doesn’t have clear answers.\n“I’m not sure anything went wrong,” he said. “That system has been installed since the early 1960s. It’s been monitored, but I’m not sure what caused the damage itself. It’s designed for higher flows. Lower flows can create more energy. We don’t completely understand why this erosion occurred.”\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources workers watch water pour down the Oroville Dam spillway as authorities try to reduce the amount of water in the lake in preparation of coming storms and to be able to make repairs to the damaged spillway.   (Photo: Greg Barnette) \nCroyle said it could be at least 15 days or longer before the agency will be able to put a plan into place to make repairs. He said a plan has been approved, but did not go into details.\nHeavy trucks were moving rocks into a staging area near the dam throughout Monday morning, and by late afternoon helicopters were carrying bags of rocks toward the eroded section of the emergency spillway.\nCrews are filling in the erosion around the spillway with boulders and gravel, said Josh Janssen, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\nHe did not know the volume of rocks being placed in the eroded area. At some point, DWR plans to cover the boulders and gravel with concrete, he said.\n“The goal is to replace the erosion and make (the spillway) stronger,” Janssen said.\nThe DWR continues to let more water out of the lake at a rate of 100,000 cubic feet per second in an effort to lower the lake level to 50 feet below its capacity. That should allow room for more runoff and to accommodate coming storms, and allow the DWR to stop releases so they can make repairs to the crumbling main spillway.\nBy Monday evening, the lake was about 6 feet from its crest.\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nWater continues to rush out of a damaged spillway at the Oroville Dam. Evacuations remain in place for residents downriver. USA TODAY NETWORK \nMost residents appeared to have heeded evacuation warnings, although some remained in towns from Oroville downriver to Marysville and Yuba City. At the news conference with Croyle, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea defended the decision to order the evacuation and keep it in place.\n“It’s a dynamic situation,” he said. “We need to make sure that before we allow people back in those areas it is safe to do so.”\nHonea said the Sheriff’s Office is devising a repopulation plan to let people go home in an orderly fashion when the time arrives.\nSpeaking from the headquarters of the Office of Emergency Services just outside Sacramento, Brown pledged Monday night more scrutiny will be placed on California’s massive infrastructure network.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Photos: Crisis at Oroville Dam and spillway   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
