HALF of Britons have a lucky number (so what’s yours?)\nMORE: Drunk milkman crashes truck into house and car causing £40,000 worth of damage\nThe research has echoes of science fiction movie Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, in which an estranged couple erase each other from their memories.\nIn real life, Dr Josselyn’s team has succeeded in both activating and erasing fear-based memories in mice.\nPrevious research had highlighted collections of neurons known as “engrams” that fire in a particular pattern when a memory is created.\nThe Canadian researchers found certain neurons compete to be recruited to an engram underlying a fearful memory.\nThe scientists also found it was possible to flag up those neurons engaged in fear memory by over-producing a certain brain protein.\nBy genetically removing the targeted neurons, a specific memory could effectively be erased, without affecting other memories.\nFurther work in mice showed cocaine addiction could be overcome by wiping out emotional memories associated with taking the drug.\nSpeaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston, Dr Josselyn said: ‘Our findings suggest that one day it could be possible to treat people with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) by erasing these traumatic memories.\n‘In these people, the memories are intrusive and disrupt their everyday lives.\n‘However, there could be potential downsides, especially when applied to people who would like to get rid of a ‘bad memory’ such as a messy break-up.\n‘We all learn from our mistakes. If we erase the memory of our mistakes, what is to keep us from repeating them?”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RV9pu0uIMQqCI0BN2o8BaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/1ad1b797d055dd5f249d77de063979d3"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:20:45.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
