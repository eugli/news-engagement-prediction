It might be time we stop being inured to the pervasion of the PR machinery. The propaganda machinery at the State government's disposal targets not only the electorate but also the cadre. | Bijoy Ghosh \nThe latest in the Tamil Nadu government’s propaganda machinery is a film reel being played at cinema theatres in the State during the intermission. Film-goers are quite used to seeing State government publicity films during the intermission. The government’s films division routinely publishes news reels that are about ten minutes long, released to all movie theatres in the State. These films are basically publicity material on important welfare schemes and programmes, and development activities of the government. \nWhenever the AIADMK was in power the films would focus solely on former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and various schemes and programmes that she had introduced. Images of a beaming Jayalalithaa handing out textbooks or saris or getting couples married, inaugurating Amma canteens, were all quite normal mid-movie fare. \nSo, it is quite startling to see the usual films changed to one that not-so-subtly bats for V.K. Sasikala. The film is still about Jayalalithaa, of course. It starts with poignant images (and mournful music) of her last journey from the hospital to her home in Poes Garden, and moves on to her funeral, capturing moving images of thousands of people mourning, wailing cadre beating their chests, the final State funeral, and the gun salute. It goes on to show Jayalalithaa at public appearances as well and at work, but you notice the subtle way in which the narrative has changed. \nWhile political propaganda may be seen as a legitimate and necessary way to reach the people, the AIADMK, took it to a new level, focusing on projecting the personality, not the work. \nJayalalithaa is still the focus but almost every frame has been selected to show Sasikala by her side. The film juxtaposes scenes of Jayalalithaa interacting with various leaders like President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and then cuts to them paying their respects at her funeral, and in most frames, Sasikala is in them: breaking down at the funeral and being comforted by the Prime Minister; the President of India greeting her as he pays his respects; on the gun carriage accompanying the leader on her last journey. There is one particularly striking frame where Jayalalithaa makes a public appearance and the camera then pans from her to Sasikala standing in a doorway behind the scenes, directing someone off-camera. \nThe message is as subtle as a sledgehammer. It tells the tale of Sasikala, the loyal friend who stood by Jayalalithaa throughout her life, career and death, and is now her natural political heir. \nOne shouldn't be surprised by this, though. Tamil Nadu is a State that has used the propaganda machinery to its hilt. All political parties also have an important position, the Propaganda Secretary, which oversees all PR and publicity material for the party. Magazines Dr. Namadhu M.G.R. and Murasoli are the official mouthpieces of the AIADMK and the DMK, and both parties routinely use their television networks Jaya TV and Sun TV to extol the virtues of their own parties and attack the other, as well as their social media accounts. \nWhile political propaganda may be seen as a legitimate and necessary way to reach the people, the AIADMK, took it to a new level, focusing on projecting the personality, not the work. Driving through Chennai, one can’t miss the video vans that are strategically located in places where crowds gather in large numbers, playing important government announcements and schemes announced by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. Short jingles blare out on the radio letting people know about the latest government scheme. \nAnd then, there are the stickers, posters and hoardings, wherein Jayalalithaa was deified, which have been the subject of much criticism. Stickers of Jayalalithaa are affixed on all merchandise such as mixies, laptops, or fans that were given to people during the elections and on publicity material for different schemes and programmes like the Amma canteens and Amma water, and even on the headgear and garlands worn by couples getting married under the mass marriage scheme for underprivileged girls. \nPosters, cut-outs and hoardings of Jayalalithaa, which have been subjected to numerous jokes and memes on social media, show her as a larger-than-life presence — world leaders bowing before her; Jayalalithaa single-handedly rescuing a child from the swirling waters during the floods of 2015; Jayalalithaa as mother Mary with the baby Jesus in her arms; Jayalalithaa the lioness. Cut to post-Jayalalithaa’s death where the posters are now with Sasikala a larger-than-life presence, shown in the foreground, often overshadowing the central figure of Amma, who is almost an afterthought. \nWhile one got used to the excesses of the Jayalalalithaa publicity machinery, I am not sure we should encourage the same with her self-proclaimed successor.
