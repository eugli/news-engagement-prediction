After copping 60 millimetres of rain on Saturday night - with some suburbs seeing close to 80 - the city will again be drenched by rain on Sunday. Up to 15 millimetres of rain is expected to blanket Sydney on Monday. Rainfall will ease but remain consistent for a full week as temperatures hover in the low 20s. Scroll down for video Sydney is on track for a wet start to autumn, with forecasters tipping seven straight days of pouring rain (rainfall radar for last 24 hours pictured) Up to 15 milimetres of rain will blanket Sydney (pictured on Sunday) on Monday, with rainfall easing but remaining consistent for a full week Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Neale Fraser told The Daily Telegraph the rainfall would linger throughout the week across the broader Sydney metro region. 'It's going to continue today. There are a lot of showers around and it will be heavy at times briefly,' Mr Fraser said. 'There is even more showers for the rest of the week, from Monday through to Friday. 'It's going to be a humid week with lots of showers coming in and out with a risk of thunderstorms each day.' The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts rain and chances of thunderstorms for the next week (pictured is Copacabana Beach, NSW) Despite the soggy conditions, the weather will be humid across the week in Sydney Brisbane won't escape the soggy weather either - with the Bureau of Meteorology predicting showers producing roughly 15 millimetres of rain every day next week. The capital city of Queensland could see as much as 40 millimetres of rain on Wednesday as temperatures float around a muggy average of 25 degrees all week. Melbourne could see light showers come next Saturday, but will sweat through tops of 33 degrees as the sun comes out and stays Monday onwards. On the west coast of Australia things will be fine and sunny, with Perth forecast to enjoy perfect weather with highs in the low 30s and no sight of rain. The conditions in Sydney will be nothing like the devastating storms that battered the NSW coast last weekend with widespread power cuts and tennis ball-sized hail that wrecked homes and cars.
