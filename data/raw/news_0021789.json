The officials also wanted the MLAs to furnish written declarations. \n\nThe legislators have been staying in the resort since Wednesday evening after attending a meeting convened by party general secretary V K Sasikala, who was elected as legislature party to be the chief minister of Tamil Nadu. The MLAs were taken to the resort in luxury buses, a day after caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam alleged that Sasikala had forced him to resign. \n\nThe police and revenue team began inquiries on Saturday in the wake of complaints the MLAs were confined in the resort forcefully. Panneerselvam, who met the Governor on Thursday evening, raised the issue forceful confinement of the MLAs. \n\nOn Friday, the Madras high court observed that it was a serious issue if MLAs are confined. Two petitions have been filed in the court to trace two AIADMK legislators. \n\nTension prevailed after people engaged by the supporters of Sasikala, who have been guarding the resort to prevent the journalists in meeting the MLAs, pelted stones at a section of media persons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:38:09.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
