Then, they got to him a little bit. He babied up a change-up on a 3-2 pitch. In the SEC, you can’t make pitches like that. He needs to get better. Zack Hess had trouble with his command. We wanted to break the ice for him before his opportunity to start Wednesday (against Hofstra).”\nUP NEXT\nLSU will play UNO at First NBC Ballpark in New Orleans on Tuesday. First pitch is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Central. The Privateers (3-0) defeated Prairie View 14-0 on Sunday afternoon in New Orleans.
