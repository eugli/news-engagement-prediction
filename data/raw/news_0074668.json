Earlier last week, UAE residents were in for a surprise when they updated WhatsApp on their phones. The popular messaging app introduced its new 'Status' feature which allows users to share short video status messages that disappear after 24 hours. While the move may be a tech leap from the application's older text-only status messages, social media is abuzz with users complaining it is too close to the Snapchat 'Stories' feature and is, therefore, an overkill. But how exactly does it work? If you've used Snapchat or Instagram Stories, here are some steps you might be familiar with: 1. On your phone's WhatsApp, there is now a new section called 'Status'. From this panel, you will be able to see statuses that others have put. You can also update your own status from here. 2. Select 'My Status' to upload your own. It will bring up your phone's camera. 3 . Here you can take a photo or a video that will represent your status. 4. You can further tweak it. You can add text, stickers, and even scribbles (!) on your status. 5. Once you're satisfied, you can upload it. Prior to this, WhatsApp will notify you that this status will be sent to all your contacts. Once you confirm this, your new status will be live. 6. Once your status is live, users can reply to it. This allows them to send you direct messages with the aforementioned status update attached. 7. If you are not satisfied with your status update, you may simply delete it. Click on the status you want to delete and tapping the 'Trash' icon. This window will also show you your contacts that have seen your status. Still don't like it? You're not alone. The new feature does not sit well with many users of the app. On Twitter alone, a lot of users are clamouring to the app to go back to its older version with its simple text statuses. These default status messages said \"Hey I'm on WhatsApp\", but one could simply edit it to any short quip. Speaking to Khaleej Times, UAE resident Fariha Osmani said that it can be risky since majority of the app's users in the UAE have their colleagues, relatives and even handymen on their phone. This wide range of contacts allows even mere acquaintances to have an unintended peek at one's life. Another resident, Ryan Miglinczy, said that he \"doesn't understand the point of it.\" - keith@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:59:50.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
