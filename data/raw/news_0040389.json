including the new offence of 'controlling and coercive behaviour', Domestic Violence Protection Orders, and the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme - and ensure that no stone will be left unturned in delivering a system that increases convictions, and works better for victims.\" \nThe moves come amid concerns in Number 10 that the legal system often lets down victims, partly because the plethora of different offences and procedures that currently exist had resulted in a postcode lottery.\nAides said the lack of clarity in the system had created an \"unacceptable diversity\" in terms of the degree of effort put in to try and tackle it, with inconsistency in the way laws and measures had been applied.\nMs May, who said she had attached \"personal importance\" to the issue while at the Home Office, will oversee a cross-Government effort to improve the situation.\nRead more Homeless women turned away by local councils for emergency housing The work, which is expected to take up to 18 months, will also hear the views of victims, charities and legal experts, but Mrs May is understood to be keen that any \"quick wins\" identified in the project could be acted on in the interim period.\nMrs May said the plan had the potential to \"transform the way we think about and tackle domestic violence and abuse\".\nShe said: \"There are thousands of people who are suffering at the hands of abusers - often isolated, and unaware of the options and support available to them to end it.\n\"Given the central importance of victim evidence to support prosecutions in this area, raising public awareness - as well as consolidating the law - will prove crucial.\"\nMore than 100,000 defendants were prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2015/16, with over 75,000 convicted - the highest volumes ever recorded - but there are concerns that not all victims feel prepared to come forward.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: \"Domestic abuse is a particularly distressing crime as it often occurs in the place where people should feel safest - their home.\n\"We welcome the programme of work the Prime Minister has announced in this important area and we will play a full part.\n\"A domestic abuse case is more likely to be prosecuted and convicted today than ever before.\n\"However, we know this crime is often under-reported and therefore any new initiative which encourages victims to come forward is to be applauded.\"\nUK news in pictures 16 show all UK news in pictures 1/16 14 February 2017 The sun rises behind Tower Bridge in London\nPA wire\n2/16 14 February 2017 Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK\nRex\n3/16 14 February 2017 Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK\nRex\n4/16 14 February 2017 The Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, is given roses by RVS volunteer Dave Hancock at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol\nPA wire\n5/16 14 February 2017 The Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, dances with Graeme Puckett of Hoppin' Mad at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol\nPA wire\n6/16 14 February 2017 The scene outside Topshop in the Oracle shopping centre in Reading, Berkshire, where according to reports a 10-year-old boy died from severe head injuries following an incident involving shop furniture\nPA wire\n7/16 14 February 2017 Creator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London\nPA wire\n8/16 14 February 2017 Creator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London\nPA wire\n9/16 14 February 2017 Mayor of London Sadiq Khan poses for a photograph with Tinie Tempah and MTV presenter Laura Whitmore at the offices of Viacom in London where he announced that the MTV European Music Awards will be held in the city\nPA wire\n10/16 14 February 2017 The Tornado locomotive at Appleby station before it pulls the first timetabled main line steam-hauled service for half a century across the Ribblehead viaduct in North Yorkshire\nPA wire\n11/16 14 February 2017 Britain's Queen Elizabeth arrives to officially open the National Cyber Security Centre in London, Britain,\nReuters\n12/16 14 February 2017 The new National Cyber Crime Security centre in Victoria, central London.
