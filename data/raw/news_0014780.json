But the threat again did not warrant an arrest, police determined.\n\"There was nothing actionable,\" the source said. \"There was no victim. There was no complainant.”\nLewis’s sister, Theresa Forbes, said he was not a woman hater.\n\"He loves girls. He was very protective,\" she said, referring to the women in his life.\nShe added that her brother wasn’t “ready” for a girlfriend and never hung around Howard Beach.\n\"We're not killers, we're church people. They set him up,' Forbes, 36, said. \"I think the cops framed him because he's a black person.\"\nShe said she was sorry for the Vetrano family's loss, but that the wrong person was in custody. Lewis's DNA was found on Vetrano's body.\n\"The DNA lies sometimes. They wanted to get confirmation so they framed him for murder. My family, we are God-fearing people. The Bible tells us 'Do not kill.' We do not kill,\" Forbes said.\nLewis was \"pretty forthcoming\" and gave a detailed account of the killing, a police source said. Detectives Lewis happened upon Vetrano and launched the vicious attack. He did not admit to sexually assaulting the victim, sources said.\nHe is charged with second-degree murder.\nBut Forbes wasn't buying it.\n\"I think they coerced him into a confession. They tricked him,\" she said.\nShe pointed out that Lewis is a rail-thin 6 feet tall and 140 pounds — and bears little resemblance to a police sketch released of a suspect in the Aug. 2 attack.\n\"Look at the sketch, that's not him,\" Forbes said. \"He's a skinny guy, she's a strong person. He could never kill a person like that.\"\nLewis’s mother said he was innocent at her home in East New York, Brooklyn.\n\"He's not guilty. Tell them to go look for the real killer,\" she said.\nA next door neighbor, who would not give his name, said Lewis “was slow” and “stayed to himself.”\nLewis’s father previously denied his son could be a killer , and noted that he had received good grades at school.\nNYPD Commissioner James O'Neill was expected to address the case during an update Monday on citywide crime statistics.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-not-convinced-son-killed-jogger-karina-vetrano-article-1.2965005", "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/chanel-lewis-20-arrested-killing-jogger-karina-vetrano-article-1.2964701"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:37:13.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
