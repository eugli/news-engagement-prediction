Bush Released from Hospital Former President George H.W. Bush was discharged from a Houston hospital Monday after being treated for pneumonia. \n2:23 PM, Jan 30, 2017 | By TWS STAFF The Weekly Standard Sorry,   \nPhoto credit: Jim McGrath \nFormer President George H.W. Bush was discharged from a Houston hospital Monday after being treated for pneumonia. \nA statement tweeted by spokesman Jim McGrath thanked the public for \"the many prayers and kind messages [Bush] received during his stay\" at Houston Methodist Hospital, \"as well as the world-class care that both his doctors and nurses provided.\" \nMcGrath announced on Jan. 18, a Wednesday, that Bush had been admitted Saturday for shortness of breath. He was moved to the ICU, but a series of near-daily updates relayed news of continuous improvement. \nPart of his hospitalization overlapped with that of his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, who spent five days at Houston Methodist for bronchitis. She was released last week. \nThe forty-first president had written President Donald Trump to inform him he couldn't attend the inauguration, citing the winter weather. \"My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under. Same for Barbara. So I guess we're stuck in Texas,\" he stated in a letter dated Jan. 10, prior to his receiving care.
