Jamal al-Harith Credit: Universal News & Sport \nI n all an estimated £20million was paid to 16 British citizens and residents who were held at the camp. \nIn a statement from Mr Blair’s office, he said: “It is correct that Jamal al-Harith was released from Guantanamo Bay at the request of the British Government in 2004.” \nHe added: “He was not paid compensation by my Government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the Conservative Government.” Jamal al-Harith (AKA Jamal Udeen) Credit: BANARAS KHAN \nN umber 10 declined to comment on the compensation payments, whether they were necessary, whether they would be reviewed or why Mrs May had agreed with them, or tried to stop them. \nNumber 10 also refused to say why Mrs May as home secretary allowed al-Harith had been allowed to travel back to Syria in 2014. \nMrs May’s deputy official spokesman said to each question: “It is an intelligence matter.” Jamal al-Harith \n“When his release was announced in very measured terms in 2004, pointing out the risks which remained with Guantanamo detainees, the Conservative MPs reacted by strongly criticising not the released but why it had taken so long. \n“The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any Government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took. \n“The reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations.” Follow Telegraph News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:26:46.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
