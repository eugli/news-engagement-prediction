The 22-year-old man, who works as a baker, denied earlier an attempted murder charge in the Court of First Instance claiming he did not have any intention to kill them. He will be deported after serving his jail term. The incident took place on March 26, last year, in Freej al Murar, Naif. One of the victims, a 30-year-old Bangladeshi maid, said it was on a Saturday when the defendant attacked her and another woman. \"Few minutes after he entered our flat he attacked me with a scalpel stabbing me in the face, neck, chest and shoulder. I fainted and fell down. He then went for the other woman\". The other victim, a 35-year-old Indonesian, recounted to the investigators how the accused stabbed her all over her body. She claimed she had recovered of her injuries. A police sergeant said : \"We chased him in the patrol car and then on foot. We surrounded the area where the crime took place in Iyyal Nasser. He was bleeding all the way and it helped us track him\". The accused had a cut in the left thigh. His clothes were covered with blood. Another police officer said they cordoned the flat off as they waited for the crime scene experts. \"The victims looked terribly injured and in a state of panic\". A medical test which the first victim underwent showed she suffered of AIDS and the police had to place her in a separate cell in in jail. During the investigation, the accused admitted he wanted to kill the two women when he attacked them with the scalpel. In the remarks made by the public prosecution, they said that the intention to kill was present on the incident day given the nature of the stabs which could have been deadly had it not been for the urgent hospitalization. The baker may appeal the ruling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:03:31.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
