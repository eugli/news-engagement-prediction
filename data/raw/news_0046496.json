Print \nAshish Mehta has broken a spell that lasted over 100 years. In 2016, he became the first Indian chef to make it to the elite team that cooks for the prestigious Nobel Banquet in Stockholm. On December 10, he prepared a meal for 1,300 guests at the City Hall in Stockholm, for a dinner attended by the cream of academia, culture, industry, diplomatic corps, government, the Royal Family of Sweden and, of course, the Nobel Laureates. \nMehta, who is the chef at the official residence of the Ambassador of Sweden to India, said he had never been ambitious as a young chef. \n“Even though I loved cooking since the age of 10, I was not striving for anything like this,” the 30-year-old said. “I was content if I managed to make decent money. Fresh out of college, that was all that mattered.” \nIn 2010, Mehta joined the kitchen of the Embassy of Sweden in Delhi, where he finally received the kind of international exposure which stoked his ambitions. “At the Embassy, I worked with Swedish chefs from whom I got a close-up of the real world of cooking – I understood the meaning of fine dining, restaurant-style cooking and food presentation skills. I observed things around me looked for answers within me... in that process I discovered my real passion for cooking.” \nIn the summer of 2015, Mark Phoenix, a Nobel Chef who was associated with the Embassy for the Sweden-India Nobel Memorial Week, casually mentioned the Nobel Banquet to Mehta and asked him to apply as a volunteer. Enthused, Mehta sent an application, but did not make the cut. Panoramic shot of the Nobel Prize Banquet.

Isaksson, who runs Esperento – one of the 50 best restaurants in the world – was also the man who designed and executed the Nobel Banquet in 2015. No one knew that he had been asked to lead the team once again (chefs are bound by non-disclosure agreements), or that he was in Delhi for a mission. Finally, when Isaksson revealed his secret to the young chef he had observed and selected for the team, Mehta was over the moon. \nAll proceedings from that moment were conducted in secrecy, with the official line being: “Ashish Mehta is going to Sweden to work in a restaurant for a week.” When Mehta reached, he realised that he was one of the six members of a core team which would work closely with Chef Isaksson. \n“The Noble Banquet caters to a large audience of very high profile guests, we had to work for extended hours every day, which required us to be physically fit and mentally agile at any given point in time,” Mehta said. “As an Indian I was not used to working in such cold weather. I was shivering there.” \nMehta improvises by adding Indian ingredients like cumin and garlic to Swedish food like meat balls and has served Tandoori Salmon at official dinners at the Embassy. With his experience at the Nobel banquet, he is ready to bring more improvisation to the culinary space back home. \n“You learn so much from Chef Isaksson, he is such an inspiration,” Mehta said. “What I am never going to forget is that for any event, if you plan, are clear about your logistics and how to handle stress, the event will be a success no matter how large the audience is.” We welcome your comments at In a first, some of the finest Indian theatre can now be seen on your screen A new cinematic production brings to life thought-provoking plays as digital video. Published Feb 17, 2017. Print \nThough we are a country besotted with cinema, theatre remains an original source of provocative stories, great actors, and the many deeply rooted traditions of the dramatic arts across India. CinePlay is a new, ambitious experiment to bring the two forms together. \nThese plays, ‘filmed’ as digital video, span classic drama genre as well as more experimental dark comedy and are available on Hotstar premium, as part of Hotstar’s Originals bouquet. “We love breaking norms. And CinePlay is an example of us serving our consumer’s multi-dimensional personality and trusting them to enjoy better stories, those that not only entertain but also tease the mind”, says Ajit Mohan, CEO, Hotstar. \nThe first collection of CinePlays feature stories from leading playwrights, like Vijay Tendulkar, Mahesh Dattani, Badal Sircar amongst others and directed by film directors like Santosh Sivan and Nagesh Kukunoor. They also star some of the most prolific names of the film and theatre world like Nandita Das, Shreyas Talpade, Saurabh Shukla, Mohan Agashe and Lillete Dubey. \nThe idea was conceptualised by Subodh Maskara and Nandita Das, the actor and director who had early experience with street theatre. “The conversation began with Subodh and me thinking how can we make theatre accessible to a lot more people” says Nandita Das. The philosophy is that ‘filmed’ theatre is a new form, not a replacement, and has the potential to reach millions instead of thousands of people. Hotstar takes the reach of these plays to theatre lovers across the country and also to newer audiences who may never have had access to quality theatre. \n“CinePlay is merging the language of theatre and the language of cinema to create a third unique language” says Subodh. The technique for ‘filming’ plays has evolved after many iterations. Each play is shot over several days in a studio with multiple takes, and many angles just like cinema. Cinematic techniques such as light and sound effects are also used to enhance the drama. Since it combines the intimacy of theatre with the format of cinema, actors and directors have also had to adapt. “It was quite intimidating. Suddenly you have to take something that already exists, put some more creativity into it, some more of your own style, your own vision and not lose the essence” says Ritesh Menon who directed ‘Between the Lines’. Written by Nandita Das, the play is set in contemporary urban India with a lawyer couple as its protagonists. The couple ends up arguing on opposite sides of a criminal trial and the play delves into the tension it brings to their personal and professional lives. Play \nThe actors too adapted their performance from the demands of the theatre to the requirements of a studio. While in the theatre, performers have to project their voice to reach a thousand odd members in the live audience, they now had the flexibility of being more understated. Namit Das, a popular television actor, who acts in the CinePlay ‘Bombay Talkies’ says, “It’s actually a film but yet we keep the characteristics of the play alive. For the camera, I can say, I need to tone down a lot.” Vickram Kapadia’s ‘Bombay Talkies’ takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of emotions as seven personal stories unravel through powerful monologues, touching poignant themes such as child abuse, ridicule from a spouse, sacrifice, disillusionment and regret. \nThe new format also brought many new opportunities. In the play “Sometimes”, a dark comedy about three stressful days in a young urban professional’s life, the entire stage was designed to resemble a clock. The director Akarsh Khurana, was able to effectively recreate the same effect with light and sound design, and enhance it for on-screen viewers. In another comedy “The Job”, presented earlier in theatre as “The Interview”, viewers get to intimately observe, as the camera zooms in, the sinister expressions of the interviewers of a young man interviewing for a coveted job. \nBesides the advantages of cinematic techniques, many of the artists also believe it will add to the longevity of plays and breathe new life into theatre as a medium. Adhir Bhat, the writer of ‘Sometimes’ says, “You make something and do a certain amount of shows and after that it phases out, but with this it can remain there.” \nThis should be welcome news, even for traditionalists, because unlike mainstream media, theatre speaks in and for alternative voices. Many of the plays in the collection are by Vijay Tendulkar, the man whose ability to speak truth to power and society is something a whole generation of Indians have not had a chance to experience. That alone should be reason enough to cheer for the whole project. Play \nHotstar, India’s largest premium streaming platform, stands out with its Originals bouquet bringing completely new formats and stories, such as these plays, to its viewers. Twenty timeless stories from theatre will be available to its subscribers. Five CinePlays, “Between the lines”, “The Job”, “Sometimes”, “Bombay Talkies” and “Typecast”, are already available and a new one will release every week starting March.
