Dance, for her, was “the expression of man — the landscape of his soul.” She makes for a tough, but not impossible, act to follow; what’s frustrating is that none of the new works try to carry Graham tradition into the future. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Sacred In the spare “Primitive Mysteries,” inspired by the rituals of Native Americans in the Southwest, the dancers must move and breathe as one. In a precurtain talk, Janet Eilber, the company’s artistic director, said that Graham told her dancers, “It should be as if they had one heartbeat.” Photo Ms. Chien-Pott in the title role in “Clytemnestra.” Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times Deliberate walks — extreme in their slow pace, but daring in their power — herald the beginning and the end of the three sections, in which the dancers hold cupped hands at their hips and envelop the stage in a profound rhythmic vibration. As the lead, PeiJu Chien-Pott, transcendent in a long white gown, glides to groups of women, who maintain rigid devotion, holding angular, stationary shapes or changing formation in unison packs. At this performance, it took time for the dancers to find their single heartbeat, but it was unnervingly beautiful when they did in the final “Hosanna” section. Moving as one, they were somehow both flesh and steel; the quiet grandeur of the walks made time stand still. The New (Or Was It the Profane?) In “ I used to love you ,” Ms. Parson takes inspiration from Graham’s 1941 comedy “Punch and the Judy” to tell the story of an unhappy marriage. In her update, Judy (Xin Ying) is the unhappy wife of Punch (Lorenzo Pagano), who — and this is apparently the modern part — turns out to be gay. But the chorus of three women on rolling chairs, Laurel Dalley Smith, Anne O’Donnell and Leslie Andrea Williams, were the real stars of this production.

The chorus shouts. Using a mix of video (Jeff Larson), text (Will Eno) and sound (Tei Blow), Ms. Parson has choreographed a frustratingly self-referential work: “Time will tell,” the chorus says, “what they are doing, here. Whether they are just barely succeeding at something very difficult, or completely failing at something totally impossible.” Mr. Cherkaoui’s “Mosaic” is a different kind of superficial. It tries to get by on energetic force: a nonstop swirl of movement. The choreographer’s ambiguous aim? To promote diversity. But it’s a monotonous work, in which the dancers, fingers twitching, form a tableau at center stage before falling out to let loose with agitated rolls to the floor and whipping turns. Return to the center. Repeat. And repeat. The Heroic It wasn’t a Graham retelling of a Greek myth that invoked the heroic, but her 1948 look at three facets of love: “Diversion of Angels.” It was a standout for its gutsy dancing, particularly by Charlotte Landreau and Lloyd Mayor as the Couple in Yellow. Ms. Landreau has remade the spunky part, which pays homage to young love, with her fearless verve. The Reimagined The company is offering shorter versions of the second act of “Clytemnestra” and “Dark Meadow Suite.” Both allow for transcendent dancing — especially by Ms. Chien-Pott as Clytemnestra and Ms. O’Donnell in “Dark Meadow.” But a richer experiment comes in the reinvention of a lost Graham work, “Ekstatis” (1933). There is no film of the dance; what remains are photographs and Graham’s recollections about its importance in the development of her movement vocabulary. Created by the former principal Virginie Mécène for Ms. Chien-Pott, this reimagined solo — eerie yet poignantly forthright — reveals connections among the hip, the shoulder and the pelvis. Twisting like a snake with a rubbery torso as she juts a hip forward, Ms. Chien-Pott is spellbinding in her ability to waver between slinky and taut. “Ekstasis” is an experiment that worked and one that could even pave the way to the future. Ms. Mécène should keep going. \n‘Sacred/Profane’Through Sunday at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan; 212-242-0800, joyce.org.
