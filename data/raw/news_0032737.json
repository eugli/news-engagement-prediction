(Picture for representation/HT File) \nThe number of applicants for Master in Business Administration (MBA)and Masters in Management Studies (MMS)courses has grown by 50% in the last two years. \nThe Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) has received more than 94,300 applications for the Common Entrance Test (CET) to MBA and MMS courses this year — a jump of more than 20,000 candidates compared to 2016. There were around 60,000 applications in 2015. \nThe intake capacity in 360 management institutes in the state is 36,900. This means at least three students are vying for one seat this year. \n“Last year, the registrations had gone up to 74,000 from 60,000 in 2015. The fact that the registrations have increased by such a huge margin again this year proves that the demand for MBA/MMS courses is still very high among the youth,” said Dayanand Meshram, joint director of DTE. \nRegistrations for the CET started from January 21 and ended on February 13. \nMeshram added that the total intake capacity of colleges can go up by a few hundreds based on the approvals for new batches or institutes that might come through in April from the government. \nThe highest registrations recorded for MH-CET for management admissions was in 2011-2012, where 96,000 students had registered for a mere 20,000 seats. \nIn 2013, admissions to management courses in the state were done on the basis of scores in the Common Management Admission Test (CMAT) conducted by the All India Council of Technical Education. Registrations to management institutes took a hit due to this change and a mere 20,000 students had applied for the test as compared to 42,490 in 2012. \nIn 2014, DTE went back to MH-CET for management seats as well and the registrations once again shot to 53,000. \nOf the 36,900 management seats available in the state, around 4,300 are in Mumbai-based institutes. \nPune district has the highest number of management seats with a capacity of 14,000. \nMeanwhile, students aiming to bag a seat at the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies (JBIMS) are still clueless. \nImplementation of the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of admission and fees) in May 2015 made it clear that admissions to all professional courses will be done through CET, followed by Common Admission Process rounds. \nIn 2017, JBIMS sought relief from the common admissions process, but its proposal was rejected. JBIMS has resent its proposal to the state government and are yet to hear from them. \nThe MH-CET for MBA will be conducted in the first week of March.
