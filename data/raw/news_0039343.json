hundreds evacuated as Christchurch Port Hills fire rage out of control Last updated 19:47, February 15 2017 BRITA CORBETT \nGrowing smoke cloud over Christchurch's Port Hills. \nFour homes have been destroyed as a massive fire blazes through the Christchurch hill suburbs of Westmorland and Kennedy's Bush. \nAt least 300 people have been evacuated hill suburbs as a state of emergency was called and the army was sent in to help. \nThree houses were destroyed on Hoon Hay Valley Rd on Wednesday afternoon. DAVID WALKER/Stuff.co.nz \nResidents in the Christchurch suburb of Westmorland are evacuating as the Port Hills fires spread on Wednesday. \nThe Early Valley Road fire area was also extending. One house was destroyed on Old Tai Tapu Rd. \nREAD MORE: \nPolice said residents of Kennedys Bush Rd and its intersecting streets were evacuated from Halswell Quarry up towards the end of Kennedys Bush Rd. SARAH RAMSEY \nA view of the Christchurch fires from the top of the BNZ centre in the central city. \nResidents should leave their homes immediately and head to the Pioneer Recreation Centre for further information. \nA \"concerning wind change\" has led one fire service veteran to warn the fires have become a \"highly volatile situation\". \n​ Greg Crawford, Assistant Area Commander of the NZ Fire Service for Canterbury and West Coast, said Christchurch staff were doing their best to battle the blazes but had an immense task ahead of them. JOHNATHAN JOHANNIS \nThe scale of the fires in the Port Hills is evident in this image, taken from Tuam street, in central Christchurch. \n\"We are under a fair bit of pressure here, we have fires on about 10 different fronts,\" Crawford said. \"One sector in Governors Bay, one on Summit Road, now a new sector on Worsleys Rd, Cashmere, and we still have a sector running at Early Valley Rd.... we've committed just about every resource in Christchurch to this incident. It's under the control of Rural and DOC in some cases.\" \n​ He said Worsleys Rd was being evacuated. \n\"There are some big issues over there, people need to be wary.\" JACK FLETCHER/FAIRFAX NZ \nA police cordon at the intersection of Penruddock Rise and Cashmere Rd, the access point to the suburb of Westmorland in the Port Hills. \nA Fire Service media spokeswoman said she understood only rural firefighters were fighting the fire. \nHowever, Principal Rural Fire Officer Douglas Marshall said both Canterbury rural and urban brigades were fighting the fire. \nThe Worsley Spur flare up, which caused the Westmorland evacuation, had been caused my the nor east wind, dry conditions and heavier vegetation. \n\"Once they get into trees and they start to crown, not only are they hard to control, but they're dangerous. \n\"I know it's frustrating for people,\" Marshall said. \nDAMAGE TO ADVENTURE PARK AREA MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nBlackened bush in Ohinetahi Reserve in the hills above Governors Bay. \nChristchurch Adventure Park spokeswoman Anne Newman said the fire was getting close to the park's chairlift base station. \nThe fire had entered the valley where the park was situated, however the village, at the bottom of the valley, was untouched. \nVegetation surrounding the some mountain bike tracks was \"gone\", Newman said. MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nSmoke pours from burning trees in the hills above Governors Bay. \n\"But, you know, trees can grow again,\" she said. \nShe did not know whether the chairlift pylons or the station at the top of the lift were damaged. \nThe $20 million park opened on December 17 last year after an eight-month build process. Staff had earlier been evacuated from the park. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/Stuff.co.nz \nNeil McPhail watched as the flames approached his house. \nUNSAFE TO FIGHT AT NIGHT \nMarshall said it was unsafe to fight at night \"so all these things [fires] get away\". \n\"We had that in Governor's Bay. \n\"Think about the fire ground and how little roading structure there is and how far we have to get anywhere. \n\"So you're relying on aerial arriving and then you're relying on tankers to turn up and do their bit, but they might have to come 20 or 30 minutes. \n\"It's just a size thing, it's immensely frustrating,\" Marshall said. MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nA helicopter with a monsoon bucket drops water on trees in the Ella Track/Cass Ridge Track area above Governors Bay. \nThe Fire Service would \"bring up more\" firefighters from the South Island. \n\"We've got more firefighters on the ground today. \n\"We will look at whether more resource and equipment will help us . . . Often you have cockies turn up and they've got boots and shorts on and they want to fight. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nHelicopters fill monsoon buckets from Lyttelton Harbour. \n\"But they're not safe,\" Marshall said. \nIt was not clear how the fire would be fought overnight. \n\"Three hours is a long time here. So I don't know right now is the honest answer,\" Marshall said. JUDY JACKSON \nSmoke rising from the Port Hills can be seen from the Diamond Harbour ferry. \nAs resources are stretched, the NZ Fire Service warn that people elsewhere in the city should be careful. \nSome suburban stations are being staffed by volunteer firefighters. \n\"Because we are committed to what we've got, we haven't got resources to do much else at the moment,\" Crawford said. \"We can only do what we can do, at the moment it's a pretty volatile situation\". TWITTER/METSERVICE/JMA \nSmoke from the fires on Christchurch's Port Hills can be seen clearly from space. \nSome residents had wrongly assumed the fires to be contained. \n\"It has never really been under control,\" Crawford said. \nCivil Defence and Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has requested the New Zealand Defence Force to provide support to local authorities in Christchurch as they deal with the Port Hills fires. FLETCHER BOIXO \nWhat looks like a meteor streaks by as flames engulf the top of Christchurch's Port Hills. \n\"The Canterbury Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Group has offered its assistance to both Selwyn District Council and Christchurch City Council but at this time the councils have not declared a state of local emergency,\" Brownlee said. \n\"At the moment the response to the blazes is being coordinated by Rural Fire, not CDEM, out of the Selwyn District Council. \n\"The New Zealand Defence Force this afternoon deployed a Liaison Officer to work alongside the Selwyn Rural Fire Authority and to provide timely advice to Defence on what further support they can provide. MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nThick smoke from the spreading Port Hills fire envelops Lyttelton Harbour on Wednesday morning. \n\"NZDF will send forward logistics personnel and equipment from Burnham Military Camp. \n\"Engineering equipment, water tankers and manpower options that will support cordons, firebreaks, and firefighters will also be deployed. \n\"Since yesterday, six NZDF firefighters and two appliances have been assisting in Early Valley Rd, near Kennedy's Bush southwest of the city,\" Brownlee said. DANIEL HUNTON/SUPPLIED \nThe Christchurch Port Hills fires continued to rage just after midnight on Wednesday. \nWESTMORLAND EVACUATED \nWestmorland resident Tim Butcher said, \"We've been told this whole area is being evacuated.\" \nAbout 100 cars are queuing along Cashmere Rd and police are blocking access to the Westmorland subdivision, home to almost 2000 people. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nRNZ News reporter Conan Young is live from Governors Bay which is under threat from the Port Hills fire. \nIn a statement, police said they were helping the Fire Service with evacuations at Worsleys Rd and the streets intersecting with Worsleys Rd. \nThe evacuation was due to a \"concerning wind shift\". \nWorsleys Rd was closed from Cashmere Rd to all members of the public. GARY WILSON \nHelicopters with monsoon buckets fight the fires on Christchurch's Port Hills. \nResidents could be permitted access, but needed to report to police officers at the cordons. Anyone with concerns could to speak to officers at cordons or phone emergency services. \nWestmorland residents were gathered at the corner of Penruddock Rise and Cashmere Rd, as police took the names of those they are letting collect pets and other family members. \nPhil and his two kids, aged seven and five, sought shade under a tree next to Francis Reserve. GARY WILSON \nHelicopters with monsoon buckets fight the fires on Christchurch's Port Hills. \n\"They haven't told us much yet, we're just waiting. \n\"I've just organised someone to get my dog,\" he said \nHis two children, still in school uniform, sat alongside. MARTIN VAN BEYNEN/FAIRFAX NZ \n???Ash coats cars in Diamond Harbour, on the other side of Lyttelton Harbour, following the Christchurch Port Hills fires. \nHis son, 7, described the situation as \"bad\". \nIt is understood residents on neighbouring hill suburb Worsleys Spur had been told to prepare for evacuation. Police were preventing access to Worsleys Rd. \nStaff at the new Christchurch Adventure Park have also been evacuated. BARRY DUNCAN \nHelicopters fly to fight the fire at first light. \nLisa Briggs lives at the top of Kennedy's Bush Rd, under the path of a constant helicopters. \n\"I'm scared because if it gets any closer my house could burn down,\" Briggs said. \n\"The bags are packed, the dog is already gone so it's just me and the cat. GEORGE HEARD/STUFF.CO.NZ \nFire crews are getting a blaze in Christchurch's Port Hills under control. \n\"The kids are going to my sister's place at the bottom of the hill.\" \nBriggs' husband and a neighbour had dug a small fire break behind the house and had the sprinklers going since yesterday. \n\"It seems like Christchurch can't catch a break, first the earthquakes and now fires.\" JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nFire near Governors Bay on Wednesday morning. \nThe Port HIlls fires which have raged since Monday afternoon have destroyed buildings, vehicles and forestry, and helicopter pilot, 38-year-old David Steven Askin , was killed while fighting the flames. \nThey also caused a 30-minute power outage to 89,000 Christchurch households. Widespread power outages were reported at about 2pm after smoke or flames from the fires caused the Transpower 220 kV line to trip. \nCOULD BURN FOR 72 HOURS TIM MCGINN \nA plane drops fire retardant onto a blaze near the Sign of the Kiwi on Christchurch's Port Hills. \nSelwyn District Council spokesman Stephen Hill says the fires could continue for another 48 to 72 hours. \nThe largest fire started on Early Valley Rd about 6pm on Monday while a smaller one at Marleys Hill, near Sign of the Kiwi, started in a car park about 7pm on Monday. \nHill said the fire was \"still developing in some locations\", including parts of Marleys Hill and Early Valley. TIM MCGINN \nA helicopter fills a monsoon bucket from a small pond near Sugarloaf on the Port Hills. \n\"I don't think we can describe the fire as contained at this stage. A lot of the area is under control, but there are some spots that are expanding and developing.\" \nCrews with diggers and bulldozers were working since 6am to create new fire breaks to protect properties in the Holmes Rd area, including one belonging to Graeme and Leah Causer. \n\"I slept last night just because I was shattered, but the call came in at six this morning that the whole valley was alight, so we came down quick smart,\" Leah Causer said. \nGraeme Causer said he was \"hopeful\" a fresh fire break bulldozed by contractors on his hillside would stop the fire spreading further. \n\"The biggest wait will be over the next two weeks to two months, I mean, until we get a big rain it'll keep smouldering for at least two months.\" \nContractors were widening a section of the fire break to keep the flames back from trees behind their house. \n\"I don't really care about the house, we've been in there three times to pick things up, you know, photos and jewellery from the safe,\" Causer said. \nHe knew most of the contractors working in the eight earth-moving machines cutting fire breaks in the area. \n\"We haven't talked money yet, but those machines are about $400 an hour, but they just wanted to come in and help.\" \nDAMAGE TO NATIVE RESERVE UNKNOWN \nA wind change shortly after midnight on Wednesday caused fire crews to race to Summit Rd after flames started spreading quickly. About 107 residents from the Allandale area near Governors Bay were evacuated about 3am by firefighters and police. Affected residents were allowed to return to their homes mid-morning. \nAbout 15 fire crews, 120 firefighters and support crew are involved in ground operations, while about 15 helicopters and two aircraft were attacking the flames from above. No further property had been reported damaged overnight after a house and several sheds were destroyed by flames earlier. \nFirefighters were expected to be needed for another two or three days. \nSuzanne Johnson, co-owner of Governors Bay's She Universe Cafe, said she was called by the Fire Service about 3am and asked to check her tenanted property in Teddington Rd. \nShe arrived to see flames raging on the ridge line above the property. \n\"It was pretty obvious why nobody should be there. The flames were very high,\" she said. \nThe tenants and their animals had gone. \nThe tired cafe owner spend Wednesday morning sending loaves of ciabatta, eggs, bacon and other ingredients to the Governors Bay Volunteer Fire Brigade so the fire crews could make BLT rolls. \n\"Our brigade is incredible. They are incredibly valuable to this community . . . so committed and devoted.\" \nSummit Road Society member Anne Kennedy said she had not been able to check on the Ohinetahi Reserve and could only hope the damage was not too severe. \n\"The firefighters don't want us over there at the moment so we will have to wait, no one has been in yet to see what it's like.\" \nKennedy said she would be deeply disappointed if the landscape was damaged after 20 years of work maintaining the tracks and planting in the area. Matai, mature totara trees and a variety of native birds populate the 150-hectare reserve. \nCONDITIONS 'FAVOURABLE' FOR FIREFIGHTING \nMarshall said an evacuation centre was set up at Governors Bay School, which would not open for classes on Wednesday. \nThe Governors Bay houses were not immediately threatened by the fires, but the evacuations were a precautionary measure. \n\"We have also got a fire creeping towards the Sign of the Kiwi and it's sitting about 150 metres away, but we have a response team in place ready to protect the area. \nMarshall said the midnight flare-up was likely caused by flames entering the steep, hilly territory around Governors Bay and being fuelled by wind. \nConditions on Wednesday looked \"much more favourable for firefighting\", he said. \nMetService duty meteorologist Ravi Kandula said very light northeasterly breezes were forecast on Wednesday, but \"a bit of a sea breeze will blow in and obviously that can get going\". \nA high of 22 degrees Celsius is forecast in the early afternoon. \nPower remained out to about 50 homes in Governors Bay, Marleys Hill and Landsdowne on Wednesday. \nLines company Orion hoped to have power restored for most before nightfall on Wednesday, but about 12 homes in Lansdowne and Marleys Hill could be without power until Sunday evening as firefighting efforts continued. \nHELICOPTER CRASH \nThe helicopter pilot who died battling large fires on Christchurch's Port Hills was a war hero. \nIt was understood the pilot was Way To Go Heliservices' David Steven Askin , known as Steve. \nAskin was a former member of the SAS and was understood to have been wounded in the head during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2011 . \nUp to 15 helicopters had been fighting the blaze, and all were grounded immediately following the crash. \nPilots were given the option to return to the skies in the evening, with some choosing not to take to the skies following the crash. \nThe blazes, which both started on Monday, had spread over 600ha. It was expected firefighters would be needed for another two or three days. \nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW \n- Up to 15 helicopters, 10 rural tankers and one New Zealand Defence Force tanker are being used to battle the two fires on Christchurch's Port Hills \n- About 650 hectares of scrub and vegetation has been burned. \n- About 120 firefighters and three two-person New Zealand Army teams are working to contain the blazes. \n- One house and several sheds have been destroyed. A second house has been slightly damaged by four. \n- Twenty houses on Early Valley Rd and four on Summit Rd were evacuated overnight Monday. A further six houses and a church near Governors Bay were evacuated just after midnight on Wednesday. The hill suburb of Westmorland, home to almost 2000 people, was being evacuated on Wednesday afternoon. \n- The following roads are closed: Worsley Track from Worsleys Rd, Kennedys Bush Rd from the roundabout with Rock Hill Drive (including the southbound cycle track), Early Valley Rd, Old Tai Tapu Rd between Osterholts Rd and Early Valley Rd, Summit Rd between Gebbies Pass and Rapaki Track, and Dyers Pass Rd between Hackthorne and Governors Bay roads. Holmes Rd was closed on Wednesday morning due to rubberneckers. The public are reminded to avoid the area to free up the roads for emergency services. \n- A no fly zone is in place for the area bound by Princess Margaret Hospital, Sugarloaf, Teddington, and Tai Tapu until midday Friday. \n- The Christchurch Adventure Park remains closed on Wednesday while firefighters work to control hotspots. Recreational mountain bikers, walkers and runners should stay off the Port Hills between the suburb of Huntsbury and (also including) Kennedys Bush. \n- Governors Bay School is closed on Wednesday. \n- A total fire ban has been in place across Christchurch and Banks Peninsula since Saturday. All fires in the open air are banned, including barbecues and other devices using or containing solid fuels. Gas-fuelled barbecues and gas cookers can still be used. \n- The fires may cause health issues for some Cantabrians, with smoke possibly irritating eyes, noses, throats and airways. The Canterbury District Health Board says most symptoms will disappear soon after exposure to smoke ends. Medical treatment should be sought if symptoms worsen, especially for those with asthma, or lung or heart disease.
