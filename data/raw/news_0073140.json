Because I’ve always shied away from it.” \nHenwick reiterated that many of her previous roles had “no relevance to my ethnicity.” \n“But I reached a stage last year where I said, I want to start telling Asian stories, I want a young Asian girl to go, oh my god, that reminds me of my relationship with my mom.” \nBut even though Henwick wanted to tell these stories, she was still concerned with her role in Iron Fist , and so she spoke with producer Jeph Loeb about them. \n“He said, ‘We’re going to take the stereotype, and we’re going to – we’re not going to avoid it, we’re going to inspect it.’” \nHenwick revealed that one aspect of the character will deal with how much time she spends fighting, as hinted in the clip where she participates in a two-on-one cage fight.“What happens when you become addicted to that?” Henwick asked. “What happens when you can only talk with your fists and you struggle to communicate on any other level and you’ve become addicted to fighting? So we’ve taken this stereotype and we’ve said, okay, what is the actual realism in it? You know? Which was interesting to me.” (Photo: Netflix) \nMarvel’s Iron Fist debuts on Netflix on March 17. \nFifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company.
