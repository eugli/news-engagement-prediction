Week two? It’s a classic time for students to get the wobbles at school. \n\nSo much focus about schoolchildren is about academic outcomes, and the recently released 2015 Pisa results have again raised questions about Australia’s approach to education, due to a nother decrease in the OECD academic performance league tables . \nBut while the focus on reading, writing, and scientific literacy is critical, there is an equally important conversation that is currently sidelined – what the Pisa results show about the wellbeing of Australian students.\nThis relative silence is puzzling, given that improving mental health has been listed as one of Australia’s national health priorities and the fact that the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians together with the National Curriculum framework , both advocate that wellbeing is a central outcome of schooling. \nPisa results don’t look good, but let’s look at what we can learn before we panic Read more \nWith 26% of young Australians suffering symptoms of mental illness and crying out for help , we need to be monitoring how well Australian schools are doing on both academic outcomes and student wellbeing outcomes. Also supporting this case is the consistent research finding that wellbeing and achievement go hand in hand.\nAs researchers, we were able to gain access to the most recently published Pisa dataset to examine change in a range of wellbeing indicators assessing Australian student’s belongingness and engagement at school.\nSo how does Australia fare on wellbeing outcomes compared to other OECD countries? The answer is not so well. The picture is particularly bleak when looking at trends over time. From 2003 to 2012, Australia had the fifth largest decline in school belongingness and engagement of all OECD countries. This finding received very little media coverage at the time.\nOn all of these indicators the 2015 results, in only a three year period, showed a worsening that is similar in size to the decline over the entire decade from 2003-2012. \nIn the 2015 data, the largest declines were in the number of students who feel like an outsider (8.6% more), feel awkward (6.8% more), and have trouble making friends (6.1% more) at school. Since 2003, the trend is more alarming. In total, 16% more Australian students now feel they don’t belong, 15% more feel like an outsider, and 10% more feel lonely at school. \nConsidering that a one unit increase in school engagement has been associated with a 13 point increase in academic performance in some domains, we cannot afford to ignore this fall in school wellbeing for Australian students. Beyond academic implications, there are many psychological, social and physical health costs arising from this decline.\nSo how can Australian schools boost the wellbeing of their students? We need to act at the system level and ensure that the skills for student wellbeing and positive social relationships are brought into teacher training and curriculum design in a co-ordinated way across our all of our education systems. We need to teach in ways that are inclusive of different student needs, as well as create social norms in schools of reciprocity and community in schools. \nCrucially, our education system needs to expand the metrics upon which it evaluates schools to include wellbeing in addition to academic measures such as Naplan. \nAnd at this time of the start of the school year, extra care needs to be taken to make students feel welcome and to foster a smooth transitions from holidays back to school.\nAccording to the OECD’s Centre for Educational Research and Innovation “Perhaps the ultimate goal of education policy makers, teachers and parents is to help children achieve the highest level of wellbeing possible.” This means the discussion must extend beyond our academic rankings, and soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:43:13.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
