Ã— I bought a comfortable desk chair, and it was one of the best purchases I made last year Feb. 20, 2017, 5:02 PM 6,398 \nThe Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Yes. Annoying to sit at for more than 20 minutes? Definitely. Was I apprehensive about replacing it? A little bit. \nDespite the discomfort a chair is a chair, right?. Plus, I'm using the iPad Pro more than ever ; why should I invest in a better chair when it won't that much use? \nA little over a month ago I decided to bite the bullet and buy one, I have some projects I'd like to get done that require me to use my Mac more. Despite buying it in late November, the chair was one of the most significant purchase I made all year. \nMy criteria for the chair were relatively simple: It needed to be inexpensive, comfortable looking, and well reviewed. Because of my previous good experience with the brand, I opted to buy Amazonbasics' High-Back Executive Chair. \nThis chair comes disassembled, but only took too me about 20 minutes to set up (I may have tried assembling it without looking at the directions first). It's a standard high-back chair; you can adjust its height, roll around on its six wheels, and that's about it. There isn't a lot of give when you lean back, so if you like to be able to lean back far you're out of luck. \nThat said, this chair is very comfortable. That's true compared to the chair I was using before, but it's even better than the chair I sit on at work. It has enough padding to be comfortable, without having so much that responsitioning myself feels awkward. It feels sturdy, but is light enough to move around in. \nI use an L-shaped desk at home, so I swivel around quite a lot. On my old chair that was impossible, with this chair it's a breeze. \nWhat makes this purchase significant is that it changed how I work. I didn't spend a lot of time using my computer because it was uncomfortable. That made me a better iPad user (I still use my iPad for a lot of things on a daily basis), but I'm using my computer more than I have in months. \nI didn't realize how much discomfort fed into my aversion of using the most powerful piece of technology in my home. \nIf you're looking for a comfortable desk chair, Amazonbasics' gets my full recommendation. This is doubly true if you're reading this while sitting on an uncomfortable chair that you've decided works \"good enough.\" \nAmazonBasics High-Back Executive Chair, $109.99, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
