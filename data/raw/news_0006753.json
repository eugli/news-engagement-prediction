(AP) — New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is donating his boat “V Rings” to a community sailing center in Newport.\nThe Newport Daily News reports the 24-foot power boat was named after the five Super Bowl rings Belichick had at the time he acquired it. Since then, he’s won another ring and bought a larger boat, “VI Rings.”\nHe’s going for a seventh ring in Sunday’s Super Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons.\nSail Newport says the boat is coming in mid-February and will be used to support instructional programs and regattas.\nJeffrey Lichterman, president of Albury Brothers Boats, connected Belichick with the nonprofit group. He says the boat was not being used, and he suggested the donation because it’s consistent with the Belichick Foundation’s mission of supporting sports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:10:16.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
