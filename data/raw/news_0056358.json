Source: Tweet \nThis continental trip offered the Foxes distraction from domestic dismay that lurched from slipping into a Premier League relegation fight to FA Cup elimination at the hands of Millwall on Saturday. \nGiven their woeful form, a trip to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan was the last thing Claudio Ranieri needed and Sevilla - without the suspended Jorge Sampaoli on the touchline - routinely found gaps in a porous and passive defence. \nKasper Schmeichel was the only visiting player to provide resistance, saving Joaquin Correa's early penalty and numerous other efforts, but Pablo Sarabia's firm header had Sevilla ahead at half-time and Correa atoned for his miss with a goal after the break. Jamie Vardy has scored his first goal in 748 minutes of football across all competitions. \nHuge away goal. pic.twitter.com/E6RNB55F0u \n— Squawka Football (@Squawka) February 22, 2017 \nSchmeichel's saves largely looked to be in vain, but a Sevilla lapse opened up space for Danny Drinkwater to tee up Vardy's first Champions League goal and send a Leicester following that has become increasingly browbeaten to dream again. \nThe Foxes won all three of their group games at the King Power Stadium, twice by the 1-0 scoreline that would take them through in three weeks' time. \nRanieri had spoken of this fixture having a transformative effect on Leicester's campaign, but it was more of the same from the off, Christian Fuchs almost nodding past Schmeichel, who reacted sharply for the first of many times to save the Austrian. 380 - Jamie Vardy has scored with his first shot on target in 380 minutes for Leicester. Lifeline. \n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 22, 2017 \nThe air of calamity would not clear, though, as Correa weaved past a static Robert Huth before he was felled by a clumsy, lunging Wes Morgan in the penalty area. Though Schmeichel saved his captain's blushes by holding Correa's weak effort, the Sevilla tide was unrelenting. \nSergio Escudero was a persistent menace on Sevilla's left, and he forced Schmeichel into a smart stop before setting up a magnificent opener. \nThe full-back beat Ahmed Musa to the ball before coming back into possession and whipping an inch-perfect cross over Fuchs for Sarabia to race onto and plant a firm header beyond the helpless Schmeichel. “Champions of England, you’ll never sing that” Leicester City fans to Sevilla’s. \n— Henry Winter (@henrywinter) February 22, 2017 \nThe increasingly desperate Dane had to fist a looping, deflected Stevan Jovetic shot over and tip away a fizzing Correa shot as Leicester's lifeless approach of sitting deep in their own half did nothing to stem Sevilla's roaming through the pitch. \nWilfred Ndidi blasted the visitors' first shot on target straight at Sergio Rico, but it did not immediately signal the coming fightback as Vitolo hit the post from an impossible angle before the dithering Morgan and Huth converged on Jovetic, allowing Correa the time and space to finish after the Montenegrin offloaded the ball. \nSevilla were in control, but they were guilty of allowing Leicester a scent of progression when Drinkwater wandered into open space before picking out Vardy for his first strike since a hat-trick against Manchester City in December. \nVictory remained Sevilla's, while Real Madrid's defeat at Valencia also vitalised a potential title tilt in LaLiga, and Sampaoli's return to the touchline for the second leg could prove crucial in the Spanish side making the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.
