(Photo: Scottsdale Fire Department)\nAn intoxicated man fell 15 feet into a drainage area at the Waste Management Phoenix Open on Saturday afternoon, a fire official said. Thirteen other people, mostly those who were unconscious because of intoxication, also were transported to nearby hospitals on Saturday.\nShortly after 2 p.m. Saturday, a technical-rescue crew had to extricate the man using a 24-foot extension ladder from the area near the entrance to the expo tent, Scottsdale fire Capt. David Folio said.\nWitnesses said he had run up the mountain and had climbed a fence at the top, when he slipped down headfirst. The man then ran into some boulders and hit his head again, according to witnesses.\nFolio said the man was transported in stable condition to the trauma center at HonorHealth Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center, where he remained hospitalized Sunday afternoon.\nExtra personnel at the event allowed staff medics to reach the injured man within one minute of the call, Folio said. In total, crews received 50 calls for service Saturday, a day when the event saw record-breaking crowds of about 209,000 attendees, he added.\nA fire crew rescues an intoxicated man who fell 15 feet at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.
