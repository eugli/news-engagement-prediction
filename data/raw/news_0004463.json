So before he could close up, he had to go and buy some locks.\nMr Alshabbi is one of thousands of Yemeni grocers holding a shutdown in protest against President Donald Trump's far-reaching US entry ban.\nThe closures started at noon (17:00 GMT) and are set to last eight hours.\nYemen is one of the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by Mr Trump's immigration crackdown, the others being Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria.\nTwitter staff give $1m to Trump battle US travel ban: Why these seven countries? Will Trump's ban affect the fight against IS? Organisers said about 6,000 of New York's bodegas and grocery stores are owned by Yemenis. At least 1,000 were expected to join the shutdown.\nA Facebook event page set up for the strike explained: \"This shutdown...will be a public show of the vital role these grocers and their families play in New York's economic and social fabric.\n\"During this period, grocery store owners will spend time with their families and loved ones to support each other.\"\nAn explanatory sign hangs in the window of a closed bodega in Brooklyn \"We want to send the message that we're here,\" said Sulaiman Alaodyi, a 24-year-old cashier at the Best and Tasty deli in the Bronx.\nThe bodega where he works is normally open round the clock. This was the first time it had closed in nine months of trading.\n\"We're going to go out and support all our brothers and sisters who are detained in airports and in other countries that can't get back,\" Mr Alaodyi said.\n\"This is just not fair.\"\n'United immigrants of America' Hundreds of Yemeni Americans braved the winter chill to rally outside Brooklyn's city hall as the shutdown continued.\nShoulder to shoulder, they crammed onto the building's steps waving a sea of American flags, carrying signs with slogans like, \"United immigrants of America\" and \"Hate Will Never Make US Great\".\n\"We stand here for justice, for dignity,\" said Yousef al-Baadani, 31, who works in a bodega in Queens.\nThe flags of Yemen and America flew together as the protesters sent a message of unity Bodega owner: \"If we lose freedom, we lose everything.\" Some of the bodega owners are American citizens, like Mr Alshabbi. Some have relatives applying for US residency, whose visa applications are now on hold.\nFor most, visits to family have just become impossible as they face being refused re-entry to the US if they travel to Yemen.\n\"This is our country. We have nowhere else to go,\" Mr Alshabbi told Buzzfeed .\nHe said the shutdown was a show of support for those now trapped in Yemen.\n\"This is the only thing we can do for them.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TalalNAnsari/status/827195557571657729", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1792162054368070/", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5913/production/_93930822_brooklyn3.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15C4A/production/_93926198_bodega.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0AF3/production/_93930820_brooklyn.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:26:45.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
