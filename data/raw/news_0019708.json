However, it has come to our attention that one of the characters has the name ‘Wildo the D**do’ and this has, I am sure you can understand, raised some concerns with us. \nOn further discussion, none of the children said they knew what it meant, but were aware that it was an inappropriate word to be using. One of the children said they picked up the word on the playground, so we will be following this up further and dealing with accordingly. \nI hope you can appreciate the reason I am informing you of this matter and please do not hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss it further.” Bride's search for great grandmother's wedding dress \nAnd while the note does acknowledge that playing make-believe “is an imaginative and creative pastime and causes no harm,” the school clearly took issue with the imaginary character’s name: ‘Wildo the D**do.’ \nIt didn’t take long for the note to go viral. It was retweeted nearly 4,000 times in just two days. \nIn a follow-up tweet (before making his Twitter account private), Hunt revealed that he turned down interview requests by journalists eager to learn more about ‘Wildo the D**do.’ \nIn an interview with The Huffington Post UK, Hunt and his wife said they weren’t too concerned about their son’s silly choice of words. \n“We haven’t sent a reply to the school,” Hunt said. “When we received the letter we struggled to keep a straight face in front of him but we managed it somehow.” \n“He genuinely had no idea what the word meant and was mortified when he found out it wasn’t appropriate.” Share Funniest thing I ever read : Dad shares hilarious note from school about son s imaginary friend - Yahoo7 <p>Sorry, we can't show this content as your browser does not support iframes.</p> Latest From 7News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:05:36.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
