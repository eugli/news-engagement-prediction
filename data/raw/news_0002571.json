After the school's visiting dental program finished the oral surgery, they sent the 9-year-old boy home without any pain medication, according to his mom. \n\"I just don't understand how a school or a company can take it in their hands to do something like this to a child,\" she told WJZ. \"I'm angry about this. I don't think that it should have happened like that.\" \nThe Baltimore, MD, school has not yet commented on the incident, but Shanda acknowledges that she signed a permission slip at the beginning of the school year to allow Michael to receive dental work. However, she was under the impression that this was for routine cleanings, not oral surgeries. \nThis left her child unprepared for these extractions and his mom without the option of getting a second opinion or being there to comfort the third grader. Shanda also stated that Michael already had a scheduled appointment with a family dentist for later in the week and is outraged that the school didn't even bother to call her. \nTo make matters worse, the extractions took so long that Michael missed his bus and had to walk the mile from school to his home. \"He walked home alone after having three teeth extracted from his mouth. He could have fallen over,\" Shanda said. Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:29:40.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
