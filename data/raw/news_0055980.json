Credit: Route Plan Roll \nSee a full-size version of the map here . \n“The main thing when you’re looking at something like Google Maps is how much the main roads jump out at you,” Dermot Hanney told Telegraph Travel. \n“But when you’re planning a bike ride, these traditional roads may not be the best routes for people to cycle on. \n“I wanted to create map where the cycle routes stood out – trying to apply mapping simplification to cycling, rather than just road or rail. There’s been a lot of new infrastructure in the past few years, too, and I was trying to consolidate that.” dutch reach How opening your car door like the Dutch could save lives \nHenney, who lives in London and is a transport planner by trade but produces the maps in his own time, said that he wanted people to be able to see bike-friendly routes that might otherwise disappear among the traffic. \nThe different colours indicate the status of the roads – for example, a Cycle Superhighway, a local road or part of the Quietway network. Lines are then styled according to how much protection they offer cyclists. Parks and the cycle hire zone are also shown. \nBlackfriars Bridge, a key cycling junction, where two Cycle Superhighways meet, is used as the map’s epicentre.

London Underground: alternative tube maps \nNational cycling charity, Sustrans, instrumental in developing Quietways routes, also has maps of the city. Nicholas Sanderson is its senior policy officer for London. \n“This is a useful map because it shows the whole of London, so you get this overview of which places link up,” he said. “If you were in Marylebone and wanted to get to Blackfriars, you could see there is a decent cycle route.” \nSanderson said that generally cyclists should get an understanding of their basic route, then follow more detailed maps as well as a sat nav app on their phone. \n“This is a nice addition to the more detailed maps. It also shows that there’s still a lot to do.” Watch | Car caught driving down dedicated cycle lane in London 00:19", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:26:20.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
