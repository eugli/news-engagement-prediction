In New York late last week to announce “The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg,” his new retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago , Murakami appeared in front of the assembled crowd at NeueHouse wearing a plush octopus crown and dazzling technicolor suit. Murakami explained that it helped “cover for” his language barrier, a funny touch for an artist who has, over his 30-year-plus career, developed a knack for communicating with collectors, museum-goers, designers, celebrities, and consumers the world over. \nFew artists rival Murakami’s multidisciplinary range or reach. His often-playful paintings and sculptures currently command astronomical prices at auction, while at the same time his distinctive “superflat” style has become a ubiquitous and desirable pop-cultural aesthetic (see: the album art for Kanye West’s 2007 album “Graduation”). You’ve probably also seen his playful cast of anime-inspired characters in one of his many fashion collaborations, like his limited-edition Vans or, most famously, Louis Vuitton x Murakami. That collaboration between Marc Jacobs and Murakami—where the artist re-worked Vuitton’s iconic monogram print on bags and accessories—shook the art world when it was sold at the Brooklyn Museum in 2008, and has reached peak grail status after being discontinued two years ago. The new exhibition, opening in June, spans Murakami’s entire career, including moody early works and two new paintings reminiscent of his Kanye-era work. Murakami has never been one to shy away from speaking his mind about the art and fashion world, and he did not disappoint when we sat down with him on Friday. (And yes, he was still dressed like an octopus.) \nTell me about your amazing outfit. Among my audience there are sneaker fans and sci-fi fans who are not a normal art audience, so for those people I don’t want a really lengthy explanation, I just want one photo to show Oh he’s doing an event or a show . So that’s why I’m doing this cosplay. \nAs the most prolific collaborator with Louis Vuitton, do you feel you laid the groundwork for the Supreme x Louis Vuitton line? I don’t think it was me, I think it was Marc Jacobs doing a collaboration with Steven Sprouse . That’s when the gate opened for these kinds of collaborations. \nYou mentioned that your collaboration with Louis Vuitton [under Marc Jacobs’s creative direction] came about by coincidence. Right, just around that time I was doing a show in Paris at the Cartier Foundation, so Marc Jacobs saw the show and then contacted me. Probably it wasn’t that he was thinking about me for a long time and then approached me, but just that he was thinking about a broad idea and then saw the show in Paris, and that’s probably why he contacted me. \nI’m curious if you still keep in touch with Marc, Kanye, and Pharrell. Yes, the relationship is maintained in its own way in each case. With Pharrell we’ve been working together for a long time, just last year in November I worked with him on Complexcon, and then also aside from my relationship Pharrell has been working with [my gallery] Kaikai Kiki artist Mister, and that’s been a continuous collaborative project. As for Kanye, if I have a show somewhere he will go see it and then have a one-line message saying, Oh this is fresh! \nWhat do you find so interesting about the sneakerhead subculture? One of the key moments was when A Bathing Ape opened a store in New York, and it was really explosively well-received, which was interesting because it wasn’t doing really well in Japan, it was just so-so. They released a sneaker and there was a long line to buy the sneaker, and it was a very shocking phenomenon, that kind of reaction. And I think one of the achievements of BAPE was that they created fashion in more of a toy concept, something more approachable, it had nothing to do with the Paris mode and that kind of high fashion. But then if you just look at the past five years or so, there’s a real focus on sneakers more than what you’re wearing on the rest of your body, this is not particularly coming from Japan but rather from young people in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, which maybe has something to do with skateboard culture. It’s really a surprising focus, but that’s just how the fashion trend is going. And when I collaborated with Vans two years ago was really surprised by the strong reaction I got, and it was around that time in Paris that Kanye had released Adidas Yeezy collaboration, and it was during men’s fashion week, and Instagram posts for both my Vans shoes and his Yeezy shoes were competing and competing. The focus within fashion is of course constantly changing, and right now it’s the sneaker, and for some reason I ended up getting involved in that, and I’m still wondering what that means. It’s not like I’m strategically involved in it with some vision of what I want to do, it’s just more like I’m involved in it by default. I’m continuing to communicate with the kids and the audience for sneakers, and I’m inspired by them. \nI read somewhere that your Vans collab came around because you mentioned you wanted to do it in an interview. What do you want your next fashion collaboration to be? I tend to be a little bit passive in terms of doing these kinds of projects, so I don’t actually have active desire or idea right now, but I love the collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Supreme, so I want to put my own character or something on that bag. Or I just want to have that bag. \nLouis Vuitton x Supreme x Murakami would be incredible. \n[Laughs.] \nAs the art market gets increasingly top heavy, with famous artists commanding higher prices, it’s good for these artists and their galleries, but do you think this affects creative expression? There’s something strange or mysterious about this in the world of making things, or the creative world. You can see this effect very clearly in the musical world with musicians’ careers and stuff like that. If someone makes a debut and there’s an instant hit, all the audience and the recipients of the production the team behind the musician are all into pushing the career and selling, so maybe for two years from the debut that’s the time when the best material and work come out. After those two years things kind of calm down and you’re relaxed a little bit, and then the next boom comes and maybe you’re forgotten. So that happens a lot in the creative career. But if an artist, whether it’s a musician or a visual artist, if they kept on creating and kept on producing and pushing through the time when the next boom has come and you’re almost forgotten, then you sort of approach a level of purity and clarity in your work. And if someone can keep on doing that, then in 10 years time maybe you have another boom or time of recognition. \nIn general, fine art people perceive someone just sitting down and focusing on creativity and production as really good, and if there’s a big boom or too much hype around something it seems like, Oh it’s too commercial , but in fact from the creative side to be pushed to that kind of chaotic level with the boom— when you have to keep producing and you don’t even know what you’re doing, what you’re creating—in that state sometimes you can achieve that purity that’s otherwise not possible, even though seen from the outside it’s too commercial or too hyped up, it’s actually great for the person who’s creating because you can achieve that level or purity or clarity only when you’re pushed in that way. \nSo are you saying that in this hyper-commercial art world, real purity of vision or purpose is rewarded more than marketability? Of course, the most frightening thing is the gallery will just cut you off if your work doesn’t sell, so of course you have to keep producing work that’ll sell—that’s the difficult part. \nI know you yourself are a big art collector, what have you been excited by lately? \nWhat set me off when I first started collecting was when my own work sold for almost $16 million at Sotheby’s. I really didn’t understand what it meant—of course I understood the existence of the secondary market and how the auction works, I understood that logic, but I didn’t understand the reality and what it really meant for my work to have that kind of price. It was around that time I had moved to Gagosian, and I was seeing artists younger than myself their prices rising even more rapidly than my piece, and I wanted to know what it feels like to buy such works, so in a sense it was an experiment at first. I was young and wanted to know what the collectors felt like when they bought my work. So in that kind of experimental feeling I bought works that were really expensive, and two years later maybe they were gone and the artists were gone from the scene and the prices had gone down maybe it was only a twentieth of what I paid for, so you’d think oh, I lost out on that. But when that happened if I felt really depressed about it, then it probably meant the work itself didn’t mean much to me. But for the works that I felt like it wasn’t too bad even when the price went down, that meant the work itself had some real importance to me. So in experiencing that I started thinking about how to become the artist whose prices didn’t matter but still had meaning for the collectors. So then it became an exercise in how to become that artist and how to create that kind of work. But then I went on collecting and I became addicted to it and buying itself became a pleasure, but at first it started as experiment and exercise. \nYou’re more popular in America than Japan, and your work is frequently concerned with topics like nuclear proliferation. Are you planning to address America’s current political situation? So I think there’s a lot of very muddy things behind the realistic situation of the world. My own belief is that rather than getting involved in trying to change the reality of social-political things, creators can be involved in and express in different ways and be meaningful in different ways, so for me it’s important to leave messages to people of the future and to be engaged with the people now. It’s almost like looking at [the Netflix show] House of Cards , it’s like a much worse case of House of Cards now is the reality, so it’s almost like the creators of those show have predicted the future, and looking at House of Cards it’s possible that the people in power would like to instigate a huge disastrous war in order to hold onto power and so things might go that way too. But the connection between real society and the creators doesn’t necessarily have to be direct, and there could be many layers of filters that could be influencing in different ways, so my personal belief is that creators can’t directly change the reality. So what I want to do is leave something like Goya’s painting where you can see it and know in an instant what the reality of that time might have been like. So I think that’s what I can do as a creator. EDITOR’S PICK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:50:39.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
