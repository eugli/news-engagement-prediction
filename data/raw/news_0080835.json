It also touchingly told her younger sister that “being you was enough”. It said: \"My darling Tara, I hope you know how much we miss you. From the moment you were born we were a family of five, but now we are four and that just isn’t right. \n“I hope you’re aware of all the lovely things people have written about you, and that you are touched, because you never believed you lit up a room or made people feel special, but you did. You really did. I hope that you are resting, because you found life hard and now it is done.
