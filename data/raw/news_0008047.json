Questions mount over botched Yemen raid approved by Trump Read more \nThe new administration has faced sustained backlash over an order which suspends the country’s refugee program and temporarily bars entry to the US to people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n“The world is in trouble – but we’re going to straighten it out, OK?” Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast, gesturing his hands for emphasis. \n“That’s what I do. I fix things. We’re going to straighten it out. Believe me. When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having – don’t worry about it. Just don’t worry about it. They’re tough. We have to be tough, it’s time we’re going to be a little bit tough, folks. We’re taken advantage by every nation in the world, virtually. It’s not going to happen anymore.” \nThe breakfast came hours after news reports detailed an extraordinary phone call between Trump and the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, an ally of the US, which was abruptly ended by Trump. The president reportedly bragged about the size of his electoral victory – despite losing the popular vote – but grew cross when Turnbull asserted that the US should honor an agreement struck by Barack Obama to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center . \nIt also emerged on Wednesday that Trump had apparently threatened to send troops into Mexico to stop the “bad hombres down there” unless the country did a better job of controlling drug trafficking, in a call with Enrique Peña Nieto, the Mexican president. Peña Nieto recently canceled a meeting with Trump amid a row over whether his country would pay for the wall along the countries’ shared border. \nDuring his speech Thursday morning, Trump painted a vision of a world in chaos, scarred by “unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion”. He spoke of the brutalization of “peace-loving Muslims”, the “threats of extermination” against the Jewish people and a “genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads – not since the Middle Ages have we seen that”. \nTrump also said that the administration was days away from initiating what he has called an “ extreme vetting ” system for immigrants and refugees, which he said would “ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination”. Steve Bannon: the strategist behind Trump’s travel ban \n“We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values,” Trump said. \nThe US has one of the longest and most rigorous vetting processes for refugees in the western world. It can take up to two years for refugees to be resettled in the country and it is unclear how the administration intends to expand this process. Appease or oppose? How the world's nations are reacting to Trump Read more \nTrump promised to “get rid of and totally destroy” the so-called Johnson amendment, a provision prohibiting tax-exempt organizations such as churches from publicly endorsing political candidates. He repeatedly pledged to repeal the amendment during his campaign, joking: “I figure it’s the only way I’m getting to heaven.” \nTrump did not announce an executive order expanding “religious freedom”, which some had expected him to do. On Wednesday night, the Investigative Fund and the Nation published what they said was a leaked draft proposal of the order, which could have allowed LGBTQ employees to be fired or refused service by individuals or companies professing a moral objection. \nThe audience at the prayer breakfast included Vice-President Mike Pence, who Trump praised as a “12” on a scale of 10; faith leaders from around the country; members of Congress; and two foreign dignitaries, King Abdullah of Jordan and Samy Badibanga, the prime minister of Congo. \nTrump was introduced by Mark Burnett, producer of The Apprentice, who flattered the president by attributing the source of inspiration for his successful career to Trump’s book The Art of the Deal. \nWhen it was Trump’s turn at the podium, he couldn’t resist the opportunity to boast about the reality show’s success during his time as host – and taunt his replacement, former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump v Arnie: president starts beef with movie star over ratings \n“And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can, for those ratings,” Trump said, drawing laughs after saying the show “went down the tubes” once he left. \nIn a video posted on Twitter soon after the president’s remarks, Schwarzenegger suggested the pair should switch jobs: “You take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, then people can finally sleep comfortably again.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:56:14.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
