Death has no power over us.” \nIn the photos, Monyeki holds the plastic bottle aloft, declaring “life from above upon the water mixed with Rattex; and spoke nourishment unto bodies and healing unto the sick”. \nPicture: Facebook \nAccording to the Facebook posts, after the pastor took a sip, “a multitude of congregants voluntarily ran to the front to have a drink of the deadly poison”. \nNyaope is typically made from low-grade heroin dagga rat poison and detergents containing chlorine and ammonia. \nGrace Living Hope Ministries have not responded to media queries yet. \nMonyeki is not the first pastor to feed life-threatening substances to his congregants to prove their faith. \nIn December, the Limpopo High Court granted an interdict against Lethebo Rabalago, who used Doom to cure the ills of his flock.
