McDermott, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound senior guard-forward, has played a huge role in the Centurions’ success, averaging 20 points a game. This comes after a junior season in which McDermott averaged only 11. McDermott is a two-sport standout. In baseball, he is a pitcher-outfielder who helped Greensburg C.C. make it to a WPIAL title game the past two seasons, winning once. McDermott has signed to play baseball at Seton Hill. \nWhy so much more scoring from you this season? I think it’s just the way the offense works. I like getting out and running, and our fastbreak is the main part of our offense. Getting in better shape was key, too. But I think I’m looking to attack more often on offense and just looking to score more. \nBe honest. Did you guys really think you’d be unbeaten at this time of year? We have high expectations every year. But being undefeated is pretty surreal. \nAnything at all that has been key to this perfect run? From the beginning of the year, I think we all bought into the program and we have great team chemistry. We have four senior starters who have been playing together since our freshman year and our sophomore point guard, Asa Klimchock, has fit right in. We’ve all trusted the coaching staff and I think that’s big. You have to build some bonds with each other. \nDo you really know how good you guys are yet? We know we’re good, but we have goals to be even better. \nWho is the best basketball-baseball athlete you ever heard of? That’s tough, but I’d say Bo Jackson. \nYou know who he is, huh? I know a little sports history here and there. \nThoughts on Andrew McCutchen to right field? I’m all for it. It’s a sign of a team player. Plus, Starling Marte has won a Gold Glove. So it seems like an obvious move. \nLike or dislike this Super Bowl? The Patriots winning is not my favorite, but you have to really respect Tom Brady. \nPeople might be surprised to know ... I used to have a buzzcut all the time. Now I’ve let my hair grow. — By Mike White Daeja Quick, Cornell Last week: Quick scored a game-high 20 points to lead Cornell to a 56-48 win against Quigley Catholic, ending the Spartans’ 66-game section winning streak. Monday, Quick scored 22 points to help Cornell claim a share of its first section title by beating Sewickley Academy, 45-34. \nCheck this out: Quick, a 5-foot-5 senior guard, is the leading scorer in Class 1A and ranks among the top scorers in the WPIAL with 22.5 points per game. She’s also a menace defensively, averaging 7.1 steals a game. She has four double-doubles and had her first triple-double (16 points, 10 steals, 10 assists) a few weeks ago. Quick began her career at Moon before transferring to Cornell midway through her junior year. She surpassed 1,000 career points last month. \nYour last name is Quick. Quickness is one of your greatest assets, too, right? Essentially, because our team is based on speed. That’s just the game we play. We use speed to win games. \nWhat does it mean to win the section title? It means so much to our program and our school because every year we break history. This year it means the most because we worked so hard and the first day of practice we said our goal was to get a banner in our gym finally. \nOne reason your team can win a WPIAL title? We just want it. We’re working hard for it. We have experience. We want to be the team to hang a WPIAL banner in the gym and have a medal around our neck. It’s about desire and hard work. \nYou score the winning points in the WPIAL championship. How would you want to score them? I’m really not a flashy person. If it’s a free throw, that’s great. If it’s a 3-pointer, that’s great. Whatever it takes. \nBest player you have faced this season? [Winchester Thurston’s] Gia Thorpe. \nDid you watch the Super Bowl? Yes. \nHappy with the outcome? I don’t watch much football. I only watch the Super Bowl. I like the underdog more than the team that wins all the time. But I like how the Patriots fought back and won. It was an amazing comeback. \nTom Brady is … a hard worker. \nOne movie you would recommend people watch? My favorite movie is Love and Basketball. — By Brad Everett", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:50:58.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
