Former Obama adviser David Axelrod declared, “No other president would have described the media as ‘the enemy of the people.’ ” \nNo, not the media, just his Republican political opponents. \nAxelrod seems to have forgotten that, back in 2010, his former boss let slip this telling insight into how he viewed his political adversaries: “We’re gonna punish our enemies, and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us.” \nFew on the left compared Barack Obama to Stalin or Mao when he declared his fellow Americans who disagree with him to be “enemies.” (Obama later apologized for his choice of words.) \nThere was also a notable absence of outrage when, during the first Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton was asked “Which enemy are you most proud of?” and she replied, “Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians? Probably the Republicans.” \nClinton didn’t compare her Republican opponents to generic “enemies,” she compared them to an actual enemy. She compared them to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, a regime that took scores of US diplomats hostage for 444 days and is responsible for countless terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Americans. \nIt was not the first time Clinton did it. \nIn August 2015, she compared pro-life Republicans to our terrorist enemies: “Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don’t want to live in the modern world, but it’s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:14:32.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
