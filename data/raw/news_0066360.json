In exchange, Bills coached the company on how to win the contract, orchestrated key votes and even worked to sabotage competitors vying for the contract. \nBills retired in 2011 as the No. 2 person at the city's Transportation Department, was convicted last year at a federal trial and is serving a 10-year prison term. Also sentenced to prison time were former Redflex CEO Karen Finley and a Redflex consultant in Chicago, Martin O'Malley, who acted as Bills' bagman. \nAfter Emanuel moved to fire Redflex, he allowed the company to manage the lucrative ticketing program for more than a year while a new vendor was selected. The program is now run by Conduent, a Xerox subsidiary whose contract runs through October 2018 with the option of three, two-year extensions. Throughout the scandal, the cameras never missed a day. \nEarlier this month, the city and Redflex reached a $20 million settlement over a lawsuit filed by the city seeking up to three times the $120 million in fees Redflex collected for its management of the program over a decade. \nThe company will pay the city in installments through 2023.The first payment of $5 million is due late next month, according to the agreement. The city expects to receive $10 million of the settlement during the current budget year, but the Emanuel administration hasn't said how the money will be spent. \nThe lawsuit had alleged breach of contract, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment and payment of kickbacks in connection with city contracts. The bribery scheme helped Redflex build its Chicago program into the largest automated traffic enforcement program in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:10:48.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
