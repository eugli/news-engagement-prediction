We'll know soon enough if Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast can match the Best Picture nomination earned by its animated counterpart in 1992. And the rest of my bizarrely early guesses are attached to directing talent like Kathryn Bigelow, Alexander Payne, Darren Aronofsky and Paul Thomas Anderson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:20:37.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
