'Tough life' leading up to attack \nMickelo's defence lawyer Mal Harrison said his client was the father of four children and had faced a tough life, where he encountered violence, substance abuse, homelessness and learning difficulties. \nMickelo suffered lung and liver injuries during the shooting and now had a 30-centimetre scar from surgery, Mr Harrison said. \n\"He was born, almost doomed to fail from the date of birth,\" he said. \nProsecutor Dejana Kovac said Senior Constable Jarman suffered \"daily psychological issues\" and had serious arm injuries which still affected him. \nIn her victim impact statement, Senior Constable Schofield said the incident left her deeply traumatised. \n\"I find it hard to enjoy social activities that I used to find myself interested in,\" Senior Constable Schofield said during her victim impact statement. \n\"Still to this day I have nightmares at least twice a week of my firearm not working or my partner being injured.\" Officers praised for bravery \nJudge Anthony Rafter said police had behaved \"bravely and courageously\" while arresting Mickelo. \n\"This was lawful force employed by a police officer,\" he said, regarding the shooting. \n\"Police officers serve the community, they perform an important daily function. \n\"They were doing their job, they certainly did not deserve to be treated the way that you treated them.\" \nMickelo will not be eligible for parole until two years and three months of his sentence has been served.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:54:57.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
