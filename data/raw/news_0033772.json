I've got to hand it out to them because they just did such a job,\" he said. \n\"And they worked tirelessly I can tell you â€” putting them into the boat and then taking them out about 500 metres to the shore of the lake, and then back they go again. \n\"They nearly tipped the boat over a couple of times, and of course these young blokes think it's a hell of a joke, they think it's good fun.\" \nThe inventive sheep rescue began after Mr Grant noticed 200 of his sheep were stranded on an island on the edge of an overflowing lake on his property. External Link: Floods in Western Australia's south Dinghy only way to save sheep \nMr Grant said they initially tried walking the sheep through the water, but the animals would not budge. \nIt was then that his son Regan called in a crew to help. \nTo herd the sheep, the group made makeshift yards out of floating timber and dead trees lying on the property. \nMr Grant said there were times where the recuse seemed ambitious. \n\"There was a little bit [of water] pooling in on the sides so they had to bail,\" he said. \n\"We found a bucket so they had to bail continuously, because when you put the sheep in, the water from their wool drains out. \n\"You had to hope [the driver of the jet ski] didn't throw the guys out of the dinghy, because he nearly did once but they were having a hell of a time, the young blokes, they're good fun.\" Farmer swims to save cattle \nThe unique sheep rescue was not the only effort put in to save livestock from drowning. \nDunn Rock farmer Doug Giles said he had spent the last few days swimming out to save his cattle, who were up to their necks in water. \nHe said it had been exhausting, but it had to be done and was no easy feat. \n\"At the end of the day, you sit here and you watch them drown or you give it a go yourself, and that's what we did,\" he said.

(Supplied) \n\"I swam across probably 100 metres of water with 30-year-old boogie board and then walked right round, about 3.5 kilometres, and came in above the cattle that I could see. \n\"The gate was underwater, totally underwater, so I could walk until then but was armpit height. I know I'm short but it was still pretty deep.\" \nHe said he was then able to assist the cattle to higher ground. \n\"The cows were just holding their heads above water,\" he said. \n\"There were meant to be calves there but there was only one left alive and he actually had his front legs and his head up on his mum. \n\"That's the only way that heifer survived.\" \nBut the rescue did not end there. \nWhen water engulfed the \"higher ground\", Mr Giles had to do it all over again on Tuesday but luckily, by that point his friend with a kayak had offered to help. \nMr Giles said he was not too concerned about his own safety. \n\"I knew the depth [and] the water wasn't actually flowing a strong current when I went across,\" he said. \n\"I did have a backpack on with all my clothes and a two-way [radio] and everything, and that worked as a buoyance vest for me.\" \nThe WA Government's Office of Emergency Management and the Australian Government's Attorney General's Department have advised that flooding in large parts of the state have been declared eligible disasters under the Western Australia Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:01:14.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
