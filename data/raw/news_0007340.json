Coming to the Super Bowl just the way you’d expect. Bringing the fire of a thousand supernovae. I’ve been feeling pretty good about her honey’s chances to make history anyway. But seeing this, I don’t see how the game can even be close. \nHaving a custom made Swarovski crystal hoodie has to be like carrying the Ark of the Covenant. Something that’s going to put the power of a wrathful, Old Testament Hebrew God at your disposal. The Bible speaks of the Swarovski hoodie leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions. An army which carries the crystal hoodie before it… is invincible. When she peels off her jacket and unleashes the light of this thing, faces are going to melt. And in her case, it wouldn’t be the first time. The Patriots by a million. \nDec 16, 2016 at 1:43pm PST Jerry Thornton |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:29:40.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
