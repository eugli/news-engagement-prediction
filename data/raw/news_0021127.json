It was a very, very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well and I think that we'll also be very much of a benefit to Japan,\" Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with the visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \nThe two leaders, he noted, \"had a very, very good talk last night\" and discussed a lot of subject. \"It was a long talk and we are working on that (South China Sea) as we speak. We have conversations with various representatives of China,\" \nTrump said responding to a question on China's aggressive behaviour in South China Sea. \n\"I believe that, that will all work out very well for everybody, China, Japan, the US and everybody in the region,\" he said. \nResponding to a question on Chinese currency devaluations, Trump said he had been complaining about that for a long time. \n\"I believe that we will all eventually and probably, very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think, we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it's fair,\" he said. \n\"That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things. We will be on that field and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country. But it has to be fair and we will make it fair,\" Trump said. \nTrump said the US is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now by a lot when it comes to trade. \n\"A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you'll be seeing in the not-too-distant future,\" he said, adding that ‘his administration will have an incentive-based policy’. \nThe White House is working with Congress on this issue, he said. \n\"We're also working very much, and this has a lot to do with business, on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much reduced price both to the people receiving the health care,\" he said, adding that Obamacare was a total and complete disaster. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:26:17.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
