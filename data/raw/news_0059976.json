ESPN's Adam Schefter provided the full list of 32 compensation picks awarded by the NFL: Adam Schefter @AdamSchefter NFL awarded compensatory draft picks early this year. Here's the full list of extra picks for teams: https://t.co/0SAAd7qet2 2/24/2017, 8:18:31 PM The 32 compensatory picks issued are split among 16 teams. The Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs earned the most selections with four apiece. Per the official release from NFL Communications , the awarding of compensatory picks is determined using a \" formula based on salary, playing time and postseason honors.\" As a result of the NFL's punishment handed down in December due to head coach Ben McAdoo's use of a walkie-talkie, the New York Giants' fourth-round selection moves down from pick No. 130 overall to No. 140. The Los Angeles Rams' comp pick at No. 141 includes an asterisk to indicate the Giants' move to the pick preceding the Rams' selection. This is also the first year in which compensatory picks are eligible to be traded, likely leading to more activity on the second and third days of the draft as teams lock in on those hidden gems to find under-the-radar contributors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:14:05.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
