PHOTO: REUTERS \nMinutes after Punjab government announced holding the Pakistan Super League final in Lahore on March 5, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan opposed the decision, terming it “madness”. \n“God forbid, if any blast takes place in Lahore, there will be no cricket in Pakistan in the next 10 years,” he told Nadeem Malik on SAMAA TV . \n“This is madness considering the situation here” he said, referring to the series of bomb blasts which rocked Pakistan. “What’s the point of holding the PSL final in Lahore? It isn’t even an international match.” \nIt’s final. PSL final to be held in Lahore \nThe PTI leader added, “In my view, it is a terrible idea. We want to hold this match by calling in army and blocking roads and there will be high security. This will not send a good message.” \nThe decision to hold the final fixture in the Punjab capital was put on a hold following a string of blasts hit the country, particularly Lahore, killing over 100 people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:10:18.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
