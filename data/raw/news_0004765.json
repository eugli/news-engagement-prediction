I’m very, very upset,” said Anne Kelly, a teacher with the Dartmouth EAL program. \nThe closure of the programs is a result of changes to how they are funded by Immigration, Refugees and Services Canada, according to the Halifax Regional School Board (HRSB) which facilitates the EAL program. The closures are expected to impact 40 teachers and 350 students. \n“They told us this school is going to close the end of March and so it was really surprising for us, all of the students,” said Jassem Shahryari, who moved to Halifax from Dubai in 2012. \nBoth Shahryari and his wife now participate in classes at the Dartmouth EAL school. \nMariana Vidal (right) is upset over the closure of her EAL program.

She said the program has became a central part of her life. \n“It’s like our family, like our sisters, like brothers and the teachers for us is like our parents because some students don’t have a family here,” Vidal said. Changes expected \nThe EAL programs have been in operation for nearly three decades. \nAccording to HRSB, the goal of the programs is to help facilitate the cultural, social and economic integration of immigrants and refugees to Canada through the development of their English language skills. \nHRSB spokesperson Doug Hadley told Global News they were aware changes were coming. \n“They made it somewhat clear to us when we were asking questions in the last few months that they’re looking to fund multi-service agencies, so those agencies that can support newcomers, not only with language instruction but also in other areas like employment and housing,” said HRSB spokesperson Doug Hadley. ISANS to expand their language programs \nThe Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia (ISANS) is one of those multi-service agencies that government is looking to fund. The organization confirmed they will be expanding their language programs beginning April 1. \nGerry Mills, director of operations for ISANS, said they are currently working with the HRSB to accommodate the language needs of the students who may make the move from the EAL programs. \n“The most important thing right now is to make sure that clients’ language training isn’t interrupted,” she said. \nISANS expects to add an additional 20 language classes to deal with an influx of students. (Credit: Natasha Pace/Global News) Natasha Pace/Global News \nISANS currently offers between 35 to 40 language classes. They expect to add an additional 20 classes to deal with the influx of expected new students. \n“In the long haul, a lot of the people that we’re serving with this expansion will be Syrian refugees and of course we have a lot of Syrian refugees right now.” 40 teachers expected to lose their jobs \nWhile the students will have the option to move to a new language program at ISANS, the teachers are uncertain what their future holds. \n“We were told without a lot of warning that we’ve lost our jobs, ” Kelly said. \n“For me, even more so, is the loss of the community of our school. Ever since I’ve been here for 23 years, we have built this school to be a community and to be a safe place for the students to come and we feel that we are losing that for no, really good reason.” \nREAD MORE: English as an Additional Language classes providing vital skills to Saskatoon newcomers \nBrahim Adderramahmne, who moved to Canada from Africa last year, said the program’s staff were beneficial to his learning. \n“I feel, myself, that I have improved my English very quick due to the experience of our teachers and our staff,” Adderramahmne said. \nTeachers and students are hoping Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada will rethink their decision to close the program. \n“Government think about us because this school is very important for us,” Vidal said. \n“Very important for my life and so many students and the government can’t close this school, please.” Funding change comes on heels of new immigration plan \nThe decision to change the way EAL programs operate comes less than a week after officials from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador announced details of the Atlantic Immigration Pilot. \nWATCH: Atlantic premiers aim to bring 2,000 immigrants to region with pilot program \nThe three year pilot project will see applicants arriving in Canada offered a job from a designated employer and individualized settlement plan for their family. The goal of the program is to bring 2,000 new workers and their families to the Atlantic region in an attempt to retain skilled immigrants. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:17.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
