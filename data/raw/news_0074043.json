Only had personal belongings \nOfficers confirmed that any criminal investigation involving smuggling or crime has been ruled out. \nThey say the man and the woman only had personal belongings in their possession when they were reported to police, who found them in the area of 170th Street and 0 Avenue around 7:20 a.m. PT on Saturday. \nSurrey RCMP says officers deal with illegal crossings at B.C. borders weekly, and issued a release about this one because members of the media happened to be in the area and witnessed the initial arrest. Refugee claims on the rise? \nAccording to the Canada Border Service Agency in January 2017, 72 individuals made refugee claims either at a Pacific region designated port of entry (POE) or a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) inland office. \nThat's 13 more compared to January 2016. \nThe majority of those claims came from people who were from Afghanistan, India, Mexico and China.
