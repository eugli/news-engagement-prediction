Like several other of Oregon’s Saturday Junior Day visitors, Brewer flew to Los Angeles shortly after the Duck gathering to participate in Sunday’s Southern California Under Armour camp. And like the rest of the contingent from Oregon, he performed very well.\nHis solid showing at the UA regional on Sunday will add to a recruiting fire that had just started. In the last week, the 6-foot-4, 295-pound Corvallis high school standout received his first two scholarship offers from Massachusetts and Nevada. His Saturday visit to Eugene to meet Oregon’s new coaching staff was the perfect time for them to put their foot in his recruiting door.\nTom Corno - DSA\n“It was great,” Brewer said of his Junior Day experience. “It was a small group of seven. We all put jerseys on and toured the whole school, it's a super crazy expensive school with the nicest facilities.”\nHis coach/host while in Eugene was offensive coordinator Mario Cristobal.\n“I liked him so much,” said Brewer. “He got to show us some stuff and kind of show us how he coaches, it was great.”\nAt this early point in his recruitment he is not certain how far the Ducks are from an offer.\n“It's honestly hard to say how interested in me they are but I hope there really interested because I'm interested in them,” Brewer admitted.\nDespite being a junior in high school Brewer has already developed a more advanced perspective on the recruiting process and the uncertainties that go with it. In terms of next offers he is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n“I know Ball State said they would offer me if I visited,” said Brewer. “As far as Pac-12 it's hard to say. They all act so interested but at the end of the day I don't know if there interested in offering me or not.”\nWhere the Ducks stand from his perspective is clear.\n“Oregon is definitely one of the top schools recruiting me.”\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lmwkg8j1lukd5q0vulgf)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lmwkg8j1lukd5q0vulgf"], "published": "2017-02-21T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:13:13.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
