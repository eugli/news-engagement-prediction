Ailing DMK supremo M Karunanidhi was not present in the House.\nIn another development, the Panneerselvam camp appointed Semmalai as the party whip in the assembly and sent a letter to the Speaker to this effect.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/832859058105413632", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/floortest?src=hash", "https://t.co/CkMQY9FfQx"], "published": "2017-02-18T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:00:59.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
