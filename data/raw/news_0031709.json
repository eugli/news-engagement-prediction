Not that today’s swan goes to any old supermarket of course. Being the most middle class of birds it is naturally drawn to Waitrose. This one was spotted leaving a branch in Portishead, Somerset – albeit with only a bill (on her face) on this occasion. A couple of weeks ago, two other swans were seen making their way across a pedestrian crossing towards another branch of the supermarket. The swans have been a feature at the town’s Lake Grounds for years and have more recently set up home at a nearby marina – which happens to be easier for the shops. Experts believe the birds have started visiting stores because they have come to link plastic bags with food – mainly because bird lovers feed them with bread from them.
