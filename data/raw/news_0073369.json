What no one predicted was the way in which it happened. \nPresenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway took a long, long pause after opening the envelope, before calling out La La Land . The music played, the cast and crew took to the stage, and we got through four speeches. But a mistake was made. Moonlight actually won. Watch the insane moment things all fell apart \nhttps://twitter.com/GMA/status/836082756157222912 \nThis is just... bananas. I'm hard pressed to think of a bigger screw-up in awards history, even after the great Steve Harvey flub of 2016 . It's a rough break for the La La Land guys, too (never thought I'd be saying THAT), who had to hand back their Oscars almost immediately. \nUp until this moment, this was a fine, pretty benign ceremony. Now, right at the last minute, it'll live in infamy as one of the craziest ever. Congrats, Moonlight . You scared us for a second there. \nUPDATE: In a wild turn, it looks like the presenters were mistakenly reading from the \"Best Actress in a Lead Role\" envelope. Emma Stone won the category for her role in La La Land .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:20:06.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
