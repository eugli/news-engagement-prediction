Hide Caption 37 of 37 struggling to shape policy without a full Cabinet in place and stocked with aides with little White House experience. Shaping policy comes with challenges The roundtables also highlight the campaign mindset that persists in an administration struggling to shape policy without a full Cabinet in place and stocked with aides with little White House experience. \"They've really still got too much campaign in them and not enough governing,\" said a person close to Trump, noting that the lack of a full Cabinet compounds the problem. \"I'm sure the Democrats are doing that to irritate him so he looks like he's irritated. And they're having some success I hate to say.\" Sources close to Trump say the administration is also missing someone to gut check the President and steer him from unnecessary confrontations. It's a void New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had lunch with Trump Tuesday, filled at points throughout the presidential campaign before the relationship between the two men grew strained. By now, everyone has become accustomed to the fact that Trump sleeps only few hours each night. Aides are often alerted that the President is awake by his early morning tweets, ricocheting across the Internet and, often, driving the agenda for the day. He's on the phone with staffers beginning early in the morning, and doesn't usually end his workday until 11 p.m. or midnight, one administration official said. Aides have mapped out a rough schedule for him stretching to nearly mid-March, but what the President could truly use is a change of scenery, according to sources close to Trump. Aides are looking at more opportunities to get him out of Washington, including a visit to South Carolina later this week. Multiple sources close to the White House said the President would prefer to be on the road -- and adding campaign-style rallies to the mix. The trips to Mar-a-Lago provide a bit of an escape -- particularly when they're intertwined with work. This weekend he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there, mingled with the club's members and even popped into a wedding reception in the Grand Ballroom to pose for a photo with the bridesmaids.
