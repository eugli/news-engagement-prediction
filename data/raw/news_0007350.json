Â© Reuters \nSEOUL -- Hanjin Shipping is heading for liquidation after a court decided Thursday to essentially pull the plug on the struggling South Korean container giant, potentially closing the curtains on the company's 40-year history. \nHollowed out \nThe Seoul Central District Court elected to discontinue Hanjin's rehabilitation plan due to the shipper's falling liquidation value and the lack of any turnaround sponsors. The court is set to finalize the bankruptcy decision on Feb. 17 after two weeks to give creditors or other parties a chance to appeal. \nThe bankruptcy proceedings are able to move forward because the court managed to sell off Hanjin's stake in a U.S. terminal, a major creditor told the Nikkei on Thursday. \nHanjin, once the world's seventh- or eighth-largest container shipper, applied for court receivership last August. Ports around the world later refused entry to its fleet, fearing nonpayment for unloading work, which literally set Hanjin's freight business adrift. \nMajor stakeholders Korean Air Lines and Hanjin's founding family, along with creditor Korea Development Bank, sought to restore the supply chain to normal by paying the handling fees. Under a bankruptcy liquidation, those payments will be unrecoverable. \nHanjin sold off its Asia-U.S. routes to South Korea's Samra Midas construction group. Hanjin used to be the fourth-ranked player in that corridor with a 7% market share. The majority of the roughly 140-vessel fleet are chartered ships. The few company-owned ships have been sold off, leaving no notable assets. \nLG Electronics and other major Hanjin clients have switched to other shippers. Thanks to Hanjin's troubles, the supply of container ships has tightened to an extent. Average shipping rates in December between Asia and the U.S. were 15% higher than in July, before Hanjin filed for receivership, data from the Japan Maritime Center shows. \nSome Japanese carriers also picked up Hanjin cargo. That windfall is part of the reason Nippon Yusen 's container business turned a pretax profit in the October-December quarter of 2016. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Kawasaki Kisen also realized smaller losses. \nAnd then there was one... \nHanjin's exit will leave domestic rival Hyundai Merchant Marine virtually unchallenged in the South Korean marine shipping industry. The shipper is taking in 200 Hanjin employees, as well as the equity stakes in American and Spanish terminals. There are also plans to build upon lines to North America and Europe. HMM's cargo load at South Korea's Port of Busan soared 26% in November on the year thanks to business from former Hanjin clients. \nHowever, HMM signed contracts for many of its charter ships back when those deals fetched higher closing prices. The same misstep that ended up dooming Hanjin is also hurting HMM's finances. HMM is busy rationalizing operations under an agreement with creditors, but the company is expected to turn in a sixth straight operating loss for the financial year ended December. \nThe cash-strapped carrier had sought to join the European 2M alliance of A.P. Moller-Maersk and Mediterranean Shipping, but HMM will have to settle for limited participation due to lingering concerns about its corporate health, according to a source from a European marine liner. \nOne South Korean shipping analyst says HMM is in a poor position to boost its competitive advantage, and it will need additional government support to purchase fuel-efficient vessels, among other measures. \nThe government, seeking to preserve South Korea's ocean transport industry, established a state-backed ship-owning company worth 1 trillion won ($872 million) in January. Government-linked financial establishments like Korea Development Bank provided the capital. The new entity is tasked with buying vessels from domestic shipping companies at market prices, then leasing them out at affordable rates. Some say this move is essentially a bailout for HMM. \nAlthough mergers and acquisitions are picking up across the international scene, ailing companies like Hanjin are being left behind to await their eventual demise. Whatever bounce Hanjin's bankruptcy will produce will be limited since the construction of giant container vessels ordered by shippers will be completed this year. Many experts say a real recovery will not come until at least 2018. \nNikkei staff writers Yohei Muramatsu in Tokyo and Takayuki Kato in Stuttgart, Germany, contributed to this story.
