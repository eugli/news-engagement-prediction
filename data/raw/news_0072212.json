He gets two years credit for the time he's already served.\nMORE CRIME NEWS | Child pornography charges laid against Lethbridge teacher MORE CRIME NEWS |  Man found dead inside bullet-riddled vehicle in Crescent Heights", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:00:55.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
