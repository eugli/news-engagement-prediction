Ed Rowe, a Detroit pastor with the Methodist Federation for Social Action. \"If we don't stand up for Muslims, we will be next. ... This is a time for you to step up.\" \nRowe was joined by about 30 other clergy and elected officials at the Islamic House of Wisdom. Dearborn Mayor Jack O'Reilly Jr. and Dearborn Heights Mayor Dan Paletko, whose cities have sizable Arab immigrant populations, also attended the press conference. \nThe orders \"violate the teachings of many of our faiths,\" said the Rev. Fran Hayes of Littlefield Presbyterian Church in Dearborn. \"It's a moral issue. ... How we treat the stranger is central to our faith.\" \nCiting verses from the Bible, Rev. Hayes said \"we are to care for those who are foreigners.\" \nRead more: Syrian refugees worry for future after Trump's order on immigration \n\"We have so much more in common than differences.\" \nThe religious leader of the Islamic House of Wisdom, Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi, who was born in Iran, said Trump's order will hurt many educated immigrants from Iran and the other six nations Trump is restricting immigration from. \n\"It's amazing the absence of common sense,\" Elahi said. He said the executive orders are the \"greatest gift for ISIS...a relief and victory of the terrorists\" because they alienate the U.S. from foreign countries and make it appear hostile. \nImam Mohammad Mardini of the American Moslem Center in Dearborn said the early settlers in the U.S. came to \"enjoy freedom from religious persecution.\" He and others are concerned that the executive orders appear to target Muslims. \nRobert Bruttell of the Interfaith Leadership Council of Metropolitan Detroit said \"we need to stand together. ...We are all called to lift each other up.\" Buy Photo \nMembers of the interfaith community assemble as Pastor Fran Hayes of the Littlefield Presbyterian Church in Dearborn speaks during a press conference Wednesday Feb. 1, 2017 at the Dearborn Heights Islamic House of Wisdom regarding President Trump's order on immigrants. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) \nLocal Jewish groups, including the Michigan Board of Rabbis, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and Jewish Family Services also put out statements this week criticizing Trump's orders. The board of rabbis said in their statement, quoting from Exodus: \"We hold dear the Torahâ€™s frequent reminder that we Jews understand what it is like to be considered the stranger, and thus we hold aloft the teaching, 'And you shall not wrong a stranger, neither shall you oppress them; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.'\" \nDearborn Mayor O'Reilly, whose city is about 42% Arab-Americans, said he's been meeting with Arab-American and Yemeni-American leaders to hear their concerns. O'Reilly said he's concerned about how the orders were suddenly implemented without input from Congress and others. \n\"The people who are being hurt are the honest people,\" immigrants who follow the law, O'Reilly said. \"The rules can't change midstream.\" \nWali Altahif, a Yemeni-American community leader in Dearborn, said Yemeni immigrants are being hurt, especially since there's a war in Yemen that already makes it difficult to connect with family. Yemen is one of the seven nations in the Trump order. \n\"The community is very nervous,\" he said. \nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or 313-223-4792.
