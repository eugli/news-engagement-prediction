miss Manchester United’s Europa League clash with Saint-Etienne on Thursday, manager Jose Mourinho revealed on Wednesday. \nJones has not played since sustaining a foot injury in United’s recent 0-0 draw with Hull City and Mourinho said Rooney and Carrick had “little muscular problems”. \nThe three England internationals missed Wednesday’s pre-match training session at United’s Aon Training Complex west of Manchester. \n“Phil is still recovering from the injury,” Mourinho told reporters ahead of the last 32 first-leg match. \n“Wayne and Carrick I don’t want to say ‘injuries’ because I don’t think we are speaking about injuries. \n“We are speaking about little muscular problems and protection of these problems. \n“So all three are out tomorrow and apart from that everything is right.” media_camera Wayne Rooney. \nMOURINHO DEALS SHAW FRESH SNUB \nLuke Shaw received another setback on Wednesday when Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho revealed he will not play in Thursday’s Europa League game against Saint-Etienne. \nShaw has battled back from a double broken leg suffered last season, but has made just one appearance since November and has not featured in United’s last three match-day squads. \nThe Europa League has provided Shaw, a £30 million ($37.2 million, 35.3 million euros) signing from Southampton in June 2014, with three of his last seven starts. media_camera Luke Shaw. \nBut Mourinho has no intention of giving the 21-year-old England left-back a run-out in Thursday’s last 32 first leg, telling his pre-match press conference: “He’s not playing tomorrow.” Pressed over his reluctance to pick Shaw, Mourinho replied: “Because my team is playing well and I am happy with my back four and I’m going to repeat: (Antonio) Valencia, (Eric) Bailly, (Chris) Smalling, Daley Blind.” \nThe long-term situation for Shaw does not appear positive at Old Trafford and reports have surfaced that Mourinho could be prepared to let him leave the club at the end of the season. \nREUNIONS ABOUND IN EUROPA LEAGUE CLASH \nManchester United’s quest for a trophy treble continues with a meeting against a fallen French giant on Thursday as Saint-Etienne visit Old Trafford in the Europa League’s round of 32. \nAlthough United trail leaders Chelsea by 12 points in the Premier League, they remain on track for glory in both the League Cup, where they have reached the final, and the FA Cup. \nEven one season outside the Champions League is seen as a season too many for a club like United, but although Saint-Etienne last sat at Europe’s top table in 1981, Jose Mourinho remains an admirer. \n“Despite many years without titles, it’s a big club with big tradition,” the United manager told MUTV after the draw was made. \n“It’s the club where Michel Platini, before he went to Italy, did amazingly well in an amazing team that was dominant in France in that period, so it’s a historical club. \n“And (with) the extra curiosity of a beautiful thing, which is two brothers playing against each other.” \nThe brothers in question are United’s record signing Paul Pogba and the Saint-Etienne defender Florentin, who will meet in a professional match for the first time. \nThe pair have spoken of their excitement prior to the game and another player rubbing his hands in anticipation is United’s Anthony Martial, who came through the ranks at Saint-Etienne’s arch rivals Lyon. \n“There was a huge rivalry while I was still at Lyon,” the French forward, whose side are unbeaten in 16 league games, told the United website this week. \n“It was always a highly charged atmosphere and they were usually massive games, the kind all players love to play in. \n“Of course, it would be great if I could score against them again, but I hope we can win the game because that’s the most important thing, then it would be a bonus if I managed to grab a goal.” \nMOURINHO’S SYMPATHY FOR POGBA’S MUM’S ‘IMPOSSIBLE’ CHOICE \nSaint-Etienne’s visit will see United’s record signing Paul Pogba go up against his older brother, Florentin, for the first time in their professional careers. \nMourinho said the sibling rivalry added an extra level of fun to the game, though he sympathised for Pogba’s mother Yeo, who he said hoped the game could be a draw. \n“We spoke about it, but we spoke in a good way, a funny way,” Mourinho told reporters at United’s training ground. \n“It’s a good, nice destiny. I think only Mum Pogba is a little bit in trouble, which is normal!” \nMourinho said while the Pogbas facing off gave the family a dilemma, the game would be a good experience for both brothers. \n“It’s difficult for the lady to choose — it’s not difficult, it’s impossible. I know from Paul that the mum wants a draw, but next week one son will be happy and another one will be sad. \n“For the mum it’s a bit of a problem, but they will enjoy playing against each other. Paul will enjoy it and Florentin the same. I think it’s a good thing.” \nUNDERDOGS HAVE ‘NOTHING TO LOSE’: CAPTAIN \nSaint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin insisted on Wednesday that his team has nothing to lose when they tackle Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Europa League. \nAnd while the centre-back admitted he would have preferred to avoid United so soon in the competition — the last 32 — he said the entire club was excited to be taking on one of Europe’s powerhouses. \n“We would have liked to meet them later, that would have been a good sign for us as it would have meant we’d got through at least one more round,” said Perrin. \n“Initially we said ‘damn’, that’s not the best draw. But we’re playing in Europe to take part in exactly this type of match. \n“They’re a top European club who, not so long ago, were winning the Champions League.” \nPerrin just wants his team to avoid letting the occasion get to them and simply do their best. \n“We’ve got nothing to lose. You have to make the most of these moments, play freely and why not create a surprise? \n“We need to be bold and be ourselves, most of all don’t be shy, don’t be intimidated by the environment and the great players that will line up opposite us.” \nOne such will likely be Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored 14 goals in 13 matches against St Etienne during his four-year spell at Paris Saint-Germain, losing only once, and that on penalties in a cup game. \n“He’s the type of player you dream about facing. It’s always amazing for us defenders to test ourselves against such world class players,” added Perrin. \n“That’s what we all want, always, but at Manchester he’s not the only player of that calibre.” Following Thursday’s first leg, St Etienne will entertain United in the second leg on March 22. \nWITH AFP.
