Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pet hamster trapped down a pipe for three days was saved - after a dad made a tiny ladder so it could make its great escape. \nThe Sykes family feared they would never see Fang again after it got stuck down the pipe. \nThey faced a race against time to free their furry friend. \nAs the hours and days went by they became increasingly desperate to find a way to save Fang and called in help from United Utilities, the RSPCA and emergency drainage company Dyno. Fang the hamster got trapped in a pipe \nBut in the end Fang was saved thanks to the ingenuity of dad Andy. He built a tiny ladder out of some chicken wire so Fang could climb out of the pipe. \nFriendly hamster Fang who is just over six months old was enjoying a run-around in his hamster ball when one of the plastic sides broke away. \nFang seized his opportunity and darted out of the living room while his six-year-old owner Zac Sykes and dad Andy Sykes were watching TV. Andy Sykes rescued the hamster using a ladder made from chicken wire \nMr Sykes, from Chadderton , said: “Out of the corner of my eye I could see him pottering about in his exercise ball. \n“But when I looked again I realised he was in the corner of the kitchen.

I didn’t know how to reach him.” \nThe family have been through hamster hell after Fang then found his way through a gap in the skirting board and burrowed under the house through a hole where the fresh water supply leads into the kitchen. \nMr Sykes called on his father-in-law to assist with his power drill so they could gain access behind the cupboards. \nHe said: “We pulled out the washing machine and went in behind the cupboards. Fang was reunited with Zac, Pixie-Belle and dad Andy Sykes \n“We were using our phones as torches to try and find him but he had disappeared.” \nThe next day Mr Sykes picked up his search behind the cupboards and noticed teeth marks in the black foam surrounding a kitchen pipe. \nHe said: “I looked closer and saw that he had chewed his way down. I knew he had to be there and I began shining by phone and tapping the pipe. \n“Then I saw his head pop up and he was at the bottom scurrying around. \n“I was really excited he was alive because I hadn’t seen him for two days. My son had been tipping food down the hole so he didn’t starve.” \nA rescue mission ensued as the family cut off the top of Fang’s cage to form a ladder. When that failed they tied some old tea towels together to form a rope. Dad Andy Sykes said 'we had to be as creative as possible' \nMr Sykes said: “We had to be as creative as possible.” \nThe family contacted United Utilities and the RSPCA to ask for advice but to no avail. Next they phoned emergency drainage company Dyno who put a camera down the 1.2-metre drop but after 20 minutes they still could not free Fang. \nIn a last-ditch effort – on day three – Mr Sykes came up with the idea of crafting a piece of chicken wire into the shape of a ladder.
