It’s only a little over two minutes long. Get up there and do what I’ve always loved to do: sing for people. And try to take it at that – don’t overthink it.” \nBryan follows this year’s halftime performer Lady Gaga, who belted out “The Star - Spangled Banner” in 2016 . Previously, Idina Menzel, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks and Carrie Underwood each honored America by singing the song at past games.
