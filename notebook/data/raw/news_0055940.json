(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \nSteven Hawthorne, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for a crime he committed at age 17, speaks about his release from Stateville Correctional Center on Jan. 18, 2017. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \nFrom decades-old court cases that began with horrific crimes has emerged a hope, however fragile, among the inmates that a new sentencing hearing will bring about their freedom. Some inmates were as young as 14 when they were arrested, and many have spent more years inside prison than outside. Many have formed a community of sorts, bound together by their crimes and their hope that they can one day atone for them. \nSo far, about 15 men and one woman across the state have had new hearings. Judges have affirmed life sentences for two, Addolfo Davis and Terril Williams. In the other cases, inmates received reduced sentences that already have led to their release or will within a matter of years. \n\"I think there's a growing recognition that children are different and that given the opportunity to grow and change, individuals who commit crimes as children can still contribute in significant and positive ways to the community if given a chance,\" said Heather Renwick, legal director of The Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that aims to end sentences of life without parole for juveniles. \n'Time changes everything' \nExperts agree the small number of cases so far in which life without parole was reaffirmed suggests that judges in Illinois are heeding the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court's ruling that such sentences be handed down only in rare circumstances in which inmates demonstrate \"irreparable corruption.\" \nIt is impossible to know if that trend will continue, and even more difficult to discern a pattern nationally because the three states with the largest juvenile life without parole populations — more than 1,000 inmates are eligible for new sentencing hearings in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Louisiana — are still in the very early stages. \nSeventeen states have banned life sentences for juveniles, although Illinois is not one of them. Renwick expressed concern that prosecutors in some parts of the country, including here in Illinois, continue to seek life without parole sentences across the board. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, in office a few months, has pledged to reform the juvenile justice system and has spoken of taking into account the lives of the onetime juveniles in their resentencing. \nFor decades, judges had no discretion to consider age, home environment or rehabilitative potential at sentencing for juveniles convicted of murder. In Hawthorne's case, in fact, his judge said he believed justice would be better served if he had the option to sentence him to less than natural life. \nHawthorne grew up surrounded by the crime and poverty of the Stateway Gardens public housing development on Chicago's South Side. At 16, he shot and killed two men, including one whom his attorneys argued had preyed on him for years and shot at him the night before the murder, and a second man who was playing chess nearby and was killed by a ricocheting bullet. (Duaa Eldeib) \n\"I have no doubt that by the time you reached a mature age of 40 or 45 or 50 years of age you would no longer represent a threat to the community and the interests of justice in terms of reaching the magnitude of your offense would be well-served,\" Judge Stephen Schiller told Hawthorne at his 1984 sentencing, according to a court transcript. \nSchiller, who retired from the bench in 2004 and now works as a mediator, said in an interview that he believed a life sentence in Hawthorne's case was excessive \n\"He was a kid,\" Schiller said. \"He was 16 years old at the time of the offense, and just housing him for the rest of his life was gratuitous given the circumstances surrounding the offense.\" \nHawthorne was among the state's longest-serving inmates sentenced to life without parole as a juvenile. At his resentencing last year, the family of one of the victims, James Burnett, submitted statements describing the anguish that followed his death and lamenting the hearing that forced them to relive their pain. \n\"The very opportunity the court has determined Mr. Hawthorne is entitled, a second chance, has been denied to my brother,\" wrote Burnett's older brother Renaldo Dixon Sr. \nWith the agreement of attorneys on both sides, the judge resentenced Hawthorne to 68 years in prison. Having served half that time, Hawthorne was paroled last month under the state's good-time credit provisions. \n\"Time changes everything,\" he said. \"When you're young, you think you're indestructible. You think you're smarter than you actually are. You really don't think about the consequences of what you do.\" \nHawthorne said he is no longer quick to react and spends most of his days reading. He amassed a collection of some 300 books while in prison, completed his GED and is working on earning his bachelor's degree in political science and economics. He is studying for the entrance exam to law school in hopes of becoming an attorney.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \nHe recalled reading a poem while incarcerated that explored the concept of a person's legacy. It stirred something within him, he said, and forced him to contemplate what the remainder of his life would look like. He finds himself wrestling with that question still and said it is even more urgent now that he has regained his freedom. \n\"What can I contribute and give back that will outweigh the mistakes that I've made in the past?\" he asked. \n'Not that monster no more' \nJacqueline Montanez, who is now 40, found herself reflecting on the same question after a judge last year replaced her life sentence with a 63-year term proposed by prosecutors and her attorneys. With good-time credit, she is expected to be released in about 61/2 years. \nMontanez was 15 when she was arrested in 1992 for the murder of two rival gang members in Chicago. She was drawn to gang life at 12 and soon became a ward of the state and a chronic runaway. She had been physically and sexually abused by a relative who was a gang enforcer and trained her to kill as well, she said. \nJust days before the murders, she was named chief of the female branch of the Maniac Latin Disciples. She vowed to avenge the killing of a deaf friend by rival Latin Kings. \nAt trial, she glared at the victims' families. Once convicted and behind bars, she was ticketed more than 100 times for her misbehavior, according to court records. A few years into her sentence, she started a fire in her room and assaulted an officer, though records show she was found to be mentally ill. She said she had little remorse and even less incentive to change. \n\"(Prison) was my home,\" Montanez said. \"I knew these walls were going to be the walls that I was going to look at for the rest of my life. I knew that I would die here, so authorities couldn't tell me anything.\" \nBut her mindset shifted gradually, she said. First she went back to court for a retrial and was again convicted. Then an officer gave her a book that helped her confront the issues stemming from her rape and abuse. In 2008, her mother died of cancer. When her attorney, Alison Flaum, told her of the Supreme Court's ruling and the possibility that she might not die in prison, Montanez began to think of all the things she had never done: visit a zoo, eat steak, go to an amusement park, walk around downtown Chicago, get an ID, have a baby. (Duaa Eldeib) \n\"What a difference hope makes,\" said Flaum, legal director of the Children and Family Justice Center at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. \nAt the same time, Montanez struggled to reconcile that hope with the regret and responsibility she felt, Flaum said. \nIn a recent interview at the downstate women's Logan Correctional Center, Montanez described the slayings in matter-of-fact terms. \n\"To me, it is something that happened to somebody else,\" she said. \"I came here a child thinking I was grown, but I got thrown into a facility with grown women who had committed crimes. I had to learn to become a woman. To me, it's easy to talk as a (third) party because I'm not that monster no more.\" \nIn stark contrast from her original trial, Montanez wept at her resentencing hearing and apologized for the decisions she made 24 years earlier. The families of the victims, Hector Reyes and Jimmy Cruz, wanted to see her life sentence reinstated. \n\"I understand that the law has changed, but the impact of this case has not,\" Reyes' 24-year-old daughter, Rachel, said in a statement read by prosecutors. \"It does not change the fact that I am fatherless, and it does not change the fact she has killed him.\" \nMontanez, who now trains service dogs in the prison and collects donations of clothes for other inmates to wear on their release, asked for copies of the families' statements as a reminder of the real consequences of her actions. \nThe power of hope \nHope, Flaum learned, was a double-edged sword. The Supreme Court ruling guaranteed a new hearing but not a new sentence. Attorneys were mindful that if their clients were sentenced to life a second time, it could forever extinguish their flickering hope. \nStill, some inmates needed hope to carry them through their seemingly endless days, while others found the cost too high. \n\"They were surviving by giving up those kinds of dreams, thinking it was better not to dream at all,\" Flaum said. \nIn many cases, the power of hope endured, said Marsha Levick, deputy director and chief counsel at the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center. \n\"The difference between waking up every day and knowing that you'll never get out and waking up every day and now knowing there's a possibility that you might get out, I would have to assume is pretty profound,\" Levick said. (Steve Schmadeke) \nLevick, who served as an attorney on the 2016 Supreme Court case that ensured the life-without-parole ruling also would apply to inmates already in prison, said she has seen inmates come to appreciate the seismic shift in how the criminal justice system deals with juveniles, even if their own fate remains unchanged. \nSome inmates made a decision to change their behavior long before the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling gave them the hope that they might someday go free. They simply decided they could not live as they had, said Shobha Mahadev, an attorney at the Children and Family Justice Center. \n\"They made that decision a long time ago,\" she said. \"They said, 'I'm done being a kid.'\" \nMahadev's client, Lindsey Crittle, had been convicted as the getaway driver in a 1991 armed robbery of a Chicago convenience store that left two clerks dead. Although Crittle, then 17, did not go into the store, he was accountable under the law and sentenced to life without parole. \n\"It felt like my life was over,\" he said in a recent interview at his lawyer's downtown office. \"I felt like I had nothing.\" \nWhen he got to prison, he saw other lifers and that \"the light had gone out of their eyes,\" he said. He was determined to not let that happen to him. He decided he would live in prison as if someday he would get out. He took whatever classes were offered, though lifers often have little access to education in prison because they will have no use for it outside prison. He took whatever jobs he could get as well. He spent hours in the prison's law library. \nCrittle believed he should have a chance. After all, he did not take a life himself, he said, and he did not know one of his co-defendants would. But after years in prison, he began to lose hope. Not long after, though, the court rulings that changed the landscape of juvenile justice \"revved him up.\" \nHis lawyers, including Russell Perdew, a commercial litigator at the Locke Lord law firm who took Crittle's case for free, tried not to let his hopes get too high; he did not want Crittle to be disappointed if he could not win him a new sentence. Crittle, though, worried Perdew did not believe in him. \n\"I just didn't want him to be disappointed ultimately,\" Perdew said. \"But I didn't appreciate the value of hope on a day-to-day basis.\" \nAlthough prosecutors again sought a life term, Crittle was resentenced to 50 years and released last June. He has a job at a laundry that serves hospitals and other health care facilities and shares an apartment with a co-worker. He is working on reconnecting with a son who is now 25, though it hasn't been easy.

He hoped as well for a chance at life's more serious side — like building a relationship with his son, contributing to society and perhaps helping kids avoid the mistakes that he made. \n\"I have a life now,\" said Crittle, 43. \"I want to make something of it.\" \nPressure to succeed \nHawthorne and the others whose lives essentially stopped — even when the world around them did not — are well aware that the path forward for a convicted felon is marked by obstacles. While he was locked up, Hawthorne's grandparents and parents died. The last time he received a prison visit from a family member was in 2004, he said. \nWhen Hawthorne was released a few weeks ago, Flaum and his other Northwestern lawyers, including two former law students who initially worked on his case, were the only ones there to greet him. They brought him a wool coat, a bag of his favorite caramel-and-cheese Garrett popcorn and a cold bottle of Mountain Dew. They stood next to him as he marveled at the electronic menu in a fast-food joint and balked at the cost of a cookie. \nAfter enjoying his first moments out of prison, Hawthorne spoke of the pressure he felt to succeed as well as a responsibility not to forget the other onetime juvenile inmates still awaiting resentencing. \n\"This gives us hope. Anytime we see somebody leave, that lets us know in our own little way that our day is coming,\" he said. \"I know there's no room for failure.\" \ndeldeib@chicagotribune.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:08:20.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
