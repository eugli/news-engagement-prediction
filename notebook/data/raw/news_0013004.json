The 35-year-old was first admitted to the hospital in April 2015, after she was found unconscious in the bathroom of her house. Once examined by the doctors it was found that the young mother of two had slipped into coma. Dr Zeyad Al Rais, Head of Critical Care Department at Rashid Hospital said she slipped into a coma due to intracerebral hemorrhage, a life-threatening type of stroke caused by bleeding within the brain tissue. \"Perlie suffered from the intracerebral hemorrhage due to aneurysmal bleeding. Al Rais explained that an aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge or weakening of an arterial wall. As the bulge grows it becomes thinner and weaker. It can become so thin that the blood pressure within can cause it to burst or leak. Most aneurysms develop from a weakness or abnormal artery wall. \"Perlie underwent a surgical intervention to drain the blood. Due to the critical location of the bleeding, the respiratory and hemodynamic functions were affected, and she was kept on ventilator for more than 2 weeks, hence the decision was taken to perform tracheostomy, which helped her to gradually be weaned off the mechanical ventilation. We also started early physiotherapy to enhance her muscular power, while she was in the coma\" he said. By the time, Perlie gained consciousness-nine months later-Dr Al Rais said that he was able to start intensive active physiotherapy and put in place a neurological rehabilitation plan. \"Now, after nine months on being comatose on ventilator with tracheostomy tube, I am happy to say that the patient is fully conscious. Her neurological state is also stable. We successfully weaned her off the ventilator. She regained some of her motor skills and can now even walk with people's aid. We are now working on an intensive rehabilitation plan for Perly. Our aim is to make her independent as much as possible so that she can lead a regular life. It is a very pleasant moment to see Perlie setting in bed, holding her phone chatting with her family and beside her a bag of snacks. Perlie, who is now in the path of recovery, is happy that her health state is improving thanks to the effort to Dr Al Rais and his team of specialist, nurses and respiratory therapists. \"I have spent over a year and nine months at Rashid Hospital, I now consider the doctors and nurses at the hospital my family. I am truly thankful for the treatment I have received at Rashid Hospital. I am glad that I am recovering and I can't wait to go to the Philippines to see my children,\" she said. Dr Al Rais concluded by stating that Rashid Hospital has one of the most equipped and specialized critical care departments in the UAE, adding that the hospital has a high success rate in treating patients similar to Perlie's case. This is attributed to the multidisciplinary team. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:35:12.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
