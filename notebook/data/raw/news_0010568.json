It’s one of three ads that the company will air during the Super Bowl (which according to T-Mobile ties them with Budweiser for air time at the Super Bowl, which you should probably keep in mind if your rates go up because that’s a lot of ad buys.) \nIn the ad, Stewart tries to finish Snoop Dogg’s sentences and fails miserably until they both agree that smartphone sweaters, which keep a smartphone “all cozy” are “all that”. \nFor more and to vote on your favorite Super Bowl commercial, head over to Ad Meter.
