Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA \"brave\" young care worker has died from an illness so rare it does not have a proper name and has only been seen in one other person in the world. \nLyndsey Borman, 33, died of the extremely rare illness at Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham near Hull on Sunday. \nSince she was born Miss Borman had battled numerous illnesses and last year had battled to overcome cancer. \nJust last month, the mystery behind her weak immune system was solved when she was diagnosed with the rare ARPC1B deficiency. \nOnly one other person, a nine-year-old boy in the Netherlands, is known to have anything remotely similar to the condition that afflicted Miss Borman.

She would go to work, caring for people, even if she was feeling poorly herself. She was a credit to us all.\" \nGail Borman, 53, said her sister was relieved to finally get a diagnosis. \nShe said: \"Lyndsey really was one of a kind. She was a unique case in more ways than one. She said to us after the diagnosis, 'I'm famous at last. \n\"She was a warrior. So brave.\" \nMiss Borman's family, who are now awaiting the results of a postmortem examination, have been told by doctors that she is likely to be included in future medical journals. \nSister Carla Borman, 36, said the family wished to thank Dr Gordins and Jackie Whittaker, a senior specialist nurse, and colleagues in Castle Hill's immunology and haematology departments for their determination in diagnosing Miss Borman. \nShe said: \"If it wasn't for them, Lyndsey would never have been diagnosed. It meant a lot to her knowing what she had and the reason for 33 years of illness. The family of Lyndsey Borman have been left devastated by her death (Photo: Northcliffe Media Ltd.) \n\"We're told the condition affects just one in six billion. That's how rare it is.\" \nDespite long periods of ill health, Miss Borman - who doted on her puppy Dolly - gained a degree in social work from the University of Lincoln four years ago, before deciding she wanted to be a care worker. She worked as an auxiliary nurse at the private Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital in Anlaby. \nMiss Borman was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. Her family have been told it is not thought that the condition was linked to the autoimmune disorder. \n\"Lyndsey sailed through cancer,\" said another sister, Niki Borman, 38. \"She was going to Marbella with me in May. She had been really looking forward to it. She was so excited.\" \nFriends of Lyndsey Borman have set up a JustGiving page to raise cash for her family. \nLast night, nearly Â£2,500 had been raised. Miss Borman's family intend to use the money to pay for a memorial, while also making a donation to the immunology and haematology wards at Castle Hill. \nSarah Louise Knowles, who first met Miss Borman at Hull College more than 20 years ago, was left reeling by her friend's unexpected death. \nThe 35-year-old said: \"She was bubbly, chatty and always smiling. There was never a dull moment with Lyndsey. \n\"She had just got the all clear from cancer last year and were looking forward to going to Butlins and booking holidays together. I will miss her smile and the way that she was always positive even through her illness. \n\"She was quirky, funny, joyful and devoted to spending time with her family.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:27:57.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
