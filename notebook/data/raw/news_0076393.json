Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. \nChancellor Angela Merkel has even described the nation as “a country of immigration”. \nThe news comes after a leaked report suggested the fate of British expats in the EU could be under threat. \nTheresa May is reportedly looking to guarantee the right to free movement of British citizens in Europe, but would have to thrash out a deal with the 27 other countries in the Brussels bloc. \nThe deal would also likely involve retaining freedom of movement rights of EU nationals residing in the UK before the Brexit starting gun is fired – likely to be next month.
