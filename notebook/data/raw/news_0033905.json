Ad Feedback \nI guess it was, she was engaged and that ended abruptly. My mum and her used to watch the show and they really enjoyed it. \nMum actually sent Sharon an email saying why don't you perhaps give this a go and Sharon thought it was pretty crazy at first. \nThen the next day she did the one minute video online and got through the gruelling 3 or 4 months worth of interviews and auditions and once she got to the face-to-face interview they realised that she was a twin and they asked is she single and looking for love. \nThe answer was yes and yes and I chimed in. \nWould you describe yourselves as unlucky in love? \nI definitely would not describe myself as unlucky in love. I have had some very loving relationships in the past, it just so happened to be that I was single at the time. \nI guess when the opportunity presents itself for experts in love and relationships to help you find someone compatible, it is too good to pass up. \nHave you always done everything together? \nWe do a lot of things together because obviously we have grown up in sync our whole lives. \nOur first steps, our first words, our first day of school and the same friends because we were in the same classes in a country school so we have done a lot together. \nBut to get married on the same day is a pretty unique and unusual circumstance. It was even kiss the bride at the same time! A post shared by Mish (@mishmarsh) on Aug 20, 2016 at 9:11pm PDT \nTell me about the experience itself \nIt was awesome, it was an amazing day. We could not have it planned better and we only had three weeks to plan and organise this wedding. \nWe chose everything from the flowers, to the location, to our wedding dresses and it all came together so beautifully. There were moments where Sharon and I were looking around at all our family and our friends and our partner's family and friends and they were all getting along and mingling. \nIt was an unbelievably magical experience and to have Sharon by my side and vice versa to help support each other was amazing. \nWhat do your family think of this experience? \nOur family are really supportive. We are a pretty modest easy-going country family. We all live in the city now but our parents have supported us no matter what we have wanted to do in life. \nWhether it was move to the opposite side of the planet or up in the dirt where Sharon went. If we are happy, they are happy. \nWhat was the most surprising/unexpected part of the process? \nI guess watching the show back. Sometimes things don't always happen the way you see them, there are smoke and mirrors. \nSometimes there is a look or a conversation and you are like 'I am not sure that actually happened that way, I remember it like this'. \nI guess it is reality tv and you don't have full control over the editing process so you have to keep that in mind when watching the show. \nMoving away from your home town as well. You are in an unfamiliar environment as well as living with a stranger. It's a lot to get used to, it is 24/7 in each others company. Its a shock to the system to try and become comfortable with all these different things \nWhat was your initial reaction when you saw your husband-to-be? \nForget the editing process of what you might see on TV because that is not actually what happened. When I first saw Jesse I thought attractive, warm and kind eyes. \nHe immediately made me feel calm. I was a little bit nervous and he grabbed my hand and squeezed it and we had a lot of laughs and a lot of banter and it was an extremely fun day no matter what the editing does. \nIt is a 12 hour day and they picked up subtle frowns or life-less expressions and they have used that but let me tell you it was a beautiful day. A post shared by Mish (@mishmarsh) on Feb 13, 2017 at 8:13pm PST \nWas it the same for Sharon? \nAbsolutely, we both had an amazing day. Honestly when you have got your family and your friends around you and it is a big party and there is so much excitement in the air because you don't know in eight weeks time how you are going to feel. \nDo any of the other matches stand out to you as terrible? \nI would say yes. Scarlett and Michael was not a good match at all. Different values, different personalities. I thought it was a terrible match. \n\nWhat has it been like being on TV and opening yourself up to criticism? \nTo be very honest, even now I put that in the back of my mind. I'm a pretty reasonable, fair person and I'm not blind to the fact that in world you are always going to have people that disagree with you and don't agree with what you are doing. \nBut even the most beautiful, kind people in the world, for example Miranda Kerr, will have people criticising her. \nYou are always going to have the haters out there but you just have to get a sense of reality and know that you've got your friends and your family and what they say matters and no one else. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:19:36.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
