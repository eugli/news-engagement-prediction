Photo: Supplied \nShe had helped end decades of demarcation disputes between the ASU and the RTBU. \n\"Normally when there are unions that have shared coverage like the RTBU and ASU in the NSW railways, it is very easy to cast a suspicious eye on each other. But Sally was incredibly good at breaking down those barriers,\" Mr Nanva said. \n\"She is as adept at having a conversation with clerical workers as she is rallying a mob of railway workers. \n\"It was her unflinching honesty, integrity and dedication to rank and file members that broke down those barriers of suspicion within our two unions, to the point where I am very happy to say we are no longer competitors. I consider her now to be a confidante.\" \nTim Ayres, the NSW secretary of the left-wing Australian Manufacturing Workers Union said he expected Ms McManus would provide exciting leadership and generational change for the trade union movement. \n\"She's an exciting union figure who has a lot of support around the movement who has organised some really creative campaigns, particularly the equal pay campaign and campaigns around the NDIS,\" he said. \n\"I think she is going to bring some real clout and energy and creativity to the leadership of the labour movement.\" \nNadine Flood, national secretary for the left-wing Community and Public Sector Union, said Ms McManus was \"not just a brilliant campaigner, she is a highly strategic leader driven by the interests of working people\". \n\"That's why supporting Sally as ACTU secretary is an easy decision,\" Ms Flood said. \nUnions NSW's Mark Morey said Ms McManus had shown she was comfortable working with blue and white collar workers. \n\"She is a high quality official who is able to deliver for community sector workers and blue collar workers in rail and water,\" he said. \n\"She is smart, hard working, takes a broad view of the union movement and is able to bring different groups together to work on a common cause. And she is driven.\" \nNSW Labor Party leader Luke Foley, who has worked closely with Ms McManus and knows her well, said she was \"an extraordinarily passionate and committed advocate for working people\". \nShe had served for a quarter of a century in only two roles – with the ASU and the ACTU – and had \"never shown the slightest inclination to do anything else but to fight for working people\". \n\"I personally think the union movement would be making a very wise choice if Sally were to be chosen as the next ACTU secretary,\" Mr Foley said. \n\"I worked closely with her for many years and I think she understands the changing world of work. \n\"From what I observed she was always interested in expanding the union movement's presence into workplaces where it hadn't been before.\" \nMr Foley, who is also aligned to the left-wing of the ALP, said Ms McManus was committed to growing union membership by speaking directly with workers. \n\"She is committed to a grass roots approach, not a top-down approach,\" he said. \nLinda White, national secretary for the Australian Services Union, described Ms McManus as dynamic and a great campaigner. \n\"She's what we need and she has a proven record. You couldn't pick anyone better,\" she said. \n\"Having an ASU woman as the first woman ACTU secretary is pretty impressive for this union.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:31:05.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
