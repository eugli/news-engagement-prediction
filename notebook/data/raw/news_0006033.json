STACEY GATFIELD-TUPOU/SUPPLIED \nA shark pup was found washed up on the Petone shoreline on Tuesday. \n\"It's not common to see [Porbeagle sharks] on the coast like this. They're an open ocean species and live mainly out past the edge of the continental shelf,\" he said. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We've tagged quite a few in the past. They migrate vertically between the shallow water and very deep water every day.\" NICHOLAS BOYACK/FAIRFAX NZ \nVictoria university PhD student Britney Finucci measures the shark on Petone beach. \nBut people should not be concerned by the shark's decision to visit Petone, Francis said. \n\"They're harmless. They're a close relative of the Mako shark, they look very similar. The Porbeagle is basically a stockier version of the Mako shark.\" \nPorbeagles were about 70cm long at birth and could grow to 2.3 metres in New Zealand waters, he said. STACEY GATFIELD-TUPOU/SUPPLIED \nIt was not known on Wednesday how the shark died. \nThe cause of the shark's death was unclear. Ad Feedback \n\"I can't see any netting damage or anything on it. It might have been caught by a fisherman and discarded from a fishing boat,\" Francis said. \n\"Or it might have just wandered into the harbour and got lost. It's been pretty windy out there so it might have gotten rolled around by surf or something like that if it got into shallow water.\" \nVictoria University student Britney Finucci, who is doing a PhD on sharks, was at the Petone foreshore on Wednesday measuring the Porbeagle and taking samples. \nrushed out to record its details when she saw people posting about it on social media. \nFinucci said it was a young a male, but she did not know what killed it. \nShe planned to measure and weigh it, and she said it was a good opportunity to gather information about a shark that is an important commercial variety. \nPORBEAGLE SHARKS Slow-growing and vulnerable to over-fishing Related to Mako sharks Mainly caught as bycatch by longline tuna fisheries \nSource: Forest & Bird", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:28:07.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
