She didn’t get legal permission to work in the country until seven weeks later. \nAt the time, the 46-year old only had a B1/B2 visitor visa and by working, she violated the terms of her visitor, or tourist, visa. \nThough a lawyer representing her told the AP he wasn’t familiar with the documents he also didn’t deny or challenge the veracity of them. \nOn January 25, Trump issued an executive order prioritizing the deportation of people who have “engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency.” Credit: Pool/Getty Images \nDepartment of Homeland Security documents released this week indicate these instructions are currently being enforced and, according to Slate , had this been the 90s, Trump’s wife — known then as Melania Knaus — would have been considered a deportation priority. \n“If the current executive order on interior enforcement and the related Homeland Security memoranda on interior enforcement had been in effect at that time, then [Melania] would have certainly been an enforcement priority,” deputy attorney Hasan Shafiqullah confirmed to Slate . \nOf course, the mother of one has since become a naturalized U.S. citizen so this is no longer a cause of concern for her. \nStill, it’s interesting that had these rules existed so many years ago, Donald and Melania may have never met. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’ s coverage of Donald Trump below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:25:36.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
