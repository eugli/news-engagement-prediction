The closure is expected to lead to the loss of 140 jobs. \nIn an email to staff announcing the move, ITV’s chief executive, Adam Crozier, said there were plans to move back to the South Bank site once it was redeveloped but there would not be a place for the studio.

The fall in the value of sterling in recent months is thought to have made ITV, which also operates a large production business, a more attractive prospect for overseas bidders. \nThe London Studios makes programmes for all the UK’s main broadcasters, including Have I Got News for You and The Graham Norton Show on the BBC, and Channel 4’s Sex Box. It also hosts ITV’s daytime programming – Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women – but these will continue to be filmed in the redeveloped HQ. \nThe site has a long history stretching to its original incarnation as the South Bank Television Centre, producing sitcoms such as On the Buses and Father Ted , as well as Blind Date . \nBectu said the plans did not make sense and were a “betrayal” of staff already reeling from 120 redundancies announced late last year. \n“Even in the short term the proposal has no logic,” said Bectu’s head, Gerry Morrissey. “Why announce the studios’ closure when planning permission has yet to be sought and when the redevelopment will not begin until 2018 at the earliest?

We’d also like to know whether the proposal to close the London Studios is motivated more by the prospect of a possible sale of the company than by sound industrial planning.” \nThe tower block in which the studio is housed was built in the 1970s for London Weekend Television, with ITV securing the freehold on the site in 2003 for £56m . \nIn December the Wembley studio where the ITV shows The X Factor and Pop Idol were shot was closed before a planned demolition .
