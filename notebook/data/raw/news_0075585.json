The guilt and shame factor is deeply imbedded in our Western culture mainly perpetuated through religion and \"osmosis\" ...the Western mind-set. In the East, the body and all its functions are considered beautiful and natural. Frequent Orgasms and Women's Health \nFrequent orgasms can benefit women's sexual health tremendously. However, there is a vast difference in having an ordinary orgasm and having a tantric orgasm. Ordinary orgasms, which are the norm, are of short duration, isolated in the sex organs. Tantric sex orgasms involve the full body, mind, and spirit, lasting for hours as well. Benefits of Tantric Orgasm \nTo obtain the benefits of a tantric orgasm, the shakti, or energy, the rising kundalini , must pierce each of the chakras (vortexes of energy in the subtle body) as it ascends the spinal cord. It must reach the brain's central nervous system and endocrine command center - the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which commands the changes that benefits our sexual health. Benefits of Frequent Orgasms \nFrequent and powerful orgasms increase the level of the orgasm hormone, oxytocin. The oxytocin level is linked to the personality, passion, social skills and emotional quotient (EQ), all of which affects career, marriage, emotions and social life. Orgasms are very beneficial for sexual health because they empower our pituitary (brain function). \nWe benefit from tantra practices on the physical, spiritual and emotional levels. Hari Om Tat Sat \nAbout this Contributor Chandi Devi has always been involved in both the creative arts as well as the mystic arts.
