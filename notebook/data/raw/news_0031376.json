Go buy it today everybody, you can find it online.” \nThe comments came a day after Trump tweeted that he believed his daughter had been treated “unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which had recently dropped the fashion line. The company has said the decision was not political, but was based on declining sales. \nREAD MORE: Kellyanne Conway’s endorsement of Ivanka trump’s fashion line ‘flippant’: Trump aide \nIn the letter to the White House, Walter Shaub, the director of the government ethics office, wrote that Conway’s comments appear to be a “clear violation of the prohibition against misuse of position.” \nSpicer, the White House spokesman, said last week that Conway has been “counselled” about her comments, but the government ethics office said it has yet to receive any guidance on what if anything happened as a corrective action. The White House didn’t immediately respond to questions sent via email Tuesday. \nKellyanne Conway walks past reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, in New York. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Evan Vucci \nThe letter notes lawyers for the White House and the government ethics office spoke on Feb. 9, the day of Conway’s interview, and that Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee’s ranking Democratic member from Maryland, asked OGE to follow up. Chaffetz has said that Conway’s comments were “wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line.” \nThe government ethics office is requesting that White House lawyers tell them in writing by Feb. 28 what they’ve done about Conway’s comments. The office advises executive branch officials on abiding by ethics laws and rules but doesn’t have investigative or enforcement authority. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:36:19.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
