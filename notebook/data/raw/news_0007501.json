Yes, we do that because we are frustrated,\" Sechaba said. \nSechaba said the music industry neglected its stars and left Lundi without food. \n\"Lundi would attend events and make everyone cry and then when he is done he would go home and cry to himself, because there was no food in the fridge. \n\"Why are people crying? What makes them cry? Where were you when Lundi was in hospital? You heard that he was eating through a drip,\" Sechaba said. South Africa is to blame for breaking Lundi, says close friend \nAn angry Sechaba then turned his attention to other gospel artists in attendance, asking who was taking care of the widows and children of dead gospel singers such as Sfiso Ncwane, Vuyo Mokoena and Oleseng Shuping. \n\"Since Vuyo died how many of you went to visit his wife? How many of you visited Oleseng's wife? You don't even know where she lives,\" Sechaba said. \nHis address had mourners on their feet as they clapped and cheered at his remarks. \nHis microphone was cut near the end of his address and he stormed off the stage.
