People didn't make much money, but nobody went hungry,\" says Mendoza, 23, sharing common lore from her region. She was born just after NAFTA was signed. \nAs cheap American corn came pouring in from the border, it had a devastating effect on her family. Her father, Benancio Mendoza, couldn't compete and make a living wage selling corn. He had to give up and move to the United States looking for a job. He took up a job as a cook in Tennessee, saving up money to send home so his kids could attend school. \n\"He went north looking for a job and I didn't see him again for 18 years,\" says Mendoza, who now works as a secretary for the local government. \nWhile NAFTA did boost Mexico's manufacturing industry, it gutted many farming towns -- especially mom and pop corn farmers like Benancio's. \nRelated: Trump isn't Mexico's biggest fear for now \nMexico lost over 900,000 farming jobs in the first decade of NAFTA, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture. \nMendoza says her small town of Santa Ana Zegache is now inhabited mostly by women and the elderly because working-age men went to the United States looking for jobs -- the vast majority crossing over illegally. \nNAFTA opened the Mexican market to U.S. corn producers who were subsidized by the U.S. government. \nThat led to a boom in U.S. corn exports to Mexico -- and a bust in Mexican farming jobs like Benancio's. In the first decade of NAFTA, U.S. corn exports to Mexico quadrupled while Mexican corn prices fell 66%, according to Tufts University professor Tim A. Wise, a trade expert. \nThe U.S. is the world's number one producer and exporter of corn - and Mexico is its number one export market. \nIndeed, some of NAFTA's biggest winners were U.S. farmers. \nRelated: Mexicans threaten to boycott U.S. brands \nIn 1995, the year after NAFTA went into effect, U.S. corn exports to Mexico were $391 million. In 2015, American corn farmers sent $2.4 billion south of the border, according to U.S. Census and Agriculture Department data. \nNot surprisingly, Trump's threats to build a wall, renegotiate NAFTA and possibly slap a 20% tax on Mexican goods has American farmers worried. They fear Mexico will retaliate and slap a tax on U.S. corn. \n\"It probably would cost corn jobs,\" says Kurt Hora, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association. \"Mexico is a huge market for us...any disruption in trade for corn would be very detrimental to U.S. farmers.\" \nAmerican agriculture businesses know their NAFTA gains are at risk. In a recent letter to President Trump, 130 U.S. agriculture companies, including Cargill, touted the gains of NAFTA for American farmers. \nRelated: Trump wants to speed up NAFTA talks \n\"In the 20 years since NAFTA was implemented, the U.S. food and agriculture industry has become increasingly efficient and innovativeâ€”growing to support millions of jobs,\" according to the letter . \nCorn exports to Mexico alone support lots of American jobs. In Kansas, where 99% of corn goes to Mexico, 48,000 jobs depend on trade with America's southern neighbor. In Iowa, 53,000 jobs rely on trade with Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \nBut south of the border, those farming jobs are few and far between. \nBenancio Mendoza returned to Mexico a few years ago and started farming corn again as a hobby. But the family knows farming as a way to sustain the family isn't in their future anymore. \n\"Young people like me have gone to school, we want other things,\" says Griselda.
