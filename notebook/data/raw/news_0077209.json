(CBS) — A special kind of fertility intervention is keeping alive the legacy of a Chester County horse. \nIt was made possible by a team of local veterinarians who joined up with other veterinarians across the country in Texas. \nThe procedure is similar to in vitro fertilization that is used with humans creating embryo’s in a Petri dish. \nBut this fertility intervention was done with a horse that had died and now her legacy is alive. \nSleepy Teens 4.5 Times Likely to Commit Crimes By Age 29: Study \nLisa Gaudio is grateful for the miracle of birth of three foals that were born after the loss of their mother. \n“I thought if I just got one it would be just a miracle but we had three,” said Gaudio. \nThe foals’ mother is Gaudio’s beloved 20-year-old half-Arabian horse named Kyrie Eleison. \n“There was just something special about that mare,” she said. \nBut Kyrie suffered from a devastating hoof disease called laminitis. \nDespite months of treatment she eventually had to be euthanized. \nGaudio loved Kyrie so much that she wanted to find a way to keep her legacy alive. \n“For me and my husband it was just to have a part of her,” she said. \nThanks to modern technology they were able to do just that. \nDoctors from Penn Vet’s New Bolton Center in Kennett Square removed the mare’s ovaries after she died. \nBack in the lab at New Bolton, reproduction specialist Dr. Tamara Dobbie performed a painstaking process. \n“We carefully dissected the ovaries and harvested the eggs,” said Dobbie. \nKyrie’s eggs were immediately sent to Texas A & M University for an advanced reproductive technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI. \n“With the ICSI procedure under an inverted microscope someone physically takes a single sperm cell and injects it into the egg,” explained Dobbe. \nAnd it was successful, resulting in embryos. \n“To think that we can take eggs from a deceased mare and we can recover eggs and get pregnancies and offspring I think it’s incredible,” she said. \nThe embryos were implanted in three surrogate mares in Texas. \nThe moms-to-be traveled to New Bolton Center where they gave birth. \n“It’s such a lovely ending to a very sad story,” said Dobbie. \nTwo of Kyrie’s bouncing babies were born in January and the third foal was born at the beginning of February. \nThere’s Epona who has her mother’s eyes, according to Lisa. \n“It melts you every day because that same eye is there,” she said of the little filly. \nAnd there’s her sister, Elle Vitorina who Gaudio describes as really sweet. \nAnd then there’s the feisty little colt named Big Man In Town. \n“Three perfect little ones how do you beat that,” said a beaming Gaudio. \nShe also owned Kyrie’s great grandmother, grandmother and mom so the foals are the fourth generation. \nVets say using eggs from a deceased horse is not new, but they say what is amazing is that they were able to get three wonderful foals.
