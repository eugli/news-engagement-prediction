Credit Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times Remedies for toenail fungus, the scary possible side effects of antidepressants, the beauty of male genitalia and the popularity of vodka tampons: These were among the topics addressed by Isaac Mizrahi during his raucously funny opening-night show last week at Café Carlyle , where he is appearing with a pop-jazz band through Saturday. Better known as a fashion designer than a performer, Mr. Mizrahi, 55, has been a part-time nightclub entertainer since the late 1980s. That was years before the term alt.ca baret was invented to describe a freewheeling performance style that stretched the boundaries of a form that had been largely devoted to the preservation of the American songbook. He qualifies as a founding father of a genre that fuses performance art, music and stand-up comedy — and until recently didn’t have a name. Mr. Mizrahi isn’t interested in evoking the misty-eyed nostalgia of swooning to the old songs while holding hands, sipping Champagne and shedding a tear. Like so many other alt.cabaret performers, he is determined to challenge the cultural status quo and help blaze a path into a more liberated future where few subjects are off-limits. And his Café Carlyle engagement is a big deal. “I’ve been preparing my whole life to be in this room,” he said in a telephone interview. Depending on your perspective, his candor about his sexuality and his neurotic tics is liberating or threatening. Although he appears fearless onstage, he said, he is bedeviled by doubt and insecurity and some self-loathing. Still he soldiers on. Airing it onstage, he insisted, is healing, not only for himself but also for audience members who share his insecurities.
