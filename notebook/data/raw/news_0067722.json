Though not in the film, Ciara was a standout at the party, having donned a skintight black mini-dress that tightened about her bulging baby bump. Standing beside her was her gorgeous husband Russell Wilson, whom she married last July and with whom she announced her pregnancy that October. Glamorous couple: Vanity Fair and Genesis threw a celebration on Friday night honoring Hidden Figures, which is nominated for three Academy Awards at Sunday's show, and Ciara was a showstopper with her husband Russell Wilson The 31-year-old singer had gathered part of her wavy blonde hair up over her head, allowing the rest to tumble onto the fossil grey coat. She'd slung the jacket casually over her shoulders, accessorizing with a tiny black purse she held roughly level with her above-the-knee hem. A bit of sheer black drapery dangled from the back of her dress and fell nearly to the floor as she posed for the cameras next to the Seattle Seahawk. Backstory: The singer and the Seattle Seahawk married last July and announced she was pregnant last October All smiles: The couple got in a bit of posing alongside Taraji P. Henson, who does in fact star in Hidden Figures and wore a cocktail dress that slid off one shoulder Wilson had popped on a blazer that appeared to be velour and featured brown, red and white patterns flecked across a gold field. Its sleeves emphasized his musclebound arms, and beneath it, he'd kept his look simple, opting for a black T-shirt and trousers and dark purple boots. Their impending baby is their first, though Ciara's also got a two-year-old son called Future Zahir Wilburn by her ex-fianc√© Future. Elegance: Though the dress was mostly black and fell past her knee, the covered shoulder had a frilly stretch of white fabric draped over it The couple got in a bit of posing alongside Taraji P.

The mains: The Empire actress posed for photos in between her co-stars from the Theodore Melfi-directed film, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae Spencer, who's nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, wore a flowing cream blouse with a loose matching tie that fell past the waist. Her midnight blue blazer featured sleeves that stopped shortly after the knee and matched her slacks, which clashed elegantly against orange shoes. Monae's voluminous sleeves were a frilly white fabric, and the rest of her mini-dress was splattered with black, blue and red flower patterns. Top brass: Spencer posed alongside Pharrell Williams, who was among the producers of the film and flung an arm about her shoulder The centers of the flowers were gold, and a black belt cinched about her svelte waistline, matching her ankle-strap stilettos. Spencer posed alongside Pharrell Williams, who was among the producers of the film and flung an arm about her shoulder. He'd got on a blueish black cardigan, buttoned all the way to the top and allowing just hints of his bright pink shirt to show through. Troika: He stood for photos beside Manfred Fitzgerald, Senior Vice President and Head Of Genesis Brand, as well as with Chris Mitchell, publisher and CRO of Vanity Fair Tears streaked across his faded jeans, and he'd slung on a cross-body purse, having slipped into a pair of sand-colored boots.

Samira Wiley's dress featured a lighter shade of blue slanting from the top down to its left side and a dark shade of blue slanting from the hem to her right underarm. Its hem stopped about halfway down her calf, allowing for a full view of the gleaming metallic ankle-strap high heeled shoes she'd got on for the event. Friday night style: Cleopatra Coleman and Samira Wiley, though not in the film, each cut a chic figure while posing at the event commemorating the film She's not in the film, and nor is Cleopatra Coleman, who'd turned up in a cleavage-baring dress with robe-like sleeves that largely obscured her hands. Grey abstract patterns were splattered across her dress' white field, and its thigh slit had a white ribbon dangling into the breach while she posed. Kirsten Dunst, who is in the film, wore an Oxford blue blazer with black lining at the hem and cuffs, pulling it over a black blouse and matching slacks.
