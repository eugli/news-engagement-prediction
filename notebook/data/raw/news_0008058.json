More An eerie-looking doll that was perched on a ledge in Dhoby Ghaut MRT station has been removed, according to a Channel NewsAsia report on Wednesday (1 February). Train operator SMRT confirmed that the doll was removed on Wednesday morning before train service started, the report said. Investigations on how the doll was placed on the ledge are ongoing, the report added. Pictures of the doll were making their rounds on social media after Twitter user Ashley Soo posted two photos of the doll on her page on Tuesday. According to Soo’s tweet, she was travelling on a train along the North-South Line heading towards Jurong East when she saw the doll. Soo’s tweet has attracted more than 7,000 retweets by Wednesday night. SGAG, a popular humour site, also turned her photos into a meme by juxtaposing them next to a picture of South Korean horror movie, “Train to Busan”.
