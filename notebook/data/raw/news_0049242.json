David Cassidy and his son Beau at Wrigley Field in 2006. | DAVIDCASSIDY.COM \nOn Feb. 3, Cassidy posted this statement to his Facebook page, announcing his retirement, but giving no specific details about the reason: \n“MESSAGE FROM DAVID I’ve spent months contemplating this decision to retire at the end of this year. But I will still do a number of concerts this Year in 2017! I believe I owe that to my fans and also to my second family, the members of my band. They’ve been there for many years with me. They’re all fantastic musicians and wonderful friends to me. \nThis has been a very difficult decision for me that nobody can possibly understand. 49 YEARS of doing concerts!!! \nToo all who’ve loved my work and that have been there for me, I want to be able to show my gratitude and awareness of your care and support. So…. I will continue to speak with my friend Jane who has helped me for years now with my website and my Facebook page. I’m not going to just disappear! I’m just no longer going to fly and play and travel and fly and play again etc. \nGod Bless you all and I hope you’ll come and see me in concert in my final year! I love what you’ve all given me with your magnificent support for decades. \nHappy Trails to you. XO DC” \n“I just can’t tour anymore. I know it’s time. I’ve done it at the highest level. I’ve been embraced by millions and millions and millions of people all over the world,” Cassidy said in an interview Feb. 16 with theindependent.com \nIn addition to his many concert performances in Chicago, Cassidy also performed in musical theater here, including a two-week run of “Little Johnny Jones” at the Arie Crown Theatre in 1981. In 2006, Cassidy, accompanied by his son Beau, sang “The National Anthem” before a Cubs game at Wrigley Field. \nIn a 2011 interview with the Sun-Times, Cassidy revealed Chicago had a special place in his heart: “Other than New York or L.A. or even London, where I lived for a while, I’ve spent more time in Chicago than any other city. I came to Chicago right after “Cherish” broke in 1972 and I fell in love with the city.” \nContributing: Sun-Times staff reporter Miriam Di Nunzio Previously from Entertainment ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:16:10.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
