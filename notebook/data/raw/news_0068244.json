Save Google \nLast summer Google introduced phone prompts as a way of approving sign-in attempts protected by two-step verification. Instead of an email or text, users receive a simple pop-up alerting them to a new sign-in request. While useful, there wasn't much information on the card, save for the location and device being used. Now, Google is refreshing the feature , adding more details about the associated time, location and hardware. As Android Police notes , the wording has also been adjusted slightly in the prompts, from \"no\" to \"no it's just me.\" It's a small change, but one that should help privacy-conscious users distinguish friend from foe.
