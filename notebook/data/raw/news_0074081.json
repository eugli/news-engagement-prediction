(Photo: AFP) \nViewers immediately started speculating exactly how it happened, with some believing the presenters were handed the wrong card by producers. \nSome thought they were actually holding the card that announced Emma as the winner of Best Actress in a Leading Role for La La Land, and therefore read out that film by mistake. \nBut Emma has revealed that that couldn't possibly be the case. \nHolding her Best Actress award, Emma spoke out backstage. She can't stop looking at her award (Photo: Rex Features) She was presented her prize by Leonardp DiCaprio (Photo: Getty) \nShe said: \"Okay, so yes of course, I'm an actor, so I've always dreamt of this kind of thing, but yet again, not in a realistic context. \n\"And for that, I f***ing love Moonlight, God I love Moonlight so much! I'm so excited for Moonlight and of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land, I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture, but we are so excited for Moonlight, I think it's one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside mysef. \n\"I also was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story, I don't mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card. So I'm not sure what happened and I really wanted to talk to you guys first.\" \nOther fans summised the Oscars was hacked. Either way, it is a huge embarrassment for all involved.
