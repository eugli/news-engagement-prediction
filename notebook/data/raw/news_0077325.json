People with EDS are prone to chronic pain, joint dislocation and lost vision. The province says EDS affects approximately one in 5,000 people and requires a combination of efforts to be diagnosed and treated properly.\nThe new EDS clinic is run by the Hospital for Sick Children and the University Health Network in Toronto.\nThe province said the clinic will give primary care providers a single point of contact to get information on signs of the disease, receive advice and feedback from experts on diagnosis and treatment options and make referrals to specialists.\n\"I believe this clinic is going to make a difference in the lives of both adult and pediatric patients,\" Hoskins said.\nThe other clinics that are being expanded are also in the University Health Network and will help patients with red blood disorders such as Sickle Cell Disease, Thalassemia, and metabolic disorders like Phenylketonuria, Hoskins said.\nPhenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder that causes an amino acid that can harm the central nervous system and the brain to build up in the body.\nThe province is investing $622,500 to expand those clinics.\nThe government defines a rare disease as a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease that affects approximately five people out of 10,000 and requires special, combined efforts to enable patients to be diagnosed and treated effectively.\nRelated Stories Rare disease committee shot down at Queen's Park New clinic to treat people with EDS, possibly other rare diseases Erika Crawford to undergo surgery before Christmas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:35:00.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
