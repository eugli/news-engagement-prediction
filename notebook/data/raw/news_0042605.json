(Photo: Facebook/ShakulGupta) Men have a variety of ways to woo girls and social media has made it easier with for many to simply make their wealth do the talking. A Delhi man did not require Tinder to get a date on Valentines Day, he simply posted a date request on Facebook and he got more than he could have expected.\nAccording to a media report, an entrepreneur Shakul Gupta posted a rather interesting post on 11 th February. The post directly addresses the idea saying “Who want to be my Valentine (sic)?” The post further goes on to tell all the girls about what the date would be like – a dinner at Oberoi in Gurgaon and gift them an iPhone 7 too. He posted quite a few photos giving them an idea of the person he is along with his height, weight and occupation along with likes and dislikes in the funniest way possible (or so we think).\nMany girls were convinced and while he received over 2,000 applicants, he chose to spend his Valentines Day with five girls. However because of the number of people interested he had to have it on 16 th February but he definitely had a good time. The interesting post has received over 14,000 likes and has been shared over 561 times.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D1884949551742612%26id%3D1682079002029669%26substory_index%3D0&width=500"], "published": "2017-02-21T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:15:08.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
