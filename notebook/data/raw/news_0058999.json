The bureau manages the Red Rock conservation area. \nHis 2016 proposal drew a unanimous recommendation for denial last October from county planning panel members, setting up Wednesday’s commission vote. \nCommissioners Chris Giunchigliani and Lawrence Weekly voted against approval, after Giunchigliani said she believed the 2011 plan should have expired. \nCommissioner Susan Brager said strict county review during upcoming development steps could reduce the density of the project. \nRhodes, the builder of thousands of homes in developments including Rhodes Ranch, Tuscany Village and Spanish Hills, bought the Blue Diamond mine property in 2003. He also owns ranch property in northwest Arizona. \nState and county lawmakers passed land use restrictions that effectively killed his first proposal for a master-planned community. \nLawsuits followed, plans stalled further during the Great Recession, and the process stopped when Rhodes’ development company filed bankruptcy in 2009. \nSeveral officials and speakers referred Wednesday to the previous court battles, and said they expected another following the commission decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:15:14.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
