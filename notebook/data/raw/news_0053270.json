She has now become a full-time Deerfield Beach resident after more than 20 years as a snow bird.\nRuth has collected more than two million pennies and is now working on her third million collection here in South Florida. Through this penny collecting, she has given away nearly $40,000 to the synagogue in New Jersey, for cleft lip surgeries and for a well to be dug in Africa for a needy village.\n\"This gives me great satisfaction because lately I've given the money to children with cleft lips in Africa and the next collection will go to trees in Israel as they've had so many fires and they need the trees so badly,\" Wolf said while interviewed in her Deerfield Beach apartment.\nCurrently, Wolf collects pennies from family, friends and neighbors and puts them in a canister in her condo. Once the canister is filled, she puts the money in the bank. People have already started bringing her pennies to her condo. She said she has gotten \"very sincere thank yous\" from the people who have benefited from her collection project.\nCaption Holocaust Survivor Band returns from Poland Polish-born Holocaust survivors Saul Dreier and Reuwen Sosnowicz returned home Wednesday after an unforgettable trip to Poland and Israel.\nPolish-born Holocaust survivors Saul Dreier and Reuwen Sosnowicz returned home Wednesday after an unforgettable trip to Poland and Israel.\nCaption Holocaust Survivor Band returns from Poland Polish-born Holocaust survivors Saul Dreier and Reuwen Sosnowicz returned home Wednesday after an unforgettable trip to Poland and Israel.\nPolish-born Holocaust survivors Saul Dreier and Reuwen Sosnowicz returned home Wednesday after an unforgettable trip to Poland and Israel.\nCaption Weston philanthropist to build Holocaust rooms at Nova A gift from Craig and Barbara Weiner will benefit Nova Southeastern Universty's Alvin Sherman Library to create a new Holocaust Reflection and Resource Room.\nA gift from Craig and Barbara Weiner will benefit Nova Southeastern Universty's Alvin Sherman Library to create a new Holocaust Reflection and Resource Room.\nCaption Sherman tank on display at the Holocaust Documentation & Education Center A Sherman tank used in combat during WWII was unveiled at the Holocaust Documentation & Education Center Friday at 303 North Federal Highway in Dania Beach.\nA Sherman tank used in combat during WWII was unveiled at the Holocaust Documentation & Education Center Friday at 303 North Federal Highway in Dania Beach.\nCaption Temple honors people where Torah is from.

Collect money. Whoever wants to give me a gift, they can send it there [to the penny collection]. It's more important.\"\nWolf was born in Germany and fled the country, along with her family, after her family's small department store was trashed during Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) in 1938 when it was ruled by the Nazis. The family moved to what was then Palestine before it became Israel in 1948, and Wolf spent the rest of her childhood there before coming to the United States at the age of 18.\nWolf and her late husband Manny decided to start collecting pennies as a way to illustrate the value of saving when her now adult grandson was asked by her to pick up a penny from the floor of her car when he was a child.\n\"When my grandson picked up the penny, he asked, 'What am I going to do with a penny?' And I said 'Everything you do in life starts with a penny.' It doesn't start with a dollar, and that's how my husband and I spent that night, figuring out how we can explain to children how to pick up a penny, which they don't do anymore,\" Wolf said.\nWhen asked how her project exemplifies Jewish values such as tikkun olam (repair the world), Wolf responded, \"We have to help each other. If we don't help each other, who's going to help us.\"\nHer son Steven Wolf said about his mother's efforts, \"We all wondered when my mother said she was going to try and collect one million pennies if this was a little over the top. But sure enough she set her mind to it, arranged all the details and got it done.\"\n\"Many people were so supportive and helped her. It was amazing. I remember going to their house one morning and there were sacks and jars full of pennies on the front step that people had dropped off. We are so proud of what she has done.\"\nWolf's looking for a local Conservative synagogue to join and to introduce her penny collecting project, as well as have more people bring in pennies.
