If Chip Kelly isn't in Nick's contacts, surely somebody in the office has his number. \nYou remember Sark? He was the former USC and Washington coach so down on his luck that he entered December making $28,000 as one of those Alabama analysts. \nSark surprisingly surfaced in Atlanta on Tuesday, no doubt able to answer this simple interview question from Dan Quinn: What do you do from the Patriots ' 22-yard line while leading by eight with 4:22 left in the game? \nIf Sark didn't say something along the lines of, \"Run the damn ball,\" he should be busted back to Bama's video cut-ups room. \nThere's really nothing to see here except an opening at Alabama. Saban will fit it quickly with someone we all recognize. \nCurrent co-coordinator Mike Locksley? \nFormer Oregon coach Mark Helfrich? \nFormer receivers coach and current Arizona State OC Billy Napier? \nKelly? \nOr, put another way, whoever Tua Tagovailoa wants? \nSomething seems to be conspiring against this Alabama dynasty. First, a Clemson student manager masquerading as a slot receiver ( Hunter Renfrow ) runs rings around future NFL pros in the secondary , then Sarkisian gets upwardly mobile. \nBut who can blame him? Even Saban understands that you hire assistants who want to become head coaches. Never mind that Sark and Lane Kiffin seem to be acting out that concept in reverse. \nThe New Guy calling the plays will be Saban's sixth offensive coordinator in 11 seasons. Who remembers that Major Applewhite was Saban's first OC at Alabama? Jim McElwain stayed forever -- four seasons -- and won two rings. \nKiffin coached three different quarterbacks for three different SEC championship teams. All three QBs had career years. \nHow hard can the job be? \nThey're all using Saban as much as Saban used them. That's not an Alabama thing, it's a college football thing. Sure, it's a bit surprising that Sark would be valued so much by the NFL at this point. \nA month ago, Sarkisian told reporters he was still undergoing treatment for substance abuse . Alcoholism is never \"cured.\" You manage the urge and your quality of life until the end. \nIt can also be argued the NFL isn't the place to go if you want to lessen the pressure. But we are not here to judge. A promotion is a promotion. A man in possession of a USC championship ring, Sarkisian's had a few lately. \nYou can blame last month's CFP National Championship loss on a lot of things. Steve Sarkisian isn't one of them. \nThe defense couldn't catch its breath. The Tide scored 31 and lost. \nIn fact, that's the way the last three season-ending losses have gone for Saban (2013, 2014, 2016) That spans three offensive coordinators and not enough stops by the defense against Oklahoma (2013 Sugar Bowl), Ohio State (CFP Semifinal) and Clemson. \nAnd let's not forget Sarkisian was on the sidelines because Kiffin was probably the only guy who could get fired from a job he already quit . \nIn three seasons, it can be argued Kiffin overstayed his welcome. Sark hardly had time to unpack in T-Town. \nIf there is a coffee table book in the works, it shouldn't go much beyond 38 pages -- one for each his days on the job as Bama's offensive coordinator. \nI'm happy for Sark. We all should be. Yes, there was surprise within the Alabama football offices on Tuesday. But that's all it was. \nWhoever gets the OC job will be the 23rd assistant to work for Saban in Tuscaloosa. Alabama's head man seems to have managed the turnover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:17:01.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
