The Premier League has seen a fair few brothers in the past, and we could be about to see another family connection. \nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola wants to bring brothers Lucas and Theo Hernandez to the club in a Â£40 million deal. \nThe pair, who currently play for Atletico Madrid, have impressed in recent months and Guardiola has already sent scouts to watch the Hernandez brothers on numerous occasions this season. \nBack in December, Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin said that the club turned down a double bid by Manchester City for brothers Lucas and Theo this summer, but Guardiola is looking to make another bid. \n\"They [City] were prepared to pay the buyout clause in both cases. City would have been able to pay it perfectly and the players could have easily gone.\" \n\"Atletico did what it had to do to for them to stay, which was to improve their contracts and to increase their buyout clauses.\" Marin said. \n20-year-old Lucas Hernandez played 16 games in all competitions for the first team last season, and is impressive at the club. \nHis brother, Theo, is currently playing well in a loan spell at Alaves. \nIt is believed Manchester City are willing to pay both of their release clauses in the summer. \nPep is already planning for the future at City.Can the Hernandez brothers make it work in the Premier League? \nLet us know your thoughts.
