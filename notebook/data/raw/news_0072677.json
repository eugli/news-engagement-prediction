Enlarge Image \nCasey Neistat, man of the (YouTube) people. \nSamsung has Oscars history. \nIts Oscars night all-star selfie featuring almost everyone who believe they're anyone even made the president jealous . President Obama, that is. \nOn Sunday, Samsung tried to ensure it's seen as cool again -- and certainly cooler than Apple. \nFor here was an ad featuring, of all people renowned vlogger -- and not exactly always an Apple fanperson -- Casey Neistat. In this Samsung ad, Neistat explained that he represented \"the creators of this generation.\" \nThese are the people who \"don't have big awards shows or fancy cameras.\" They merely have phones, duct tapes, parking lots and guts. Oh, and an idea that needs to be told. \nStrange ideas, silly ideas, but, at least for some, uplifting, crazy, educational and life-affirming ideas. His is the generation of can-dos, those who won't be told they can't. Indeed, the tagline to this opus is \"Do What You Can't.\" \nShould you not have been alive in 2003, Neistat rose to online fame with a little movie entitled \" iPod's Dirty Secret .\" In it, he revealed that the iPod's battery only lasted 18 months. \nHe's been a tiny thorn in Apple's love-handles on occasion since then. \nIn 2013, for example, he mused : \"I am so disappointed in Apple. I don't even use an iPhone anymore. Their marketing sucks. It's embarrassing. It's just garbage. If you had asked me the day Steve Jobs died, 'What's the biggest fear for what might happen with Apple?' I would have described to you what's happening right now.\" More Technically Incorrect", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:26:24.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
