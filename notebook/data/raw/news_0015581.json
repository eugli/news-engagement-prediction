On Sunday, Lady Gaga leveled the Super Bowl audience with an incredible 13-minute half-time show that involved acrobatics, awe-inspiring choreography, and a keytar. But where did the Grammy-winning pop star stay in Houston while preparing for her biggest performance to date? A five-star hotel? A sci-fi egg vessel left over from a previous performance? A castle in the sky recommended by Beyoncé ? Nope, on Monday, the Grammy winner revealed that she stayed in a five-bedroom mansion listed on Airbnb. Loading View on Instagram Lady Gaga took to Instagram hours after performing to thank Airbnb for her Houston accommodations. . . making the performer just the latest celebrity to name-check Airbnb on social media in what seemed like product placement for a comped vacation. (Previously, Gwyneth Paltrow, Mariah Carey, and even freaking Beyoncé have plugged the company.) Soon after Lady Gaga’s post went live, E! reported which Airbnb-listed property Lady Gaga chose for her Super Bowl weekend. The home? A $20 million, 9,768-square-foot mansion, complete with resort-inspired pool, home movie theater (and popcorn machine), wood-fired pizza oven, bocce court, wine cellar, sauna, and impressive name: Villa Encantado (which translates roughly to mean \"charmed\"). So essentially, she stayed in a mansion pretty much like your place. Last year, when Beyoncé performed during the Super Bowl half-time show, also also stayed at an Airbnb for the trip, and also Instagrammed a plug for the company—an exceedingly rare promotion for her. Her borrowed San Francisco abode was a 12-acre estate complete with a private orchard, 270-degree views of San Francisco, a vanished-edge pool and spa, fitness center, and gated surveillance. However, unlike Lady Gaga, Bey’s Airbnb plug has mysteriously disappeared from her Instagram feed into the ether. . .
