McFarland designated for assignment to open up a 40-man roster spot, give Baltimore another potential starting or relief option. Nuno, 29, went 1-1 with a 3.53 ERA and a 4.64 strikeout/walk ratio in 55 games (one start) with the Seattle Mariners last season. \nâ€¢ Spring: Tickets | Ballpark | 40-man roster | NRIs \n\"Our scouts like how Vidal Nuno competes in the American League and old school baseball people will appreciate how he works fast, throws strikes and changes speeds,\" Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette said. \"We look forward to his contributions to the 2017 club.\" \nNuno has a career 4.02 ERA in 126 career Major League games (42 starts) with the Mariners, Arizona Diamondbacks, and New York Yankees. His role with the Orioles right now looks to be as a potential long reliever though he does add some starting depth for a primarily right-handed rotation. Orioles manager Buck Showalter referenced last week that the club could have closer Zach Britton , situational lefty Donnie Hart and another lefty in its bullpen. \nMoseley, 22, went 0-1 with a 3.20 ERA (7 ER/19.2 IP) in 12 games with Class-A Aberdeen last season. The 27-year-old McFarland went 2-2 with a 6.93 ERA in 16 games with the Orioles last season. is a reporter for MLB.com.
