Carmona said that they will give residents a month grace period to come into compliance. \n“We hope that people will go ahead and voluntarily comply with the rules but if the problems is persistent we will go ahead and take enforcement action,” he said. \nSmokers will face a fine of up to $200. \nBut the ban only applies to burning tobacco products. Vaping and e-cigarettes will still be allowed under the new ordinance.
