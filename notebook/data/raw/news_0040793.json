A commission of inquiry, used only once before to investigate former justice and Labor minister Lionel Murphy, differs from a royal commission only in that it reports to the parliament instead of executive government. \nThe Greens briefed Senate crossbenchers on the details of a commission of inquiry, which could see an investigation run by three judges appointed by the Senate. \nSuch commission would have likely have support in the Senate but would need two Coalition MPs to support it in the lower house. LNP MP George Christensen told Guardian Australia he would support a commission of inquiry in the absence of a royal commission. But no other Coalition members have yet indicated support for such an inquiry. \nFellow Queensland LNP MP Warren Entsch , who has long pursued the banks on behalf of victims, remains in favour of a tribunal that can levy enforceable financial penalties on banks rather than a royal commission. \nEntsch would not support a commission of inquiry at this stge. \nEntsch would like to see a tribunal award penalties set at three times the amount of the financial damage sustained by customers, if the bank is proven to be negligent. Excluding big banks from tax cuts not practical, says Turnbull Read more \nHe said one of the victims had sustained financial damages of more than $100m for the loss of his civil construction company. He said the victim had cancer and any royal commission would take too long. \n“We are starting to see the ads, the banks are clearly starting to get the message but if you really want to change the bank culture, you have to hit in them in the back pocket, in the wallet,” Entsch told Guardian Australia. \nEntsch said he believed the prime minister was in favour of such a tribunal, even though the Coalition appeared to walk away from the idea late last year after an interim report by the Ramsey review into the dispute resolution process for bank complaints.
