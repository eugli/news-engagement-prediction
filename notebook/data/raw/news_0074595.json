I understand that in this instance, the case did not go to tribunal. ‘In the interests of transparency and in order to ensure confidence in the fitness to practise regulations, it is important that patients are always clear why and how such processes have been followed. I intend to discuss this with the GMC.’ The failings were exposed in a ‘confidential’ report from the local health board, which oversees GP surgeries in the area where Ellie-May Clark lived with her mother. It found the ‘bright and fun-loving girl was sent home from school early on 26 January, 2015, because teachers were concerned her asthma was ‘deteriorating’. Her mother Shanice, 25, made an emergency appointment at The Grange Clinic in Newport and was told to arrive at 5pm. But that gave her just 25 minutes to arrange childcare for her two-month-old baby, and she had to plead with a friend to give her and Ellie-May a lift to the surgery a mile away. Miss Clark claims her mobile phone was showing 5.04pm when she arrived and was faced with a queue at the reception desk. Earlier this month the Mail revealed how 19 doctors whose mistakes led to fatal errors had been let off with a warning by the GMC But she was turned away and an NHS ‘serious concern’ report claimed Dr Rowe shouted at a receptionist: ‘No, I’m not seeing her she’s late.’ After being turned away, Miss Clark took her daughter home. But five hours later, at 10.35pm, she suffered a seizure and stopped breathing. The unconscious schoolgirl was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital by ambulance with Miss Clark following in a police car, but tragically she was pronounced dead. A subsequent health board investigation found staff were ‘fearful of questioning’ Dr Rowe, who claimed to be prone to ‘angry outbursts’. It concluded the ‘root cause’ of Ellie-May’s death was that Dr Rowe refused to see her ‘because she was brought in late.’ It also revealed that Dr Rowe had been warned months earlier by a paediatrician that Ellie-May was ‘at risk of another episode of severe / life-threatening asthma.’ She agreed to attend a GMC hearing in May last year, held behind closed doors, where she agreed to have a written warning added to her record, which will be removed in five years. Ellie-May’s grandmother, Brandi Clark, 43, said: ‘They were a few minutes late and Shanice even told the receptionist they wouldn’t be there on time. ‘But Dr Rowe was angry that they weren’t punctual and sent them away. Her decision cost our gorgeous little girl her life. ‘Our lives have been shattered but Dr Rowe has been allowed to get a new job and quietly move on with her life as if nothing ever happened.’ An Aneurin Bevan University Health Board spokeswoman said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Ellie-May. ‘We can confirm that Dr Rowe no longer works within the health board area, and also that we referred the doctor to the GMC who investigated in accordance with their procedures.’ Earlier this month the Mail revealed how 19 doctors whose mistakes led to fatal errors had been let off with a warning by the GMC. Their identities and details of their mistakes would have remained a secret had they not been exposed in a freedom of information request. Allegations against doctors are considered by two senior GMC staff, who can choose to take no further action, to issue a warning, to agree re-training, or to refer to a medical tribunal. Warnings are held against a medic’s name on the GMC register for five years, after which they are cleared entirely, but they are not displayed in surgeries. Charlie Massey, Chief Executive of the General Medical Council, said: ‘We strive to keep patients and their families fully informed about the progress of our investigations. We accept that this didn’t happen in this case and we would like to apologise to the family for not doing so. We will contact the Clark family to discuss this further. ‘Formal warnings are issued after a thorough investigation, when a doctor’s behaviour or performance shows a significant departure from the standards we expect of them. We publish the warning - detailing the shortcomings in the care provided - on the online register for all patients and employers to see. ‘Only when two case examiners decide that a warning is appropriate – and the doctor has not disputed the facts – we will issue this serious response, which remains on a doctor’s pubic record for five years. ‘As part of revalidation we expect all doctors to have reflected on significant events, feedback from patients, and complaints, in order to demonstrate they are fit to practise.’ Additional reporting: Tom Bedford Share or comment on this article 73", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:58:37.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
