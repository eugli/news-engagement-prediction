Story continues below \nTHE FACTS \nA 2008 joint study by Canada and the European Union suggested trade would increase by 20 per cent and generate $12 billion annually in new economic activity – a gain of almost one per cent of gross domestic product yearly in Canada. The government says the ripple effects would translate into an extra $1,000 for every Canadian family, and 80,000 new jobs nationwide as tariffs are eliminated and the price to ship and purchase goods drops. \nSimilar studies have also pegged an economic boost from CETA, but with lower effects on gross domestic product. \nREAD MORE: Cheaper wine, cheese and avocados: How trade deals impact the price of your favourite things \nA study published in the International Journal of Political Economy in September estimates 23,000 job losses in Canada over the next seven years – a blip in the domestic job market – and 200,000 job losses in the EU. The wage impacts under the economic models used in the paper would also be different than what the government says: The authors predict that average annual earnings would decline by almost $2,500 by 2023. \nTHE EXPERTS \nResearch shows that overall, countries that liberalize trade see gains in jobs, average incomes, and standard of living, says Ian Lee from the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University. The benefits accrue in the long run, and may not materialize immediately, he said. But, Lee said, not everybody benefits, pointing to the Canadian textiles industry that suffered job losses after NAFTA was signed. \nThe editor of the International Journal of Political Economy, Mario Seccareccia, an economics professor from the University of Ottawa, said the September research paper suggests benefits will accrue disproportionately to upper income earners, leaving working class people behind. \nWATCH: Justin Trudeau addresses free trade, highlights middle-class concerns during trip to Europe \nOn the other hand, the narrow assumptions underlying earlier studies may severely underestimate the economic gains to Canada, said Domenico Lombardi, director of the global economy program at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \nLombardi said CETA is more than a trade deal. It’s a new-generation agreement that includes provisions about harmonizing regulations and fostering greater co-operation. In that sense, he said, there are benefits that accrue to everyone, from companies down to consumers, although the benefits are more difficult to quantify. \nAll this leads to a question, posed by Dan Ciuriak, former deputy chief economist at Global Affairs Canada: “Who did the prime minister have in mind when he said, ‘everyone’?” \nCiuriak said CETA has a small, positive effect on Canada and the EU overall under the conventional economic models, making it good for all as Trudeau suggested. And consumers in Canada in the EU are likely to see more choice and lower prices, meaning “everyone” in that sense is better off under CETA, he said. \nREAD MORE: Imposing tariffs on US goods likely to increase costs for Canadian consumers \nThe effects of the deal will vary by province and between EU member nations, but there is no independent study that considers the impacts of CETA on provinces that shows all would be in positive territory, said Ciuriak, who was responsible for economic analysis of proposed trade agreements in his last posting at Global Affairs Canada. (Global Affairs Canada’s website includes a section about provincial benefits.) \nThere will likely be negative effects in other countries not part of the deal as their exports are displaced by a newfound preference between Canada and the EU, Ciuriak said. \nTHE VERDICT \n“Overall, taking into consideration that it is a political statement, rather than a nuanced, footnoted academic assessment, I would characterize it primarily as beef, not baloney,” Ciuriak said. \nUnfortunately, beef isn’t on the rating scale – at least not yet. \nBut given all the above, Trudeau’s comment earns a rating of “some baloney” because key information is missing. In its place, is the ability for the anyone to describe “everyone” in their own way. \nWATCH: Trudeau assures CETA trade deal will benefit all amid economic anxieties \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians. Each claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the following scale: \nNo baloney – the statement is completely accurate \nA little baloney – the statement is mostly accurate but more information is required \nSome baloney – the statement is partly accurate but important details are missing \nA lot of baloney – the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth \nFull of baloney – the statement is completely inaccurate \nSOURCES \nAddress by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the European Parliament: http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/02/16/address-prime-minister-justin-tr http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/ \nPierre Kohler and Servaas Storm: “CETA Without Blinders: How Cutting `Trade Costs and More’ Will Cause Unemployment, Inequality and Welfare Losses.” September 2016: http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/16-03CETA.pdf \nGlobal Affairs Canada: “(CETA) Benefits for provinces and territories.” http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accor http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-ac \nStanding Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade: “Free Trade Agreements: A tool for economic prosperity.” February 2017: https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/committee/421/AEFA/reports/FreeTrad https://senca \nColin Kirkpatrick, et al: “A trade SIA relating to the negotiation of a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada.” June 2011: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/september/tradoc-148201.p ht \nEU and Government of Canada: “Assessing the costs and benefits of a closer EU-Canada economic partnership.” 2008: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2008/october/tradoc-141032.pdf \nRBC Economics Research: “The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.” October 2013: http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/other-reports/CETA http © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:02:15.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
