Conway said refugees were banned for six months after the incident, when in fact former President Barack Obama ordered a review of the rules for allowing Iraqi refugees into the country.\nThe letter also took issue with Conway’s flippant comment to “buy Ivanka’s stuff,” made after one large chain dropped first daughter Ivanka Trump’s line of products.\nAdvertisement – story continues below\n“Federal rules on conflicts of interest specifically prohibit using public office ‘for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity,’” the complaint said.\nConway’s use of the term “alternative facts” last month was also used as evidence against her.\n“‘Alternative facts’ are not facts at all; they are lies,” the professors said in their letter.\n  ICE: More Than 950,000 Illegal Immigrants With Active Deportation Orders At Large ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis Takes Only Three Hours Of Rest Before Returning To Work As McCain Steps Up Criticism Of Trump, He Makes Surprise Trip To Syria “We believe that, at one time, Ms. Conway, understood her ethical responsibilities as a lawyer and abided by them. But she is currently acting in a way that brings shame upon the legal profession,” the letter said.\nAlthough Conway is listed as a D.C. Bar member, she is also listed as “suspended” because she has not paid dues.\nPrior to her White House job and her work on President Donald Trump’s campaign, Conway was a pollster.\nD.C. Disciplinary Counsel Wallace Shipp Jr. said he gets about 1,500 complaints a year and acts on about a third of them.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:52:16.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
