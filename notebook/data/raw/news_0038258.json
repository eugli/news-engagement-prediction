This is probably the biggest haul of FICN in new Rs 2000 bills in the region. \n\nThe special team tracking down FICN rackets in the area arrested Umar Faruk who had gone to meet another racketeer with samples of the fake bill on Tuesday. During the course of investigation, the team came to know about the consignment, which was scheduled to reach India from Bangladesh in the early hours of Wednesday. Based on leads from Faruk, the BSF and NIA teams laid an ambush at the zero line villages and the consignment was seized. The carrier, however, managed to flee. \n\nFaruk alias Firoz, a 19-year-old resident of Churiantpur village, is believed to be a part of the chain which receives such fake currency bill consignments from the border and ferries them deeper into the country. Special squads of the BSF and NIA have been tracking down Faruk since 2015 in a case of smuggling of fake currency notes of a face value of Rs 594,000. \n\nOn Tuesday, he was apprehended with three fake Rs 2000 bills and a mobile phone. \n\nFaruk’s arrest is a tell-tale sign of juveniles being roped into FICN rackets as carriers. At least three members of his family are serving jail terms for difference cases of FICN smuggling. \n\nChuriantpur’s geography has perhaps helped shaping his destiny. The biggest village on the zero line in Malda is a conduit for smuggling of fake Indian currency notes from Bangladesh into India. It is home to at least 20 syndicates. \"Most of the families in this village have taken FICN smuggling as their profession. Demonetisation has hit them bad. But, it has almost become an industry here and they will not let it die a silent death,\" a senior official of BSF intelligence wing told ET. \n\nAt least 25 people are involved in end-to-end supply chain of FICN. The business also calls for huge investments for procuring printing machines and payment to carriers like Faruk. Since the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes dealt a huge blow to the business, they began trying hard to regain the market with fake bills of the new currency notes. \n\n\"This is basically a trial and error method for them to assess the response of the common people to the new FICN,\" the official said. \n\nThe notes seized on Wednesday appear to be of the similar quality of those that the police had found in Murshidabad recently. While the security agencies confirmed these attempts are part of a \"sample survey\" for FICN smuggling racket, the sleuths have traced the origin of fake notes to a \"small village\" in Bangladesh, and not in Pakistan. \n\nThe racketeers have breached most of the security features adopted in the new currency bills, but the quality of the paper still remained beyond their reaches. \"In this recent seizure, we have seen notes are of better quality. But, the paper is of poor quality, while the original note is of finer quality; it has a shine. The pulp that is used to get that print is itself one of the security measures taken. So, we are suspecting that the fake bills might have been printed in some local printing unit is Bangladesh,\" said a senior BSF official.
