Chicago needs help!” Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there – totally out of control. Chicago needs help! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017 \nThe tweet comes in the wake of reports that Chicago saw its deadliest day of the year, so far, with seven homicides across the city on Wednesday. \nTrump recently threatened to “send in the Feds” if Chicago couldn’t fix the “carnage.” \nChicago city officials have offered measured responses to Trump’s criticisms, saying additional federal resources would be welcome. \nTrump, as a Republican presidential candidate, continuously made Chicago the butt of remarks about urban violence and failed policies. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:52:02.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
