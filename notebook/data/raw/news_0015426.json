His work has been cited by the Associated Press Sports Editors and the New Jersey Press Association, and his 2011 column on the tragedy at Mainland Regional High School won first place in the New Jersey Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. \nAnastasia has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1980, serving as a Philadelphia Eagles beat writer as well as a sports columnist and sports editor at the Courier-Post in Cherry Hill, N.J. before joining The Inquirer. More by Phil Anastasia \nAnthony Duca led off with a technical fall. \nJoey Perez came next with a major decision. \nSam Giordano finished up with a pin. \nJust like that, the senior light-middleweights set the tone for Paulsboro's 43-19 victory over Collingswood in a clash of Colonial Conference wrestling teams on Friday night. \nIt was strong work for the trio of 12th-graders. \nIt was typical. \nAnd it was fitting as the veteran leaders of an otherwise baby-faced team showed the way in a victory that kept alive hope for the fabled program's first undefeated season in 17 years. \n\"To be the first Paulsboro team to do that in 17 years, that's pretty special,\" Giordano said. \nIn running their record to 18-0, the Red Raiders got pins from sophomore Geno Duca at 113 pounds and freshman Brandon Green at 152 pounds as well as a dramatic overtime victory from senior Frank Mooney at 285 pounds. \nBut, as usual, it was the threesome of Anthony Duca, Perez and Giordano that seized command of the match for the Red Raiders as each registered bonus points in imposing performances before a large crowd in Paulsboro's gym. \n\"It seems like one or more of us always is getting bonus points,\" said Anthony Duca, who won by a 19-4 score at 126 pounds. \nPerez followed up with a 14-5 win at 138 pounds. And when Giordano pinned at 5 minutes at 145 pounds, Paulsboro's lead had swelled to 34-6 and any doubt about the outcome of the match had vanished into the cold February night. \n\"This team has done a lot,\" Perez said. \"We've got some young guys who get a little nervous before a big match, but [the seniors] try to calm them down, get them focused.\" \nCollingswood (19-4) got a big win from Andy Clark in a matchup of top freshmen at 106 pounds as well as an impressive victory from senior Sean Miles at 160 pounds and a pin from Mike Taulane at 182 pounds. \n\"We could have wrestled better,\" Collingswood coach Dechlin Moody said. \"Always could have wrestled better. But next week [the state team tournament] is a new season.\" \nWhen Paulsboro coach Paul Morina said this has been an \"easy\" season for the Red Raiders, he wasn't talking about the level of competition. \nThere's struggle in every wrestling season. That's the nature of the sport. \nMorina was talking about the leadership of his three senior light-middleweights and the example they have set for a team that sometimes has seven freshmen or sophomores in the lineup. \n\"This was an easy season as a coach,\" Morina said. \"It was easy because of those [three] guys. They managed the team. They are great leaders. They bring it all.\" \nSince the trio are so close in weight - separated by just 16 pounds - they often work out together in the Paulsboro wrestling room. \nAnd fireworks often erupt. \n\"Sometimes we get ticked off at each other,\" said Giordano, who has a 24-5 record. \"But coach said you can't be friendly with your teammates in the room. You have to push each other.\" \nSaid Perez after improving his record to 25-4: \"We wrestle each other like we don't even know each other.\" \nAnthony Duca raised his record to 28-2 with another performance that bodes well for his hopes for striking deep into the individual state tournament later this month and into March. \n\"All three of us get after each other,\" Duca said. \"We push each other to be better, to make the team better.\" \nThe trio are well aware of the history of Paulsboro wrestling, and the opportunity before them next week: To add the hardware from another Group 1 state title to the school's overstuffed trophy case. \nThat's special in any season. \nBut especially senior season. \n\"It's kind of sad, actually,\" Perez said. \"We know this is our last time, our last shot. That's why we're all trying to make the most of it.\" \nPaulsboro 43, Collingswood 19 \n220: Kingsley Ayeni, C, d. Miles Moore, 3-2; 285: Frank Mooney, P, d. Matt Meloni, 4-2; 106: Andy Clark, C, d.
