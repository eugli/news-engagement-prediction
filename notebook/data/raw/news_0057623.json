(Carrollton Police Department – Facebook) \nOfficers discovered the dog, along with the heroin, inside a car parked at Home Depot in Carrollton Saturday, after arresting its owners for switching price tags on merchandise in the store. \n“He was extraordinarily lethargic, almost comatose,” recalled emergency veterinarian Dr. Stacie Fowler. \n“He was really on the verge of not breathing.” \nDr. Fowler said the symptoms were typical of a dog that’s ingested opiates, something she sees fairly frequently at the North Texas Emergency Pet Clinic. \n“Really common. Every shift,” she said of overdose cases. “We see a lot of marijuana toxicity, amphetamine toxicity, legal prescribed drugs that they’ve gotten into accidentally, like ADHD.” \nAnimals most often survive after being treated for an overdose. \nLucky was in fact, “Lucky,” that police found him when they did. \n“If he had not received treatment, he would have stopped breathing,” she said. \nNow in the care of Carrollton Animal Services, he’s bounced back. \n“He’s very outgoing, very playful, a little camera shy,” said Skenesky. \nThe department hopes they’ll be able to place him with a loving family. \nLucky’s previous owners are now charged with fraud and drug possession. \nThomas Romero, 46, and Nina Crawford, 38, were arrested for heroin possession and for fraudulent destruction, removal, or concealment of writing. \nCharges for animal abuse have not been ruled out. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
