It also wanted to get better, and that happened, too.   \nATHENS, Ga. -- Kirby Smart described his second National Signing Day as Georgia's head coach as \"an exciting, uneventful day.\" The Bulldogs added just three prospects on Wednesday, all defensive backs, and held on to all 23 of their previous commitments. \nOnce the dust settled, Smart felt like he and his staff got a lot of work done -- especially in regards to becoming a bigger football team in general. \n\"We think we attacked a lot of areas of concern for us. I think it’s a good group,\" Smart said. \"I think we did not deviate very far from our size criteria. When you look at certain positions you want to get certain sized guys. We were able to do that. We were able to hit some areas, especially on the offensive line, the defensive secondary, that we had some guys leave that we needed to replace. All in all, it was a good class.\" (Photo: UGA Athletics: Jon Paul Van Wert) \nOnly two of UGA's 26 additions in the currently class are under six-feet tall. When it comes to the offensive line pledges, the average over 6-foot-5, 334 pounds each. The Bulldogs also signed four cornerbacks who are 6-feet or taller after starting a pair of players in Malkom Parrish and Deandre Baker in 2016 who measure in at 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-11 respectively. \nThen there's just overall quality. Smart and company appear to have hit a homerun there with nation's third-ranked class according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. The Bulldogs have over 300 points, something that only three other schools, Alabama, Florida and Ohio State, have done. \nIn order to put together a group talent like that, it takes a lot of hard work.

If you counted the man-hours, the phone calls, the text messages, the Saturdays and Sundays that people spend away from their families up here, I think it’s pretty incredible the amount of time that goes into each one of these guys we were able to bring into our program.\" \nDon't confuse that with a complaint. Smart told reporters on Wednesday that the most important aspects of building a program are acquiring top talent (recruiting) and developing it. According to him, that's how you build a championship-level football team. \nIdentifying the guys you want is also key. Smart doesn't necessarily think that landing all the top kids in the Peach State is necessary. Landing the right kids, however, is a priority. That's why he and his staff spend a great deal of time watching film and evaluating players. Before a staff can truly target a prospect, the coaches have to figure out whether they want him or not. \nOnce that happens, recruiting said player isn't just the job of the head coach, assistants, or support staff. It's a process the entire team takes part in. \n\"I think the credit goes to our team. Our juniors that decided to stay built a lot of momentum for us in recruiting,\" Smart said. \"I think any time you’ve got players that decide to stay who have an opportunity to go to the NFL, it speaks volumes for their character and what they want to do for the University of Georgia, but it also helps in recruiting because at the end of the day, good players recruit good players. When your good players stay at your university, they help recruit the student-athletes that are coming to your place.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
