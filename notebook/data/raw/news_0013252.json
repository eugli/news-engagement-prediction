In what was considered to be a veiled attack at Sasikala, the ace spinner had tweeted about the job opportunities opening up with Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and his entire cabinet’s resignation. In his recent tweet, Ashwin joked that it was only a job creation drive and had nothing to do with politics. Earlier today, Tamil Nadu governor V S Rao had accepted Chief Minister Panneerselvam’s resignation but had asked him to hold the office till all other arrangements had been made. This had cleared V K Sasikala’s path to take the oath as Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister.\nGuys please cool it down, it is a job creation drive.Nothing to do with Politics. #howmuchtwisting ????\n— Ashwin Ravichandran (@ashwinravi99) February 6, 2017", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ashwinravi99/status/828513138546860032", "http://twitter.com/hashtag/howmuchtwisting?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:25:02.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
