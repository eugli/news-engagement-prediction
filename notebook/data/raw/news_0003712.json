I think it'd be sold out with two or three months left for the people at home.\" \nThe sheer number of empty yellow seats at the Wellington Sevens has thrown into question whether the city deserves such an event. \nOnce a thriving weekend of sevens action, the atmosphere was described as dull and boring, particularly after New Zealand were out of the race to win the tournament. Advertisement \nNew Zealand Rugby has two years left on its three-year deal to host a round of the world sevens series. There is the option of moving the event to another city, however, nothing has been locked in. \nNew Zealand captain Scott Curry described the weekend's flop as \"disappointing\", and said it would be a shame to see the event moved. \n\"That'd be definitely disappointing if we lost it,\" Curry said. \"That's something New Zealand Rugby would have to look at. \n\"That's the only chance we get to play in front of our own fans and our family and friends. We travel the world, which is pretty cool, but there's nothing like playing in front of your family and friends.\" \nDespite Fiji's success at the Olympics, the real question is whether an event there would be financially viable, given the smaller stadiums and potential lack of corporate dollars. \nKolinisau threw up Suva as a possible destination, and although thousands of Fijians would be desperate to see their heroes compete against the world's best on home soil, it would not be an easy decision for World Rugby. \nKolinisau has fond memories of playing in Sydney last year in front of a healthy Fijian support base. \n\"We thought we were playing at home,\" he said. \"We're expecting them to be out in numbers and with flags and helping get the boys forward this weekend.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:13:15.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
