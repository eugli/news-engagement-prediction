The Patriots owner said he would get Putin his own personal ring if he could get the original ring back. \n“I was willing to have one made with his name on it,” Kraft told Fox News’ Chris Wallace. “Maybe we’ll have the new president bring it to him when he connects with him.” Putin, Super Bowl ring thief…Can Pres.

Originally, Kraft had told the media that he gifted Putin his 2005 Super Bowl ring. But in 2013, he told the New York Post that the Russian president had actually taken it without permission. \n“I do have an emotional attachment to that ring,” Kraft said Sunday. “Maybe if we win Sunday I could trade a new one with him — have one made up in good spirit of friendship.” \nWallace suggested Trump could be the “courier.” \n“Right, we’ll have him do that,” Kraft said.
