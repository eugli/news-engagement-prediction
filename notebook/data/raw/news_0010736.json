He died early on Sunday at the age of 71 from a kind of cancer. \n\"We are losing the elected members of this Parliament one by one. It is truly very painful for me,\" the prime minister said. \n\"We are losing those who accompanied us during the struggle for democracy, who took part in the Liberation War. We, the old ones, will have to leave. But we want the young ones to take the country forward holding the spirit of Liberation War in their heart,\" she added. Speaking about Suranjit, she said, \"We together took part in the struggle for democracy. \nHe believed in progressive, secular and democratic politics.\" \nRecalling his arrest during the military regime of HM Ershad, she said army personnel kicked and broke the door of Suranjit's home. \n\"His son (Soumen Sengupta), 9 to 10 years of age at that time, was traumatised by that incident. He has recovered after treatment in Canada for a long time,\" she said. \n\"We had to face many such incidents during our political career,\" she added. \nShe also remembered the role Suranjit played as a key member of the committee to make the Constitution. \nHe later played a key role in bringing the 15th Amendment to the Constitution. \nThe amendment brought 55 changes to the Constitution, some of them reversions to the 1972 Constitution. Suranjit was the co-chair of the constitution amendment committee. \n\"We re-established the Constitution, which was bruised by the bayonet. Suranjit Sengupta was our companion in this struggle,\" Hasina said. \nShe also recalled how Suranjit spoke at the meetings of the committee to make the Constitution. \n\"There were not many who could speak at that time. Apparently, Suranjit Sengupta was an all-encompassing talent who had the thorough knowledge of the constitution and legal matters.” \n“Bangabandhu encouraged him and let him speak. That's how Bangabandhu paved the way for him to become a good leader and parliamentarian,\" she said. \nThe leader of the Opposition in Parliament, Raushon Ershad, said, \"He was a shining star in Parliament. I feel bad to think that he is not here anymore. So many qualities in one person are very rare.\" \nThe MPs stood silent for a minute in Parliament commemorating Suranjit before the passage of the condolence motion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:24:00.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
