He was about to leave for Macau. \nFour people have so far been arrested in the probe into his death. \nLast Wednesday, the first suspect, who holds a Vietnamese passport bearing the name Doan Thi Huong, was arrested at KLIA2 as she was preparing to board a flight to Vietnam. \nA day later, Indonesian Siti Aisyah was arrested at a hotel in Ampang at 2am. \nPolice said she was identified based on CCTV footage at the airport and was alone at the time of arrest. \nHer boyfriend was also picked up by police to assist with investigations. \nSiti Aisyah had taken a taxi from a hotel in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi to the airport that day. \nThe fourth suspect arrested over the assassination has been identified as North Korean Ri Jong-chol, from Pyongyang. \nThe 47-year-old man, who has expertise in chemistry, was detained after police raided a condominium in Jalan Kuchai Lama on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:18:05.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
