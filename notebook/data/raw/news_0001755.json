Comment on This Story Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer Texas Rangers catcher Jonathan Lucroy (25) blocks the throw as it comes in from the outfield as the Angels score a third-inning run during the Los Angeles Angels vs. the Texas Rangers major league baseball game at Globe Life Park in Arlington on Wednesday, September 21, 2016. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) By Gerry Fraley , Staff Writer Contact Gerry Fraley on Twitter: @gfraley \nARLINGTON -- The Rangers celebrated the unofficial holiday of \"Truck Day\" on Friday. In the first sign of spring training, a semi carrying about 16 tons of equipment pulled out of Globe Life Park for the 1,076-mile drive to Surprise, Ariz. \nNo one welcomed the day more than catcher Jonathan Lucroy. \nThis will be Lucroy's first spring training with the Rangers. He joined the club on Aug. 2 last season in a trade with Milwaukee and had to learn his new team on the fly, a difficult task. \nLucroy will be there from day one this season. That could make a significant difference for him and the club. \nThe Rangers did everything in their power to make it a smooth transition, Lucroy said. Changing teams in mid-season is never easy. Having a full spring to prepare and further familiarize himself with the club can only help. Matt Bush, Rangers closer? There's an arguably more valuable role for him \n\"I've been around long enough to know how it goes,\" Lucroy said. \"At the same time, it is exciting to get out there with a new team for a whole year instead of just two months. It's going to be a lot of fun. \n\"Any time you are around for a full year, I think that helps guys be more comfortable. You know what the deal is. And in that situation, you're able to play better.\" \nOn offense, Lucroy met expectations. In 47 games, he hit .276 with 11 homers, 31 RBIs and an .885 OPS. \nAdd his numbers with Milwaukee, and Lucroy was the top offensive catcher in the majors last season. Having that bat over a full season will help ease the loss of Carlos Beltran, Ian Desmond and Mitch Moreland from last year's club, manager Jeff Banister has said. \nThere is room for improvement as a receiver, Lucroy said. His mechanics began to slip while with Milwaukee, and that continued after the trade. \nThe Rangers' staff had 15 wild pitches in 367 regular-season innings with Lucroy catching. The staff had 30 wild pitches in 1,076 innings with all other catchers. \nLucroy also had three passed balls with the Rangers and a career-high eight overall. \nSpring training is the time for fixing those problems. Could Profar's desire to play every day become a clubhouse problem? What would Texas do if Napoli doesn't sign? \n\"I have some bad habits that I need to get out of my system, things I need to work on,\" Lucroy said. \"That's the beautiful thing about spring training. You're able to work on those things and get the kinks out. I'm going to get better and take it into the season.\" \nLucroy will also have more time to learn the staff and get more out of each pitcher. It was unrealistic to expect him to come in cold during August and lift the staff. The Rangers had a 4.39 ERA with Lucroy and a 4.36 ERA with all other catchers. \n\"He's going to be able to learn the core guys that were here last year a little better,\" Banister said last month. Lucroy will be able to \"put his stamp on what he likes to do behind and plate and how he likes to call a game.\" \nLucroy will not have the benefit of a full spring with the Rangers. He will leave the team in the second week of March to join Team USA for the World Baseball Classic. Lucroy could be gone for more than two weeks. \nThat will not be a problem, Lucroy said. According to Lucroy, Team USA manager Jim Leyland told him that he will share playing time with San Francisco's Buster Posey. Representing the country on an international stage appeals to Lucroy, who also participated in the 2013 event. \n\"You're not playing for anything other than to be the best and national pride,\" Lucroy said. \"It's a serious thing. ... It's an amazing feeling to wear that uniform. It's an experience you can't replace.\" \nThe eventful spring of Jonathan Lucroy is underway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:04:53.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
