Getty Images 4 \nSome celebrities use their platform to spread a message and this has been met with some controversy, with warnings that political speeches should be reserved for other occasions than awards ceremonies. \nMeryl Streep used her speech at the Golden Globes to criticise Donald Trump for his attack on a disabled reporter, and several of the winners at the Baftas earlier this month used their acceptance speeches to attack the US President. \nHere’s what we know about the blue ribbons some celebrities are wearing tonight… Why did Ruth Negga wear a blue ribon and what other celebrities have worn them? \nRuth Negga is nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for Loving and she had the blue ribbon sewn onto her custom made red Valentino gown when she walked the red carpet this evening. \nThe ACLU is of particular significance to Ruth as the movie Loving features the work of the ACLU. The non-profit organisation supplied the legal resources for the couple featured in the film to fight their case in 1958 when their marriage was deemed in violation of Virginia’s anti-miscengenation law. Getty Images 4 Nominee Ruth Negga sported a blue ribbon on her Valentino gown \nLin-Manuel Miranda and his mum both wore a ribbon on the red carpet and Casey Affleck wore one at the Film Independent Spirit Awards where he won the best male lead award for Manchester By The Sea. \nKarlie Kloss had her ribbon attached to the hip of her white dress. Getty Images - FilmMagic Lin-Manuel Miranda What is the ACLU? \nACLU stands for The American Civil Liberties Union and the ribbons are in support of the new “Stand with ACLU” initiative. \nThe campaign was launched last week and Hollywood stars are being encouraged to wear the ribbon as an act of solidarity with the organisation which has campaigned for nearly 100 years to defend and protect the individual civil rights of citizens. \nRecently the ACLU have spoken out about protecting the rights of those they feel have been threatened under the administration of Donald Trump. \nActress Sarah Paulson encouraged viewers to donate to the group during her acceptance speech at the SAG Awards Getty Images - WireImage ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:28:43.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
