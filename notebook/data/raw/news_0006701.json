The superstar, along with the film's co-producer Ritesh Sidhwani , headed to the Golden Temple in Amritsar on Tuesday (January 31) to seek blessings. And when you have Shah Rukh, his tiny tot AbRam can't be far behind. The munchkin accompanied his dad on this holy visit. \n\n\nShah Rukh and his younger son were a sight for sore eyes as they offered prayers together. The doting daddy could also be seen feeding prasad to his little one. The actor was quoted as saying that it was wife Gauri who sent AbRam along as the kid had not been to the Golden Temple before. \n\n\n\nSRK also shared an adorable picture of him and AbRam on his Instagram handle. He captioned the picture, \"At the Sri Darbar Sahib. Peace and love and all feelings beautiful. Thank u Amritsar.\" We surely can't get enough of the father-son duo! \n\n\nAt the Sri Darbar Sahib. Peace and love and all feelings beautiful. Thank u Amritsar. pic.twitter.com/gB53l1HJvK \n\nâ€” Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) January 31, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:23:09.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
