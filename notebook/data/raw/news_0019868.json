(NTB SCANPIX/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 10, 2017, 10:00 PM \nA wave of arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials sparked fear and protests Friday as activists and advocates took to the streets. \nImmigration officials said the sweeps in New York, Southern California, Chicago and other cities were routine and not part of a promised crackdown vowed by President Trump. \nOne man was arrested in Hudson, in upstate Columbia County, according to advocates. \nAt least three others were picked up in surrounding counties, according to Brian MacCormack, an organizer with the Columbia County Sanctuary Movement. \nMacCormack said the group “condemns ICE’s activities in the area, and their attempt to separate families.” \nThe man arrested in Hudson was being held at the Albany county jail. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, was taken into custody Wednesday after coming to the U.S. at age 14. The government under the Obama administration had not deported her after she pleaded guilty to a felony plea a decade ago. (Puente Human Rights Movement via Facebook) \nHundreds gathered at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan Friday evening to denounce the arrests and deportations. \nSimilar protests broke out in Los Angeles, Austin and Phoenix. \nMost of the United States’ 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants live in just 20 major metropolitan areas, with the largest populations in New York, Los Angeles and Houston, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on government data. \nICE officials said this week they conducted an “enforcement surge” that was no different than enforcement actions carried out in the past. \nWhile Trump has vowed to sharpen the federal focus on immigration, his predecessor quietly increased the number of deportations.

(Steve Fluty/AP) \nRoughly 2 million people were deported under President Obama. \nBut immigrant rights groups say the actions are harsher than in the past. \nA mother of two teens who left Mexico when she was 14 and entered the U.S. illegally was deported earlier this week. \nGuadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, was taken into custody Wednesday in Arizona during one of her regular check-ins with ICE. \nGarcia de Rayos was arrested nearly a decade ago for using a false ID to get a job as a janitor at an amusement park. David Marin, of ICE, said removal operations in greater Los Angeles occur two to three times a year. (HANDOUT/REUTERS) \nShe pleaded guilty to a felony charge, but the government during the Obama years declined to deport her despite her being in the country illegally. \nOn Wednesday, she showed up at the ICE building in Phoenix for a scheduled check-in with immigration officers and was swiftly deported to Mexico. \nOfficials denied that the rash of raids was in any way linked to President Trump’s executive order targeting illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. \nDavid Marin, ICE’s field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, told the Associated Press the agency carries out such operations two or three times a year in his region. \nHe said the California operation was in the planning stages “before the administration came out with their current executive orders.” Most undocumented immigrants live in Houston, New York and Los Angeles, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on government data. (NTB SCANPIX/REUTERS) \nRoughly 160 people were arrested during a five-day sweep in Southern California aimed at immigrants with criminal histories and deportation orders, officials said. \nA Salvadoran gang member wanted in his country and a Brazilian drug trafficker were among those arrested. \nThe agency said a “rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible.” \nIn a statement, ICE said “officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in the United States in violation of the federal immigration laws. Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:10:07.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
