His finish makes him the fastest American sailor to complete a nonstop solo circumnavigation, beating a 2005 record of 109 days, 19 hours.\nAdvertisement\nIn a news release, race organizers said Wilson and his vessel, Great American IV, had returned “in almost exactly the same, near-perfect condition as they left.”\nIt was the second time that Wilson, a lifelong mariner and former math teacher with degrees from Harvard and MIT, has finished the Vendée Globe. He also completed the race in 2009, with a time of 121 days, 41 minutes. Twenty-nine boats began the most recent race.\n“To finish two Vendée Globe races with both of his boats in great condition is testament to his impeccable seamanship, his ongoing focus and discipline to stay within the prudent protocols he sets himself, looking to achieve high average speeds and sail very efficiently while keeping the skipper and his boat safe,” Vendée Globe organizers wrote.\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com .
