(Photo: Chris Nelsen, Special to the Detroit Free Press) \nTOLEDO -- James Hudson III almost took the bait. Almost. \nMinutes after signing with Michigan on Wednesday morning, the Toledo Central Catholic four-star defensive lineman was given an opportunity to guarantee a win over rival Ohio State next season. \nHudson, who paused and then cracked a huge smile, instead chose the politically correct response. \n\"You can't predict the future,\" said the 6-foot-5, 290-pounder. \"The rivalry is huge, but you can't just focus on that one game. It's in our head, though.\" CLOSE x Share Toledo Central Catholic football star James Hudson signs with Michigan on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. Video by Chris Nelsen / Special to the DFP \nHudson, an Ohio State fan growing up, said the Buckeyes were his \"dream school\" when he began the recruiting process. After evaluating him as both an offensive and defensive lineman, however, Ohio State never made a scholarship offer. \n\"It's going to be interesting playing against them,\" he said. \"It's going to be fun, but maybe a little awkward at first.\" \nAfter a breakout junior season at Central Catholic, the former Kentucky commit became a hot commodity on the recruiting trail. As a junior and senior, he combined for 162 tackles, including 59 for loss, and 16.5 sacks. He also started at left tackle on offense. \n\"I was happy he decided to explore more options,\" said Glenda Hudson, James' mother. \"He committed to Kentucky very early (before his junior year), and maybe got caught up in the moment. I was very excited when he opened his recruitment back up.\" \nAs the offers rolled in, including one from Alabama, Hudson shifted his focus to Michigan State after being shunned by Ohio State. \n\"My mom really liked coach (Mark) Dantonio. She had never met coach (Jim) Harbaugh,\" Hudson said. \"I wanted the Michigan State offer so bad. That was my next dream school after Ohio State. But then Michigan came into the picture. I took a visit and loved it. I loved everything about Michigan.\" \nHudson received an offer from the Wolverines after an unofficial visit in May. He committed to Michigan on Aug. 8 and took an official visit in December. He also took unofficial trips to Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan State, Notre Dame and Ohio State. MSU, Kentucky and Indiana made offers. \n\"I never hated Michigan growing up, but whenever they played Ohio State, I was always rooting against them,\" Hudson said. \"But I'm a Wolverine now and that's all that matters. I can't wait to get up there.\" \nDespite Hudson's verbal commitment and strong allegiance, Harbaugh took no chances and visited Hudson at his Toledo home last Thursday. \n\"Coach Harbaugh is very exciting, very entertaining,\" Glenda Hudson said. \"I've never laughed so much. We had a good time. He came in, took his shoes off and made himself at home.\" \nJames Hudson also enjoyed his visit with Michigan's eccentric leader. \n\"I wouldn't say he's crazy, but he's a different type of head coach,\" Hudson said. \"You're not going to find another head coach like him. He has a joking side, but also knows when to be serious. You see him on Game Day and he's fired up. That's what I like about coach Harbaugh. He's going to have a huge impact on my life.\" \nHudson, mainly seen as a defensive end in college, said Michigan coaches plan to use him at defensive tackle. That doesn't surprise Central Catholic coach Greg Dempsey. \nToledo Central Catholic senior defensive lineman and future Michigan Wolverine James Hudson III, center, is joined by his mother, Glenda, left, older sister, Ciara, and father, James Hudson Jr., at a signing ceremony at his high school on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017.

He went from having a lot of potential and showing flashes of greatness, to consistently showing it every night and every play.\" 109 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:06:41.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
