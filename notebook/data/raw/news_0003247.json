(Photo: Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports) \nNo matter how the remainder of the winter shapes up, we donâ€™t need a rodent with dubious weather forecasting ability to know that Selection Sunday is six weeks away. \nFebruary has arrived, meaning college basketball coaches and fans want to see their teams round into postseason form. So before the attention of the sports world turns elsewhere on Sunday, here are a few hardwood matters worthy of attention for the day before. Game of the weekend \nNo. 5 Arizona at No. 13 Oregon, Saturday, 4 p.m. ET, ESPN \nThere are a whole lot of Wildcats hanging around the top of the polls. Weâ€™ll look at some other later, but the ones from the Pac-12 headline the slate this weekend. Arizona will be wrapping up its swing through the Beaver State (they faced Oregon State on Thursday), and another conference road win against the highly rated Ducks could enhance the Wildcatsâ€™ case for a No.-1 seed. \nThat wonâ€™t much interest the Ducks, who would like to protect their home venue before next weekendâ€™s tough L.A. trip. No. 2 Kansas survives against No. 3 Baylor with 73-68 win \nThe Wildcats were playing fairly well even before the return of Allonzo Trier from a lengthy suspension, and his insertion into the lineup has been about as smooth as coach Sean Miller could have hoped. Arizona will need contributions from everybody, however, to get by the well-balanced Ducks in Eugene. Player to watch \nIsaiah Briscoe, Kentucky \nFreshman point guard Deâ€™Aaron Fox battling the flu as well as a sore ankle, so Brisco has taken on extra responsibilities in the backcourt for the No. 6 Wildcats. If Fox remains sidelined, heâ€™ll be needed again Saturday as Kentucky heads to No. 23 Florida (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN). His opposite number for the Gators, senior Kasey Hill, is averaging a couple of steals a game and could make life difficult for the Wildcats as they continue struggle in half-court sets. \nRANKING COLLEGE BASKETBALL'S BEST PLAYERS Facebook Posted!
