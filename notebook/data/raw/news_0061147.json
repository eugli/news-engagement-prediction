Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event. And the first lady’s put a lot of time into this event, in welcoming our nation’s governors to the capital, and I have a feeling that’s where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night. MARK RALSTON via Getty Images Donald Trump and his wife Melania are shown attending the 2011 Academy Awards, but the president apparenlty won't be tuning in this time around. \nThe former reality star has fired up feuds with the likes of Meryl Streep (who’s nominated) and has also gotten roasted at previous award shows , so he probably isn’t feeling chummy with show business right about now. Plus, given the anti-administration yuks that will likely spill forth at the Oscars, perhaps Trump wants to spare his ego. \nWhile he may not tune in, we have a sneaking suspicion that the commander-in-chief won’t tune out what transpires on Oscar night. Got that, Twitter? \nHe apparently hasn’t been such a fan of the ceremony anyway, tweeting in 2014 that it was “ amateur night ” and “ bullshit .” In 2015, he issued this politicized critique: The Oscars are a sad joke, very much like our President.
