(Charles Osgood / Chicago Tribune) Jessi Roti \nRuth Ratny, publisher/editor of ReelChicago.com and founder of Screen Magazine, died Tuesday of a heart-related illness, according to her close friend Barbara Roche. \nRatny took ill a week ago, Roche said, and while her death was sudden, it was peaceful. \n\"She never stopped working,\" Roche said. \"She continued writing and writing until the very end.\" Roche met Ratny in 1980 and the two remained the closest of friends, speaking almost daily. Roche was one of many friends with Ratny when she passed away. \n\"The thing about Ruth is she'd say, 'You know, I have this idea,'\" Roche continued. \"She'd have these elaborate ideas that she'd just come up with. It was mind-boggling.\" \nRoche added that Ratny had told her she had begun writing her memoirs and had already outlined all 12 chapters, saying, \"She never wanted to accept the fact she'd leave some day.\" \n\"She broke many, many glass ceilings in her time,\" said Roche. \"She said she started writing when she was 7.\" Ratny was adamant about never revealing her age. \nNancy Reid, a colleague of Ratny at ReelChicago, confirmed her death. \nSpeaking about Ratny as a mentor and adviser, Reid said, \"When I moved to Chicago from Detroit in 1983 to work at Optimus, Ruth was one of the first people I got to know. She made many great introductions for me in my early days. She was constantly thinking about her next big project or screenplay. And she loved to talk politics. Ruth was always sending me an article or a petition to sign. I will miss Ruth dearly.\" \nAn influential voice in Chicago's film industry, Ratny got her start as a producer in post-production, earning an Emmy for her work. In 1979 she founded the advertising and film publication Screen Magazine, serving as editor and publisher until she sold it in 2001. In 2004 she founded the online publication ReelChicago.com, where she continued editing and writing until her death. Her last ReelChicago story was filed on Feb. 10. \nRatny was born the only daughter of German immigrants who lived in Rogers Park on the city's North Side, and lived through the Great Depression, according to Roche. She entered the workplace straight out of high school with a passion for film and a knack for journalism that quickly got to the heart of the story. \nRatny earned multiple distinctions as a Chicago and Midwest Ad Woman of the Year and was a member of Today's Women Chicago 100 Hall of Fame, as well as being an honoree on Newcity Magazine’s “Film 50” list, a recipient of the Hugo Legend Film Award and a recipient of the Chicago Film Critics Award. \nRatny often referred to herself as a \"chronicler of the Chicago film industry\" and, in her spare time, completed two of her own film scripts, one she wrote while going through Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to Roche. She also dedicated herself to various causes supporting women and children. \nAccording to Roche, Ratny will be cremated as to her wishes and there is a public memorial service being planned. There are no immediate survivors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:35:53.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
