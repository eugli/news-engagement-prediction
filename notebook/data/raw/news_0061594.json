It was lucky there was no oncoming traffic. \n\"The potential for a real tragedy here was so high.\" \nSpikes were laid, which slowed the stolen vehicle down. \nNear Onion Rd the car came to a stop and the four teenagers inside tried to run. \nBut Hermann said a dog unit sniffed them out and within 10 minutes of abandoning the car all four were in police custody. Ad Feedback \nThe driver has been charged with unlawfully taking a motor vehicle, reckless driving and failing to stop. \nPolice charged the other three 16 year olds, all from Hamilton, with unlawfully getting into a motor vehicle. They are all due to appear in Youth Court on Friday. \nHermann said the teens had allegedly pulled the ignition on the car to steal it from a University student earlier in the night. \nIt was unclear how much damage had been done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:00:51.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
