Photo: Supplied \n\"She was the first Australian wild woman of rock and she's from suburban Brisbane and that's an amazing story to celebrate.\" \n\"She smashed down the walls and paved the way for women like myself ... the way was paved by Carol Lloyd.\" Advertisement \nCarol Lloyd with Railroad Gin and later with her own band, toured with AC/DC, Suzi Quatro, Billy Thorpe, Skyhooks, Daddy Cool, the Little River Band, Stevie Wright and Matt Taylor of Chain. \nThe singer, former advertising executive and a long-time mentor to young singers had been in the Wesley Hospital after a long illness with pulmonary fibrosis. \nHer death was confirmed on Monday by her producer and manager Troy Armstrong. \n\"Her partner has told me that she passed away this morning at the Wesley,\" Mr Armstrong said. \nMr Armstrong began managing Lloyd after she gave concerts at the Brisbane Powerhouse in 2014. \n\"So it's pretty sad news,\" he said. \n\"She took her time and decided when to go, really.\" \nMr Armstrong said he had no doubt the singer would be remembered as a tour-de-force in Australian music. \n\"She was a trailblazer. That '70s-era rock era was definitely a bloke's world,\" he said. \n\"Remember this was era before Chrissy Amphlett; so she was a pioneer, a real trailblazer.\" \nIn September 2016, Lloyd agreed to a short interview with Fairfax Media to tell of her story as a gay woman in Queensland during the conservative Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen governments in a photographic essay book by Queensland College of Art photography lecturer Heather Faulkner. \n\"I never felt it was necessary to make any statement,\" the singer said. \"It was pretty obvious what I was. I wasn't the '70s version of Kylie Minogue, looking gorgeous and cute in a frou-frou thing. \n\"I was a sweaty, in-your-face rock singer, singing about taking women to bed. I came out wearing sequins on my nipples and not much else with a fur cape.\" \nMs Faulkner said Lloyd was a true heroine. \n\"She was a champion of lesbian and gay rights since she first started singing and it was her voice that sang for everyone in Queensland who found themselves on the outside of the narrow conventions of Queensland society in the Joh era,\" Ms Faulkner said. \n\"It was a gift to have her friendship and something to be treasured. She was a heroine. A heroine to us all.\" \nLloyd was aware of her legacy. \n\"I guess it is within our nature to want to leave some sort of legacy and have the truth be known,\" she said. \n\"And I think we like to have the record straight before we pass on.\" \nLloyd said the gay community of Brisbane in the 1970s was \"a family\" and talked of the 379 Club in George Street, where the Campaign Against Moral Persecution (CAMP) group began. \n\"We looked after each other. We liked each other. It was a place where you could party, where you could safely bring new people into the scene,\" she said.
