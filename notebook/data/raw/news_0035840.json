A simple 10 to 1 snow ratio tells you how much snow could fall. A trend noted with this storm is that is does not involve phasing as several other of our failed snow events did. This one is simply a wave now west of the Aleutians Islands, reaching the west coast by mid week and then pushing eastward from there. Needless to say 100 pops are already in the forecast for Friday from FB.\" \nWhatever that means. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \nKidding. Here's what that means: a Quantitative Precipitation Forecast coupled with a rain-to-snow conversion rate of 1\" of rain equal to 10\" of snow means we're on par to get up to 20 inches of snow next weekend. \nPhoto: Getty Images A native of Columbus, Ohio, Raven graduated from Kent State University in 2014 with a degree in TV/ radio.
