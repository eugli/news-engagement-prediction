Mia’s a good dog! The Westminster Dog Show combines the two best things in the world: very good dogs and sports. This year’s competition gave us this inquisitive little beagle named Mia. Mia the beagle does whatever Mia the beagle wants. — FS1 (@FS1) February 13, 2017 Mia is a very good dog. She might have been a little distracted going through the agility course, but she finished it! She was just really excited to see all the people who came to watch all the very great and floofy pups, big and small. Mia was probably looking for other very good dogs to play with — after all, there must be plenty of scents all over the venue. Good job, Mia! Even though you didn’t go through the course as intended, you provided a “delightfully entertaining run!” Next Up In ##Lookit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:49:18.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
