Had we known that, we would’ve dealt with it very differently.” \nDuggan’s budget, unveiled today, calls for a $50-million payment into a pension trust fund that the mayor expects to reach $335 million by 2023, the year before the payments begin in 2024. \nHad he known about Orr’s methodology, more prudent plans could have been made during the bankruptcy rather than having to set aside money for it now, Duggan said. \nOrr is now partner-in-charge of Jones Day’s Washington, D.C. office. He has not yet responded to a message seeking comment. \nDuggan even questioned whether his own testimony during the city’s lengthy bankruptcy trial in October 2014 could have been different if he was better informed. \nDuring the trial, Duggan was among several city leaders called to testify before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes about the bankruptcy exit plan, which Rhodes ultimately approved. \n“I support this plan, and I believe it is feasible,\" Duggan said under questioning from Jones Day lawyer Tom Cullen in confirmation hearings on the city's bankruptcy exit strategy. \nToday, Duggan suggested he was not fully informed when he gave that testimony. \n“The question is, did the emergency manager have a legitimate right to do this and keep (Detroit CFO John Hill) and me in the dark as we were testifying in the bankruptcy on feasibility. If we get to the point where we believe we’re going to win the case, we’re going to file it (lawsuit),” Duggan said. “We’re very much looking at how much discretion did the emergency manager have; how much obligation did he have to disclose and is this a lawsuit this city is going to win?” \nThe pension trust fund to cover the pension payments was a major aspect of Duggan’s proposed 2017-18 budget. The $1.07 billion general fund spending plan also devotes resources to allow for more police officers and recreation centers in neighborhoods. \nEnsuring the city can make pension payments in 2024 is imperative if the city wants to get out from under state oversight imposed after the bankruptcy, the city’s CFO Hill has said previously. \nUnderfunding of the city's pension funds and the magnitude of pension and health care benefits owed to Detroit workers and retirees was a driving factor behind the city's historic bankruptcy, which resulted in 4.5% cuts and other reductions for general pensioners and decreased cost-of-living increases for police and fire pensioners. 4 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:49:19.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
