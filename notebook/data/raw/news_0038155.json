Actor Seth Rogen woke up Thursday morning and realized his ability to \"slide into the DMs\" of the political elite may help him take down President Trump . \nRogen realized Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. , follows him on Twitter —and saw an opportunity for direct contact. Yo! @DonaldJTrumpJr ! I noticed you follow me on Twitter. Please ask your dad to resign before he destroys the planet. Thanks dude. — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nOn Twitter, users can’t send direct messages to other users unless they follow one another. Because Trump Jr. follows Rogen, he was able to give him a piece of his mind about how Trump’s presidency has been going. \n“Your father is trying to discredit our media, collude with Russia, and destroy the environment,” Rogen wrote to Trump Jr. “It would be super cool if you could be like ‘yo, dad, why don’t you stop all this and go back to being just a guy on TV.’ The majority of the world would be pretty psyched.” Let's see if this works! pic.twitter.com/q5b3d8U4Nx — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nRogen also messaged Trump Jr. about Jason Chaffetz, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman who called for an investigation into White House leaks Thursday morning. \n“Also, please tell your dad that this guy, Jason Chaffetz, you know the dude with the awesome Twitter handle @jasoninthehouse, should probably investigate Flynn’s connection to Russia because he got fired over it,” Rogen wrote. If @jasoninthehouse won't investigate Flynn's ties to Russia, maybe I can get his boss' son to help me do it. pic.twitter.com/bmOfDDepC3 — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nThursday wasn’t the first time Rogen showed animosity toward the Trump administration. Despite being famous as a Canadian comedian, his Twitter is awfully serious and he often tweets about American politics. \nSome users on Twitter argued about what Rogen’s role was in politics, and whether or not celebrities should have a say. Yo! @Sethrogen ! I noticed you didn't follow me on twitter. Please keep your agenda to yourself until you know how to live an average life — Jake Recoon (@JRecoon) February 16, 2017 @Sethrogen @DonaldJTrumpJr people yelling at Seth for being a movie star and having a opinion but you elected a fucking reality tv star... — cursed man (@bobbyjroche) February 16, 2017 @Sethrogen @DonaldJTrumpJr yall just butthurt hillary didnt win 😄😄 — Justin Ramirez (@JustinR147) February 16, 2017 @Sethrogen offer big Donald a role in your next movie if he steps down! He'll do anything to be famous!.. and then obviously edit him out. — Daniel Danger Marin (@dangermarin) February 16, 2017 \nRogen responded to one user, Ashley Feinberg, who responded to his tweet and said “we deserve everything that’s happening.” \n“You're right,” Rogen responded. “I should probably just keep my mouth shut? Keep Hollywood out of politics?” We deserve everything that's happening https://t.co/q8c8D696D7 — Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) February 16, 2017 \nAt press time, Trump Jr. had not responded to Rogen’s direct messages.
