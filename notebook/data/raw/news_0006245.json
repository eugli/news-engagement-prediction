The venue has been rocking the corner of College St. and Spadina Ave. for nearly 60 years. The venue’s booker, Dan Burke, told Exclaim! it will shut down around the beginning of May. \n“We know that our end date is probably May 1,” Burke told the music publication . “The property owner has been planning a redevelopment for quite some time. It was approved by the city. It’s all been sorted out in the past few months.”\nThe future of the Silver Dollar, along with the other businesses in the building, has looked dim for a few years. The building, which also houses the Waverly Hotel and The Comfort Zone, an after-hours club, was sold to a developer in 2013 with plans to make way for new highrise rental housing for students .\nSad news if you're a fan of the Silver Dollar Room. The musical institution is set to close in May. The venue has hosted musical royalty Bob Dylan and Levon Helm to name a few. ( Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star )   The Silver Dollar started out as a cocktail lounge for the Waverly in 1958, and became a place for blues and jazz musicians to play. Burke took over booking in the late-’00s and helped revitalize the place, making it known as a spot for up-and-coming bands. In 2015, the city granted it an official designation as “being of cultural heritage value or interest.”\nThe venue has many booked dates between now and its planned closing, including goodbye parties featuring bands that have played there, including The Highest Order, whose Facebook posting broke the news Tuesday about the closing, as well as buzzy U.S. band The Priests performing there next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:12:24.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
