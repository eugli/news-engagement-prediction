Head of the Nigeria National Office of the WAEC, Mr Olutise Adenipekun with Governor Aregbesola \nHe also described the knowledge tablet (Opon Imo) as a great development which has enabled students that are writing Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) to overcome most of their difficulties. \n“These achievements have resonated throughout the country and beyond,” the APC claimed, adding that, “it has even won awards internationally”. \n“The people of Osun should therefore stand tall over these achievements. They should not allow selfish politicians, and misdirected interest groups to diminish their pride through false claims, designed by the opposition to scandalise the Governor \n“History will vindicate Aregbesola and generations of beneficiaries of his educational revolution in Osun, will in future, curse those who today are trying to destroy the governor’s good work. \n“Already, WAEC, through its head of a National Office, Mr Adenipekun has endorsed the project as the best in Nigeria. \n“Many more people will do so in the months and years ahead to the shame and discredit of the opposition,” the party concluded.
