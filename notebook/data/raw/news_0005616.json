(South Shore International College Prep) Bob Narang .\n\"She's an accomplished guard and can really do whatever she wants to do,\" South Shore coach Thomas Johnson said. \"She's a slasher, probably has one of the quickest first steps in the state.\" \nGoodrich scored 30 points against Argo earlier this season and had 21 points, 12 rebounds and six assists against Crete-Monee. Before she showed she could shine on the court, however, she had to prove to her father that her love of the game was pure. \nEight years ago, Goodrich, already a promising long-jumper in fourth grade, told her father Corey that she wanted to play basketball. \n\"I told her if she's serious about playing it, come and see me in a year, and learn the game, the calls and rules,\" Corey Goodrich said. \"She came back a year to the day and told me she wanted to play basketball.\" \n\"I was trying to watch NBA games and learn things and the calls,\" Cymone Goodrich remembered. \"I had to show him I was serious about the game.\" \nShe proved her dedication to the sport, but it has been tested time and again by shoulders that keep slipping out of their sockets. Five times between seventh grade and her sophomore year, Goodrich suffered shoulder separations. In eighth grade, she even separated a shoulder while sleeping. \n\"We did a lot of assuring her that it was be OK,\" Corey Goodrich said. \"She still never put a ball down. She just basically started working on her other hand, still went to all her AAU and school practices. She just loved the game.\" \nSurgery on both shoulders seems to have stemmed the problem. With both arms moving freely, Goodrich became one of the state's best players, one who has overcome her team's obscurity to make a national splash. \n\"I understand why people don't go to our games,\" said Goodrich, who led the Tars to the city semifinals before losing to Harlan for the fourth time this season. \"Maybe because we haven't built our reputation like other schools for more than a couple of years.\" \nBob Narang is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:12:32.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
