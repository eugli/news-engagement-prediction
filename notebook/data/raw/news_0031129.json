You know it's gotten bad when the dictionary feels the need to weigh in. 02/14/2017 10:24 am ET Nick Wing Senior Viral Editor, The Huffington Post \nIn January, less than 24 hours after becoming president, Donald Trump sent out a tweet telling the nation he was ready to lead. He seemed to follow a simple checklist: \nTell the constituents they’re awesome. \nRemind them of your job title. \nThrow in a few words about honor and service. \nEasy enough. The 18-word tweet dropped just before noon. \n“I am honered to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!” Trump wrote, deterred neither by auto-correct nor the red line that likely appeared under “honered,” imploring him to take closer look. \nIt was an impressive typo. Nearly half of the words in that tweet contained three letters or fewer. The longest words were “American” and “President.” Honor, a fourth-grade vocab word, is the only one that could have presented any sort of challenge. It’s hard to understand how something like this could have happened, but this visual aid may help explain what was going on in Trump’s head when he pressed send: \nTrump deleted and reposted the tweet minutes later, this time with “honored” spelled correctly. But this was not a one-off mistake. Typo-ridden tweets ― including one in which he invented the word “ unpresidented ” ― have become par for the course, leading to the the disturbing conclusion that nobody looks at the president’s tweets before he sends them. \nHis sloppiness appears to have set a tone for his administration, with the White House including a series of embarrassing misspellings in official releases. If these blunders are any indication, attention to detail is not the Trump administration’s strong suit. It’s gotten so bad that the dictionary itself has felt compelled to weigh in on multiple occasions . Reminder that our app has voice search, so you can look a word up even if you're not sure how it's spelled. https://t.co/gAH5JjwU32 https://t.co/oyxk2zwpWO — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) February 7, 2017 \nLook, everybody makes mistakes. To err is human. But to err with such a cavalier disregard for your own reputation is pretty damn irresponsible. And it’s no longer just a question of whether Trump and the people in his administration have a solid command of grade-school spelling. If nobody is copy-editing these dispatches, how can we be sure anybody is editing them for content, either? An intelligence report that didn’t look very intelligent \nEarlier this month, the White House released a list of 78 supposedly “unreported” acts of terrorism that Muslims had carried out around the world over the last three years. The document lacked factual basis in many areas, as it included a number of incidents that were major news stories when they occurred. It also contained some glaring typos, which made it even easier for critics to laugh off the argument the administration was attempting to make. \nThis, for example, is not how you spell San Bernardino, California. White House \nNor is that how you spell “attacker.” The document contained this misspelling a bunch of times throughout. White House list of allegedly undercovered Islamist terror attacks repeatedly misspells “attacker.” pic.twitter.com/Im2MPWJr7j — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) February 7, 2017 If the “H” is silent, is it really necessary? \nTheresa May is the prime minister of the United Kingdom. Teresa May is a softcore porn star . Accuracy matters. But last month, the White House dropped the “h” at least three separate times while referring to a guest Trump had “honered.” White House Department of Edumacation \nThe U.S. Department of Education is part of Trump’s executive branch. It’s also a department that should understand the importance of proofreading and, well, knowing stuff. Or, at the very least, trying to look like you do. \nIn a tweet over the weekend, just days after billionaire GOP donor Betsy DeVos took the reins as secretary following a heated confirmation process, the agency attempted to pay tribute to renowned civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois. Education must not simply teach work - it must teach life. – W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA — US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017 \nThe department later acknowledged the mistake with another tweet ― and another typo. \n“Post updated - our deepest apologizes for the earlier typo,” read the now-deleted tweet. Names are hard \nWho is this “Richard Tumka” you speak of? Another name misspelled in a White House guidance pic.twitter.com/KdWVIK3Kha — Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) January 27, 2017 \nThat would be Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. It’s sort of surprising they didn’t go with the “Trumpka” misspelling. “Columbia” is not a country \nThe White House made one of the most common and most commonly ridiculed geographical typos on Monday, when it referred to the nation of “Columbia.” It’s Colombia. Dios mio. Predictably, the @WhiteHouse misspells Colombia. — Ernesto Londoño (@londonoe) February 13, 2017 \nTo everybody in the Trump administration: Proofreading is important. Not as important as keeping the White House free from improper foreign influence, but still important. Stop humiliating yourselves and stop embarrassing us all.
