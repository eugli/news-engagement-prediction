In addition to New Orleans, which also declared a state of emergency, tornadoes were reported in Baton Rouge, Donaldsonville, Ponchatoula and Killian, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. \nTornado watches were in effect for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.

The tornado watch in Alabama and Florida is set to expire at 6 p.m. Severe storms are expected in cities such as Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile and Pensacola. \nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said a serious tornado hit Chef Menteur Highway and traveled there for about two miles. Landrieu described the damage it caused as \"devastating\" and that it looked \"like an elephant stomping on your house.\" \nApproximately 9,400 Orleans Parish residents are currently without power, the mayor said. Crews are working around the clock and expect to have all power restored in three to five days. \nNo deaths have been reported, but of the 31 injuries reported in New Orleans, at least six were considered moderate to severe according to Landrieu. Authorities will continue to survey the damage in the next several days. \nNASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans was impacted by a tornado, the agency said Tuesday. All 3,500 employees at the facility were accounted for, with five sustaining minor injuries. The facility will remain closed on Wednesday, as emergency personnel continue damage assessments on multiple buildings which were damaged, including the main manufacturing building, which sustained roof damage. \nNASA posted the following video to YouTube of the tornado near the facility. \n\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday night, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in southeastern Louisiana affected by today's severe tornadoes.\" \n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with everyone in southeastern Louisiana affected by today's severe tornadoes.\n— President Trump (@POTUS) February 8, 2017 \nThere could still be isolated severe storms in North and South Carolina. \nAs of Tuesday morning, at least 23 U.S. states were under winter weather alerts, and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the Southeast as most of the country braces for severe weather this week. \n“We are in a very active weather pattern all across the country, from California to New York,” ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. \nAn atmospheric river, which draws massive amounts of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean, has taken aim at California, where the National Weather Service has issued flash flood and flood watches through Friday. \n\nABC News \nThe Atmospheric River was aimed straight at California as of 7 a.m. ET on Feb. 7, 2017. \nCopious rainfall is in the forecast for the West Coast until the end of the week, potentially bringing floods, mudslides and debris flows.

Heavy snowfall is in the forecast until Thursday afternoon. Some weather models are showing snow farther south in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. \n“This could be a plowed event for major Northeast cities,” Golembo said. “Stay tuned.
