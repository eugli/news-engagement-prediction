The outline of the golden engraving is visible to the naked eye - but a microscope is needed to see it properly. Each image of the Pride and Prejudice author is surrounded by a unique quote from some of her most celebrated novels. The Birmingham-based artist released the notes into circulation last year, one in England, Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. Pictured: A new £5 note Mr Short is most famous for engraving the words of the Lord's Prayer on to the head of a pin. When he released the notes, the 70-year-old artist said: 'I'm always looking to do something different and as soon as I saw the new £5 note I thought 'wouldn't it be good if I could engrave something on it?' 'I didn't know what but then I found out it was going to be the 200th anniversary of Jane Austen's death and her image is also going on the new £10 note, so it ties in nicely with that.' The first five was found in December last year by a customer taking change from a sausage and egg sandwich at a café in Blackwood, south Wales.
