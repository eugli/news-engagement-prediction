Jeffrey Hollender, one of the founders of Seventh Generation, is Meika’s father and runs Sustain with her. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Growing up, my dream was to start a condom company with my dad,” Ms. Hollender, 29, quipped to the staff at Ricky’s. Seventh Generation was an instant success, hitting $8 million in sales within three years of its founding in 1988. But the market for condoms is much smaller than the market for diapers and soaps. And three years after founding Sustain, the Hollenders are working to overcome some early missteps — and a fickle consumer base — as they try to make their eco-condoms mainstream. Mr. Hollender, 62, decided he wanted to start Sustain while he was on a surfing trip. After founding Seventh Generation and building revenues into the hundreds of millions, he lost control and was forced out by his partners in 2010. On the beach, contemplating the meaning of life and what he should do next, he zeroed in on condoms. Condoms, he figured, were a product that hadn’t yet gotten the full environmental treatment. And he knew that they were an inherently sustainable product — latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree, an endlessly renewable resource. Mr. Hollender initially wanted to call the company Rainforest Rubbers. Meika, who was working in the consumer products industry, persuaded him to go with a name suggested by an investor: Sustain. To give the new condoms additional ecological bona fides, the Hollenders focused on eliminating nitrosamines. Common chemicals that are present in everything from processed meat to balloons, nitrosamines have been found to be carcinogenic in large doses. And while only minuscule amounts are found in most products, including condoms, the World Health Organization recommended that condom makers minimize nitrosamines in their products. The Food and Drug Administration monitors the presence of nitrosamines in various products, but has not banned them outright. As a result, they are found in small doses across a wide array of products. The Hollenders hired a former employee at Durex, another condom brand, who had figured out how to make nitrosamine-free latex. And they found the rubber plantation. Finally, for the small number of stringent vegans who try to avoid using any animal products at all, Sustain removed casein, a milk protein commonly found in traditional latex condoms.

But vegan condoms are shaping up to be a more difficult sell than recycled paper towels. The Hollenders approached more than 25 venture capital firms looking for backing. All of them said no. Instead, the Hollenders have used their own money and funds from friends and family. Three years after founding the company, sales have topped $1 million annually, and big stores like CVS and Target are carrying their products, but the brand has yet to really crack the mainstream. \nAdvertisement Coyote Amrich, the director of purchasing and product development at Good Vibrations, a chain of sex shops, said more customers were asking for Sustain and other environmentally friendly brands.
