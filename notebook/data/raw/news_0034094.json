This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia wrapped filming on the first season this week, posting several photos and videos of his final days as everyone’s favorite TV dad, Jack Pearson. \n“Just wrapped. First season. This Is Us . This is the plate of the slate we use to mark the show. That’s the last shot, last roll, last day. Here I am closing it down,” Ventimiglia said in a Twitter video from the set. — Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) February 14, 2017 The 39-year-old actor rocked his signature long locks and was clean-shaven for his final shot on Monday evening. \n“That’s wrap y’all,” Ventimiglia said, commemorating the mysterious last scene. “569th roll. 4 takes of scene 19A directed by @kenolin1 & shot my Mr #YasuTanida.” — Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) February 14, 2017 Ventimiglia also praised his TV wife, Mandy Moore, who wrapped filming as Rebecca Pearson on Saturday. \n“Wrapped this lovely lady tonight. What a great first season @TheMandyMoore,” he tweeted, alongside four photos of the two of them on This Is Us. — Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) February 11, 2017 While we know Jack dies when The Big Three are teenagers , This Is Us is all about flashbacks. So don’t worry, Ventimiglia will be back for season two! And on Tuesday’s Valentine’s Day-themed episode, there will be friction between Jack and Rebecca as she prepares to go on tour. It’ll also give fans a glimpse into Miguel, Jack’s best friend and Rebecca’s current husband. \n“He’s getting the short end because everybody loves Jack and Rebecca that they can’t see this version with Miguel,” Ventimiglia told ET at NBC’s winter Television Critics Association press day in January. “He has a big, big moment that I think is really going to solidify people going, ‘OK, OK. I’m OK with it.’” \nRELATED: 'This Is Us' Composer Reveals His Secret to Making You Cry “If people are not fond of Miguel, then we have not done our jobs,” Moore added. “I think I walked away from reading that script and I was like, ‘OK, done deal. I love him.’ I hope they give him a chance. I suspect they will in due time.” This Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:55:51.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
