For Mumbai’s sake, earnestly hope the next 5 years are better than the last 2 decades \n— Milind Deora (@milinddeora) February 23, 2017 Conclusion one can draw from BMC election results is that Mumbaikars seem content living with potholes, flooding, malaria & water tankers \n— Milind Deora (@milinddeora) February 23, 2017 \nThe Congress and the NCP are far behind the Sena and the BJP, leading on 5 and 2 seats, respectively, in the 227-member BMC. \nAs per trends coming in from the other city corporations, zilla parishads and panchayat samitis, the BJP is ahead of its rivals on 18 seats and Shiv Sena on 7 seats in the Nashik civic body. \nWatch this video \nThe ruling MNS in Nashik, Congress and NCP were leading on 2 seats each. \nThe civic polls, especially in the country’s financial hub Mumbai, have generated much political heat on account of the fierce fight between the BJP and the Sena, despite being partners in governments in the state and at the Centre. \nThe battle of the estranged allies has put a question mark on the stability of the BJP-led ministry in the state as Sena had been tenacious in its attack on the senior partner and the Centre’s demonetisation policy. \nThe results will determine the fate of 21,620 candidates for 5,777 seats up for grabs in the 10 municipal corporations, 25 zilla parishads and 283 panchayat samitis for which the elections were held in two phases. \nThe stakes are high for Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray , who led their respective parties from the front and were involved in a high decibel and no-holds-barred campaign, relegating the opposition Congress, NCP and other players like the MNS and the AIMIM to the background.
