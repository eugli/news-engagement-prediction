In a posting on the carriers website, Verizon announced the news and the device will be available in two colors, namely Platinum and Black. Pricing and plans for the LG G6 on the Verizon network hasn’t been announced as of yet, but the carrier recommends consumers to purchase the device with Verizon Unlimited when orders are opened. Verizon Unlimited offers unlimited data, unlimited calls and texts, along with HD video streaming, and is priced from $45 to $80, depending on the number of lines you have. \nWhile the pricing of the LG G6 on the Verizon network hasn’t been announced yet, we will keep you posted regarding it, once the device does land on Verizon. The LG G6 was announced today, and it is the latest flagship device from the South Korean electronics manufacturer, LG. In terms of specs, it is a pretty feature packed smartphone, packing a large 5.7-inch QHD+ FullVision display, surrounded by extremely thin bezels. Under the hood, the device sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, coupled with the Adreno 530 GPU to handle graphics. Memory wise, the LG G6 packs 4GB of RAM, with internal storage options of either 32GB or 64GB, and both are expandable via a microSD card. For optics, the LG G6 sports a dual camera setup on its rear, both of which are 13-megapixel shooters. One camera comes with a normal 71-degree angle lens, while the other has a wide-angle 125-degree lens. The cameras support 2x optical zoom, along with 16x digital zoom, and a dual-LED flash has been included. Selfies will be handled by a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. \nWhile previous LG flagships came with a removable battery, the LG G6 packs a 3,300mAh non-removable battery. This has allowed LG to make the smartphone water and dust resistant, with IP68 certification. The company has also stated that the battery is flexible and supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. Software wise, Android 7.0 Nougat runs on this smartphone out of the box, and it should be noted that it is the first device other than the Google Pixel smartphones to come with Google Assistant .
