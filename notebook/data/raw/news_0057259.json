The lizards, which can grow up to 8.5 feet in length, are a staple of the outback, but rarely like to be around people, which makes this encounter so bizarre. One might think this server was some sort of lizard-handling veteran by how well she took care of the thing, but in reality 25-year-old Samia Lila is from France and working in Australia on a visa. That made it a very unique encounter, but one that didn’t bother her . \"I looked at it and thought it was a dog at first! But then I realized it was a goanna.\" The remarkable thing about this video is just how chill everyone is. One woman can be seen standing on a chair, but the rest of the guests are just chilling while this monster-sized lizard is dragged out around them. \"I wasn't scared, I like reptiles so was a bit excited,” she said. The video is going viral in Australia where local media has dubbed Lila “The Goanna Girl.” More power to her, because I’d totally be standing on a chair freaked out as hell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:32:34.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
