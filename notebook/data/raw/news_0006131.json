Lawyers challenging the Trump administration’s travel ban in US District Court in Boston Friday morning had yet to receive a ruling.\nAlhanfy said her visa had been issued later than those of her relatives and that they had arrived in the United States ahead of her. She was barred from her original flight in Iraq due to the travel ban, but changed her destination to Turkey and traveled to Germany, she said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

It is my second home,” Partopour said.\nPartopour, who flew on Lufthansa Flight 422 from Frankfurt and landed at Logan shortly after 1 p.m., left Logan wearing a blue blazer and Chuck Taylors and carrying a pink rose.\nAdvertisement\nMcGovern said he was “glad he is home. I’m offended he had to go though what he had to go through.”\nAlso returning Friday was Niki Mossafer Rahmati, a junior mechanical engineering student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is from Iran. Rahmati had been trying to return to MIT after spending winter break in Iran, but she was blocked from boarding her connecting flight from Qatar to the United States last weekend.\nLawful immigrants with valid visas should have been allowed to enter the United States freely in recent days since a judge had imposed a seven-day restraining order on the travel ban. However, many had been unable to travel because their visas had been revoked by the State Department, the Globe reported on Thursday.\nMark Arsenault can be reached at mark.arsenault@globe.com .
