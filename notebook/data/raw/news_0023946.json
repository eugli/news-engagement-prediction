You never forget what would have been. \n“With our retreat we want to help parents to be with people in a similar position and to know that they’re not alone.” \nSimon and Alanna were told that they’d lost Isobel at 39 weeks and two days. (Photo: Belfast Live WS) \nThere had been no prior warning and inside Alanna’s womb Isobel was fully-formed and healthy. \nTheir home was filled with baby gear when Simon returned home from work as normal that evening in June 2015. \nAlanna told him that she hadn’t felt any movement from their baby in a few hours and, as was semi-regular, they decided to go to the maternity ward as a precaution. \nThey were still going over names for their boy or girl as they waited to be seen by a midwife. (Photo: Belfast Live WS) \nAfter trying two separate fetal dopplers to find the baby’s heartbeat, the midwife showed its parents to another room and got the attention of a consultant. \nAt that point, Alanna and Simon knew that something had gone wrong. \nSimon said: “There was pure silence. We were in there for fifteen minutes and there was maybe two or three words spoken between us. \n“A consultant then came and he laid Alanna down on the bed. He used a machine and the next thing he said was: “Im so sorry.” \n“The two of us just broke down. To this day I still can’t believe what happened at that moment. \n“There were so many tears.” (Photo: Belfast Live WS) \nHe went on: “It was the strangest drive home I’ve ever experienced in my life. You come to the point where you’re paying for a parking ticket just after finding out that your baby had passed away. It was surreal. \n“And then we come back to a house that was full of baby gear for an expected child. \n“There was no sleep, we were up all night. \n“I went from cuddling up to Alanna and the bump who I’d spoken to every night and could feel moving with my hands - to holding Alanna and holding the bump and knowing that our baby was dead inside.” \nThey would find out that the placenta had failed at the last minute, restricting oxygen to her. She suffocated over a six hour period. \nThe day before her birthday, on June 26th 2015, Alana gave birth to Isobel and the family was allowed to spend three important days with her. \nSimon said: “It was so valuable, every second was precious. You’re creating a lifetime of memories in just a few hours. \n”Since then, Simon said he has gone through every emotion: Seeing little girls of family and friends go through key moments in their life and wondering about Isobel. \nHe said: “If someone asks you how many children I have, I say three - Jenson, Theo and Isobel. \n“You always have these markers of other children of a similar age. You’re always looking at children of that age and in the back of your mind you’re always thinking about what Isobel would be like. \n“I didn’t get to hear her laugh, I didn’t get to see the colour of her eyes. As time progresses you encounter the first day of school, friends and family with daughters of similar age, and every day is a reminder. \n\"You never forget what would have been.” \nIn memory of their daughter, and in a bid to help couples deal with their grief together, Alanna and Simon have organised an unique retreat, with the first happening in April. \nIt will focus on dealing with emotions and communication between couples. \nSimon said: “You change drastically overnight. The two of us are dealing with grief in our own way and as parents will know that can put a lot of strain on a relationship. \n“There is a certain comfort zone when you’re in the company of people who are in a similar position to yourself. \n“With the retreat we’re trying to end the stigma attached to stillbirth and we want couples to take something positive from the weekend.” \nFor details on the retreat or to speak to Simon and Alanna, you can visit the Facebook page here or email .
