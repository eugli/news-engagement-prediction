These fundamental rights, abbreviated with the acronym “M.A.T.A.P.A.N.G,” are as follows: ADVERTISEMENT \n1) Manahimik (Keep quiet)—You can opt to keep quiet amid interrogations from authorities. \n2) Ayoko (I don’t want)—You can deny entry to policemen out to inspect you and do a search operation inside your home for illegal drugs. \n3) Tumawag (Call)—You have the right to call a lawyer even without initial money to pay for his services. \n4) Alis (Get out)—You have the right to leave when there is no basis for you to remain in the police station. \n5) Pribado (Private)—If it is needed for authorities to frisk you for banned items, it should be done in a private place with someone of the same sex. \n6) Alamin (Inquire)—You should know the name and rank of the person in charge. \n7) Numero (Number)—In case someone violated one or more of the eight given rights, you can contact Resbak at 0956 874 2385. \n8) Go—Follow the previous rules. \nIn conclusion, Resbak reminds Filipinos to be tough and vigilant when faced with arrest from authorities and apply the eight basic rights to defend one’s self.
