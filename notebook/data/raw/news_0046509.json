I have always supported his hobby. \n“He recently bought a new bi­­cycle with his own savings,” Mayang Mora­ni said. \nShe also said that she felt guilty for not monitoring his activities more closely. \n“I hope this will serve as a lesson to other parents to always be aware of their children’s whereabouts and activities at all time,” Mayang Mora­ni added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:25:36.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
