In other cases, employees would register themselves.\nEach situation would be different,\" said Finance Minister Mike de Jong.\nEmployees advised to examine their contracts The province is recommending employees find out if there is any language in their current work contract that ensures the benefit is passed onto them.\nFor example, the collective agreements between the B.C. public service employee unions include language that covers 100 per cent of employee MSP costs, including the province's largest employer, the B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union.\nThe same applies to non-unionized employees.\nAny changes in compensation for unionized public service employees must be negotiated between unions and their employer.\nAt a bare minimum, an employee that qualifies for the MSP break and has the tax paid for will receive a break on their annual income taxes because premiums are a taxable benefit.\nPartly because of the complex nature of the changes, the province is spending $1.8 million to cover the costs of explaining them to the public â€” $1.1 million of which wasn't previously in the budget.\n\"If an individual's MSP is being reduced by hundreds of dollars a year on an ongoing basis, they need to know about that and know how to get that reduction,\" said Andrew Wilkinson, the minister in charge of spending the advertising money.\nNDP calling on advertising increases to stop B.C. NDP finance critic Carole James says the changes have left people confused and still wondering how it will benefit them.\nJames does not think that the government should be spending taxpayer money on an advertising campaign.\n\"It's another example that this government has learned nothing. Here we are going into an election and the government is increasing the advertising budget,\" said James.\n\"Money doesn't need to be spent on advertising. It needs to be spent on giving families a break.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:30:11.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
