'Catastrophic failure' in church leadership \nThe Archbishop of Perth, Timothy Costelloe, also gave a damning assessment of the way allegations of sexual abuse had been handled. \nHe said there had been a \"catastrophic failure\" in church leadership and that the abuse of children was at odds with what the Catholic Church purported to be. \n\"That leads me to reflect there has also been a catastrophic failure in keeping people faithful [like priests] to the commitments they made. I asked myself what can possibly have gone wrong, or what was missing, that could lead to, not just one, but countless people failing in this way,\" Archbishop Costelloe said. \nThis is the 50th public hearing of the royal commission. \nThe Archbishops of Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane are also being probed at the hearing, which will finish tomorrow. \nIn the lead-up to their appearances they have each apologised for the Catholic Church's failure to protect the children in their care.
