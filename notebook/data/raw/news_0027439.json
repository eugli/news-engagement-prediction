And with the last 10% of a dam’s water not being useable, dam levels are effectively at 26,2%. \nAs a result the City of Cape Town has called on all residents and visitors to the city to conserve water wherever and however possible. \nThe latest actual consumption is 825 million litres of collective use per day. This has now been lowered to a water consumption target from 800 million litres to 700 million litres for collective water usage per day. \nThe city says in order to reduce the consumption to 700 million litres of collective use per day, and at the current draw-down rate on dams, it could be looking at approximately 135 days of usable water left. \n\"In December 2016, the target of 800 million litres per day was set and this was subject to seasonal variations which, among others, affect the evaporation rate of dams. These variations have caused us to lower the target now. In addition, we have struggled to meet the previous target and we will therefore need a monumental effort to reduce consumption further and to meet a target that is one hundred million litres lower,’ said the City’s Executive Mayor, Patricia de Lille. Water consumption must be lowered immediately - 135 days of usable water left! \nCape Town is in a water-scarce region and at all times, but especially during this water crisis, water must be used sparingly. While rain has been forecast in certain parts of SA this week, particularly the north-eastern areas, none is expected in the province. \nWater levels remain critically important throughout the country as national dam levels also remain a concern, not just in the Western Cape. Southern Africa is reeling from a two-year drought which has affected over 40 million people, UN figures show. \nWant to know how much water you should be saving? \nSee this map that allows you to check the status of your province and your local dams. This data is provided by the Department of Water and Sanitation. &lt;/img&gt; \nWater Saving measures \nWith the aim to conserve water, the City of Cape Town has instituted a number of measures to curb wastage of water. \nLast week it changed the operating times at all public swimming pools for the remainder of the summer season. With the exception of Sea Point, Mnandi Resort pool, and four indoor facilities in Long Street, Retreat, Blue Downs and Strand, all public swimming pools will be closed from Monday to Thursday, starting on Monday 13 February 2017. The swimming pools will only be open to the public from 14:00 until 17:00 on Fridays and from 10:00 – 17:00 on Saturdays and Sundays until the end of March when pools will close for the winter season. \nSEE: #BeWaterwise: Severe action to be taken against top-tier water offenders Added to this there has been a crackdown on splashing and surfer shorts at the city's swimming pools in a bid to save water as the fierce drought bites. Most pools in the city will also be closed on weekdays to eliminate the need to clean them daily, which is expected to save 680 000 litres of water every day. \nWarning notices have also been issued in the rates bills of some of the metro’s highest use domestic, commercial and government department water users in an effort to further reduce consumption. \nAccording to the January 2017 consumption, the highest water users are all using far above 50 000 litres of water per month while out of the almost one million customers that the City supplies with water, most households are using an average of approximately 20 000 litres per month or less. \nSEE: #BeWaterWise: Cape hotels get creative as city's water levels dip below 39% \nResidents can contact the City via email to for queries or to report contraventions (evidence should be provided to assist the City’s enforcement efforts) or they can send an SMS to 31373. \nWednesdays have also been pegged as a day when South Africans are urged to use as little to know water, if possible. \nBe Water Wise with these tips. \n\"The time to save water is when there is water to save - the city suggests these water-saving tips for throughout your home: \n- Ensure all taps are fully closed and replace tap washers regularly. A dripping tap can waste 30 litres a day – that is equivalent to 10 000 litres a year. \n- Fit tap aerators to reduce and spread the flow. This saves water yet feels like you are using the same amount of water. \n- We typically use the most water in our gardens, especially residents who have large gardens and swimming pools. During level 3 water restrictions, no watering of gardens is allowed - unless you have well-point or borehole access. \n- Use a broom to clean paved areas. Hosing down paved areas wastes water and is illegal in Cape Town. \n- Wash your vehicle using a bucket of water and limit spraying with a hosepipe. \n- Plant water-wise plants and limit the size of your lawn area.- Mulch flowerbeds to help retain moisture in the soil for longer. \nWater saving tips for your kitchen: \n- Ensure washing machines or dishwashers have a full load before running them. \n- Rinse dishes and vegetables in a basin of water, rather than under a running tap, and reuse the water for pot plants or in the garden. \n- Reuse rinse water for the next cycle of washing up. \n- Thaw frozen foods in the fridge at room temperature, in a basin of water, or in a microwave rather than placing them under running water. \n- When using taps, don’t let the water run down the drain while waiting for the hot water or for the water to cool. Rather collect the water in a bottle. \nWater saving tips for your bathroom: \n- Close the tap when brushing your teeth. \n- Plug the sink when shaving rather than rinsing your razor under running water. \n- Shower rather than bath – a half-filled bath uses 113 litres of water, while a 5-minute shower uses about 56 litres. \n- Install a water-saving showerhead, take shorter showers, don’t run the water at full force, and turn off the shower when soaping. \n- Reuse bath water in your garden. \n- Install a new water-saving toilet. \n- Check if your toilet is leaking. \nFix water leaks: Cape Town’s water use is much higher than it could be. This is because of water leaks and wasted water from dripping taps and leaking toilets. By checking for water leaks, you save water and reduce your water bills. \nWhat to read next on Traveller24 : ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:10:43.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
