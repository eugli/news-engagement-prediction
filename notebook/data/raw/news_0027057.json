He retaliated by punching her in the face, causing severe bruising and a fractured eye socket.\nShaw then tried to get away from the train, but one of the women had phoned British Transport Police and officers immediately attended and arrested him.\nShaw, of Buxton Road in Stockport, was charged on 17 June and, after initially failing to appear at court on an earlier date, he pleaded guilty on 1 February at Manchester Crown Court to one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nThis was classed as a hate crime and he was sentenced today to two years and four months in prison.\nInvestigating officer PC Mark Haviland said:\nThis incident was absolutely deplorable and demeaning. The victims have been really badly affected by their ordeal and suffered horrendous injuries, both physical and mental, as a result.\nIt is 2017. People can choose to live their lives however they like, without having to deal with the opinions and homophobia of a small minority of individuals like Shaw.\nI have to give credit to the victims for their outstanding bravery giving evidence, which was compelling.\nI feel the sentence given to Shaw outlines how seriously we at the police, the judicial system, and society, perceives hate crimes and will hopefully deter any other incidents of this nature.\n– PC Mark Haviland If you ever need British Transport Police, call 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016.
