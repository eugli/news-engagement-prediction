John Wray (R-Waxahachie) says the ambulance frequently arrives at a crime scene before the police get there, and the paramedics deserve the right to protect themselves.\" \nFirefighters and EMS do not need to perform a police officer's role, but they certainly have the right to protect themselves,\" Wray told 1200 WOAI news. \nCurrently there is a patchwork of laws across the state on when and under what circumstances firefighters can be armed while on duty. Most cities and counties, however, do not allow first responders to carry guns, mainly on the argument that, while they are focused on saving a life or putting out a fire, the gun could be stolen. \nWray says we need to give our first responders more credit than that. \n\"Folks who have a license to carry are knowledgable about the weapon they are carrying and keeping it secure,\" he said. \"That is a reasonable risk that is tolerated, and first responders should have the ability to protect themselves.\"He says current rules are so crazy that first responders who cover multiple jurisdictions frequently have to waste time putting their gun into storage before answering calls in certain areas. This law would create a standard across the state that all fire departments would have to obey. \nIMAGE' GETTY ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:35:33.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
