When something happens twice, it is a trend. When the event/action gets repeated for a third time, it is a pattern. And a pattern is what Trevor Louden, Doug Hagmann and myself has uncovered. What are we talking about?\nThe Overthrow of the United States Government Trevor Louden, the author of Enemies Within , Doug Hagmann and myself are all saying the same thing. We are in the early stages of a civil war that is designed to take down the United States. The New World Order must destroy the US because there is no place in the New World Order for liberty and freedom. The idea of a nation state will go by the wayside and the planet will be governed corporate style, such as in the 1975 movie, Rollerball .\nPrior to the election of Trump, the globalists were in the final phase of extracting as much material wealth from the people of the United States before collapsing the system. Now the globalists must fight to get back what ground they have lost due to the election of Trump.\nThe Democrats and the Republicans are united on the need to takedown Donald Trump. Trump is not their enemy, but rather the symbol that will be used to usher in the New World Order. President Trump is the convenient fall-guy from which to target so the globalists can squash, once and for all, the populist spirit of the American people prior to the nation’s destruction.\nThe Congress and the Senate are united on two fronts:\nThey both support free trade agreements and these “representatives of the people” have been handsomely rewarded for falling into line with the corporate takeover of the US government. The globalists are promoting mass immigration in all major western nations. Why? The answer is simple, they seek to decultralize the major nations prior to establishing global governance. When the dominant language and the mores and the customs of the modern nations are gone, all that is left is globalism. All, in all, this process can best be understood from 3 perspectives. The three perspectives, as I mentioned, comes from Trevor Louden, Doug Hagmann and myself.\nPart One: The Enemies Within-Trevor Louden In both his book and his documentary by the same name, Louden identifies 80 elected representatives of the American people who have been elected to the the House and the Senate who belong to front groups for either the Communist Party or the world’s biggest terrorist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, or both at the same time. Largely, these representatives, such as Elizabeth Warren and John McCain have been recruited from the ranks of those who enthusiastically supported free trade and the subsequent loss of millions of American jobs. McCain was a co-sponsor of CAFTA, a free trade agreement.\nLouden details how these associations impacts the American people as it alters Congressional policies and laws that are passed.\nLouden’s documentary is available on Amazon Prime. Also, I should mention that former Congressman West makes the exact same claims as does Louden and he names the same people. Am I talking about treason, you are damn right I am.\nPart Two: The Subversive Groups of Obama and Soros-Doug Hagmann In the following video, Doug Hagmann described, in detail, the emerging and covert army that is emerging in American designed to overthrow the government. As I said, Donald Trump is just a convenient target, the real objective is the subjugation of, the depopulation of, and the destruction of the US Constitution and all of American civil liberties.\nAt the heart of the subversive takedown of America is Obama’s Organizing for America . It is run by former President Obama and it has 250 nationwide chapters. Emanating from this parent group are other Obama/Soros organizations such as Indivisible. Indivisible receives their funding from Soros groups such as Moveon.org and the ACLU. It is interesting to note that last night Oscars, the looney left that dominates the Hollywood contingent were wearing blue ribbons to support the ACLU. Doug singles out Angela Padilla as one of the leaders in this movement. She is connected with the Soros funded La Raza which seeks to break up the United States through movements like CALEXIT of which Padilla, along with the Mexican Consulate and the drug cartel leadership compromise an intimate part of CALEXIT as are former Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.\nDoug also points out that the group Indivisible has published “A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda” (ie how to destroy the Constitution, the economy and the social fabric of America).\nDoug also identifies the Weather Underground, which is run through the man who launched Obama’s political career, Bill Ayers, has reared its ugly head, once again, to terrorize America. The social networking and planned rioting from Soros funded groups like the Center for Popular Democracy, the thugs from Acorn, which are funded by Ford Foundation and the Democracy Alliance will wreak havoc on the American people this Spring.\nDoug notes that Twitter and Facebook are facilitating the revolution. As expected, the media is part of this and this is why President Trump labeled the media “the enemy of the people”.\nThe reader should get the idea, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. More detail is available in the following video produced by Doug Hagmann.\nPart Three: The Implementation of Soros’ Led Takedown of America-Dave Hodges I have previously stated that America is at a very dangerous time in her history. The enemy (e.g. George Soros and his puppetiers) are already inside the gates wreaking havoc.\nThe Arab Spring (2017) Comes to America George Soros is following a script that he all too familiar with. Soros is implementing the Arab Spring strategies in very similar fashion to what he did over five years ago in the Middle East.\nHis playbook is a combination of Hillary Clinton’s hero, S. Alinsky and his book, Rules for Radicals.\nIt is becoming clear that Soros is implementing the strategies associated with the first three stages listed below. However, we can be certain that the globalists are going all the way.\nThe Final Solution There will become a bifurcation point where soft kill methods, and diluting the native population through massive immigration will not be enough to ensure total dictatorial control over the planet by the globalists because its methods of replacement are not expeditious enough. That is when soft kill will need to become the Final Solution of hard kill.\nIn history, the pattern is always the same:\nStep One Perpetrate an economic collapse that will put millions of desperate people on the street. It is better if this can happen in the midst of some other social chaos to take fully advantage of the magnification effect. The plan calls for the complete disintegration of law order. Soros has his excuse, the election of Donald Trump . Soros has properly engineered group think in which some groups, collectively, have manufactured enough fear based upon lies, that people are striking out. We are seeing this with riots in our major cities. Soros is perpetrating a race war and when it spreads to other segments of our population, not only will safety be imperiled but so will the distribution of goods and services.\nStep Two Combine the economic collapse with the creation of a false flag series of events which necessitates the need for martial law and extreme measures of subjugation.\nIt would appear that a mass casualty event is in the works, but the rioting of groups like Obama’s OFA will do quite nicely in the meantime.\nStep 3 Cordon people off for their own protection by eliminating travel.\nStep Four Exploit whatever free labor can be extracted from this doomed group while they are being protected and this means the implementation of a Congressionally backed “New Deal like programs” which will promise to put people back to work. You can call them labor camps, I will call them FEMA Camps. This is precisely what Weatherman Underground leader, Bill Ayers, talked about doing.\n Step Five Systematically exterminate the undesirable group as a move to promote national unity against a contrived common enemy (e.g. Christians). By this time, Trump will be gone from power. The new radicals will impose the use of the NDAA will come into full view and we will witness unparalleled persecution of average citizens that “don’t fit in.\n Step Six World War III will evolve out of the turmoil as was the case with World War II-Serfdom will re-emerge\nStep Seven This is when global depopulation will begin in earnest. When the smoke clears and the bulk of humanity has been buried, the New World Order will truly be born.\nConclusion These seven steps are all supported by past history. What makes Americans think that we are immune to established historical precedent?\nSometimes it is good to be reminded of who we are fighting and what their Agenda (2030) consists of.", "external_links": ["http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/09/911-twin-towers.png", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2016/02/fema-check-in.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/09/economic-collapse.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2016/04/holocaust.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2016/11/revolution-american-style.png", "http://realitieswatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Depopulation-Agenda-For-a-New-World-Order-Agenda-21-Video.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/12/CSS-Offical-New-Logo2.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqueE5Xf0uU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/11/einstein-and-world-war-III.jpe", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/06/uk-fema-camps.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-27T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:45:18.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
