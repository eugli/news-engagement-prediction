It’s now been revealed by the Greek community that his “name” actually is the word in Greek for a sex act. \nPeople on social media have dubbed him a legend and said he should be the next Prime Minister. \nOthers slammed him for tarnishing the rally where cabbies were trying to get the government to offer more compensation for its buyback scheme.

Does he not respect his own self esteem or his brother cabbies who are bleeding? Does he not care that he embarrasses his own Greek community? Should we the consumer not take them seriously either? \n“How can (cabbies) get support when you have clowns representing them on public television. Either take yourselves seriously cabbies or you will disappear by progress and technology.” \nAfter Monday’s protest, the cabbies vowed it still wasn’t over. \nProtester David Singh told Fairfax Media they wouldn’t end their fight, especially with an election just 18 months away. \n“This isn’t over, they want it to go away but this isn’t going to go away,” he said. \nThe Victorian government wants to deregulate the taxi industry by abolishing taxi licences and introducing a single registration for taxis, hire cars and ride-share services like Uber. \nIt proposes to compensate taxi licence holders by paying $100,000 for their first licence and $50,000 for up to three others. \nHowever, some licences cost up to $500,000 and many holders fear the buyback scheme will send them broke. \n— with AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:16:01.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
