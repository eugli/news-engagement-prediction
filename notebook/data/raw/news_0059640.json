Gabrielle is the first \"pillar\" fragrance of the house in the last 15 years. It promises to exalt \"the rebellious, mold-breaking spirit of her early years before she became Coco.\" ( via ) New Gabrielle handbags Gabrielle Eau de Parfum is announced as an \"abstract floral\" composition, whose creation is signed by perfumer Olivier Polge . Other details of the fragrance notes have not been revealed yet. The goal is to \"put it into the top 10, so it’s not a niche fragrance.\" (according to Christine Dagousset, wwd ) \" No. 5 is more about femininity and accomplishment. What Mademoiselle Chanel has is this whole paradox of being vulnerable and invincible…and impertinent. Gabrielle is really who she was [as Gabrielle]. We really want it to be the expression of who she was at her core as a woman whose values are so modern today…to feature who she was before she became Coco. We’ve done a lot of research with Millennial women around the world and you see very clearly they don’t want to be put in boxes. They want to live their own lives, they want to be themselves, they want to choose their destiny,\" said Christine Dagousset (global president of fragrance and beauty at Chanel) to wwd . Gabrielle Eau de Parfum comes out in June 2017.
