Police believe Daugherty shot Roberts The incident happened at a ranch near Candelaria in the early hours of January 6. Paramedics found Daugherty and another man, Edwin Roberts, suffering from gunshot wounds. They were all part of a group of hunters in the area. The group told police they had been attacked by illegal immigrants who tried to steal their RV. The claims were followed up by Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who claimed the attack was another reason to build a wall along the southern border to halt 'violent criminals and members of drug cartels coming in'. However, police believe Daugherty shot Roberts and Bryant shot Daugherty.
