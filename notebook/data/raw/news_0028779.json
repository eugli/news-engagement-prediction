Sidd Bikkannavar works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. After racing solar-powered cars in Chile, he had trouble returning to America. mspohr quote The Verge: Bikkannavar says he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and pressured to give the Customs and Border Protection agents his phone and access PIN . Since the phone was issued by NASA, it may have contained sensitive material that wasn't supposed to be shared. Bikkannavar's phone was returned to him after it was searched by CBP, but he doesn't know exactly what information officials might have taken from the device... The officer also presented Bikkannavar with a document titled \"Inspection of Electronic Devices\" and explained that CBP had authority to search his phone. Bikkannavar did not want to hand over the device, because it was given to him by JPL and is technically NASA property. He even showed the officer the JPL barcode on the back of phone. Nonetheless, CBP asked for the phone and the access PIN. \"I was cautiously telling him I wasn't allowed to give it out, because I didn't want to seem like I was not cooperating,\" says Bikkannavar. \"I told him I'm not really allowed to give the passcode; I have to protect access. But he insisted they had the authority to search it.\" While border agents have the right to search devices , The Verge reports that travelers aren't legally required to unlock their phones, \"although agents can detain them for significant periods of time if they do not.\" They also report that Bikkannavar \"was not allowed to leave until he gave CBP his PIN,\" adding that the cybersecurity team at JPL \"was not happy about the breach.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:02:21.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
