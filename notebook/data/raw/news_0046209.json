Beyond question, Jackson Heights is the first stop for anyone seeking an education in the Tibetan syllabus: momos filled with brothy beef under their bellybutton pleats; laphing, noodles neatly rolled and sliced like strudel and set loose in a puddle of chile oil; steaming, salty, bracing cups of yak butter tea. Most of the neighborhood’s places for samosas and naan, though, are either gone or faded into insignificance. You less often meet somebody who sends you to Curry Hill for the cooking of India. But it’s the correct answer. Once known mainly for cheap buffet lunches (Haandi, long the reigning champion of the steam table, is still one of Manhattan’s unnatural wonders), Lexington Avenue in the upper 20s has over the past few years become home to the most diverse and concentrated hub of Indian restaurants in New York City. A disproportionate amount of this diversity is the work of two veteran chefs and restaurateurs. Shiva Natarajan opened one Curry Hill restaurant that paid tribute to Kolkata , particularly its Jewish cuisine; another that showcased food from India’s southwest coast; a third that brought together dishes from the cities of Lucknow and Hyderabad; and a fourth that specialized in the Punjab. He sold all four to Hemant Mathur two years ago. Together they started working on a fifth, Sahib. It opened in the fall.   More than those other restaurants, one of which has closed, Sahib darts around India. Mr. Natarajan, who worked as the consulting chef, organized the menu around dishes he has been gathering in India while researching a cookbook. He isn’t trying to be encyclopedic, and the menu reflects that; it pays a little bit of attention to several regions and ignores others entirely. This makes it hard to get a firm sense of any one regional style, but easy to enjoy several dishes you may have never seen before. \nAdvertisement   This may even be true for Indians. Goans might not recognize Sahib’s wonderful blend of fried eggplant stirred into a smoky mash of eggplant that has been softened in a tandoor; the dish, only casually spiced, comes from the northern city of Varanasi, on the Ganges. Potatoes are stewed all over India, but Sahib’s dum olav may be new to those who aren’t from Kashmir. Little round potatoes are stabbed with a toothpick first so they will pick up more of the sauce they’re cooked in: yogurt seasoned with tamarind, cardamom and Kashmiri chiles. The sauce wins its arguments through persuasion rather than force, in part because it has no tomatoes or onions. Follow NYT Food's board Restaurant Reviews on Pinterest. To see what a difference leaving them out can make, try the rogan josh. If you’ve had this Kashmiri lamb dish at other local Indian restaurants, you probably think of rogan josh as a bulldozer of a dish, more powerful than graceful. Chances are onions and tomatoes were the ground floor on which the thick brown gravy was built. At Sahib, the sauce is creamier and gentle enough that the taste of saffron doesn’t get lost, and I found myself really paying attention to the flavors — a new experience when it comes to rogan josh. If the lamb in both that dish and another I tried was very slightly more chewy than my ideal, it’s also true that the goat never let me down. In the marchwagan korma, a curry from Kashmir, goat was cooked on the bones in a rich and intensely aromatic yogurt sauce. Nothing I had at Sahib was noisily spicy, but the Kashmiri chiles in this korma made themselves heard. From the city of Mangalore on the Arabian Sea comes kori gassi, a very mild and irresistible chicken stew; coriander, asafetida and curry leaves season the coconut milk.
