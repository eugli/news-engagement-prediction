People, April Bloomfield is cooking meat, one of the things she does best. Two young butchers, Jocelyn Guest and Erika Nakamura, are partners in the restaurant; in their blue aprons and white shirts, they oversee the carving and trimming and sawing and chopping. Looking at the colors in the glass butcher’s case, the plum purple of the raw pork and the marigold yellow of the chicken skin, you know that this meat will cook up so nicely that it can be eaten and enjoyed all by itself. White Gold doesn’t go quite that far, but it comes close. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The menu gets right to the point, no small talk: The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them, cooked very simply. A gorgeously juicy and pink length of grilled pork, for example, was flecked with sage salt, and its only garnish was a spoonful of sauce made from apples — not applesauce but a saltier and more complex reduction. Beef heart was served like steak, sliced into small, tender, nearly rare slabs. The spice-and-nut blend dukkah was the seasoning. Probably meant more for the roasted carrots on the same plate, the dukkah was also at home with the heart. A special one night was a portion of pork shoulder cooked in milk at a quiet murmur until the meat had relaxed and the liquid had boiled away and the fat had pulled together in sweet curds the color of peanut butter. It sounds and looks creepy, but it’s wonderful. As good as it felt to lose myself in tender pork and caramelized milk, the high point of that dinner was beef carpaccio. White Gold now makes my favorite version of this classic Italian dish in New York. The toppings are sliced white mushrooms, parsley leaves and pickled broccoli stems. I’d never given much thought to pickled broccoli stems before, but now I think their highest use is with darkly lush sheets of raw beef furred over with fine white horseradish gratings.

For the single raviolo, two circles of barely cooked kabocha squash do the work normally done by pasta, sandwiching a creamy core of Taleggio that will end up running out and slipping into the broth, no matter how careful you are, flavoring the soup along with red drops of pumpkinseed oil. If none of this has persuaded you to take a train or crosstown bus to the Upper West Side, then it’s time to let the “crispy layered potato” out of its cage. These are little golden boxes made of thin rectangles of potato stacked like Post-it notes, then fried in beef fat. I’m not sure how they stay together. They are crunchy and delicate and impossible to stop eating. White Gold has found a way to multiply the surface area of a fairly small piece of potato so that more potato comes into contact with hot oil. This is a significant advance in the field of applied potato physics. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
