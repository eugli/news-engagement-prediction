Mohamed Idris said items like current converters, power adapters, chargers for computers and rechargeable batteries should be regulated as they handle electricity supplies at 240 volts and are potential explosives or could be fire hazards.\nHe expressed shock that the List of Regulated Electrical Equipment drafted by the Energy Commission (EC) does not include many common products.\n“Even most electric cables do not have either EC or Sirim approval,” he said in a press conference at CAP’s office in Jalan Masjid Negeri yesterday.\nHe said the Electrical and Electronics Association of Malaysia (TEEAM) recently warned that many everyday electric cables in the market are made from poor quality materials.\n“These substandard electric cables are prone to overheating and catching fire,” he said.\nMohamed Idris said despite stringent regulations, they find it surprising that electrical goods without EC or Sirim approval are being imported.\nHe urged EC and Sirim to review and expand their list of regulated products.\n“Authorities should also raid the market for electrical products that carry fake EC or Sirim certification,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:23.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
