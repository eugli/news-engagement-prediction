What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane.\" Pres. Trump: \"The new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old...what can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane.\" pic.twitter.com/hZvosKzQbc — ABC News (@ABC) February 17, 2017 \nBut the president's comment—which is most definitely a snub toward women who age or, in other words, all women—is not sexist, because he is not sexist , he claims. \nBut if sexism could touch him, this would definitely be a sexist comment about how women past the age of 30 cannot be considered beautiful, and certainly not as gorgeous as Trump's old-as-death ae-ro-plane. (No one remind him, his daughter Ivanka is 35.) \nAlas, because Trump is not sexist , his comment was most definitely not a reflection of society's expectations upon women to look young and beautiful literally every day of their waking lives—a message that girls hear as soon as they can understand their native tongue which results in low body confidence, with 40 to 70 percent of girls feeling dissatisfied with two or more parts of their bodies by the time they reach middle school. \nNope, because our commander-in-chief does not actually hate women and, as proof that he loves women so much, has married three of them, his comment about how literally nothing stays as beautiful at age 30 as a fucking plane has garnered misplaced criticism. Again, our president has never said anything bad about women , let alone older women, ever. Reflexive response to seeing Trump's \"what can look so beautiful at 30\" q was \"the anniversary of the day you are no longer the president?\" — Rebecca Traister (@rtraister) February 17, 2017 For Trump only a machine can look beautiful at 30. Did current Mrs Trump hear that? If she did, she surely couldn't have been surprised. — Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 17, 2017 Trump, gesturing to the Boeing behind him: \"It's 30y'so! What can look that beautiful at 30? An Airplane.\" Well, certainly not women. Hags. — haunted dog (@zandywithaz) February 17, 2017 #Trump : What can look so beautiful at 30?
