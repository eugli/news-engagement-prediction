Matthew Ball yelled 'Qismat!' as he ran and then hugged Qismat Amin at San Francisco International Airport in a series of emotional embraces that marked the end of a years long battle to get the translator out of his war-torn country.\n'I'm so happy,' Ball told The Associated Press after welcoming Amin. 'Yeah it feels great. I'm happy to see him. I'm sort of overwhelmed. He's here. It's been a long time.'\nArmy Capt. Matthew Ball, right, prepares to hug his former interpreter Qismat Amin, as Amin arrives from Afghanistan, at San Francisco International Airport\nBall welcomed Amin to the United States after buying him a plane ticket to ensure he would get in fast amid concern the Trump administration may expand its travel ban to Afghanistan\nThe interpreter waited nearly four years for his special immigrant visa. He lived in hiding after receiving death threats from the Taliban for helping American troops.\nHis visa arrived two days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending the nation's refugee program and temporarily halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nAfghanistan was not among them, but U.S. officials said shortly after the order was signed that the list could be expanded to include other countries. The ban has since been placed on hold while it's being debated in the courts.\nBall bought Amin a $1,000 plane ticket to San Francisco to get him to the U.S. as soon as possible.\nArmy Capt.

Amin is one of the lucky ones\nAmin has said he was nervous he would not feel welcome after Trump's order because he is an immigrant and Muslim. But those fears faded after he arrived to Americans holding signs that read 'Welcome to America' and 'Welcome Home.'\n'Right now, I don't know what to say. I forgot my words,' he said. 'Actually this has made me much, much stronger, seeing people with the welcome signs. I feel like I got a huge family right now, and I got a big family in Afghanistan. But right now I got a way bigger family than I ever expected.'\nBall, a law student at Stanford University, led a letter campaign with fellow students, including many veterans, lobbying Congress to inquire about why it was taking so long for Amin to get a visa.\nMore than 13,000 Afghans and their immediate family members have been waiting to get a special immigrant visa for aiding the U.S. mission, according to the U.S. State Department.\nA supporter holds a sign for U.S. Army interpreter Qismat Amin. Amin had said he was nervous he would not feel welcome after Trump's order because he is an immigrant and Muslim\nCongress approved an additional 1,500 visas in December and extended the program until the end of 2020, but advocates say the number is woefully inadequate.\nBall said the U.S. government should speed up the years long visa process for interpreters and cultural advisers in Afghanistan because their lives are at risk after helping U.S. troops.\nAmerica's longest war, which began in response to 9/11, has grinded into its 16th year.\nArmy Capt.
