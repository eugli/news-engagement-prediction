My mother was a teacher for almost 15 years. My upbringing taught me the value of money and the importance of hard work. When I started my entrepreneurial journey after college, my father told me to never forget the three Ps – Peace, Patience and Perseverance. And if you put in hardwork with 100 percent honesty, sooner or later, you will succeed. So, during my startup journey, I followed strict financial discipline and maintained my patience despite facing lots of rejections and failures. I kept on working hard with an undying hope and belief that success was just one night away. These learnings helped me build successful bootstrapped businesses.” \nGaurav started SaaS Labs Inc. on 17th February 2016 to experiment with a couple of product ideas. He then went on to publicly launch the company’s product JustCall.io on 2nd December. \nTwenty eight-year-old Gaurav has till now built four companies, out of which two were hits while the other two met with failure. He sold his last company to the New York Times, and before that, sold an analytics company to LA-based Science, Inc. He has also done a couple of angel investments in the SaaS/B2B space.
