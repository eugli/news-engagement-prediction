He also has a changing room with experienced players and leaders who will support him from the start. \n“The role of Test captain is an honour and a responsibility which he thoroughly deserves. Joe has maturity beyond his years and having seen him develop at Yorkshire over the last ten years I know his qualities well.” \nRoot, who was Cook’s vice-captain, takes over as Test skipper ahead of England’s one-day series against the West Indies.

A three-match home series against the West Indies follows before England’s greatest challenge, an away Ashes series against Australia, begins at the Gabba. in November. \nRoot said he was “privileged, humbled and very excited” to take on the new role. \n“We have a very good group of players and I’m looking forward to leading them out in the summer, building on Alastair’s achievements and making the most of our talents in the years ahead,” Root said. \n“The senior guys in the changing room play a very influential role and whilst there’s a natural progression for me it’s a huge support to know that they are there to help and advise.” \nRoot has developed into one of the world’s best batsmen since making his debut in December 2012. With 4,594 runs at an average of 52.80 and 11 centuries to his name, he currently sits third in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen. \nDirector of England Cricket Andrew Strauss said selectors undertook a proper process to pick a new skipper and that he was delighted Root accepted the role immediately.
