Both have lost only two games and are undefeated in Denver Prep League play. And both have a seasoned roster that knows what it’s like to qualify for and get sent home from the state tournament.\nBut the parallels end about there, as the Class 5A No. 2 Patriot boys (18-2) have been the subject of much hype since the season began and are expected to make a legitimate push for the program’s sixth state championship and first since 1994.\nMeanwhile, the Class 4A No. 10 Lady Patriots (16-2) have been quietly succeeding all season long as they, too, have their sights set on the Denver Coliseum and the program’s first state title.\nThe George Washington girls are well aware the boys get most of the attention, but don’t let that bother them, as first-year coach Keithan Lyons and his players realize hype means little once the tournament begins.\n“I think everybody looks at the boys program and forgets about us a little bit, because we’ve been winning all year and going under the radar, which is kind of a good thing,” Lyons said. “But we’re confident we can make a good push in the postseason to get to the Coliseum, and that’s been our goal from the beginning of the year.”\nThis is the second consecutive year the Lady Patriots have looked up to a title run. Last winter, the girls headed into the 5A tournament at 20-2 and undefeated in conference play, good enough to earn them a first-round bye. Yet George Washington was bounced from the tournament in the second round in a 72-70 upset at the hands of Dakota Ridge , a loss that still resonates with a squad that graduated only one senior.\n“They got caught off guard—not necessarily with Dakota Ridge, but in terms of how to get into the playoffs and then be successful in the playoffs,” Lyons said. “I think that stung a lot for them last year, and this year they want to make amends for that, especially because a lot of people thought with us losing (leading scorer Sophie Nick) that this group wouldn’t be as good this year. That’s been a big motivation, too, to continue to prove people wrong.”\nSenior shooting guard Davenport Brantley (15.8 points per game) and senior point guard Jendaya Jefferson (11.1) are providing most of the offense, while senior forward Mekhi Peoples, senior guard guard Darionna Ray and junior forward Jayde Martin, the team’s de facto defensive stopper, round out the Patriots’ starting lineup.\n“We have a great group of seniors who have been on varsity since their freshman year,” Lyons said, “so they’re experienced and battle-tested, and it’s showing because they’re buying into what I’m trying to get them to do.”\nBut losses to Golden on Dec. 15 and to Green Mountain on Dec. 20—which came by a combined five points—showed the Lady Patriots they have strides to make in order to be the last team standing on March 11.\nRelated Articles January 31, 2017 Post Preps Power Rankings: Week of Friday, Feb. 3 January 30, 2017 Weekly Colorado Preps Primer: Games to watch for Jan. 31-Feb. 4, 2017 January 24, 2017 Horizon and Legacy clash in Front Range League girls basketball action January 24, 2017 Post Preps Power Rankings: Week of Friday, Jan. 27 January 23, 2017 Weekly Colorado Preps Primer: Games to watch for Jan. 24-28, 2017 “We need to play more as a team—we try to do a lot of things individually still, so if we just keep coming together, we can achieve what we want,” Davenport Brantley said. “We’ve also learned that we can’t look past anybody, because even though we’re a good team, we can be beat. We have to come out and prove ourselves every single night.”\nAnd with that collective chip on their shoulder, the Lady Patriots are here to remind that it’s not just the George Washington boys who will be making noise at the state tournament.\n“We’ve got all the intangibles,” Lyons said. “Now, it’s a matter of putting it all out on the court and making sure we’re playing our best basketball in March.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:38:34.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
