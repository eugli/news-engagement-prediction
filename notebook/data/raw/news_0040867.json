Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teacher who was sacked after bosses learned she had previously worked in porn is fighting to get her job back. \nResa Woodward, 38, says she lost her position as a science teacher at Balch Springs Middle School in Dallas, Texas, when word got out about her past. \nShe says someone sent anonymous tip to the school that she had worked in adult films more than 16 years ago last year. \nResa says she was forced into working in porn by an older man when she was in her early 20s. \nShe went under the name Robyn Foster and appeared in at least a dozen films. Resa says she was forced into working in porn and has since transformed her life (Photo: Twitter) \nBut she told the Dallas Morning News she managed to break from the man, finish high school and become a teacher. \nShe hoped she'd left her past behind and believes she deserves a chance to continue teaching at the all-girls school. \nShe said: \"The sad thing is that if these girls find out that I'm being punished for something that I did nearly 20 years ago and had no control of and fought to get out of, well, what does that say about empowerment?\" \nWoodward remains on admin leave while a review continues.
