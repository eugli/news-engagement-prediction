Ecuador presidential hopeful promises to evict Julian Assange from embassy Read more \nThe widely different results of two exit polls saw Moreno’s camp celebrating victory in the first round while Lasso declared there would be a second round in which he would face the government’s candidate. \nFlanked by Rafael Correa and the vice-president, Jorge Glas, Moreno told his rival to “lose with dignity” while he would “win with humility”. Lasso, speaking to his supporters, insisted that there would be a second round. \nExit polls by Cedatos gave 39.4% for 63-year-old Moreno, who was a former vice-president under Correa, and 30.5 % for Lasso, a 61-year-old former banker. \nBut exit polls by Santiago Perez, a second polling organisation, handed victory to Moreno with 42.9% with Lasso trailing with 27.7%. For an outright win a candidate would need 40% and a 10-point lead over his nearest rival. \nA second round is not expected to favour Moreno, say analysts, who predict Ecuador’s opposition could join forces around Lasso who has vehemently attacked the government, blaming it for an economic downturn and corruption scandals. \nOn Sunday there were angry scenes when Lasso accompanied his running mate Andrés Páez to a polling station in the middle-class Rumipampa neighbourhood of Quito, which happened to be the same place where Moreno had to cast his ballot. \nSurrounded by supporters chanting “Lasso, please, save Ecuador” the opposition candidate confidently told journalists the election would have a wider significance in Latin America where the “pink tide” could be reaching its low-water mark, because right-leaning leaders have taken over in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. “There will be a second round and in this round democracy and liberty will win, not just in Ecuador but also in Latin America,” he said. \nBy contrast Moreno, a wheelchair-bound former businessman cut a more placid figure as he cast his ballot surrounded by supporters chanting their support. “The elections are a democratic party which the people must enjoy because they are choosing the destiny they will meet in the future,” he said, choosing a more neutral tone than his rival. \nA former United Nations special envoy on disability , Moreno, if he wins, he would be the first paraplegic head of state, having used a wheelchair since he was shot in a robbery. \nOutside the polling station, dozens of the party faithful gathered to voice their support for Moreno, a less combative figure than Rafael Correa, known for his humour and advocacy for disabled rights. “I’ve always supported this government with all my soul, because it’s the people’s movement which cares about the forgotten ones,” said Anita Rueda, a Moreno supporter. \nWheelchair user Angel Tobias Jerez had travelled especially to support Moreno. “Our comrade Lenín Moreno has won the hearts of all of us who have a disability,” he said. “Not just here but at an international level.” \nWhether he can win the presidency is another matter in an election that analysts are viewing as a vote that will test the legacy of the self-declared leader of 21 st- century socialism, Rafael Correa. \n“Whichever candidate wins … they will face mounting debt, corruption allegations and demands from different sectors,” said Gabriel Hidalgo, a political scientist at Quito’s Americas University.
