Few are aware that AIG, a large American insurer, has owned and operated Stowe, a famed ski resort in Vermont, for nearly 70 years. But on February 21st, it announced a $50m deal to sell it to Vail Resorts, owner of ten skiing spots in the American and Canadian Rockies. The insurer is, however, keeping most of the property in Spruce Peak, the ski village at the base of Stowe’s slopes, including rights to future development. After AIG had owned Stowe for so long, the news of the sale has come as a surprise. Its involvement with the resort dates back to 1943, when Cornelius Starr, AIG’s chairman at the time, visited Stowe and got frustrated at having to queue for the only chairlift. He offered to help finance a second one. AIG took ownership in 1949, so Stowe had the distinction of having the same owner longer than any other ski resort in North America. Owning and operating property assets is usual practice for AIG and many of its fellow insurers. Real estate can provide an important and diversifying source of investment income to cushion underwriting losses, especially at a time when the bonds that insurers traditionally invest in have been yielding measly returns. AIG’s property arm, founded in 1987, is particularly large compared with its peers. Though down from its pre-crisis peak of $25bn in assets, it still oversees a massive $18.8bn-worth, ranging from European commercial property to more than 100,000 units of affordable housing across America. Why, after doing so well for so long, would AIG suddenly decide to sell? There are, of course, idiosyncratic risks in the skiing business. Last winter, for instance, Stowe received the least natural snowfall in its entire history, prompting many skiers to stay away. But AIG was particularly scarred by its near-fatal accident on the steep slope of the credit crisis—enduring the humiliation of a government bail-out in 2008—and has had enough of hurtling downhill. Chastened by its experience, it has decided to focus on its core businesses of life and property-and-casualty insurance. The firm has rid itself of legacy insurance exposures through “retroactive reinsurance” deals, and pulled its investments out of certain types of hedge funds. In real estate, it had already reduced the countries it was exposed to, scaling back in Mexico and selling its stake in an office complex in Seoul. Stepping out of non-core industries—Stowe was the only ski resort in AIG’s portfolio—is a logical next step. Although some parts of AIG’s consolidation and divestment may take time to pay off, this deal looks promising for all parties involved. Skiers, for one, have reason to rejoice. Vail has already announced its intention to include Stowe in its seasonal pass valid at all the resorts it owns for the 2017-8 season. The move would not only make Stowe much cheaper, but also bring price competition to other Vermont resorts. And as those skiers fill the lodges and clubs of Spruce Peak, AIG will surely have much to celebrate, as well.
