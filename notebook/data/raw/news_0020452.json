Fox Globe Correspondent February 07, 2017\nTuesday morning was cold and snowy in Boston, but that didn’t stop many Patriots fans and players from celebrating the team’s Super Bowl LI victory without their parkas — or even their shirts.\nTight end Rob Gronkowski was characteristcally eccentric atop a duck boat Tuesday, shirtless and holding up a couple of beers.\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nNew England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski held up beers during the New England Patriots parade.\nAdvertisement\nVideo of the Patriots’ parade through Boston also appeared to show the son of special teams coach Joe Judge celebrating shirtless while perched on his father’s shoulders.\nJudge has two sons, Sean and Michael. A Patriots spokesman could not immediately confirm the identity of the boy in the parade.\nOk nevermind. Joe Judge's son won the parade.
