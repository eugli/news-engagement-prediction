Ashley Gurbal Kritzer The Molasky Group of Companies has purchased the Barnett Bank building from Shad Khan's Stache Investment for $4 million, according to property records. The Downtown Investment Authority approved $5.8 million in public incentives for a $90 million project that would see nearly 320,000 square feet of vacant, Downtown property restored. The City Council could chip in another $4 million for the project, but it will have to be discussed at a future meeting. The Barnett Bank Building in Downtown Jacksonville. Ashley Gurbal Kritzer Included in the $5.8 million incentive package is a $1.8 million recaptured enhanced value grant that will be applied over a 20 year period. None of the funds would be transferred to the developers until a certificate of occupancy was received. The city's funds would be tied to completion of the Barnett Bank building and the DIA's portion would be tied to the Laura Street Trio. City Council President Lori Boyer said on Feb. 1 after the DIA approved its portion of the incentive package, she hoped to see a economic development agreement in March. Steve Atkins first proposed redeveloping the Laura Street Trio and the Barnett Bank building in 2010. He controls the Laura Street Trio properties and has partnered with Las Vegas-based Molasky. Atkins had purchased the Barnett Bank building in 2013 with $3 million borrowed from Stache Investments. Stache Investments foreclosed on the property after Atkins failed to make payments on that $3 million loan and another smaller loan. Stache won the foreclosure action and retained possession of the property in late 2016. Much of what Atkins envisioned for the project and presented to the DIA is still in the plans going forward. Plans for the Barnett Bank building include about 100 market-rate apartments and office and retail space. The Laura Street Trio will be a specialty hotel, restaurant, rooftop bar as well as retail and office space.
