Image copyright Crossrail Image caption This Tudor bowling ball was found preserved in the boggy moat of a manor in Stepney Green Image copyright Crossrail MOLA Image caption These objects, found near Liverpool Street station, have been identified as ice skates with the help of the writings of a 12th Century monk, who described young men skating on bones tied to their shoes \n\"It had been in a moat which was boggy. Henry VIII brought in a ban banning commoners from bowling. It was only for the aristocracy. \n\"Stepney Green is now part of Greater London but it would have been a weekend retreat in the countryside.\" \nA chamber pot found beneath 19th Century terraced housing, also in Stepney Green, ranks as another highlight for Ms Keily. \n\"It dates back to when there were no indoor toilets or bathrooms,\" she said. \"This one is fabulous because it has a shocked-looking man saying: 'What I see I will not tell'.\" Image copyright Crossrail Image caption This chamber pot gives an insight into modesty in Victorian times \nThe discoveries made were by no means restricted to those from Victorian, Tudor or medieval times though, with considerably older items being unearthed, including bison bone fragments in the part of the capital we now call Royal Oak. \nAsked if there had been previous evidence of bison roaming there, Ms Keily said: \"We kind of knew but it's incredible to find the remains. \n\"There were three fragments of bison bone and one of reindeer from an antler. They were dated back to about 68,000 years ago. \n\"Some of the bones had traces of gnawing, possibly from wolves.\" Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Scientific analysis of skeletons identified the DNA of the bacteria that caused the 1665 Great Plague \nTwo finds from the Crossrail project have ended up among the 80 million specimens at the Natural History Museum: a piece of 55-million-year-old amber and two parts of a woolly mammoth jawbone. Both were discovered beneath Canary Wharf. \nThe bone find could prove to be important, as Jessica Simpson from the museum explains: \"They can date the woolly mammoth specimen once it is off display and they might be able to determine when they became extinct in our region. \n\"The last known woolly mammoths were roaming a small part of northern Siberia about 4,000 years ago.\" \nFor Ms Keily, the discovery that will perhaps provide the most significant element of Crossrail's archaeological legacy is the human remains found at Liverpool Street. \nDNA testing on teeth found in the 17th Century Bedlam cemetery confirmed the identity of the bacteria behind London's Great Plague for the first time. \n\"That's an important discovery,\" she said. \nAnd it's not the only one. \nDon Walker, senior human osteologist at the Museum of London Archaeology, analysed some skeletons found at Charterhouse Square in Farringdon.

It's a little bit frustrating. \n\"They've got lots of little circles and they are trying to interpret London from that.\" \nBut he added: \"Only time will tell. If interesting papers are published and we learn more about diseases of the past and how they are changing, it's going to be a good resource to teach students with.\" \nSome of the finds as they were reported Image copyright Museum of London Docklands", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:39:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
