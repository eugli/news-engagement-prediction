(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images) by Christopher Polk/Getty Images Lady Gaga’s 13-minute Super Bowl half-time show Sunday night was widely praised—earning plaudits from everyone from Ivanka Trump to Hillary Clinton to Marco Rubio to Zac Efron to Katy Perry to Chris Pratt . Gaga—who had said she’d dreamed of performing in the half-time show since she was four—spent the past few months seemingly dedicated solely to preparing for the event. And she pulled it off—completing the acrobatic, athletic show without any guests (making her only the eighth performer ever to do so)—ending the set by literally dropping a mic , and then catching a football as she jumped off the stage. Given the enormous size of the audience watching the Super Bowl, Gaga seems to have understood the importance of capitalizing on the attention (she was mentioned 2.1 million times on Twitter between 7:50 and 8:40 Sunday night, according to a Twitter representative). All of the songs she performed during half-time—which were weighted more toward the pre- Joanne phase of her career—were immediately discounted on iTunes. This move reaped immediate benefits, as “Million Reasons” jumped to No. 1 on iTunes and “Born This Way,”“Poker Face,” and “Bad Romance” also lodged their way in the top 10 (at No. 5, No. 7, and No. 9, respectively). Gaga’s first-ever hit, “Just Dance,” sits just outside the top 10, at No. 13. Additionally, the deluxe-edition of Joanne is the top-selling album on iTunes at the moment, with the regular version at No. 3 (other Gaga albums sit at No. 4, No. 6, No. 9, and No. 11 on the albums chart). Aside from its iTunes strategy, Team Gaga also revealed in a post-game GIF that she will be going on tour later this year. (This is a similar move to the one Beyoncé pulled last year after her appearance in Coldplay’s half-time show.) Gaga’s tour will kick off in Vancouver in August, before making its way through North America, Brazil, and Europe. No word as to whether she will begin each show by falling into the stadium from the roof as she did at the Super Bowl.
