But the filmmaker has denied that it’s a biopic.\nAccording to Variety, the Bangladesh Film Development Corporation’s (BFDC) Joint Venture Preview Committee approved the script of the movie on March 8, 2016, after which the film went into production. The completed film was previewed for the BFDC on February 12, 2017 and received a No Objection Certificate on February 15.\nHowever, a day later, the BFDC sent a letter stating that the certificate had been cancelled due to a letter from the Bangladesh Information Ministry.\n“I am really surprised to know that the government of Bangladesh has blocked the film. This is a humane story that deals with complex male and female relationships in a subtle and balanced way. What harm will it cause to the society if seen?” Khan said.\nThe actor, acclaimed for his work in Indian films such The Lunchbox, Paan Singh Tomar and Piku , plays the lead role in No Bed of Roses.\nThe Variety article claims they have had access to the film and it starts with a disclaimer that the film has no resemblance to any real life characters alive or dead.\nNo Bed of Roses is a co-production between Bangladesh’s Jaaz Multimedi, India’s Eskay Movies and Khan’s IK Company.\nFarooki, who is known in Bangladeshi cinema for works such as Television and Ant Story, is now taking the matter to court.\nTapan Kumar Ghosh, BFDC managing director, told Variety that it is not the BFDC’s prerogative to issue the certificate and it was up to the Bangladesh Film Censor Board to issue it.\nIn reality, international co-productions cannot approach the Censor Board without the BFDC certificate.\n“We have been blocked at the first gate,” said Farooki.\n“As the order does not explain any reason, I don’t know why they thought screening of the film would be inappropriate. Yes, my film handles a so-called taboo subject but it doesn’t show anything explicit and hence doesn’t violate any censor code. This goes against the freedom of expression,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:01:29.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
