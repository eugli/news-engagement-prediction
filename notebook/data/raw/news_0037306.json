The couple recently traveled to the Czech Republic for a second round of IVF to save money on the procedure, KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported. \nAs the officer walked up to the window, he told Blackmore that he wasn't going to give him a ticket, but started to give him a lecture instead. \n\"... As a parent, we also have to make sure that we're good role models, correct?\" the officer said. \"And, seeing as you're in that boat now, don't you think it's important you do the same?\" \nThe officer handed a Blackmore a \"Baby on Board\" decal. When he turned to his wife, Michelle, she was holding a positive pregnancy test, KTVT reported. \n\"I just knew I wanted to have a cool story,\" Michelle Blackmore told the station. \nIn a Facebook post, Michelle Blackmore thanked Wylie police Chief Anthony Henderson and Officer Howeth for helping with the surprise.
