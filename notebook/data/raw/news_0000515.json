The guests at the marriage procession and the bride and groom were all dressed in T-shirts and tracks instead of wedding clothes, ready for a 25-km marathon run to the marriage registration office in Satara town. \n\nThe bridegroom, Navnath Dighe from Kaloshi village, is associated with Satara Marathon Association for at least three years now. So is his wife Poonam. Both of them met during the Marathon events that the association organises. They decided on this unique way of getting married to promote the message of fitness. \n\nNavnath, who is an owner of a printer repair shop, has participated in eight marathons till date and is considered one of the top runners of the association. \n\n\"I am a fitness freak since childhood. Running has always been my hobby. After the marriage date was fixed, my friends started teasing me. They said that I would tie the knot only after running a marathon,\" he told TOI soon after tying the knot with Poonam. \n\n\"I am against spending exorbitantly on marriages, therefore I decided to go for a simple way. The money that I have saved will be used for a fitness cause,\" added Navnath.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:12:36.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
