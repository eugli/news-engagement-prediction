(John Canzano/Staff) By Mike Tokito | The Oregonian on February 22, 2017 7:39 PM, updated February 22, 2017 10:42 PM comments \nFormer Southern Oregon University coach Jim Palazzolo will join Westview High School’s football staff as offensive coordinator, Wildcats coach Ryan Atkinson said Wednesday. \nPalazzolo coached the Raiders from 1989 to 1995, and his players included former Oregon coach Mark Helfrich. Palazzolo led SOU at a time when it was in danger of being cut , and his efforts helped keep the program alive. \nThis past season, Palazzolo served as a volunteer coach at Westview, helping his son, AJ Palazzolo, who was the Wildcats offensive coordinator. AJ Palozzolo left after he got a job in marketing in Dallas, Texas, and Atkinson turned to his father to succeed him. \nAfter leaving SOU, Jim Palazzolo went into the mortgage business, setting up in Medford, where AJ was a two-year starting quarterback at South Medford 10 years ago. Jim Palazzolo had two brief dalliances back in coaching, serving as the offensive line coach at North Medford in 1997 and coaching a Pop Warner team in 2000. He also served as a senior advisor for Southern Oregon in 2010-11. \nWestview, in Atkinson’s second year as coach, finished 8-3 and in third place in the Metro League this past season. The Wildcats started the season 7-0 before losing their final two games of the regular season, to Beaverton and Jesuit, then reached the second round of the playoffs for the second year in a row. The Wildcats had ended a five-year run of first-round ousters the year before. \n-- Mike Tokito", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:01:27.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
