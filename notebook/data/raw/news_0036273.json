[BIG LITTLE LIES] is a fun, engaging and sometimes disturbing read” – USA Today Sometimes it’s the little lies that turn out to be the most lethal. . . . A murder… . . . a tragic accident… . . . or just parents behaving badly? What’s indisputable is that someone is dead. But who did what? Big Little Lies follows three women, each at a crossroads: Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest ( how is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?). Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay. New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all. Big Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive. Customer Reviews by FinnAli Oh boy can Liane Moriarty tell a story. I’d read “What Alice Forgot” and “The Husband’s Secret” so I knew she was an excellent author. “Big Little Lies” is now my favorite of the three. I downloaded it onto my iPad on Friday afternoon and finished Saturday evening. I couldn’t turn pages fast enough! A MUST READ!!! Another hit! by VinoDiva8 I read Husband's Secret & What Alice Forgot & enjoyed them, so when I had a chance to pre-buy, I did. I love her style. The \"mystery\" factor that the books I've read have, is what draws me, and I love the OMG, factor, when you find \"something\" out and it just gets yelled out! This book also had me yelling out loud, and my husband is used to being ignored when I read a book from this author... Because I want to \"know\" the \"mystery\" and to the author\"s style, it really doesn't happen till close to the end! Loved it! by CeceDonnie I have been waiting all summer for a book this good! Seriously could not put down. Can't wait for her next book!
