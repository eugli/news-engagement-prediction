I want to take that normal and toss it.'\nScroll down for video\nFormula shun! Tamara Ecclestone shared an artistic shot of herself breastfeeding her two-year-old daughter Sophia on Wednesday\nMessage: Alongside the image, she added a caption about the importance of breastfeeding\nThe shot showed the 32-year-old daughter of F1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone wearing a flowing white dress as her child, clad in a pink gown, clutched her breast while peering at the camera.\nTamara has shared a number of images of herself breastfeeding her daughter in a defiant move to normalise the natural practice.\nSpeaking to The Sun's Fabulous magazine back in October, the brunette beauty said that she found the uproar over her breastfeeding 'bizarre'.\nDefiant: The daughter of F1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone has often shared shots of herself breastfeeding her adorable offspring in public\nTamara, who is married to former trader Jay Rutland, 35, added: 'Yes, Sophia is two-and-a-half and yes, a lot of people wouldn’t breastfeed now. But it’s so comforting for her and she loves it.'\nShe joked that her little 'beast' might never tire of breastfeeding and she would be left with 'saggy' breasts - and when asked what she'll do if Sophia wants to keep breastfeeding when she reaches the age of four, she replied: 'We'll cross that bridge when it comes to it.'\nSpeaking to FEMAIL earlier this year, Tamara shared a very clear message for her trolls: 'I would tell them to go eat their dinner in the toilet.'\nHappy family: The 32-year-old daughter of F1 Billionaire Bernie Ecclestone is married to former trader Jay Rutland, 35\nKeep cosy in style with Tamara's coat by Yves Salomon £3000 Yves Salomon Yves Salomon Belted Shearling Coat\nBuy from Browns Fashion\nBuy now\nThe cold weather continues to present a major fashion conundrum: how to stay warm without sacrificing your style.

It's tricky as parenting is one of those things everyone seems to have an opinion on and a lot of the time it's unwanted and can be so cruel.\n'I am doing my best as a mum by following my heart and intuition. I feel mums should really listen to their intuition; no one knows their baby better.'\nTamara will likely halt Sophia's long-running breastfeeding privileges when she has her second baby - which she insists will be her last, and who she expects to be a boy - although she's undecided about when the child will arrive.\nSweet treat: While she may still be breastfed, Sophia also enjoys the occasional sweet treat\nShe admitted that she is still focusing on her young daughter, while her husband revealed he couldn't wait to expand their family.\nSpeaking to Hello! magazine last week, Jay said: 'I would have another one tomorrow. In an ideal world I'd like three.'\nLooking to the future: In a recent interview with Hello!, Tamara spoke about having another child\nBut Tamara admitted she wasn't ready yet, explaining: 'I can tell you now that three isn't happening. I do want another child but 2017 isn't the year.\n'You never know what's going to happen in the future but right now I'm so consumed with Sophia and I'm still breastfeeding.\n'I personally don't feel ready. My body doesn't feel ready. When I got pregnant with her I really, really wanted it and I was so excited and prepared, so I think I will know when the time is right.\n'I would love to give her a gift that no-one else can - a sibling - but it has to be the right time.'\nThe stunning mum went on to add: 'Every psychic I've seen said we're going to have one more and it will be a boy.\n'But I don't see them any more. Jay doesn't believe in psychics and mediums. He thinks you shouldn't live your life around what you think is going to happen.'\nA charmed life: Little Sophia has already been exposed to many of the finer things in life", "external_links": ["http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/fff-logo-lowercase.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/hub_link.png", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/preload-inline.gif", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1925936/tamara-ecclestone-reveals-shes-never-spent-more-than-six-minutes-away-from-her-two-and-a-half-year-old-daughter-and-opens-up-about-a-terrifying-ransom-plot/?CMP=AFF-Sun_traffic_gen-Awin-19_10_2016-1403-0-0-0&awc=7715_1486581922_cd540ae25e12c5660ee0ce1c7acd821c", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/transparent.png", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/sash_spitting_image.png", "http://www.hellomagazine.com/", "http://f.mol.im/i/furniture/fff/missing_product_image.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-08T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:36:33.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
