For this reason, what is too much for one person may not necessarily be so for others. \nFor the average person, aiming to keep caffeine consumption below 400 and 500 milligrams (this equates to one or two barista-style coffees each day along with a couple of cups of tea) is considered “safe” and not linked to the unwanted side effects of a racing heart rate, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, dizziness and blurred vision. Shutterstock \nThe issue for many of us is that extra quantities of caffeine can slip in when large coffee orders can equate to as much as 200 to 300 mg. of caffeine in a single serving. It is possible, although difficult, to overdose on caffeine, particularly when it is being consumed via drinks as opposed to a concentrated powdered form. Therefore, on a daily basis, it is important to not focus on overdoing and instead figure out the amount of caffeine you can consume without suffering negative side effects on sleep and cognitive functioning. \nA sign that you may be consuming too much caffeine is if you find that you rely on it to get through the day and experience extreme withdrawal symptoms when you reduce the amount you are having. \nCaffeine is a stimulant, which means it affects the central nervous system, increasing heart rate and blood flow. The immediate effects are increased energy and attention, but the downside is that this stimulatory effect is a short-term benefit only, with energy slumps and fatigue commonly experienced approximately an hour after the caffeine has been ingested. \nFor those who are sensitive, high levels of caffeine (particularly at night) may also impair your ability to get to sleep or result in a restless sleep. \nGenerally speaking, we also become increasingly tolerant of caffeine over time. This can explain why once upon a time one cup of coffee was more than enough, whereas now you can easily down three or four. \nFor this reason, setting a clear limit for yourself that takes into account your personal level of tolerance is the key to not drinking too much, too often. Shutterstock \nThe secondary issue associated with drinking too much coffee is that in many cases, the coffee is adding extra calories and sugar thanks to its milk base and sugar additions. While black coffee and straight espresso contain minimal calories, lattes and cappuccinos are packed full of calories. In addition, drinking milk-based coffee over extended periods of time also increases the chance that fat will be stored in the liver. For this reason, for individuals who choose and can tolerate more than one or two coffees each day, black coffee or espresso are the best options. \nAn excessive consumption of coffee is also likely to mean that you are not drinking enough water. Dehydration leaves us feeling tired and lethargic and can slow the digestive system, leaving us feeling bloated and clogged up. While we can be tempted to reach for more coffee to perk us up, you are likely to benefit from a little less coffee and a lot more water. \nThe one group of individuals who need to be especially careful of their coffee intake is those with underlying heart conditions. Caffeine can increase resting heart rate significantly, which, when coupled with high-intensity activity, can even be dangerous. The same can be said for easily influenced adolescents who see the fun in consuming concentrated sources of caffeine via coffee, energy drinks and even supplements. This group, who may not be aware of any underlying issues with their heart, need to be particularly careful of consuming excessive amounts of coffee and caffeine and keep their intake well below the upper recommended limits of 400-500 mg. per day. How much caffeine are you drinking? Black coffee 65-120 mg. Latte or cappuccino 100-120 mg. Energy drinks 80-100 mg.
