Inside the premises you can see the defendant taking away the safe but it is not possible to see their faces.” \nMr Evison told the court that Hageman turned to a life of crime after spending all his winnings on fast cars and luxury holidays. He bought a Mazda sports car just 24 hours after raid, the court heard. Nathan Hageman (second from left) with former fiancee Jane Makepeace and Red or Black hosts Ant and Dec after his 2011 win. Source: Supplied \nHageman made world headlines in 2011 when he became the first winner of Simon Cowell’s roulette game show Red or Black . It was hosted by popular duo Ant and Dec and watched by an estimated eight million people. \nThings started to go pear-shaped for the tradesman just a few months later when his former fiancee Jane Makepeace revealed he had thrown her out of his new penthouse. \n“I thought the money would make Nathan a better person because he wouldn’t have to struggle to get by, but it has just made him worse than ever,” she told The Mirror at the time.

In 2014, Hageman was jailed for four months after bombarding a woman with 400 abusive text messages in 48 hours. \nThe trial at Reading Crown Court continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:46:01.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
