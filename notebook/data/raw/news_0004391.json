PUBLISHED: 02:15, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 02:29, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 GETTY/REUTERS Relations between the US and South Korea are set to continue amid growing threats from Kim Jong-un \nSpeaking during a two-day trip to South Korea, Gen. Mattis reassured Seoul that the US intends to maintain support amid increasing fears of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. \nHe said: \"Any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming.
