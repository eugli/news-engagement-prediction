It wasn't easy. \nWith an American accent and in the driver's seat of a Toyota Hiace campervan, I was in the perfect disguise as an every day tourist. \nNo one knew that I lived in New Zealand, which gave me an unique opportunity to experience what freedom camping was like from a tourist's perspective. \nOver a fast paced eight days, my American father and I drove 3700 kilometres around the country, staying in a different place each night. Brittany Baker \nThe other three free sites in Nelson were carparks in the city centre. Who would actually want to sleep in a New World parking lot? \nI saw first-hand the freedom camping issues I've read people about in the news, but I also noticed that the tourists aren't necessarily the ones to blame. \nBy definition freedom campers are people who park up in beautiful spots around the country in self-contained vehicles, which effectively means vehicles with toilets. This is essential, because most of the beautiful spots around the country that freedom campers love, don't have toilet facilities. \nThe problem is most freedom campers, or the ones who make the news, are not driving around in self contained vehicles. Brittany Baker \nComments on CamperMate said police patrolling the Lakeside Rotorua site did not bother non self-contained vehicles. Were we allowed here? I'm sure if we weren't, there would be some sort of signage to deter us. \nThey've got the old vans, the beat-up station wagons and the garishly coloured people movers. \nBut they still want to enjoy what the country has to offer so they park in these spots anyway because the alternative is paying up to $50 a night to park in a camp ground. Which most don't want to do. \nIt is inevitable that this is going to be a problem, but to me, it's a bit like keeping a puppy indoors all day and then complaining when they make a mess. Is it really the puppy's fault? Brittany Baker \nThe Akersten St hardstand, near the marina in Nelson, was not an impressive spot. It was an enormous gravel carpark overflowing with mostly non self-contained vehicles. At least this area offered four portable toilets. \nTo help me along in my self-contained camper, complete with a tiny portable toilet tucked under the sink, I had downloaded the CamperMate app onto my smartphone. With this I could find campsites, toilets, dump stations as well as things to do and I could even find out if the locals were receptive to having Freedom campers in their back yard. \nI wanted to find out how New Zealand is catering for freedom campers? How are they treated, and how do they treat the country in return? \nCampsites (Free) Brittany Baker \nOnce parked and set up at the lakefront in Rotorua, my father walked to the toilets to find they had been locked for the evening. \nDue to the increasing popularity of freedom camping in the country, the Department of Conservation (Doc) and apps, such as CamperMate, have created easy-to-find freedom camping destinations to help resolve a misconception that any place is open for free camping. \nDesignated areas are typically only for self-contained vehicles, leaving non self-contained vehicles (and these are sometimes in the majority) no choice but to break the rules. \nWhile many spots are scenically attractive, quite a number are bland, gravel parking lots that quickly get overcrowded. Brittany Baker \nThe entrance to Hanmer Springs warned of no freedom camping, but the Hanmer Amenity Area had a few other freedom campers and we were in no shape to hunt for another spot. \nThis particularly annoyed my father when we were forced to camp in a wet and crowded Franz Joseph site. The heavy rain and lack of available free camp sites saw the Docherty Creek packed, both with puddles and campers. \nAnd there were other spots, like the Hinemoa St carpark in Rotorua, which offered a few few spots but they were full by 7.30pm. Like many others we were forced to find somewhere else, which we did on the lakefront in an area that CamperMate said allowed all types of campers. \nOnce parked, we discovered the toilets had been locked for the night. Brittany Baker \nA week in the life of a freedom camper. \nMy first thought was: if non-self-contained vehicles were allowed to park overnight, wouldn't it make sense to have the toilets unlocked so campers didn't have to use the bushes for a toilet. Maybe Rotorua does not mind as the town already reeks of sulphur. \nDuring our continued travels, I noted a huge number of non self-contained campers in areas with signs clearly stating as being for self-contained vehicles only. No matter, they were ignored. Cars and people-movers with towel-stuffed windows were always parked in areas with no toilets. But where else could they go? \nI also lost count of cars parked in pull-outs off the side of highways, like SH8; windows fogged as they had clearly stayed overnight. Brittany Baker \nA week in the life of a freedom camper. \nOnly once did I spot a DOC employee pull into a freedom camping site to ensure campers were self-contained, but this was before dusk and if a non-compliant camper had arrived after 8pm, they would not have been caught. \nWhile it's easy to say we need better policing and to fine illegal campers, after eight days on the road I could see that adequately policing these areas would require hundreds of staff working around the clock. This is not only impractical but expensive. \nAnd it might not even work. The freedom campers I met were adamant they were getting around the country without paying for camping. It was part of their experience. \nIn my opinion it would therefore be best to accommodate non self-contained campers and prepare popular areas for the inevitable, rather than make rules that no one can afford to police and then complain when they aren't. \nHospitality \nI expected to be met with hostility as a freedom camper but was surprised to be only met with kindness from strangers. \nAny Kiwis we met asked how our travels were, if we knew where to dump our gray water or where we planned to travel to next. \nMy dad proudly announced he was visiting his daughter who lived in \"Tara-knock-ee\", blowing our cover to the petrol pump attendee. \nIt was nice to know some New Zealanders out there are greeting the country's guests with a warm attitude and are ready to educate on how to be a respectful tourist. \nBut, it was funny how quickly that attitude changed once on the road. \nI found a majority of New Zealanders on the road were impatient and instead of waiting for safe opportunities to pass the not so fast freedom campers, they instead chose to tailgate and dangerously weave in and out along the highway. \nEven if I were to drive 105kmh, a Kiwi simply could not stand to be behind me. The driver would grow frustrated and zip around me only to travel at the same exact speed. There's obviously some hate for campers on the road. \nBut it's okay. I got my silent revenge when I snuck back in front of the rude ute driver when I used a roundabout in Christchurch to my best advantage. \nInfrastructure: Toilets, Showers, Water and Dumps \nAside from an unfortunate find of fecal matter near the Tongariro Crossing track, I had no issues with toilets. \nThere were a number of public toilets on offer. And as a self-contained camper, I even had the option of the tiny portable toilet to use if needed. \nMy father did not quite understand why he could not \"just go outside\" or camp wherever we liked, for that matter. I tried to explain to him that New Zealand is much smaller than the United States and rules are in place for a reason. \nAs for those non self-contained campers, they were in a bind. There really isn't enough public toilets around to cater to a normal body's calls of nature. \nThe number of water pumps and dump stations are sufficient. Little blue signs dotted along major highways help point to locations where campers could top up or drop off. \nWhat I never saw were areas for getting rid of rubbish or recycling. I had to shove stuffed supermarket bags into bins at petrol stations. And forget about recycling - that's next to impossible. \nAs for public showers? The country is in serious need of them. \nThe CamperMate app once pointed me to a location in Tokaanu that did not actually have a shower and only had a large sink that my father was tempted to bathe himself in. Don't worry, we found a backpackers 20 minutes away in Turangi and paid $5 to use their facilities. \nThe takeaway? We're not so bad as we may think \nThe major takeaway is that New Zealand is set-up quite nicely. While there are some areas in need of improvement, the country is largely structured for travellers - self-contained or not. \nBut you have to work to make it work. The freedom camper lifestyle is not an easy one. It is a non-stop search to locate toilets, showers, dump stations and a place to sleep at night. \nSome additional infrastructure would be nice and more options for non self-contained campers could also mitigate against the common issues of toileting outdoors and overflowing rubbish bins. The toilets that there are are generally disgusting and campers are often forced to shower in sinks. \nBut all in all? Not bad, New Zealand, not bad. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:28:30.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
