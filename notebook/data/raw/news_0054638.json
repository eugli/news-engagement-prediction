It is not known how many soldiers died or were injured in the attack. \nThe father-of-four had travelled to the Pakistani city of Quetta, he claimed, for a religious holiday. A few day later the US invasion of neighbouring Afghanistan began and he was reportedly detained near Iran, and handed to the Taliban. \nThe 50-year-old was released from Guantanamo after a high-profile campaign. The then Labour home secretary David Blunkett said Fiddler posed no further threat. \nA message from Isis accompanying the video, translated by the monitoring group SITE Intelligence , read: \"The martyrdom-seeking brother Abu Zakariya al-Britani, may Allah accept him, detonated his explosives-laden vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidi army and its militias in Tal Kaisoum [sic] village, south-west of Mosul.\" \nAbu Zakariya is believed to be one of 850 Britons who have travelled to the Middle East to fight. Of those, authorities believe just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15% are dead. \nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \"The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. \n\"As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas.\" Ronald Fiddler, aka Abu Zakariya al-Britani, smiling in a video released by Isis before he was said to have detonated his vehicle in a suicide bombing Isis More from IBTimes UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:33:10.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
