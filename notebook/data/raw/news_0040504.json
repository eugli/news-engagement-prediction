Well, this may be as close as it gets! Last Summer New Yorkers were lucky enough to experience the Museum of Ice Cream. Which was a month long pop up that featured a pool of sprinkles, edible balloons and a seesaw made of giant ice cream scoopers! \nNow that museum is set to come to Los Angeles! At this point the location isn't set, but LA Magazine reports that it could be somewhere in Santa Monica or Venice. Lets just hope wherever it is that there will be tons of tickets available, because in New York all 30,000 tickets sold out in 5 short days. WOAH! \nFingers crossed I'll get to jump in the pool of sprinkles when it opens in March.
