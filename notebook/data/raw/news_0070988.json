GETTY Marine Le Pen and prominent Front National member Gilbert Collard \nMr Kessler insisted his agency was above the political fray and said the same methods had been used to investigate the claims about Mr Hansen as those about Mrs Le Pen’s assistants. \nHe told politico.eu: “OLAF has conducted thorough, objective and independent investigations, revealing documented evidence. \n“While we used the same investigative methods, principles and tools in both cases, the investigations revealed very different facts. GETTY Marine Le Pen is flying high in the opinion polls Things you didn't know about Marine Le Pen Mon, February 20, 2017 Marine Le Pen is a French politician who is the president of the National Front, a national-conservative political party in France and one of its main political forces. AFP/Getty Images 1 of 10 Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father, she has led a movement of \"de-demonization of the Front National\" to detoxify it and soften its image \n“In one case, we uncovered serious irregularities that are detrimental to the EU budget while in the other case we did not.” \nThe latest OLAF investigation and the parallel probe by French authorities were launched after Mr Schulz notified officials in Paris and Brussels that 20 parliamentary assistants hired by the Front National also held official positions within the party organisation, potentially drawing a double salary and contravening EU rules. \nBoth the French and the OLAF investigations into the Front National’s use of assistants are ongoing.
