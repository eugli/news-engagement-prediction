The album, which was expected on February 3 after a Billboard interview reported that as the release date, will not be dropping Friday. \nDJBooth points out that the Billboard piece that made us all mark our calendars has been quietly redacted to declare the album is coming out in the much-less-specific timeframe of “February.” \nClose followers of TDE’s social accounts may not be that surprised at the news, considering no one had really promoted the release in what was supposed to be the lead-up period. \nAgain DJBooth reports that a TDE source told them that the February 3 release date had never been officially confirmed. \n“We never said that,” the source explained. “If it doesn’t come directly from TDE then isn’t official. [It’s] coming soon, very soon.” \nSo far there haven’t been any tweets ( exasperated , or otherwise) from the 26-year-old singer explaining the situation. \nFor now, the wait continues. \n— ddg. (@equalityoe) January 27, 2017 \n(This article was first published January 23, 2017 and is as follows.) \nSZA has announced the release date for her CTRL album, which will be her first LP since 2014’s Z . In an interview with Billboard , the TDE singer shared that fans can expect CTRL February 3. She announced the album with the release of her “Drew Barrymore” single earlier this month. \nShe also spoke about collaborating with Rihanna on the Anti track “Consideration.” She explained what she learned from RiRi’s confidence. \n”She wanted to work with me, and I played some jams that I was working on for myself, and it went from there,” she said. “Rihanna doesn’t give a fuck about anyone around her. She’s in her own space at all times. But she’s not rude — she’s comfortable. As a shy person, that was something cool to witness.” \nLast year, SZA threatened to quit music after expressing frustrations with TDE president Punch. She later further explained her hesitancies about music in an interview with Complex. \n“I’ll probably just do something different, something visual, probably film,” she said. “I’m really frustrated, and I’m kind of over it. I have a lot of anxiety and there’s a lot going on in my life.” \nLabel CEO Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith promised SZA’s album at the top of 2017. \n(This article was first published January 2, 2017 and is as follows.) \nTDE released six albums last year, but fans were left without a project from SZA . \nAccording to label CEO Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, fans won’t have to wait too much longer since it’s apparently now slated for a 2017 release. In a video Top shared where he gives a tour of TDE’s offices, he ultimately arrives at a notepad that says “2017 releases.” The caption of the video tags SZA asking “ @sza are u ready 2 get them off my head?” A video posted by gwadpot (@dangerookipawaa) on Dec 29, 2016 at 3:49pm PST \nSZA responded “Me tinks so” and added a heart emoji in the comments (even though he tagged the wrong account … Hers is @justsza). \nHe responded again, confirming the release. \nSZA’s last album was 2014’s Z . Last year, she appeared on TDE’s other releases including Isaiah Rashad’s The Sun’s Tirade, ScHoolboy Q’s Blank Face LP and Ab-Soul’s DWTW. SZA also appeared on Rihanna’s Anti. \nShe expressed frustration with the label in the fall, saying that she “quit” before deleting her tweet and later sharing in an interview that she was still hesitant about music . \nTop Dawg shared his list of 2016 releases via a white board that also showed two new signees, one of which was revealed to be Lance Skiiiwalker. He released his Introverted Intuition album, but the second “John Doe” is yet to be revealed. The mystery artist also released an album , giving the label six total releases last year.
