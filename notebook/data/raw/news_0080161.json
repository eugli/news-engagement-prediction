They are already doing it,” she said.\n“I am always on the TV, I am on newspapers. They are bound to read and want to be like someone who is on TV.”\nMshoza has completely changed her look through skin bleaching. Source: SBS \nMshoza’s manager, Xolile Sonamzi, said that celebrities need to look lighter to get more work, especially in South Africa.\n“It works better on screen,” he said.\n“It works better with make-up, and we’re selling an idealistic world out there.\n“In TV we have to sell a fake world. That’s our job.”\nWith some creams able to take skin shades three to four shades lighter, there are some variations that only allow for a slight change in colour.\nSome of the skin lightening products banned from South Africa Source: SBS \n“It depends on how you want to look and what your goal is,” one of the women applying the product to Mshoza said.\nMshoza’s make-up artist, who is also a fan of skin bleaching, said the attention of having lighter skin is worth the risks the product may cause.\n“When you walk in the club and you’re yellow, people notice you,” she said.\n“Yellow-bone, yellow-bone yeah she’s light skin ... you are more visible to people. And even though you go to interviews, and you’re slightly fair skinned, you will probably increase the chance of getting the job by 50 per cent. It’s got a huge impact on how people treat you.”\nA makeup artist, who works with Mshoza, uses skin bleach cream and said she likes being 'yellow boned'.
