Samajwadi Party , followed by BJP, is the main opponent against BSP on most seats. \n\nThough the Bundelkhand region is the most backward region in UP, caste equations dominate over the issue of development and determine the way the votes swing in these polls. \n\nPolling in this phase will be held in Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad , Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, Chitrakoot, Fatehpur and Rae Bareli. \n\nAllahabad, which has the most number of 12 Assembly seats in a district, is witnessing some interesting contests. In Allahabad (West), BJP national secretary Siddharthnath Singh is contesting against Puja Pal (BSP) and Richa Singh (SP). \n\nSenior SP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Reoti Raman Singh’s son Ujjwal is in the fray from Karchana in Allahabad district. \n\nDespite the SP-Congress alliance, the two parties are engaged in a friendly-fight in Sareni and Unchahar seat of Rae Bareli. \n\nIn Sareni, Devendra Pratap Singh, the sitting MLA is contesting on a SP ticket against Ashok Singh of the Congress. Dhirendra Singh is the BJP candidate here. \n\nIn Unchahar, SP sitting MLA Manoj Kumar Pandey is in the fray against Ajay Pal Singh (Congress) and Utkarsh Maurya (BJP). \n\nBackward Castes like Lodhs, Kurmis, Gurjars, Yadavs, Kushwahas, Pals and so on are present in sizable numbers in the constituencies that fall in the Bundelkhand region. Thakurs are in big numbers in some seats and play a significant role in the elections. \n\nBJP has been wooing the non-Yadav backward castes with reasonable success and this is likely to dent the BSP in some seats. Dalits—including Kori, Valmiki and Ahirwars—constitute the next big chunk of votes. BJP is confident of getting most of the Kori and Valmiki votes while Ahirwars are supporting BSP. \n\nThough the Muslim population in Bundelkhand region is not as high as in west UP, they can play a crucial role in the outcome. Here too, the community is strongly opposed to BJP and will vote for either SP or BSP depending on which party is a position to defeat the saffron party. In Kunda seat of Pratapgarh, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya is contesting again as an Independent with SP support.
