I was devastated to look at her because her fleece was all the way down to the ground and it took up the best part of a six by four box trailer,\" she said. \n\"I couldn't see a sheep, I just saw this mass of wool. \n\"I got my scissors out and I started chopping, and I was finding pine needles wedged into her skin and prickles that were half way in, and maggots had started to eat around those points.\" Photo: Ms Simms has named three of the lambs Angus, Spot, and Valentine. (ABC Rural: Michelle Stanley) Lambs just kept coming \nOne week later, the ewe began to lamb. Due to its behaviour, Ms Simms was sure the ewe would have twins, but the total number of lambs was unexpected. \n\"When the third one came out I thought 'Oh my goodness, triplets! That's just unheard of, very very rare',\" she said. \n\"And then four, and five, and I just thought 'Here we go, they're just going to keep coming out and not stop!'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:42:22.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
