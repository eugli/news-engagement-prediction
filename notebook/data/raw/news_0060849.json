More contact time? \nConcerns have also been expressed about a two-tier university system - with better-off students able to pay for a full three-year experience. \nThe proposals from the minister would allow universities to sign students up for a two-year degree, but with the fee income that would be as much as three years. \nIt would mean that students and their parents would face lower costs in accommodation and living expenses, with their university studies compressed into two years. \nThis would also respond to concerns about the lack of \"contact time\" for some university courses - with some students only receiving a few hours a week of seminars and lectures and long holidays in the summer and at Christmas. \nA shorter time in university would also allow students to begin working at an earlier stage and repay their loan debts. Flexibility \nThe government has already announced that it wants to increase fees to £9,250 per year - and then to continue increasing it in line with inflation. \nThere are also plans to sell more of the loan debts owed by students to private investors - with the amount paid back also including up to 30 years of interest charges. \n\"Students are crying out for more flexible courses, modes of study which they can fit around work and life, shorter courses that enable them to get into and back into work more quickly, and courses that equip them with the skills that the modern workplace needs,\" Universities Minister Jo Johnson is to tell university leaders on Friday \n\"I absolutely recognise that for many students the classic three-year residential model will remain the preferred option. \n\"But it clearly must not be the only option.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:47:36.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
