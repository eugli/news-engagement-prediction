Some say they think that Russia may have been running a secret nuclear test in Norway , while others believe it may have come from a pharmaceutical company that has failed to report the issue. \nAccording to the Norway Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA), they believe the leak is caused by a pharmaceutical company who is likely using iodine-131 to create drugs to treat cancer. Or, they say, it could also be coming from a hospital or other radio-medical supplier who has failed to report their leak. \nAt this time, NRPA does not believe the chemicals are coming from a nuclear test or secret nuclear facility. Their reason is that the leak only produced iodine-131 , which makes it unlikely to be something of that nature. If the leak were part of a nuclear test, many more chemicals would have been dumped into the atmosphere and it would have caused immediate problems for those in the surrounding areas. \nDue to changing winds, no one has been able to isolate where the leak is coming from. Despite efforts, all have turned up empty. \nStill, authorities remain optimistic and are telling the public not to worry about the levels of radioactivity in the atmosphere as it is too small to cause problems to humans.
