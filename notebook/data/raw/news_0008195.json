More videos Plays of the Week \nFrom amazing tennis to NFL finals touchdowns, these are the most exciting, silly and downright crazy plays in the sporting world this week. \nWhile he works with some of the biggest names in the game across a number of clubs, he is no attention seeker. Described as a \"touch footy guru\", Wehbe has been at pains to keep his association with players confidential, but has quickly emerged as one of rugby league's most intriguing characters. He is the father of The X Factor contestant Carla Wehbe, who made such an impression during her 2013 audition that judge Redfoo cooed, \"You have what it takes to make the world happy\". \nThe property developer is close friends with Stephen Kearney and their association has spanned club and country. Wehbe was on staff during Kearney's stint as New Zealand coach, operating under the title \"peak performance coach\". Kearney, a former assistant to Wayne Bennett at the Brisbane Broncos, also invited Wehbe for a series of the NRL side's training sessions. His stint at Red Hill – at which he reportedly gave playmakers advice which included \"trust the ball\" – coincided with a three-match winning streak.
