but who joins them? (Photo: PA/Getty Images) Share Get Chelsea FC   Thank you for subscribing!   \nAs Manchester United were winning the first major domestic honour of the season, the Premier League continued with a number of matches that, come the end of the season, could prove very important at both ends of the table. \nAntonio Conte's Chelsea moved 10 points clear of their rivals at the top of the table, defeating Swansea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham moved into second, thanks to Harry Kane's treble as they thrashed Stoke. \nEverton's European ambitions were boosted as they saw off ex-boss David Moyes, while West Brom continued their good season, beating a Bournemouth side in free-fall. \nAt the bottom, Hull will feel as though it's two points dropped after being held at home by Burnley, while Crystal Palace moved out of the relegation zone, beating a Middlesbrough side who have won less games than all other Premier League sides this season. \nBut which individuals impressed? Here's our best XI from the weekend's action: Read More Ben Foster (West Brom) Foster has enjoyed a magnificent season at the Hawthorns (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nWhen the PFA Team of the Year is announced later in the season, then West Brom stopper Ben Foster has a real chance of being selected as the man between the sticks. \nNow 33, the high-profile errors that punctuated parts of Foster's early career are very much a thing of the past, and he has been a key component in the Baggies strong showing this season. \nAgainst Bournemouth, he was once more a safe pair of hands, making a couple of very good saves and standing strong as Albion came under some late pressure. Seamus Coleman (Everton) Coleman battles with former Everton teammate Bryan Oviedo (Photo: Jan Kruger) \nIs there a better, more consistent, right-back in the Premier League than Seamus Coleman? \nAgain the Irishman impressed as Everton saw off former manager David Moyes at Goodison Park, and the Sunderland boss must have been sick of Coleman, whom he paid just £60,000 for in 2009. \nStrong defensively, he ran roughshod down the right side, giving ex-teammate Bryan Oviedo a torrid time. Gareth McAuley (West Brom) Albion players celebrate with goalscorer McAuley after he sealed their turnaround (Photo: PA) \nNow 37, Gareth McAuley is still going strong at the heart of the Albion defence. \nThe Northern Ireland international was typically powerful in the air, positioned himself well up against the much quicker Josh King and also found the net - his sixth league goal of the season. \nNot bad for his 500th career appearance. Read More Mamadou Sakho (Crystal Palace) Sakho was a commanding figure in the Eagles defence (Photo: Alex Morton) \nA £16million signing for Liverpool when arriving on English shores, this was the sort of performance of which he is capable. \nAssured in possession and authoritative defensively, Sakho's Palace debut saw him immediately solidify their defence, with one goal-saving tackle denying Christhian Stuani, just as 'Boro looked set to equalise. \n\"His experience and composure made him look very commanding,\" commented Sam Allardyce. He wasn't wrong. Patrick van Aanholt (Crystal Palace) Van Aanholt has added some quality says Sam Allardyce (Photo: Alex Morton) \nThe 26-year-old Dutchman developed into quite the attacking weapon during his time under Big Sam's stewardship at Sunderland, and Saturday saw the £14million left-back prove the difference in their relegation clash with Middlesbrough. \nVan Aanholt thrashed up and down the left side, working well with Wilf Zaha as the Eagles looked to take the game to their opponents. \nIn the end, Allardyce has a first Premier League win at Selhurst Park thanks to his new signing - with a goal that could prove vital come the end of the season. Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) Fabregas shone in Chelsea's midfield (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nThe Spaniard is back en vogue at Stamford Bridge, and after impressing in the FA Cup win at Wolves, Fabregas was man of the match in the win over Swansea. \nThe ex-Barcelona and Arsenal man dictated proceedings against the Welsh side, scored Chelsea's opener and could have had two others. \nHe's taken time to adapt to life under Antonio Conte and what the Italian wants, but this was a display that - ominously for Nemanja Matic - suggested he's back in the XI to stay. Read More Idrissa Gueye (Everton) Gueye celebrates giving the Toffees the lead (Photo: Jan Kruger) \nOne of very few to come out of Aston Villa's dismal season with any credit last term, Gueye has been an excellent signing for Everton. \nMuch like the similarly all-action N'Golo Kante, his energy rubs off on those around him and he's very much been a key component in the Toffees recent unbeaten form. \nNo-one made more tackles at Goodison Park on Saturday, only Morgan Schneiderlin made more passes and Gueye scored the all-important opener that pierced Sunderland's resistance. Manuel Lanzini (West Ham) Lanzini is stepping out of the shadows following Payet's departure (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nKnown as 'The Jewel' in his homeland, the 24-year-old Argentine continues to show that, despite the big-money signings, he's the man to lead West Ham in the post-Payet era. \nThe creative midfielder took the game by the scruff of the neck as West Ham looked to get back into the game at Vicarage Road, taking the ball under pressure, never being afraid of taking a knock from Valon Behrami and driving the Hammers forward. \nAs Slaven Bilic looks to take his side forward, it's imperative that he builds around the talents of the playmaker. Pedro (Chelsea) Pedro Rodriguez scoring for Chelsea (Photo: Chelsea FC via Getty Images) \nThe Spaniard's debut season at Stamford Bridge didn't hit the heights, but he's been a key component as Antonio Conte's men have run to 11 points clear at the top. \nHis seventh Premier League goal of the season was outstanding, a cool finish with his left foot breaking Swansea's resistance, while he also played his part in the opener and caused the Swans a host of problems with his movement and speed. \nOne of the most intelligent attackers in the division, he's thriving at present. Read More Harry Kane (Tottenham) Three goals for Kane (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nA third hat-trick in nine games for the England striker saw Spurs ease past Stoke with a four-goal first-half blitz. \nKane was ruthless with his first two goals, fortunate with his third and then produced the game's outstanding moment, flicking magnificently in Dennis Bergkamp-esque fashion around Bruno Martins Indi before having the presence of mind to tee up Dele Alli for a tap in. \nThis was a complete centre-forward's display from the man who is now favourite to retain his golden boot after joining Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku on 17 league goals for the season. Romelu Lukaku (Everton) Lukaku celebrates putting the game beyond Sunderland (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nRomelu Lukaku continues to go from strength to strength, and he bagged his 17th goal of the season as the Toffees made it nine unbeaten. \nThe Belgian is fast maturing and is pushing himself to get better and better. Perhaps more importantly, he's also pushing his teammates to do precisely that. \nHe's now very much the technical leader of Ronald Koeman's side, his pace, power, technique and finishing ability ensuring he's the perfect focal point for a young Toffees side. On Saturday, hapless Sunderland felt the 23-year-old's brilliance, with his 79th goal in 154 games for the Merseysiders.
