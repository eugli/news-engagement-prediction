Anything from Barry White works (if you can hold in the laughter). Marvin Gaye is a classic, and those who are more attuned to today’s music can get down to the Weeknd . Some people even dig Olivia Newton-John. But if you’re a Star Wars fan—and if you happen to be Australian— there’s only one band that’s going to put you in the mood. \nAnd it’s the Star Wars Cantina band. \nThat, anyway, is the word from Spotify , which reported that Australians love banging to Frank Ocean , Trey Songz, and Kings of Leon . But also these dudes.

It writes that it’s “an upbeat, swinging genre of music, most notably performed by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes and the Max Rebo Band.” Sounds spicy, but not necessarily sexy, right?
