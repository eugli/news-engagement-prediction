Puppies, seniors and adults competed for the title of \"Fastest Dachshund.\"\n\"We fell in love with the program,\" she said.\n\"The classes were a real highlight,\" Carl Geren said. \"We couldn't wait to go each week and hear the many stories about all the kids. They taught us a lot, including how to interact with the kids and how to react to certain situations. It was really interesting.\"\nSpeaking of their new son, who is of Haitian descent, Diana Geren said, \"He is our sunshine; he's adorable and so smart. He's bilingual – we speak Spanish at home – and very friendly.\"\n\"Having a child from a different race is a learning experience,\" she said. \"But, like any child, they need love, need to be cuddled and made to feel secure. He gets attached to the other foster children we bring in and always wants to keep them.\"\nAnd Carl Geren, who has a 21-year-old son from his first marriage, said, \"He's no different than my biological son.\"\nDo the Gerens have any advice for prospective foster or adoptive parents?\n\"Have patience,\" Carl Geren said. \"And do your homework and be prepared. These kids need love, caring and a family. Once you're in a home with other people, you become a family.\"\nDiana Geren advises to put the interest of the foster child above your own.\n\"Sometimes you need to shift your mindset,\" she said. \"It's our job to support and help them when they need it, and learn to let go, if need be.\"\n\"Also, realize you're not alone,\" she said. \"The agency will help you each step with training and continuing education. There's a lot of help available.\"\nVisit ChildNet.us or call 561-352-2500.\nChildNet's fourth annual Care for Kids Luncheon presented by Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital will be April 6 at the Wycliffe Golf & Country Club, 4650 Wycliffe Country Club Blvd., in Wellington.\nTickets are $75 each and include the luncheon, program and a gift bag.
