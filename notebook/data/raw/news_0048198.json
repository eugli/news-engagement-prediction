Dave Lane steering the bike lane project, the city has agreed to spend another $125,000 to prepare a comprehensive bicycle strategy and master plan.\n\"This is a really great report,\" Lane told council at council's weekly meeting in St. John's Monday evening.\n\"With great potential to propel our city forward as it becomes a modern place to live.\"\nCoun. Dave Lane says he's pleased the report is done now, so the city can have work ready to start once the snow melts. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC)\nLane said there were four \"quick-win projects\" highlighted in the report:\nUpgrade the T'Railway with signage, repairs, and automated usage monitoring equipment. Create a Car Free Sunday Event in partnership with community groups. Create a cycling education event. Develop a bike rack design competition in support of the local arts community. While the report had been accepted by council, an amendment caused a long debate.\nLane asked to have \"status quo\" on current bike lanes — lanes which would have been given back to drivers by allowing parking. A move that didn't sit well with Coun. Art Puddister.\n'I know one thing … that I will never live long enough to see this come to a fruitful conclusion.' - Coun. Bruce Tilley \"In Ward 3 and Ward 4, in Airport Heights and Cowan Heights, [bike lanes] have been a bone of contention for quite some time, \" he said.\n\"I'd like to move forward as a council together and by removing these lanes. It's a good step forward.\"\nAfter nearly 30 minutes of debate council voted to accept the amendment and keep all the bike lanes where they are, for now.\nCowan Heights cyclist says residents not being consulted on bike lanes St. John's Coun. Art Puddister moves to turn bike lanes into parking Coun. Bruce Tilley said most of the city's bike lanes are in his ward, and he hears complaints from residents all the time about them.\nDuring the winter, bike lanes in St. John's were converted to parking. Coun. Art Puddister wanted to make that a permanent change. (Gary Moore/CBC)\nWhile he voted in favour of hiring the consultant to come up with a plan for the city's bike lanes, he doubts there will be a quick resolution.\n\"I don't know where this is going to end,\" he said.\n\"I know one thing … that I will never live long enough to see this come to a fruitful conclusion.\"\nThe city will now start the process of finding a consultant to oversee the project and establish a bicycle advisory committee.\nGet work started for spring thaw Meanwhile, Lane said he's happy the report results took place during the winter months so a plan will be in place and work can move forward when the snow melts.\nWhile not every councillor agreed, the amendment to adopt the bike lane report recommendations passed was approved. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC)\n\"We will now work with an expert to take a lot of the information and work that has already been done and say, how can we formalize this and make sure it is safe,\" said Lane.\n\"Make sure that it's engineered properly so that we have safe, advanced bike lanes for all types of cycling throughout the city.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.bikestjohns.ca/home/task-force/"], "published": "2017-02-21T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:28:27.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
