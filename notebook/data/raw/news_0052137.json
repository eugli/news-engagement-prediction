The Daily Dose FEB 22 2017 \nThey called themselves the Silent Majority , a nod to Richard Nixon’s moniker for those Americans who quietly supported his agenda — and last November, those voters emerged loudly and shook up D.C. Now, as President Donald Trump continues to combat with his critics, there are those who are thrilled, even invigorated, by his political sparring. \nAs part of a regular series, OZY profiles some of those who voted for Trump , asking them why they backed him, how they think he has done, what they expect from him next and which policies they would like to see him change or double down on. These interviews have been edited for clarity and length. Jody Gillis, a 44-year-old realtor from Suwanee, Georgia \nMy husband and I have always been small business owners. Trump comes from a background of not being a politician but a business owner and a builder. So he understands how those regulations hurt the business owner. Because instead of reinvesting in our company and creating jobs to stimulate the economy, we’re paying 50 to 60 percent of what we make to the government — and that’s sad. \nI like the fact that he’s appointed a Supreme Court judge that will rule on the Constitution and not legislate from the bench. I did feel sorry for the people who couldn’t actually get back here, that maybe should have gotten back, but I think (the immigration ban) was a strong, bold move on his part to immediately reduce illegals and terrorist attacks on American soil. I hope he addresses the taxes. Next thing is Obamacare — it’s just a majorly disgusting program. We have six kids combined, but three are on our plan. We went from paying $465 a month to $1,200 a month.
