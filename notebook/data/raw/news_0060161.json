Either way, we won’t judge you. \nAnd though a report came out today claiming the rumors are in fact true, the Teen Mom 2 star hasn’t confirmed them yet. But that won’t stop her ex-husband, Javi Marroquin , from sharing his thoughts on the whole thing! \nThe 24-year-old’s baby rumors have been circulating for a few weeks now. First, she admitted on a Teen Mom 2 Live Aftershow she was open to having “one more” kid (despite telling Javi she didn’t want anymore) and on the following episode, sported what some fans were convinced was a baby bump. A post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:04pm PST \nNow, the baby gossip is abound again as a source claims Kail is in fact expecting her third child. \nReports also insist the baby daddy is none other than the mystery man who Javi caught his then-wife with at their home in a recent episode of TM2 . Burn! \nCredit: MTV \nSo, how does Javi feel about it all? \nThough the Air Force man stayed vague in his tweets, these two deleted ones certainly pointed some fingers: \nPlus, another message was pretty telling, too! \nWhen fans inquired about the potential pregnancy on Twitter, Lincoln’s dad stayed coy, saying “ya’ll aren’t getting anything from me” and “it’ll play out.” lol y'all aren't getting anything from me! it will all play out. Javi Marroquin (@Javimarroquin9) February 23, 2017 \nHe also emphasized that his main focuses right now are his son, his job, and his workouts. I'm focused on Lincoln,work,and Crossfit. Ask me questions about that. Javi Marroquin (@Javimarroquin9) February 23, 2017 \nLast we checked the former spouses were on bad terms yet again, with Javi making accusations that his ex was using drugs , among other things. \nBut if the baby news is true, we’re sure it’ll take even longer for Javi to move on and get over the fact that his son is going to be a big brother to a kid who’s not his. So sad! \n\nDo you really think Kailyn is expecting? Share your thoughts below and stay tuned! \nTeen Mom 2 airs Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on MTV. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Teen Mom 2 :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:18:00.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
