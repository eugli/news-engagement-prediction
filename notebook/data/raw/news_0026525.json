So watch out, okay? Because anyone from anywhere can do anything, and this is that.” \nA few minutes later, while coming back from a commercial break, host James Corden also appeared sans-pants and quipped, “An odd coincidence, I always told myself that if I ever hosted the Grammys, I would also do it in my underwear. It’s quite an amazing coincidence.” Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:55:00.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
