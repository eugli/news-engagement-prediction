Obviously we are not allowed to bet. I think a few mates and a few of the fans.\" \nThe Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling in Britain, says it is looking into whether there was any \"irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity\". \nIt warned operators in June last year about the integrity of taking bets on novelty markets. \n\"Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,\" said enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson. 'I don't think it shows us in the best light' \nSun Bets, who sponsored the club on Monday for the fifth-round tie, tweeted that it had paid out a \"five-figure sum\" on the bet. \nSutton manager Paul Doswell said after the game: \"I don't think it shows us in the best light.\" \nClub chairman Bruce Elliott told 5 live: \"I didn't know anything about it. He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don't worry about that.\" \nShaw said he was told about the betting promotion before the game. \n\"I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it,\" he added. \"All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n\"It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.\" FA's rules on betting \nA worldwide ban on betting in football was introduced in 2014 and covers everyone involved in the game, from the players and managers to the match officials and club staff. \nIt prevents participants covered by the ban from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition, including the passing of \"inside information\". \nThe FA website refers defines that as \"information that you are aware of due to your position in the game and which is not publicly available\". \nIt adds: \"You are not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.\" Share this page ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:52:08.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
