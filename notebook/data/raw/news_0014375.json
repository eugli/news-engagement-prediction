Moore inspired Google’s co-founder, Larry Page, to get involved in flying car projects 'Uber is close to the commute pain that citizens in cities around the world feel.' 'We view helping to solve this problem as core to our mission and our commitment to our rider base.' Although Uber put together the detailed vision of this project, the firm has no plans to build or design the crafts itself. Instead, it hopes to collaborate with outside parties who will take on the grunt work of laying out technical plans, regulatory issues and infrastructural problems. But Uber does have an idea of how the electric aircraft will operate – a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) plane with the ability to fly 100 miles (160km) on a single charge at 150 mph max. These VTOL flying cars would include fixed wings with tilt prop-rotors, which also makes for a much quieter ride. Uber says its design will be 15 decibels quieter than traditional helicopters. And the firm sees using preexisting urban heliports and skyscrapers as launch and landing pads. Unlike some of the designs on the market, Uber's has enough room for a pilot and multiple passengers.

Uber says its design will be 15 decibels quieter than traditional helicopters But this idea is different than what the firm sees with its self-driving ground cars - Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said that the company's goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible'. The paper does say: 'Over time it's highly likely that VTOLs will become autonomous, though we expect that initial operations will require pilots.' 'Utilizing pilots in the initial period permits a strategy of building up statistical proof for FAA certification while slowly increasing the level of automation.' The firm also included what it believes these crafts will cost – a low production rate of 12 units per year, each unit will run about $1.2 million (£960,000). Uber says its new innovation would cut commuter time drastically – the two-hour-and-10-minute battle through the always jammed Sao Paolo gridlock could be chopped down to an 18-minute flight But, if Uber produces 500 units a year, the cost drastically falls to $600,000 (£480,000) and at 5,000 units a year it will cost $200,000 (£160,000). 'We assume a design life of 25-27k hours for the VTOL to permit 13 years of service with the 2080 hour/year utilization,' Uber shares in the white paper. 'This enables the vehicle to provide 400,000 miles of service each year and about 5 million miles of service life before the aircraft is salvaged at a residual value of 30 per cent.' Uber Elevate is set to be ready by 2021, but Mr Moore's predictions suggest we may see the flying cars hit the skies even sooner.
