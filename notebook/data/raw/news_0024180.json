They then shared a picture of Riz, writing: 'Actor @rizmc wearing a grey mohair tuxedo on the #EEBAFTA red carpet at the @RoyalAlbertHall this evening'. Gaffe: Taking to Twitter, they name-checked Dev as wearing one of their custom-made suits, awkwardly sharing a snap of Riz before deleting it and tagging the correct actor But their gaffe didn't go unnoticed, with fans slamming the awkward mistake. 'You should be ashamed of yourself, that's not Dev', one angry fan wrote. 'Someone needs to be sacked at Burberry', another tweeted. '1. That isn't Dev 2. That suit isn't black', a follower pointed out. However others were more understanding, with one follower tweeting: 'Not Dev nor navy. But then I confused Emma & Emily Watson when interviewing Christopher Bailey-& he cldn't have been nicer about it'. Mailonline has contacted a Burberry representative for comment. The real Dev Patel: Hoping to make up for their mistake, they captioned the snap of the Slumdog Millionaire star with the same tweet they had written alongside the snap of Riz 'That isn't Dev Patel': Their gaff didn't go unnoticed, with fans slamming the awkward mistake Riz is a British actor who was initially known for his work in independent films such as The Road to Guantanamo and Shifty before his breakout role in Nightcrawler and appearing in films including Jason Bourne and Star Wars Anthology. He is also a member of music group Swet Shop Boys and outspoken in his political views and race relations. In an essay for The Good Immigrant- a book of essays by a range of British writers about race and immigration in the UK, he wrote being racially profiled in airports. He told The Guardian : 'I mean my day-to-day reality is as contradictory as ever. Every time I get on the plane, I get searched. The last time I came back from LA, I got fully searched and all of that. That's as usual. Then the second search. But this time, I got on the plane and I picked up the inflight magazine. And I was on the cover. I was already on the plane.' And talking about being typecast as an Asian actor, he said: 'Stage one is the two-dimensional stereotype – the minicab driver/terrorist/cornershop owner. Stage two challenges the stereotype. And stage three 'is the promised land, where you play a character whose story is not intrinsically linked to their race. There I am not a terror suspect, nor a victim of forced marriage. There, my name might even be Dave.' 'I love those guys and some of those guys are the my biggest inspiration', during his acceptance speech for his Best supporting BAFTA, Dev credited Skins 'Stage one is the two-dimensional stereotype – the minicab driver/terrorist/cornershop owner', Riz has preciously spoken out at being typecast Meanwhile during his acceptance speech for his Best supporting BAFTA, Dev revealed he had his mum to thank for dragging him into the Skins audition, adding of the series: 'I love those guys and some of those guys are the my biggest inspiration, in particular an actor called Joe Dempsie. 'It was the first time I set foot on a film set and I didn't know what a boom mic was, or speed or rolling was. 'And I looked over at Joe and the way he delivered his lines, confidence he spoke his lines and the knowing he had. He's been a great mentor in that process.'
