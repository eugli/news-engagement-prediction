It would improve efficiency, cut down costs and ensure faster delivery of public services. \nThe immediate reason for setting up the bhavans is the merger of ministry of overseas Indian affairs (MOIA) with the external affairs ministry. Earlier POEs were under the MOIA. \nIndian workers and nurses seeking employment in around 15 countries including those in the Gulf have to go through POEs, which give emigration clearance, ensures their papers are in order, protect them from touts and bring them back, if needed. \nMost of the country’s 39 POEs and passport offices function out of rented buildings. \nIt is not clear when the work on these bhavans, whose numbers are unknown, will begin as the ministry is battling a fund crunch. A plan to improve facilities at POEs has not taken off as the annual budget of Rs 16 crore for the office is not enough.
