Several attempts were made to settle her. \nAfter moving her to the spare room, Kinraid held her down in the bed with enough force to stop her from getting up. Kinraid said Esme was squirming around and screaming during this time, Ellis said. \nHe continued to restrain her, holding her face down into the pillow until she let out a \"shuddering breath\", Ellis said \nAt this point Kinraid said she appeared to be breathing normally so he adjusted her head to the side and left the room. \nLater that night, Kinraid was called into work. After getting home, his partner asked him to check on Esme before they went to bed. \nWhen he went into the room about 11pm, he noticed she was not breathing or moving and one side of her face was discoloured. \"You said to the 111 operator 'I think I might have killed my daughter',\" Ellis said. \nAttempts were made to save Esme's life but they were unsuccessful. \nEsme was Philip Kinraid's youngest child. He is now estranged from his former partner and son. A permanent suppression order protection their identities was made by Justice Ellis on Wednesday. \nPrior to the sentencing, defence counsel Jo Woodcock argued for permanent suppression orders to be granted in relation to two aspects of the case but this was opposed by the Crown, Fairfax and TVNZ. \nA ruling was made by Justice Ellis to lift the suppression regarding one of the elements but an immediate appeal was filed by Woodcock. \nAs a result, an interim order for the suppression order to remain in place was granted until an appeal hearing can be held. \nA first strike warning against Kinraid was issued when he pleaded guilty in November 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:04:00.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
