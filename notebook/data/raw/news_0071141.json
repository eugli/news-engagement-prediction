The ephemeral messaging service that officially describes itself as a “camera company” is pulling for a market valuation of around $22 billion.\nThe potential trouble for Snap is that its most tangible source of revenue — automated ads — will have to siphon ad dollars away from Google and Facebook, two companies that effectively enjoy a duopoly on the digital advertising market. Investors are particularly worried about Facebook, which has introduced competing features on WhatsApp and Instagram that could further stall Snapchat’s already slowing user growth.\nAt present, Snap’s corporate leadership is meeting with investors around the country as part of what’s called an “IPO roadshow” in order to allay these kind of concerns. Based on various news reports from this week, the process appears to be pretty rocky.\nFor one thing, with less than two weeks to go before its public offering, top Snap ad executive (and therefore one of its key business leaders) and Facebook alum Sriram Krishnan announced that he was leaving the company. Business Insider, which spoke with investors present at Snap’s New York roadshow stop, reports that a number of those present felt like they didn’t get straight answers from Snap’s executives during the “respectful but somewhat skeptical” meeting.\nTheir grievances are said to include two big things:\nThat Snap failed to give a real justification for why shares in the company won’t have any voting rights (which is highly unusual ) Lingering doubt about Snap’s ability to grow its user base substantially in the long run, as Snap user growth has slowed significantly in recent quarters. Goldman Sachs, which is one of the banks arranging the IPO (meaning it will make good money on fees if the offering goes according to plan), reportedly estimates that Snap’s daily average user count will grow by about 41 percent from 158 million to 221 million by 2018; for comparison, Facebook’s user base was around 845 million at the time of its public offering.\nBloomberg, which also reported wishy-washy vibes from the roadshow, Quote: d an investor at the New York meeting who described Snap as placing part of the blame on Android for its growth issues, and in general having “sort of danced around the issues with user growth.”\nEvan Spiegel, the 26 year-old founder and CEO of Snap, has long maintained that user growth isn’t everything. What makes Snap valuable, he and Snap leaders insist, is that it has a lot of really young users and that those young spend an inordinate amount of time on Snapchat each day.\nSnap and other tech startups are traditionally given some room to “dance around” investor and public skepticism before they go public, or at least until they need to raise another round of funding. Sometimes, a so-so IPO can even give way to powerful, once-in-a-generation business, as in the case of Facebook.\nFor the tech darling however, which has Wall Street currently breathing down its neck to figure out whether it is the next Facebook or, worse, the next Twitter, the dance floor might not be all that big to begin with.\nCover: (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson)", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-ipo-votingrights-idUSKBN15I2W7", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/warning-signs-abound-as-snap-barrels-toward-ipo?utm_term=.leX9qvavwn#.xvXmgrQr83", "http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-is-predicting-snap-will-deliver-2-billion-in-revenue-in-2018-2017-2", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-21/snap-road-show-questions-focus-on-growth-amid-facebook-rivalry", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fsnapchat-is-having-a-hard-time-convincing-investors-its-worth-22-billion", "http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-roadshow-in-new-york-with-investors-2017-2", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/whatsapp-status/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Snapchat", "http://www.recode.net/2017/2/19/14662264/snap-sriram-krishnan-exec-departure-ipo"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:04:21.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
