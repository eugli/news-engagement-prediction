The company just gave us a sneak peek at their rose brushes inspired by Beauty and the Beast – and they’re absolutely gorgeous! \nThe rose brush is suppose to imitate a real life rose. The hairs are dyed red and are attached to a green handle with ‘leaves’ and ‘thorns’. Storybook Cosmetics did announce, however, that there are more changes to happen before they release the brush collection. They reportedly want to make the brush hairs a little darker and extend the length of the brush before they are available to the public. That way the ‘leaves’ won’t get in the way when you powder or go for the perfect contour!
