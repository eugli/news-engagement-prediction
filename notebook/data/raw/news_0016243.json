Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is busy making her case to impeach President Donald Trump, her fellow California Democrat, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, says there’s no grounds to do such a thing. \nUnlike Waters, who last week said her “greatest desire” is to see Trump impeached, Pelosi is arguing that though Trump has certainly not been to her liking he has not broken the law. \n“[There] are grounds for displeasure and unease in the public about the performance of this president, who has acted in a way that is strategically incoherent, that is incompetent and that is reckless,” Pelosi told reporters Monday, according to The Hill . “And that is not grounds for impeachment.” \n“When and if he breaks the law,” she continued, “that is when something like that would come up. But that’s not the subject of today.” \nWaters first invoked the thought of impeachment after going on a rant Monday about some of Trump’s actions, slamming the president for “targeting Muslims” with his recent executive order, instituting a 90-day ban on entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, and his friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n“I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position where folks begin to ask, ‘What are we we going to do?’ and the answer is going to be, eventually, we’ve got to do something about him,” Waters said, according to the Daily Caller . \nPelosi, on the other hand, said she believed the Democrats in Congress might have been able to establish a working relationship with Trump but said she’s been “disappointed” since he took office Jan. 20. \n“While it’s only a couple of weeks since the inauguration, … we’ve seen nothing that we can work — that I can work — with President [Trump] on,” she said. “And I’m disappointed, because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign.” \nThe press conference between Pelosi and Waters was called Monday to slam Trump’s recent efforts to roll back financial regulations. On Friday, the president announced that he plans to scale back measures of Dodd-Frank , 2010 legislation requiring banks to comply with burdensome regulations to prevent another financial collapse. \n“President Trump and his billionaire Cabinet and his advisers … are putting forth a Wall Street-first policy at the expense of the American people,” Pelosi said. “They want to take us back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:42:55.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
