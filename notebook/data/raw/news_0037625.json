Image caption The justice secretary said the public and the Commons had spoken \nEarlier this month, MPs overwhelmingly backed a bill to empower Theresa May to begin the Brexit process. The PM wants to do this by the end of March but needs the approval of both Houses of Parliament first. \nMPs rejected calls for the status of EU citizens living in the UK and a parliamentary vote on the final terms of exit to be explicitly guaranteed in the bill - although ministers have conceded the Commons will have its say and it fully expects citizens of other EU countries to be able to stay in the UK after Brexit pending negotiations. \nLord Mandelson also said some Leave voters who were having second thoughts at the government's \"Brexit at all costs strategy\" needed to have their voice heard. 'New reality' \nBut Ms Truss said Lord Mandelson was speaking as if the referendum \"never happened\". \nShe told Andrew Marr that the House of Commons had \"conclusively\" voted to trigger Article 50, with the majority of Labour MPs backing the government. \n\"The fact is it is a simple bill on whether we trigger Article 50,\" she said. \n\"The British people have voted for that and was clear in the referendum. \n\"The House of Lords now needs to get on with it. I fully expect the House of Lords will recognise the will of the people and the House of Commons.\" \nAlthough she voted to remain in the EU last year, Ms Truss said there was now a \"new reality\" and if a similar vote was held in the future, she would vote to leave. \nTory backbencher Dominic Raab warned the Lords would face a backlash if it tried to hold up the Brexit process. \n\"Voters will not look kindly on unelected politicians seeking to obstruct both the result of the referendum, and the vote of their elected representatives in the House of Commons earlier this month,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T14:53:10.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
