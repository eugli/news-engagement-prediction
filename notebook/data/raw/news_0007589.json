Mockingbird Lane. \nWhile they were waiting, a gray car approached the pair. \nRecognizing that they were in some kind of danger, the driver with Randall began to drive off as a man wearing a red bandanna over his face shot from the gray car into the victims’ vehicle. \nRandall was shot and killed. \nShortly before this homicide, police said an aggravated robbery happened at the Anchor Inn at 10230 Harry Hines. \nThe victim of the aggravated robbery gave officers the same vehicle description and suspect description as the surviving victim in the shooting. \nPolice got video surveillance from the Anchor Inn showing the suspect vehicle and the robbery. \nThe victim at the Anchor Inn gave the following description of the suspect vehicle: A gray four-door Chevrolet Malibu 2012 to 2014 model. \nThe description of the suspects was not very specific. \nPolice believe the two crimes could be related due to the close proximity and striking similarities of the suspects and suspect vehicle. \nAnyone with information on the identity of these suspects are asked to call North Texas Crime Stoppers at 1-877-373-TIPS (8477). All tipsters remain anonymous. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:51:45.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
