Government is acutely aware of the difficult economic conditions facing the majority of South Africans, but deferring tax increases by accumulating more public debt would ultimately impose a greater burden on citizens\". \nIt notes government debt now stands at R2.2 trillion, or 50.7 percent of gross domestic product, and interest payments continue to grow rapidly. “By acting now to stabilise debt, government is ensuring that future generations will not be paying taxes for today’s expenses 20 or 30 years from now.” \nHowever, Gordhan stayed away from increasing VAT, which is seen as politically unwise as it would hurt the poor, even though SA's rate of 14 percent is low based on international standards. \nA 1 percent increase in the VAT rate could raise an additional R21 billion to R22 billion. \nNational Treasury's tax proposals will raise an additional R28 billion, he says. \nIn the Budget review, National Treasury noted that, in the 2016/17 fiscal year, for the first time since 2009/10, tax revenues did not kept pace with economic growth. \nSouth Africa's economy grew 0.5 percent this year and National Treasury is projecting gross domestic growth of 1.3 percent this year. \nLast February, National Treasury had anticipated total tax revenue of R1.175 billion, which was revised down in October during the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and again to R1.144 now. “This is the largest tax revenue shortfall relative to budgeted estimates since 2009/10,” National Treasury says. \nThe amount of tax collected fell short in three main areas and personal income tax, value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties are down by an estimated R15.2 billion, R11.3 billion and R6.5 billion respectively relative to the 2016 Budget estimate. \nThis, National Treasury says, is a result of lower wage increases and bonuses, slow job creation and higher than expected VAT refunds. \nCorporate income tax collection is expected to exceed 2016 Budget estimates. \nBUSINESS REPORT ONLINE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:15:54.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
