BBC University Challenge viewers were obsessed with contestant Luke Dale's unusual fashion choice \nAs you might expect, University Challenge fans were quick to make comparisons: Yaay the first ever jockey on #UniversityChallenge with Mr Dale, bravo sir üëèüèºüëèüèº ‚Äî Nicholas Divall (@NDivall) February 6, 2017 Dale knew the answer to that question because, as the Flash he can run into the future and back again #universitychallenge ‚Äî Dudley Cruse (@dudleycruse) February 6, 2017 Dale is on Earth on a fact-finding mission. #UniversityChallenge pic.twitter.com/5zb8VDLPyt ‚Äî Alex Dale (@typofoto) February 6, 2017 Dale looks as though he's just come from appearing in a remake of Flash Gordon #UniversityChallenge ‚Äî Richard Pearmain (@Ooh_Matron) February 6, 2017 Dale: \"I thought we were dressing as superheroes?\"Team: \"It was a joke!\"Dale: \"Wankers!\" #UniversityChallenge pic.twitter.com/bIV6DSDNZD ‚Äî Vix (@3forlunch) February 6, 2017 \nBut one fan believes he‚Äôs cracked where the shirt has actually come from: #UniversityChallenge 10 seconds in and I identified Dale's 1975 retro 'Y' York City shirt. A Classic of its time. \nIt‚Äôs not the first time Dale has caused a stir with his University Challenge wardrobe - when he appeared on the show back in November, viewers were worried he had wandered off the set of a 70‚Äôs sci-fi programme. \nThankfully, Dale and his Edinburgh team stormed to victory against their competitors from Birmingham with a 220-125 win, meaning they are still in with a shot at the title. \nCan you imagine the amazing outfit Dale would wear if they made it through to the final? \nWe can only dream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:27:30.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
