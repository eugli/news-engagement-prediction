(Photo: AP/Yong Teck Lim) A \nSINGAPORE: Autonomous vehicle (AV) trials can now take place on public roads in Singapore, after the Road Traffic Act (RTA) was amended on Tue (Feb 7) to give the Land Transport Authority (LTA) a flexible regulatory framework to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology. \nAnnouncing the changes, Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng said the Minister for Transport will now be allowed to create new rules which can place time and space limits on the AV trials, set standards for the design of the AV equipment, and impose requirements to share data from the trials. \nThese rules can also exempt AVs, operators of AVs and those conducting or participating in trials of AVs from existing provisions of the RTA, which make a human driver responsible for the safe use of a motor vehicle while on a public road. \n“As this is emerging technology, the provisions will provide the flexibility needed to assess the appropriate regulatory response more quickly,” said Mr Ng. “We have limited this regulatory sandbox to five years. At the end of these five years, the Ministry will consider enacting more permanent legislation, or return to Parliament to further extend the period of the sandbox.” \nEarlier he noted that AVs were fast becoming a reality on roads, although widespread deployment of the technology was still some 10, maybe 15 years away. \n“Progressively, the Government will put in place programmes to help Singaporeans who drive for a living, acquire new skills and take on higher value-added jobs in an AV world,” said Mr Ng. \nIn a statement, LTA hailed AV technology as having the potential to improve Singapore’s transportation system. \n“For instance, autonomous buses could address the problem of shortage of bus drivers, while on-demand autonomous shuttles could comfortably and conveniently ferry commuters from the doorstep to the train station,” it read. \n“LTA has been facilitating AV trials by various technology developers at designated locations such as one-north and CleanTech Park since 2015.” - CNA/jo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:30:56.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
