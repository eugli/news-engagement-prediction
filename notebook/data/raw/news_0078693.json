(Photo: Bob DeChiara, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe NBA said in a statement late Monday night that Atlanta Hawks forward Dwight Howard should not have been assessed a technical foul for hanging on the rim and subsequently ejected. \nIn a chippy contest against the Celtics in Boston, Howard was whistled for his second technical foul with about four minutes left in the third quarter after hanging on the rim on a dunk. Howard's first technical came shortly before after a scuffle with Celtics center Al Horford. \nThe league said in its statement that Howard's second technical \"should have been deemed non-unsportsmanlike and should not have resulted in his ejection.\" The following is being released by the NBA: pic.twitter.com/O0biF3XBF2 â€” NBA Official (@NBAOfficial) February 28, 2017 \nEarlier in the third quarter, Howard went up for a shot and Horford grabbed his arm for a hard foul. As Howard got to his feet, he shoved Horford in the chest. Some more pushing and shouting ensued, and Howard was hit with his first technical. \nHoward had 17 points and 12 rebounds before the ejection, and the Hawks went on to win 114-98. \n\"It was a good team win,\" Howard said. \"I apologized to the guys and told them I need to do a better job of keeping my composure and some other things and they understood.\" 1st: Dwight vs. Al ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/udpkmtaIhd â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 28, 2017 Dwight Howard got ejected for this. #NBA pic.twitter.com/Ev2NXN9hZI â€” FOX Sports: Hawks (@HawksOnFSSE) February 28, 2017 \nContributing: Associated Press NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
