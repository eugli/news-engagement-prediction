The vote was not legally binding. Inside Story - 'Last chance' to reunite divided Cyprus \nOzdil Nami, the Turkish Cypriot negotiator in the talks, told Al Jazeera that a decision to commemorate such an event is at odds with peace talks going on today. \n\"We have asked the Greek Cypriot side to reverse this decision. And Turkish [Cypriot] side is waiting for the Greek [Cypriot] side to take the necessary steps,\" Nami said, adding that it was \"in contrast with the spirit of the talks.\" \n\"This move, which international community also finds strange, dignifies unification of Cyprus with Greece. The Greek Cypriot side should take scratch this decision and then we can continue talks from where we left.\" \nGreek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci met last Thursday, on February 16, but the meeting ended early after atmosphere became tense when the new regulation came up, according to officials from both sides. The sides accussed each other of leaving the table during the said meeting. \n\"I regret Mr. Akinci’s decision not to attend tomorrow’s meeting. I am ready to continue the dialogue at any time,\" Anastasiades wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \nGovernment Spokesman Nikos Christodoulides noted that this was \"a very negative development for all the people of Cyprus, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and every one must assume their responsibilities.\" \nChristodoulides, quoted by the state media, said that Anastasiades was officially informed by UN's Cyprus envoy, Elizabeth Speharby, that Thursday's meeting was called off. Next meeting in March \nThe leaders had been making progress in the negotiations for reunification as a bizonal, bicommunal federation before the enosis referendum row. \nSides are scheduled to be joined by Greece, Turkey and the UK, Cyprus’s three post-colonial guarantor powers, in a meeting scheduled for early March in Geneva. A similar meeting in January ended without concrete progress. \nThe new regulation, which calls on secondary school students to learn about the enosis ideal and to commemorate the January 1950 referendum at schools, passed by 19 votes from the smaller parties in the 50 seat House of Representatives. \nAnastasides’ Democratic Rally (DISY), the largest party with 18 members, abstained in the vote, allowing the bill to be passed by nationalist National Popular Front (ELAM), which proposed the amendment, and other small parties. UN chief: No 'quick fix' in Cyprus reunification talks \nLeft-wing main opposition Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) slammed DISY’s abstention. \n\"Otherwise they want a solution ... By choosing to abstain, the DISY allowed the enosis referendum of the 1950s to be honoured at schools,\" AKEL said on Twitter, ironically accusing DISY for undermining solution prospects. \nThe island has been divided between the Turkish north and Greek south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded a third of the island intervening in an Athens-backed coup to unify with Greece. \nThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983, but has been only recognised by Turkey to date. Turkey still has around 30,000 troops on the island. \nFollow Umut Uras on Twitter: @Um_Uras Tell us what you think Content on this website is for general information purposes only.
