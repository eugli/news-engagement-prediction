Iceland Is Running A 'Big Brother' For Kittens. It's kittens all day, everyday, without all the cat hair. 02/16/2017 04:59 pm ET Nina Golgowski Trends reporter, The Huffington Post \nSome may say there’s nothing good on the tube anymore. Thankfully, the good people of Iceland love cute and cuddly cats as much as we do. \nAn Icelandic news website has released a live, reality-style YouTube show featuring four, nine-week-old kittens living in a dollhouse stocked with bunk beds, toys and of course cameras. \nThe name of the show: “Keeping Up With The Kattarshians.” Já, Ronja.

They were checked out by vets and Stubbur was found with an injured tail that required amputation. — Bjarki (@BjarkiStBr) February 9, 2017 \nBefore moving into the house, the entire project, including the cat house, was reportedly reviewed and approved by the Icelandic Humane Society, as well as other animal welfare groups. \nNow clean, healthy and well-pampered, the cats are using their good looks and charm not to push lip kits or emojis, but the adoption of other strays like them through Icelandic animal shelter, Kattavinafélagið ― which roughly translates to the “cat friendship society,” according to Mashable. The kittens are also up for adoption themselves. \nIf only all reality TV shows were this good. \nCheck out more camera angles below: Related stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:19:57.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
