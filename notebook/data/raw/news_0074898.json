The cold spell and rain have triggered a 30 per cent rise in seasonal virus in the UAE, with some Abu Dhabi hospitals seeing more than thousand patients just in last two weeks. Shocking: Weight-loss surgery puts UAE patient's life in danger \"There has been a significant increase in the number of Influenza A and B cases since last two weeks,\" said Dr Rasmi Teresa Mathai, Internal Medicines Specialist at Universal Hospital, Abu Dhabi. The hospital that sees up to 1,500 patients a day said in the last two weeks alone, they have attend to around 1,000 patients with seasonal flu and respiratory infections. Mathai said there is also a spate in chronic conditions like Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary diseases (COPD), which required hospitalization. That's funny: KHDA humours Dubai students after heavy rain \"I can say that there is a 10 to 20 per cent increase in chronic Asthma cases due to weather. The frequent exacerbation caused by the weather is leading to conditions like bronchitis, pneumonia and breathing difficulties,\" said Mathai. \"The spread of chicken pox virus is another adverse impact, and we have been seeing many patients.\" With the temperatures dipping to 16 degrees, doctors say virus and bacteria are multiplying in the atmosphere. Problems faced: Watch: Heavy crowd at Metro stations as rain lashes Dubai 'This is a strange weather and residents are not used to it. That actually means good news for viruses and bacteria,\" said Dr. Trilok Chand, Specialist Respiratory Medicine at Burjeel Hospital. \"There is a 60 per cent increase in Influenza cases compared to the same numbers last month,\" said Dr Chand. He also stated a 30 per cent increase in COPD patients this month. According to him, a considerable number of patients with chronic respiratory diseases needed hospitalization. Read about it: UAE car washes remain closed after rainfall Pointing to a 30 per cent surge in out-patients and a considerable increase in in-patients since the beginning of February, Dr. Dinesh Banur, Head of Children's department at Royal NMC Hospital said it is all linked to the weather. \"When temperature and humidity drops, the viruses multiply. People keep their doors and windows closed in this weather, and due to less ventilation, viruses spread easily,\" said Banur. He said people don't get enough Vitamin D and Melatonin which makes them more susceptible. So his advice to patients is to ventilate their rooms properly, drink plenty of liquids, wash hands properly and avoid crowded places. \"People with Asthma, diabetes and other chronic conditions have to take extra care as their immunity takes a hit when they have viral infections,\" added the doctor.

Dr. Chand said the flu jabs are not effective unless they are taken at least a month in advance. \"Also every year, new strains are found in viruses and hence vaccines do not offer 100 per cent protection,\" explained the doctor. \"It is better not to go out in this weather. If you have to, one should avoid crowded places like malls,\" said Mathai.
