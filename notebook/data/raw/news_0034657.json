It is also accused of separately giving millions of euros to Choi to bankroll her daughter's equestrian training in Germany.\nThe court is also deliberating an arrest warrant for another Samsung executive, who is also the head of Korea Equestrian Federation, over bribery charges.\nControversial merger Samsung said in a statement on Wednesday it had \"not paid bribes nor made improper requests to the president seeking favours\".\nLee has effectively taken the helm of Samsung since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014.\nProsecutors are investigating whether Samsung had paid Choi to secure state approval for the controversial merger of two Samsung units seen as a key step towards ensuring a smooth power transfer to Lee.\nThe merger in 2015 of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries was opposed by many investors who said it wilfully undervalued the former unit's shares.\nBut the deal went through after Seoul's state pension fund - a major Samsung shareholder - approved it.\nCounting the Cost: South Korea's chaebol - Economy at a crossroads\nSource: AFP news agency\nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:38:46.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
