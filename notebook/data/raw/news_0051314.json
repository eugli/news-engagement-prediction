Abrams to try and get the lowdown on any Star Wars spoilers. This minute-long clip has to be seen to be believed. And so it ends. #DaisyRidley #StarWars Give us the truth pic.twitter.com/o4d429ydzL February 20, 2017 \nDaisy Ridley, fresh from being the subject of Josh Gad pressing her for Star Wars: The Last Jedi information, is not amused by another attempt to spill the beans. What follows is an outrageously funny impromptu grilling. \nIf you can’t identify every famous face then, have no fear, I’ve broken down the video because, let’s face it, this is important and people MUST know. \nLeslie Odom Jr asks the question we’re all dying to know, “How many musical numbers are there?” with Star Wars 9 director Colin Trevorrow, fantastically, desperate for, well, any scrap of information. \nChris Pratt, as ever, plays the fool: he’s here to shill his movies and, damn it, nobody’s going to stop him. If you’re curious, he’s in: Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Jurassic World 2 (out June 22, as he helpfully points out) and Avengers: Infinity War. \nPratt’s Jurassic World co-star Bryce Dallas Howard doesn’t seem to care for Star Wars lore or just who Rey’s parents are. She wants to know if Rey’s boots get stuck in the grates of the Millennium Falcon, obviously. \nFor those not fluent in Spanish, Penelope Cruz asks the actual size of Supreme Leader Snoke. Gad and Ridley’s Murder on the Orient Express co-star Lucy Boynton, blissfully unaware of Cruz’s question, asks the exact same thing. Brilliant. \nTom Bateman is just curious about the identity of the Stormtroopers, especially as one may or may not be played by Tom Hardy , and – in a superb final sting – J.J. Abrams is begging Daisy Ridley to tell him if Luke “gets to say any lines in Episode 8.” \nIf Josh Gad doesn’t get a cameo role in Star Wars off the back of this I’ll be VERY disappointed. \nWhat was your favourite moment from Josh Gad’s repeated attempts to squeeze Daisy Ridley for spoilers? Let us know in the comments! \nDirected by Rian Johnson and starring Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Laura Dern, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, and Benicio del Toro, Star Wars: The Last Jedi opens in theaters on December 15, 2017. \nImage: Disney/Lucasfilm ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:11:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
