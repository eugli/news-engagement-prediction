(Mel Evans/AP) Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 4:01 PM \nMike’s off, Christie’s on? \nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is reportedly among candidates to replace longtime afternoon host Mike Francesa on WFAN 660, according to NorthJersey.com . \nStation director Mark Chernoff said the governor is amongst “plenty of candidates” to fill the spot. \n“I would certainly at least want to consider him,” Chernoff told NorthJersey.com. “If he's interested and we're interested, it's worth pursuing.” \nGov. Christie shouldn't test talk show schtick on taxpayer time \nChristie has been filling in for Boomer Esiason from time to time on WFAN’s Boomer and Carton morning show. He’s even made headlines in his appearances by calling out Philadelphia sports fans and referring to the Phillies as “an awful team.” \nThe fact he’s being considered shouldn’t be a surprise, because the governor has spoken about crossing the bridge from politics to sports talk radio. Mike Francesa's last day on WFAN will be Dec. 15. (Sipkin, Corey, New York Daily Ne/New York Daily News) \n“As my son said — 'I can’t believe I’ve been listening to you talk about sports my entire life and that someone might actually pay you to do that. He said, 'I can’t imagine how great that would be for you,' ” Christie stated in an interview on SNY last week. “And so, yeah, that’s certainly one of the things that I hope I’ll have a chance to consider when I get out and stop being governor.” \nMike Francesa tells Chris Russo he'll be working after WFAN gig \nFrancesa will be going off the WFAN airwaves on Dec. 15. He’s been the voice of the station’s afternoon show since 1989, working the 1 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. time slot. \nWhile he’ll be leaving WFAN, he told his former co-host Chris “Mad Dog” Russo he’ll be working somewhere else by January. Some believe it could be a podcast, but Francesa’s future plan remains unclear.
