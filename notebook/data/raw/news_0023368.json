(Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images) \n170 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE People you don't want to annoy: George Lopez at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, this past weekend, apparently.\nDuring an uncomfortable TMZ video that has gone viral, the angry-sounding comedian appears to have a woman evicted during his second appearance at the Phoenix venue on Saturday, Feb. 4. It comes after he tells a joke in which part of the punch line involves blacks not marrying Hispanics. The video is definitely NSFW .\nWoman escorted out After a member of the audience stands up and objects to the joke, he starts in on her: \"If you can't take a joke, you're in the wrong (expletive) place. Sit your (expletive) down or get the (expletive) out of here.\"\nHe keeps up the (expletive) banter for the rest of the two-minute video, until the woman and her party appear to be escorted out.\n\"Four seats just opened up front,\" he cracks as she leaves.\n\"George is a very outspoken, vocal guy,\" says Danny Zelisko, who promoted the concert,which was a co-headlining affair with D.L. Hughley. \"That's his stage. That's his house when he's up there. If you do something he considers out of line, he's got every right to say what he wants. The fact that she didn't sit down? The question should be, 'Shouldn't she have stopped?'\"\n'Don't make an ignorant ... comment' The video, which has more than 840,000 views, isn't the end of the story. A woman claiming to be the evicted concertgoer called into KKFR (98.3 FM), better known as Power 98.3 and 101.9. The caller said she is black and Hispanic, which sparked her reaction.\n\"When you have that much power in the Mexican community and people listen to what you say, don't make an ignorant (expletive) comment like that,\" the caller says.\nNo place for hecklers Zelisko said the patron's behavior amounts to heckling, which is rarely, if ever, welcome.\n\"It wasn't an audience participation type of act,\" Zelisko says.\nAdditionally, she was seated in the orchestra pit, the most expensive seats in the house.\n\"You better figure somebody down there, who is paying over $100 a ticket, knows what they're going to see,\" he says.\nThe incident occurred near the end of Lopez's set. The evicted patron didn't get to stick around for Hughley's act, which followed.\nAs for a refund?\n\"You don't offer that to someone who is disrupting a show,\" Zelisko says.\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest \nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nReach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.
