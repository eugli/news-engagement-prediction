(Photo: Fox59)\n341 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Indiana House approved a 10-cent gasoline tax increase Thursday, after weeks of push back from House Democrats and fiscal conservative groups.\nThe Republican-dominated chamber voted 61-36 for the tax hike, with seven Republicans joining the Democratic caucus in opposing the measure. Of those who voted for the increase, 18 had previously taken a pledge not to increase taxes with Americans for Tax Reform.\nThe tax increase is part of a plan to raise an estimated $1.2 billion a year targeted for road upkeep and construction. The legislation would increase the tax from 18 cents to 28 cents initially, and then tie the amount to inflation, so it could continue to increase up to 1 cent a year. The bill also would add an extra $15 registration fee on every vehicle, a $150 fee for electric vehicles and also would require a study on toll roads.\nThe vote carries a significant risk for House Republicans. Many members have pledged in the past not to raise taxes.\nRep. Thomas Washburne, R-Inglefield, took the oath in 2012 and voted for the legislation Thursday, because he felt the gas tax was the most equitable option to fund roads.\n“I'm not sure what a 2012 pledge means in 2017 after two or three cycles,\" Washburne said. \"But setting that aside, I think that while its labeled a tax, it's closer to a user fee. I think it's unfair to raise people’s property taxes or raise their income taxes to handle the roads.\"\nHouse Speaker Brian Bosma, the Indianapolis Republican who championed the legislation, noted that the Republican-dominated House has voted repeatedly in recent years to cut other taxes. He dismissed concerns that members who made “no tax” pledges could pay a political price.\n“Many signed the pledge many years ago and did not understand it was a lifetime blood oath,” he said. “Most of the members of this chamber have voted to cut taxes numerous times. In fact, the cuts that have been voted on in just the last two years have far outweighed any increase in the tax gas here.”\nThe road funding plan has generated criticism from both the left and the right.\nAmericans for Prosperity, a group affiliated with conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch, has slammed the proposal as \"a massive new tax hike.\"\nAnd Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, suggested that lawmakers who had previously vowed to oppose tax increases had pulled a bait and switch on voters.\n\"Most of the Republicans who are in the House and Senate promised their voters they would not raise taxes: some in writing, some in person,\" Norquist said. \"Did any of the Republicans thinking of voting for another tax hike on consumers say they would do this when they asked for their citizens’ vote in the last election? If not, why double-cross their voters.”\nThe measure now moves to the Senate, where GOP fiscal leaders have expressed skepticism about portions of the bill.\nSen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, said earlier this week that he is not a fan of a provision that would shift all of the state's sales tax from the general fund to roads. House Republicans want to use a $1 tax hike on cigarettes to help plug the hole in the general fund.\nKenley said he would prefer to rely on using tolls.\nBoth Gov. Eric Holcomb and Senate Republican leaders have said it's necessary to find a way to fund roads amid stagnating gas tax revenues, and that they are open to many options. It's likely a final agreement on the road funding plan won't be ironed out until late April, when this year's legislative session is expected to end.\nThe House plan is similar to a measure the chamber passed last year. But in the face of opposition from the Senate and then-Gov. Mike Pence, lawmakers opted instead for a short-term, $800 million highway spending plan that involved no new taxes.\nNorquist said Thursday he was hopeful that Holcomb would continue his predecessor's opposition to new taxes. However, the governor hasn't ruled out a gas tax increase.\nNot a single Democrat supported the House Republican plan. House Minority Leader Scott Pelath had argued for a plan that would roll back corporate tax cuts and dip into the state’s roughly $2 billion in reserves to fund road improvements. Republicans argued that spending down reserves would leave the state vulnerable to an economic downturn and could threaten the state's AAA credit rating.\nRep. Dan Forestal, an Indianapolis Democrat and ranking minority member of the House roads committee, also raised concerns about the effect of previous tax cuts. Increasing gas taxes and Bureau of Motor Vehicles fees would unfairly burden average motorists, he said, even as wealthy individuals and corporations continue to reap savings from recent corporate income tax cuts and the elimination of the state’s inheritance tax.\n“To do it in a way that shifts the tax burden onto the backs of hard-working Hoosiers so that large corporations can keep their tax cuts is just patently unfair,” Forestal said.\nOver the past five years, Republican-led cuts to taxes on corporations, banks, inheritance and personal income have wiped out more than $600 million a year in state revenue. Taken together with the new tax increases on motorists, the changes represent a large shift of the state’s tax burden from higher-income to middle-income Hoosiers, economists say.\nOther Democrats criticized the legislation for removing restrictions in place that prevent the governor from implementing toll roads.\nRepublican Rep. Ed Soliday, the author of the legislation, said that even if the bill isn't perfect, it needed to advance to prevent further deterioration of Indiana's roads.\n\"If you vote this bill down, it stops now,\" Soliday said. \"If you don’t have the courage to step up and say, 'I know there’s a problem out there and I’m going to keep working to fix it,' that’s fine, but where do we go? The number is still a number. And if everything we’ve suggested is wrong, than what's the right answer?\"\n341 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //indy.st/2lmj4vd", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//indy.st/2lmj4vd&text=Indiana%20House%20OKs%20gas%20tax%20increase&via=indystar", "http://indy.st/2lmj4vd", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c576d140de4288fb9284fb187ee81075f674144/c=80-0-1229-864&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/13/INGroup/Indianapolis/636225803689905993-i-69-project.jpeg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//indy.st/2lmj4vd&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/INGroup/Indianapolis/636225803689905993-i-69-project.jpeg", "https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2017/bills/house/1002#document-a2b28aef", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2017/02/13/INGroup/Indianapolis/636225803689905993-i-69-project.jpeg"], "published": "2017-02-16T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:02:53.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
