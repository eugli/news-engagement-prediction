The answer was yes, and for the past couple of years, he has become a semiregular in the City Hall press corps. He said he mostly covers politics, breaking news and entertainment, but allowed that he really covered whatever struck his fancy. Other reporters had mostly kind things to say about Mr. Mazza, even if they said his approach reflected his age and experience. Mr. Mazza’s work has, at times, created some unease at home. He recalled when, during a State of the City speech by the mayor in 2016 , there was a shooting of two police officers in the Bronx, and he wanted to go with the rest of the press corps with the mayor to the hospital. “My mom was calling me; she was like, ‘Go home, go home, go home,’” Mr. Mazza said. “She was very nervous, and I went home. But after that, I always went to shootings and now she understands that it is my job.” But even his mother was shocked when she saw him on national television Thursday. Mr. Mazza had been going to the White House since the election, and said he had gone to four press briefings conducted by Sean M. Spicer, the press secretary, first securing a daily credential, and then weekly passes. He happened to be in Washington on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced that he was going to hold an impromptu news conference. “I was prepared,” Mr. Mazza said, explaining that he had a news release from the White House about the first lady opening the visitors office, “and I said to myself, ‘There has not been a lot of coverage about this,’ and I thought it could be interesting.” Despite the tension during the combative news conference, Mr. Mazza said he was not nervous, saying to himself, “If he doesn’t like my question, he doesn’t like my question. I am just going to ask my question.” He was not concerned if some people might view his question as a softball. “I was really honored that he appreciated my question,” Mr. Mazza said. “And I was appreciative he answered my question. The president took the time out of his day to answer my question.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:23:13.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
