They deserve our respect.\" \nFor their part, Sevilla won the Europa League for the past three seasons under Unai Emery, who moved on to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, and Iborra believes the Basque boss laid solid foundations at the club. \nDani Alves slams Barcelona board \n\"Emery gave us many good things,\" he said. \"He gave us the ambition, the winning mentality, the idea of never giving up until the match is over. There is still an important group of players from when he was here. They know the philosophy of the club, the importance of the dressing room, and we are working to get to where we want to be.\" \nAfter winning the Europa League three times in a row, the objective now is to take a step forward in the Champions League and Iborra said: \"We are really excited that this moment has arrived. We are aware of how difficult it is going to be, but it's a special opportunity and we want to take advantage.\" \nArgentine coach Jorge Sampaoli took over from Emery in the summer and results have been excellent, despite a shaky start in which the team conceded too many goals. Sevilla are now third in La Liga and in with a great chance of making the last eight in the Champions League. \n\"I think the important thing is the results,\" Iborra said. \"At the start of the season we had a new coach with a new philosophy and new players and those conditions meant we didn't have an identity to start with, but the results helped us to keep working and allow us to get accustomed to the new philosophy.\" \nIborra is Sevilla's captain and very much a jack of all trades under Sampaoli, as he has been used all over the pitch including in defence at times and also in attack. \nI nsigne: Napoli can turn it around against Madrid \n\"What I want is to play and I don't mind where,\" he said. \"I'm always ready to play wherever the coach sees fit and I work to take those opportunities when they come around. I work to stay in the team on merit.\" \nThe 29-year-old rejected a move to Sunderland in the summer and said: \"I think I have grown along with the club since I arrived. I have won titles, I feel loved and I feel valued. My family are happy and I believe I am at a top club. There were many reasons to stay.\" \nAnd the chance of adding more silverware is one of them. \"If I had one wish for this season,\" he said, \"it would be for us to win a trophy.\" Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:13:08.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
