News, the 63-year-old poses in a black one-piece as her daughters Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Brinkley Cook join nearby. \n\"Yes! I am excited to announce that I am back in @si_swimsuit...I figured with my gorgeous daughters @alexarayjoel and @sailorbrinkleycook by my side, whose going to be looking at me!\" Christie wrote on Instagram. \"Oh and my kids think I walk on water, so let's not mention the apple box concealed just under the surface.\" \nShe added, \"Thank you Sports Illustrated for sending the powerful message that good things come in packages of every size and we do not come with an expiration date!\" Photos \nSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue 50th Anniversary Party \nSailor also shared a few powerful words about the photograph. As it turns out, this is much more than just an ordinary shoot for the up and coming model. \n\"I've had issues with my body image since before I can even remember. I grew up not loving how I looked and felt held back because of it,\" Sailor shared on Instagram. \"My body and I have been through it all. But recently I have been liberated. I am healthy, I treat myself well, and for that I'm happy.\" \nThe 18-year-old continued, \"This is more than a magazine to me and always has been. As a growing young woman, SI showed me all bodies are different and all bodies are worthy of celebrating. Thank you thank you @si_swimsuit for celebrating my beautiful mama, my beautiful sister, I, and ALL WOMEN!! How lucky am i?!\" \nAs for Alexa Ray, modeling is still a bit of a new experience for the singer/songwriter. With family by her side, however, it ended up turning out better than she could have ever imagined. \n\"It was definitely entertaining â€” a little bit of a reality TV moment,\" she shared with Sports Illustrated . \"We all have our own style. And Sailor is kind of the young new little, perfect little, sporty little model. My mom is almost, I tease her, that she's ADD in terms of how much energy she has. She literally can't stop moving. And I'm still new at this and I was just trying to maintain my focus.\" TAGS/ Christie Brinkley , Alexa Ray Joel , Magazines , Sports Illustrated  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:47:00.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
