The jagged glass shredded his left arm, tearing his biceps and triceps muscles, cutting through nerves and severing an artery. \n“The blood was unreal, it looked like a horror movie,” he said. \nStudents rushed to help stop the bleeding until paramedics arrived, he said. In the hospital, Dickie’s heart stopped beating and his breathing ceased – he was “vital signs absent” twice – as doctors scrambled to save his life, he said. \nHe survived, but his life was forever altered. He has regained about 80 per cent of the strength in his arm, but can’t play hockey, type on a keyboard and failed a physical when he tried to get into an underwater welding program, he said. \n“That glass is a ticking time bomb, someone is going to die,” said Dickie, who in 2012 filed a lawsuit against the school board, the owner of the school and the manufacturer and installer of the school’s doors. \nVIDEO: Wired glass is suppose to offer superior protection but does it? \nDoug Perovic, an engineering professor at the University of Toronto, has long pushed for action on wired glass in Canada. \n“This is bad glass, weak glass, that has led to catastrophic and gruesome injuries,” he said. \nIn the United States, the International Building Code changed its standards in 2006 so wired glass wouldn’t be used in areas where people could come into contact with it. \n“Wired glass is about half as strong as the same glass without wire – it’s terrible,” Perovic said. \n“It never passed the impact test requirements and that goes back to its initial introduction in the early 1990s.” \nWired safety glass initially came into prominence because it helped stop the spread of fire. During a fire, regular glass can break and explode due to the intense heat. Wired glass mitigated the spread of the flames because it wouldn’t fall apart easily, Perovic said. \n“There was no other glass for fire-rated purposes and the board gave it an exemption that was supposed to last for a couple of years, and that just carried on to today,” he said. \nREAD MORE: Wired glass injures as many as one child a day in Canadian schools, expert says \nPerovic believes the new standards that don’t include wired glass will have a trickle down effect on building codes across the country. The hope is for builders to stop using wired glass going forward, he said. \nBut he cautioned that the board didn’t provide guidance on what to do with the wired glass that “is everywhere in Canada.” \n“The board didn’t really tackle it directly, they’re just saying it’s not a safety glass. So it’s not banned. Kids can still run into it at schools.” \nFortunately, there are existing cost-efficient solutions that don’t require replacing the panels outright, such as adding a thin adhesive film – made of a high-strength polymer – on one of the exterior surfaces of the glass to prevent people going through it, Perovic said. \nVIDEO: Despite deadly 2001 incident, Edmonton schools still use wired glass \nMike Smitiuch, who represents Dickie in his ongoing lawsuit, said he’s seen a rising number of cases of wired glass-related injuries. \n“We have over a dozen cases on the go all across the country,” Smitiuch said. “This is a systemic problem. Although the standards will be changing, I think that school boards and other public bodies need to move quicker on this.” \nREAD MORE: An 18-year-old injured by broken wired glass at his former high school is now suing for $5 million \nIn a statement of defence against Dickie’s lawsuit, the school board, the school’s owner and the manufacturer said Dickie “rushed towards an exit door and intentionally or recklessly slammed his hand into the glass panel of the door causing his arm to go through it.” \nWhile it’s difficult to get a handle on the number of injuries caused by wired glass, the Ontario School Boards’ Insurance Exchange, a school board-owned, non-profit insurance program representing 78 school boards, provides some data. \nA risk management advisory written by the exchange, and obtained by The Canadian Press, said there were 107 wired glass-related claims against its schools between 1987 and 2000 that cost more than $3 million to be paid out. \n“Wired glass can cause horrible injuries,” the 2001 report said. \nOSBIE did not respond to requests for comment, but told Global News last year it had incurred a cost of more than $5.8 million for 114 claims from wired-glass injuries between 2001 and 2015. \nIt recommends a number of measures to its member schools that include warning students of the dangers of wired glass, posting “do not push on glass” signs and avoiding running in hallways.
