Pepsi and Shirlie became emotional while paying tribute with Andrew Ridgeley \nGeorge Michael died on Christmas day but this is the first time his friends have had a chance to pay tribute, as a funeral is yet to take place. \nRidgeley said that Michael's contribution to the \"great archive of contemporary music lives among the immortals\". \n\"His legacy will continue to shine and resonate for generations to come.
