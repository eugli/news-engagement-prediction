While it is not the first study into the senior leadership of the NKVD, this is the first time that everyone – from the investigators to the executioners – has been identified. There are just over 40,000 names on the list.\nZhukov, a jovial eccentric who now lives in the countryside outside Moscow, said that although he was no fan of Stalin, there was no real political motivation to his work. Now 64, he has always enjoyed collecting things and was an avid philatelist during the Soviet period.\n“I’ve always been interested in things that were secret, or hard to find. I started this off purely from a collector’s instinct,” he said.\nHistorians, however, soon realised the importance of Zhukov’s work. The organisation Memorial , which works to document Stalin-era crimes, released a CD this summer containing his database of names. In November, the database was released online.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lavrenti Beria, the boss of Stalin’s secret police, with Stalin’s daughter, Svetlana.

It took years of meticulous work. Because the NKVD was responsible for a whole range of functions in addition to arrests and executions, Zhukov limited his search to those involved in state security.\n\n“Not everyone in this list is a butcher: there are a few who were killed for not carrying out their orders. But the vast majority were in some way linked to the terror,” said Rachinsky.\nGreat Terror returns to haunt Russia as 34 skeletons discovered in cellar Read more \nNikita Petrov, another Memorial historian, said: “There were enthusiasts and there were careerists among these men. Working in the NKVD was prestigious. At the start of the 1930s, when there was poverty and famine, you got a nice uniform and were fed well. People didn’t know that within five years they’d be sentencing thousands of people to death.”\nMemorial has previously focused more on documenting the victims of the Soviet-era repressions rather than the perpetrators. Their database of the victims contains about 2,700,000 names and a further 600,000 should be added later in the year. Rachinsky said this was about a quarter of the roughly 12 million who should make up the full list – those who were internally deported or sentenced for political reasons. In some regions, the local security services have never published lists of the victims; in many places, the archives remain closed.\nAnother project, Final Address, was launched in 2013 aiming to commemorate victims of the terror. Relatives or other interested parties can apply to have a plaque installed at houses where victims lived. Sergey Parkhomenko, a journalist and activist who set up the project, said there had been 1,500 applications and 300 plaques had already been installed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man places a candle by the photograph of a relative who was killed and buried in 1937. Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPA \nWhile there have been some cautious attempts to pay tribute to the victims of Soviet-era repression, less attention has been paid to the perpetrators until now.\nOf the 40,000 names on Zhukov’s list, about 10% were themselves either executed or jailed, though some of those who were sent to the gulags were given an amnesty before the USSR joined the second world war, and went on to win medals.\nFSB: Vladimir Putin's immensely powerful modern-day KGB Read more \nZhukov recounted his discussion on an online history forum with a man who proudly recounted how his grandfather had won prestigious medals during the war. It turned out, said Zhukov, that the grandfather had run firing squads during the Terror. He was himself sent to the gulag, but was later released and again organised executions during the war. Stories such as this reveal the complexity of the Stalin era, something largely glossed over in Vladimir Putin’s Russia , where victory in the second world war has become a national rallying point.\nWhile there have been some attempts to talk about the dark pages of the 1930s, and a gulag museum opened in Moscow last year, the official narrative tends to sideline the purges and killings. Petrov said there was not one Russian school textbook that referred to “crimes” during the Stalin period, only “mistakes”. So while there are plans to build a memorial to the victims of political repression in Moscow in the near future, they are treated as if they were victims of a tsunami or an earthquake – a narrative of victims but no crime or criminals.\n\n“The problem is not that Putin supports Stalin: he doesn’t. He’s even condemned the crimes on occasion,” said Rachinsky. “The problem is Putin can’t admit that the state could be a criminal state.”\nGreat-grandson of man killed in Stalin's purges to sue Russian state Read more \nAlthough there is a chance that a few people from Zhukov’s list could still be alive and approaching 100 years old, the point is not to open criminal cases or point the finger at individuals.\n\n“We don’t need to call them all criminals but we need to recognise the criminal nature of the organisation, and the criminal nature of the state at that time,” said Petrov.\nNot everyone is impressed with Zhukov’s work. In late November, some of the descendants of those featured in the database appealed to Russian authorities to take the lists offline.
