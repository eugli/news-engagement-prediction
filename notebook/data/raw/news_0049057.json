It was handled properly and in a timely way,” Pence said. “I have great confidence in the national security team going forward.” \nOver the weekend at Mar-a Lago, Trump met with four candidates for the national security adviser job: Army strategist Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg and West Point superintendent Lt. Col. Robert Caslen. \nRetired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward was offered the job last week but turned it down. \nPence also spoke on the importance of a free press in light of Trump’s tweet last week that the mainstream media is the “enemy.” \n“Rest assured, both the president and I strongly support a free and independent press,” Pence said. \n“But you can anticipate that the president and all of us will continue to call out the media when they play fast and loose with the facts. The truth is that we have in President Trump someone who has a unique ability to speak directly to the American people, and when the media gets it wrong, I promise you, President Trump will take his case straight to the American people to set the record straight.” Share this: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:17:51.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
