She was 80. \nPeople reported she died last week in her sleep at her home following unspecified health issues. A representative for Cruise, Amanda Lundberg, confirmed her death to USA TODAY and said the People account of her passing was accurate. \nA memorial service at her local Church of Scientology took place this weekend. Cruise, 54, was there along with his three sisters, Lee Ann DeVette, 57, Cass Mapother, 55, and Marian Henry, 52, along with other family and friends. \nCruise and his mother were close; she believed he got his passion for acting from her, a theater lover who never pursued her dreams. She urged him to try out for high school theater productions. \nMary Lee Pfeiffer was a Louisville, Ky, native who was a teacher when she married Cruise's father, Thomas Cruise Mapother III. The marriage was unhappy and broke up and she remarried, to Cruise's stepfather, Jack South. \nMapother died in 1984 of complications related to cancer. \nWhen Cruise later approached his mother and stepfather seeking approval and time to pursue an acting career, “We both wholeheartedly agreed,” she told Rolling Stone in 1986. \n“Because we both felt it was a God-given talent…So to make a long story short, we gave him our blessing — and the rest is history.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2l9iRLx NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
