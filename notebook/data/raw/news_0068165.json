(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) By Mike Heika , Staff Writer Contact Mike Heika on Twitter: @MikeHeika \nThe Stars on Friday got a head start on Wednesday's NHL trade deadline, sending winger Patrick Eaves to the Anaheim Ducks for a conditional draft pick. \nThere are plenty of conditions tied to the pick, but the deal is a lot like the move that sent Jaromir Jagr to the Boston Bruins in 2013 and landed Dallas the 29 th overall pick that allowed them to select Jason Dickinson that year. \nAnaheim has three second round draft picks this year from Ottawa, San Jose and Toronto, and Dallas will get the pick that ends up in the middle once the draft order is announced. Should the Ducks win their first two rounds in the playoffs and Eaves plays in 50 percent of those games, the pick elevates to Anaheim's first round pick. \nThe Ducks would be one of the final four at that point, so it would be a late first round selection, but a first round pick is pretty good for Eaves, who can become an unrestricted free agent in the summer. \nEaves, 32, has had a career best year with the Stars. Bouncing back from an injury-riddled previous two seasons in Dallas, Eaves has played in 59 of 60 games and has 21 goals and 16 assists for 37 points. Eaves suffered a foot injury early in the year and has participated in almost no practices or morning skates since. He pretty much just skates in warm-ups and plays in games. \nEaves is working out off the ice during practices and morning skates and said that has helped him stay healthy. \n\"Hard to miss practices, because you want to be with the team and you want to be with the guys,\" Eaves said earlier this month. \"But it is what it is, so I'm just trying to put everything into games and try not to miss a beat.\" \nEaves said he would rather be practicing but the approach has possibly played a role in his goal scoring. \n\"I really miss being out there with the boys, so come game time I'm really excited to get going,\" Eaves said. \nEaves signed a one-year deal for $1 million this season, and that was one reason his trade got done quickly. He fits for teams that are tight against the salary cap. \nDepending on what Anaheim decides to do with Eaves, he can still become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 and could re-sign with the Stars. But he would command a much higher salary. \nThe NHL trade deadline is at 2 p.m. Wednesday, and the Stars still have players they could move (Dallas is 10 points out of a playoff spot with 22 games remaining). Patrick Sharp is a three-time Cup winner, so he has great value. However, he has missed 26 games with concussions this year and has a $5.9 million salary cap hit. Defenseman Johnny Oduya also could draw interest, but he has missed 14 games with an ankle injury and probably needs to play at least one game. He could return to the ice Sunday against Boston. \nAlso, with Eaves out, expect Jiri Hudler to jump into the lineup tonight. \nHere is the press release: \nFRISCO, Texas - Dallas Stars General Manager Jim Nill announced today that the club has acquired a conditional second-round selection in the 2017 NHL Draft in exchange for right wing Patrick Eaves . Based on draft position, Dallas will receive the middle pick of Ottawa, San Jose or Toronto's second-round selections in 2017 per the conditions in which Anaheim acquired the pick from Toronto in a previous trade. Should Anaheim advance to the third round of the postseason and Eaves plays in 50% or more of their games in the first two rounds, the selection becomes the Ducks first-round selection in the 2017 NHL Draft. \nEaves, 32, has recorded 37 points (21-16=37) in 59 games played this season. In three seasons with the Stars, he appeared in 160 regular season games posting 81 points (46-35=81). \nThe 6-foot, 200-pound native of Calgary, Alberta was signed as a free agent by Dallas on July 1, 2014. \nAdditionally, forward Adam Cracknell was placed on Injured Reserve retroactive to Feb. 18 with a lower body injury.
