Ltd. plans to open a large distribution hub in metro Atlanta. The South Korean conglomerate is expected to locate the roughly 500,000 square foot center in the SouthCreek Industrial Park in Fairburn, according to a source. Enlarge SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg Metro Atlanta is a national logistics hub, with its central location and rail, road and port access. The region is attracting major projects, including United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) new $400 million logistics campus . On Feb. 16, Atlanta Business Chronicle reported AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s (NYSE: ABC) plans to open a 350,000 square-foot \"Amazon-like\" high-tech distribution center in Buford. Industrial real estate firm DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (NYSE: DCT) hinted at the Samsung distribution center in an earnings call on Feb. 3. Without naming Samsung, DCT Industrial CEO Phil Hawkins referred to a tenant, which he described as a \"global, very well-known company focused on consumer electronics and household appliances, headquartered outside the U.S.\", that was drawn to metro Atlanta because of the region's strong economy. \"I think their belief is, if you got a good economy, consumers are going to be buying in Atlanta,\" Hawkins told analysts on the call. \"They better serve that consumer base if they want to continue to maintain, or grow their market share. ” The U.S. is an important market for Samsung Electronics, a corporate spokeswoman said Monday evening . “We have been making significant investments, including Austin, Texas, where we have invested $17 billion to date in our semiconductor manufacturing facility,” she said. \"We continue to evaluate new investment needs in the U.S. that can help us best serve our customers. \" DCT declined comment, citing confidentiality agreements. Samsung is said to have begun its search for space in Atlanta \"after the election and then finished in the month of January quickly, decisively and showing no flinching whatsoever about sort of the turmoil surrounding all of us,\" Hawkins noted on the call. “We’ve got a good economy, we’ve got good demand, and they need to serve it.” The more than 180-acre SouthCreek Industrial Park is located off Interstate-85 and is 10 minutes south of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Samsung is no stranger to Atlanta. The Samsung Tech Advanced Research (STAR) Center at Georgia Tech does research in software technologies. Last year, Samsung faced a $5 billion recall of its Galaxy Note 7 phablets over exploding batteries. Now, Samsung Group Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee is embroiled in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of South Korea's President. DCT expects President Donald J. Trump’s focus on bringing manufacturing and other jobs back to the U.S. to be good for the industrial real estate industry. \"The expansionist pro-growth instincts of the (Trump) Administration, as well as both branches of Congress, will be a net positive for our business,\" Hawkins said on the call. \"To the extent trade policy and taxation policy shifts some production back onshore from offshore, that also will create net demand for warehouse space, because every time you build another car here or whatever you’re building, that needs a warehouse, or more than one warehouse.\" Urvaksh Karkaria covers Technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:04:19.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
