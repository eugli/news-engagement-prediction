Therefore, they managed to amplify molecular ... Researchers develop molecular switch that changes liquid crystal colors August 26, 2013 \nDartmouth researchers have developed a molecular switch that changes a liquid crystal's readout color based on a chemical input. This new development may open the way for using liquid crystals in detecting harmful gases, ... Macroscopic self-oscillation—crystal bends and stretches in blue light May 20, 2016 \nMicrorobots and nanomachines are no longer far-off dreams. However, one of the biggest challenges that remains is to transmit the motion of individual molecules or molecular clusters into structured macroscopic motion that ... Liquid crystals open new route to planar optical elements June 16, 2016 \nResearchers at Osaka University developed a technology to control the light wavefront reflected from a cholesteric liquid crystal - a liquid crystal phase with a helical structure. Although known for their ability to Bragg-reflect ... Natural scale caterpillar soft robot is powered and controlled with light August 22, 2016 \nResearchers at the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, using the liquid crystal elastomer technology originally developed in the LENS Institute in Florence, demonstrated a bio-inspired micro-robot capable of mimicking ... New 'bottlebrush' electroactive polymers make dielectric elastomers increasingly viable for use in devices November 9, 2016 \nA multi-institutional research team has developed a new electroactive polymer material that can change shape and size when exposed to a relatively small electric field. The advance overcomes two longstanding challenges regarding ... Recommended for you Molecular switch drives powerful movement by opposing twisting helices February 15, 2017 \nPlants are capable of producing powerful movement that is initiated at the molecular level. This fast motion is often supported by helix-based architectures, for example in vetches or orchids that spread seeds by explosive ... Research to help fight multi-resistant bacteria February 15, 2017 \nAn international collaboration led by scientists from The University of Western Australia has uncovered the three-dimensional molecular structure of a protein, called EptA, which is responsible for multi-drug resistance in ... Tumor-targeting system uses cancer's own mechanisms to betray its location February 14, 2017 \nBy hijacking a cancer cell's own metabolism, researchers have found a way to tag and target elusive cancers with small-molecule sugars. This opens treatment pathways for cancers that are not responsive to conventional targeted ... A scanning-tunneling microscope provides a glimpse of entropy in action February 14, 2017 \nNew research shows that a scanning-tunneling microscope (STM), used to study changes in the shape of a single molecule at the atomic scale, impacts the ability of that molecule to make these changes. The study, appearing ... Tiny magnetic implant offers new drug delivery method February 14, 2017 \nUniversity of British Columbia researchers have developed a magnetic drug implant—the first of its kind in Canada—that could offer an alternative for patients struggling with numerous pills or intravenous injections. Researchers engineer 'thubber,' a stretchable rubber that packs a thermal conductive punch February 13, 2017 \nCarmel Majidi and Jonathan Malen of Carnegie Mellon University have developed a thermally conductive rubber material that represents a breakthrough for creating soft, stretchable machines and electronics.
