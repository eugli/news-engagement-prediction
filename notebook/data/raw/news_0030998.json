Hands down one of the most 'faulty’ TV moments I’ve seen.\" by VH1 7h ago \nBy Jasmine Washington \nDon’t come for Frank Ocean ! \nThe R&B crooner unleashed a fiery clapback in response to a Rolling Stone interview with Grammy Awards producers Ken Ehrlich and writer David Wild . The interview credited Ocean’s decision to opt out of the forthcoming ceremony to the singer’s “faulty” and “not great tv” performance at the 2013 Grammy’s. \nOwning up to his less-than-stellar “Forest Gump” performance, Ocean explained, “Yea yea my 2013 performance at the Grammys was absolute sh-t. Technical difficulties, blah blah. Thanks for the reminder. Very much appreciated. F–k that performance though,” in a legnthy message on his Tumblr . \nOcean revealed that he initially wanted to participate in the Grammy’s tribute to Prince , but decided on a more personal way to pay homage. “I figured my best tribute to that man’s legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful. Winning a TV award doesn’t christen me successful. It took me some time to learn that. I bought all my masters back last year in the prime of my career, that’s successful. Blonde sold a million plus without a label, that’s successful. I am young, black, gifted and independent.. that’s my tribute,” Ocean added. \nIn the midst of unleashing his wrath, the Blonde singer took a little dig at Taylor Swift. “I’ve actually been tuning into CBS around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honor and you know what’s really not ’great TV’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp A Butterfly. Hands down one of the most ’faulty’ TV moments I’ve seen,” he quipped. \nOcean brought his rant to a close dishing, “Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive. And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it. Have a good night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:36:42.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
