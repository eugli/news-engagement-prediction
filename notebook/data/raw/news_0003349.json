On Monday, the Commerce Department reported an uptick in inflation to 1.7 percent. \n“The economy continues to chug along and sentiment has improved. The Fed does sound more confident about eventually getting to its 2 percent inflation target,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. \nFISCAL POLICY UNCERTAINTY \nInvestors had all but ruled out a rate increase this week, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s fiscal and trade policies and how they would affect the Fed’s outlook. \nTrump’s promises on infrastructure spending, tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and a renegotiation of trade deals could quickly spur higher inflation, which may necessitate a faster pace of rate hikes. \nThe businessman-turned-politician has offered few specifics on his economic plans or a timeline for their rollout, while the announcement of policies viewed by many as protectionist and an immigration crackdown have caused market jitters in recent days. \n“There is still uncertainty about fiscal policy, so the Fed is likely waiting for a bit more data and more certainty,” said Tony Bedikian, head of global markets at Citizens Bank. \nEarlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to more than a two-year high in January while a report by a payrolls processor showed U.S. private employers added 246,000 jobs in January, far above analysts’ expectations. \nThe Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely-watched monthly jobs report for January on Friday. Yellen may also give a clearer signal on the Fed’s thinking when she provides semi-annual testimony to Congress in mid-February. \nThere are seven more Fed policy meetings in 2017, with the next one scheduled for March 14-15. \n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange; Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos and Dion Rabouin in New York; Editing by Paul Simao) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:25:52.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
