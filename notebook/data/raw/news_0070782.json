Way to go CBC. Taking a serious issue (illegal crossings) to shout me down on the air. Your tax dollars at work. \n— Tony Clement (@TonyclementCPC) February 21, 2017 \nFinnerty responded by saying he’d invite Clement back to the show, but would continue to ask for details on how the RCMP should enforce laws at the border. We'd love to have you back, @TonyclementCPC . We would still need to press you to explain how the RCMP should enforce the law on the border. \n— Mike Finnerty (@finnertymike) February 21, 2017 Getting answers to questions is our job @TonyclementCPC , no apologies for that. Ppl can judge for themselves on tone.There was no shouting \n— Mike Finnerty (@finnertymike) February 21, 2017 Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:30.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
