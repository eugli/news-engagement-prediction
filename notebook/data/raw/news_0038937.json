Earlier this year, she announced she teamed up with the American fashion house, joining the ranks of many famous faces who have done so in the past.

She later shared a picture hanging with her girlfriends at a restaurant. Gal-entine's celebration anyone? \nBut aside from Valentine's Day and music and fashion (oh my!), The Weeknd's birthday also happens to be this week. \nThe \"Starboy\" singer turns 27 on Thursday (yes, the same day SelGo is releasing her new song) and has already begun the celebrations.
