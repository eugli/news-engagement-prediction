Prior to that, he served as band council chief in Natuashish, where he lobbied unsuccessfully to repeal an alcohol ban, which still exists in that community.\nMore than twice the limit According to an agreed statement of facts, someone called police after seeing Tshakapesh leave a liquor store in Happy Valley-Goose Bay on Dec. 30, 2016 around 11 a.m. The RCMP waited for him along Route 520, between Happy Valley-Goose Bay and Sheshatshiu.\nPolice stopped Tshakapesh and gave him a breathalyzer, which showed a blood alcohol level of 190 mg — more than twice the legal limit of 80 mg.\nAs for punishment, the Crown and the defence both asked for a fine and driving ban.\nTshakapesh has two prior convictions: being unlawfully intoxicated while on reserve and breaching probation.\nJudge Phyllis Harris considered Tshakapesh's record, his prompt guilty plea, and the severity of his crime — Tshakapesh travelled nearly 20 kilometres before being stopped with four passengers in his truck.\nThe judge settled on a $1,500 fine and a 12-month driving ban.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:58:34.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
