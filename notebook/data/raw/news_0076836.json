The ad focuses on the “truth.” \nDuring the simple ad, statements flash across the screen beginning with, “The truth is our nation is more divided than ever.” The statements that follow are popular phrases or versions of the truth that are used by Trump and his supporters and then statements used by opponents of Trump. \nSome of the pro-Trump statements included: “The truth is the media is dishonest; The truth is we have to protect our borders; The truth is climate change is a hoax; The truth is Obamacare isn’t affordable; The truth is all lives matter.” \nWhile some of the statements from Trump’s opponents include: “The truth is women’s rights are human rights; The truth is his refugee policy is a backdoor Muslim ban; The truth is we need a full investigation of Russian ties; The truth is this country was built by immigrants; The truth is we need new restrictions on gun control.” \nThe rate at which the messages roll across the screen starts slow, but begins to speed up before the final statements are shown. \n“The truth is hard to find. The truth is hard to know. The truth is more important now than ever,” the ad says at the end. \n\nDavid Rubin, branding executive at the Times, recently explained in an interview to CNN the purpose of the ad. He told the cable news network the ad was intended to tap into the “national dialogue going on right now about facts and the truth.” \nHe added: \nThe idea is to be a part of that discussion about what does it mean to find the truth. What does that mean in a world of “fake news?” And what is the role of journalism and journalists in that process and what is the role of reader in supporting that journalism? \nWe think it’s a great metaphor for how hard it is on a regular basis to understand the truth. That leads into the role that we think journalism can play in helping you cut through that clutter and make your own sense of what’s going on in the world. \nWe wanted a high profile media moment. This felt like a great moment for people to respond and react to the spot. \nTrump, however, didn’t take too kindly to the ad, which many argue had anti-Trump undertones. \n“For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!” the president tweeted early Sunday morning. For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017 \nTrump’s supporters also called out the publication for the ad:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:40:01.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
