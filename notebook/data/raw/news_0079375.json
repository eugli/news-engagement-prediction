is here and it’s about to immortalise some of the best films of the past 12 months.\nThis year’s crop of Oscar-nominated films showcase a massive variety of locations — from the dazzling lights of Los Angeles, the dusty isolation of the Wild West and the sunshine of one of Australia’s very own seaside spots.\nTravel Insurance Direct has rounded up some of the awards season’s most talked-about movies and the real-life destinations that inspired them, so you can check them out off-camera.\nLA LA LAND\nThis memorable scene was shot in a park called Cathy’s Corner, near the Griffith Observatory. Picture: Dale Robinette/Lionsgate via AP Source: AP\nGriffith Park is one of the best ways to see the Los Angeles skyline. Picture: iStock Source: istock\nAs the name suggests, this musical — which is nominated for an incredible 14 Academy Awards — pays homage to the global headquarters of show business: Los Angeles.\nEven some less-obviously glamorous parts of LA are given the retro treatment in the film, such as the intersection of the 105 and 110 freeways near Athens and Watts.\nBut fans of the film will definitely want to check out the site of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling’s instantly-iconic twilight dance number.\nHead to Cathy’s Corner, a park on Mt Hollywood Drive, on the way up to the Griffith Observatory — that’s where it was filmed. And don’t be discouraged if you don’t see the park bench and lamp post, because they were added just for the film.\nARRIVAL\nIn the film, one of the spacecraft touches down in Montana, but it’s really Quebec. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe filming location was a few hours east of Montreal. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nDenis Villeneuve’s mind-bending sci-fi flick, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, explores what happens when mysterious creatures from outer space arrive on Planet Earth.\nThe captivating scene where the aliens’ egg-shaped orb settles over a green pasture in the United States was actually shot in Quebec, Canada — specifically, the Quebecuios town of Bass-Saint-Laurent.\nThe picturesque town sits on the Saint Lawrence River, about a four-hour drive east of Montreal.\nHELL OR HIGH WATER\nWest Texas brothers, played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine, in Hell or High Water.

Picture: Flickr/Greg Gjerdingen Source: Supplied\nThis modern-day western, starring Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine, is set in the arid livestock and oil country of West Texas.\nThe movie was actually shot just 15 kilometres into neighbouring New Mexico, in a town called Clovis.\nClovis a short detour for movie fans visiting nearby Amarillo, El Paso and, a little further afield, Phoenix. The town is well-known among country music fans, thanks largely to the influential Norman Petty Recording Studio, and it’s a great place to check out a local rodeo.\nHIDDEN FIGURES\nNASA staffers, played by Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monae, meet astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) in a scene from Hidden Figures. Source: Supplied\nAtlanta, Georgia is a thriving city rich in history and culture. Picture: iStock Source: istock\nStarring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae, this film tells the story of female African-American mathematicians who worked on the NASA space program during the space race of the Cold War.\nScenes at the NASA headquarters were filmed in an old building in Atlanta, Georgia, on the campus of Morehouse College.\nAtlanta may not be one of the most obvious stops for a holiday in the US but it’s a perfect spot for history buffs, especially for its crucial role during the Civil War and the civil rights movement.\nLION\nIn Lion, Saroo Brierley (Dev Patel) returns to India to find his lost family. Source: Supplied\nTassie’s Marion Bay looks great on-screen. Picture: jenne/Flickr Source: Supplied\nSunny Pawar plays a young Saroo in Lion. Source: Supplied\nBengal plays a crucial role in this Australian film, based on the real-life story of Saroo Brierley (played by Sunny Pawar and later Dev Patel) who becomes separated from his family in India and is adopted by Australian parents (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) in Hobart, Tasmania.\nThe shot where the family plays cricket on the beach was filmed at Marion Bay, east of Hobart. Many music fans would know Marion Bay as the original home of the Tasmanian Falls Festival and it’s a fantastic spot for a weekend away.\nMANCHESTER BY THE SEA\nCasey Affleck’s character Lee returns to his hometown in Manchester By the Sea. Picture: Claire Folger Source: Supplied\nThe lighthouse on Bakers Island appears in the movie. Picture: Flickr/Peter Ciro Source: Supplied\nThis moving film is set in a place called Manchester-by-the-Sea, in Massachusetts.\nThe lighthouse seen in the movie is on Bakers Island, off the coast of Manchester, near the charmingly named Misery Island.\nThis is an important spot in the history of white settlement of North America, as nearby Gloucester was settled before Boston and formed part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\nFurther south, on the way to Boston, travellers will find Salem — home to America’s most notorious witch-hunts, and a city that’s become movie-famous in its own right.\nTANNA\nBehind the scenes of Tanna, a Romeo and Juliet-style story of forbidden love in Vanuatu. Source: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe incredible Mt Yasur Volcano on Tanna Island, Vanuatu. Picture: Mark Calleja Source: News Corp Australia\nUp for a gong in the Foreign Language category at the Oscars, this critically acclaimed film by Australian filmmakers Bentley Dean and Martin Butler is about a love story in one of our favourite holiday destinations: Vanuatu.\nIt’s also the first feature film to be shot entirely on the Pacific Island.\nDean told news.com.au he spent seven months living in a traditional, off-the-beaten-track community while making the movie.\n“I was astounded that only about four or five hours from Australia was a place that had an active volcano, black sand beaches, and was so culturally rich,” he said.\n“Each village takes turns to hold a big party at the beginning of the harvest for the yam, or the taro. It’s like a bush rave, but like nothing you’ve ever seen.”\nSmaller villages in Vanuatu aren’t there for tourists, so interested visitors should first make contact with the Vanuatu Cultural Centre in Port Vila.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fc0ccfd6b0b2cbc412915643576bdaf8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6952d36adaaa411aaf8a024b565a9a95", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/54eb9ce69fe51d01dbbb645c23021fba", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/98bf4544507f5d0273799e81e890a866", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3f5876988075f0e4313a8ba240b95a6e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5014235894a6f3e4220f34704d728885", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/841cf7d8d2bca5746a857ff06c815c03", "https://www.travelinsurancedirect.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2a58e5e95e6a0f94d6edce49f25aa018", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4537d0680ba12810fd89df276cf6d259", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b2dcb2aecef55dc0a831973094a3d7cb", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/16d7b8853ff03b2035790f53907c0741", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c2dc9711bce4f38055987f3016191214", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29a370b0f0093bcabdbf21d75109a110", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/14c3e4c2720f5fe9dfc61e3bb51250e0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4ae3e644770470921e8755e70414b7ba"], "published": "2017-02-27T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:39:07.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
