(Erin Sauder / The Courier-News) Privacy Policy \nWest Dundee will once again be a stop in the popular Intelligentsia Cup Prairie State Cycling Series. \nOn Monday, trustees approved the request by race coordinators to host the one-day West Dundee River Challenge criterium Wednesday, July 19. Village officials also gave race officials the OK to increase the size of the course. \nThe 0.7-mile closed road course will start and end at Fourth and Washington streets, next to Grafelman Park, extending one block to the east and north in the vicinity of Geneva, Kane and Sixth streets. Festivities are set to run from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Several village streets that are part of the course will be closed. \nMarco Colbert, race director, said last year's inaugural event in West Dundee was well attended. \n\"We had about 400 bike racers which is a good turnout for the first year on a Wednesday,\" he told trustees at Monday's meeting. \"Our racers enjoyed the course very much although it got a little challenging going up the hill at Washington.\" \nIt's for that reason Colbert and his fellow event coordinators requested extending the race course. \n\"It's really to give the racers a little bit of a break so they're not confronting the hill too frequently,\" Colbert said. \"But having said that, the bike racers loved that hill.\" \nCriteriums generally involve a course between one and five kilometers in length that racers ride for a set time.

(Erin Sauder / The Courier-News) \nIn a memo to trustees, Village Manager Joe Cavallaro said additional layouts were evaluated but staff felt the proposed course would minimize the number of residents and businesses impacted. \nHe added that based on a better understanding of last year's event, its layout and the opportunities, village officials feel there are better ways to involve the community and the downtown businesses. \nFor instance, the village will likely host some festivities in Grafelman Park in order to bring more people into the downtown area to view the races and to facilitate the businesses' interests. \nTrustee Tom Price called last year's event \"a lot of fun.\" \n\"We had some residents that were on the route that had some festivities and other sorts of things,\" he said. \"It was a great time.\" \nMore information about the Intelligentsia Cup Prairie State Cycling Series can be found at http://www.intelligentsiacup.com/ .
