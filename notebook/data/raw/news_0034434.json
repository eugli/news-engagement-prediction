Emma was just a year old when she lost her battle to cancer in 2013. Her memory has been kept alive with various fundraisers in support of the hospice.\nBy the end of the day, dozens of laundry cleaning items were collected, in addition to $800 in cash donations. People who want to donate but were unable to attend can still drop off items at St. Gabriel’s School.\nWindsor’s Ronald McDonald House, the first one in Canada to be built right inside a hospital, caters to hundreds of families annually whose children stay in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care or pediatrics unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:14:00.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
