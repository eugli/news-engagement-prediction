Similarly, if something—say, an anonymous Twitter account that purports to share the dark innermost secrets of the Trump administration—seems too far-fetched, slapdash, and downright annoying, it too, is probably not totally legit. \nRogue POTUS Staff, but a month-old fledgling account, has already amassed nearly 800,000 followers and a bunch of coverage. The website linked to the Twitter account claims it is run by \"White House staffers, working at various levels, operating in secrecy to reveal hidden truths of the Trump administration to the American people.\" Which sounds more like the A-Team intro than anything else. \nThere's no doubt the Trump presidency has so far struggled with public opinion and leaks to the press, but such an organized, high-profile effort seems unlikely to be real. On Monday night, Gizmodo journalist Libby Watson questioned the veracity of the account after it completely airballed with a claim Michael Flynn was absolutely not resigning, which he totally did almost immediately after this tweet: \nhttps://twitter.com/JohnLockesKnife/status/831368238109978624 \n\"If you don't believe me that's your own fault\"—the battlecry of being owned online. \nLet's assume, just for a second, this is a real account: what purpose is it actually serving, other than whipping people perfectly willing to follow along into a frenzy? There's no value in incendiary information just spewed out everywhere like a woodchipper. And if these were real staffers working in the real White House, why do they spend so much time impotently fighting back against people who don't believe them? \nThe discourse of Rogue Potus Staff veers wildly day to day between holier-than-thou moralizing reminiscent of other terrible twitter accounts , and laughably thin-skinned, reactionary @-replying reminiscent of, well.... the dude they're so nobly trying to undermine . \nBy all means, follow @RoguePOTUSStaff if it makes you happy. It sure is a soothing thought experiment to think there are some well-meaning, selfless people putting themselves on the line for the sake of transparency and truth. If that were the case, though, it's hard to imagine they'd spend so much time tweeting out memes and arguing with anyone who dares question them.
