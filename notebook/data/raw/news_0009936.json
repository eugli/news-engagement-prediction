External Link: Weatherill Twitter \nLabor is expected to open preselections for a number of seats as soon as next week. \nMs Key holds Ashford by a 2 per cent margin, but under the new boundaries Badcoe has a more generous 4.2 per cent notional margin in favour of the ALP. \nThe change was one of few bright spots for Labor under the redistribution, which sees the ALP-held seats of Elder, Colton, Mawson and Newland transformed into notional Liberal seats. \nThe party has lodged an appeal against the changes and it will be heard by the Supreme Court later in the month. Digance might switch seats \nThere has been speculation the current Member for Elder Annabelle Digance may seek a shift to a neighbouring electorate to improve her chances of returning to the Parliament now her seat has become notionally Liberal. \nBut Ms Digance told the ABC she did not intend seeking to be a candidate in Badcoe. \nThe Liberal Party already has opened nominations for Badcoe, and the Unley Mayor Lachlan Clyne is considered the frontrunner. \nLabor's State Executive will meet next Monday and is expected to open preselections in a host of seats, despite the party challenging new boundaries. \nThe preselections move is likely to prompt further retirement announcements from Labor MPs in coming days. \nHouse of Assembly Speaker Michael Atkinson is widely tipped to retire at the 2018 poll, with Police Minister Peter Malinauskas expected to make a shift from the Legislative Council to run in Mr Atkinson's Labor stronghold of Croydon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:18:10.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
