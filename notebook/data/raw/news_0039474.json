I was in the process of reacting to (the other boy) when I felt the second impact.\n“I braked as hard and quickly as I could but there was not enough time ... I ran to (the other boy) who was stood holding his hip and asked if he was okay.\n“He said he was all right and said, ‘Sorry sir, my fault, I was going for the bus’.”\nMr Brooks said it was then that he saw Ashley, who was lying half under the minibus and who was already being helped by others.\nOne of the school bus drivers, Hedley Williams, who was standing nearby, described the end of the school day as a “free-for-all”, with children walking and running across the road from between parked vehicles, as buses and cars were driven along the road in both directions.\n“I always thought it was an accident waiting to happen,” he said, adding that he spoke to teachers about it.\nTributes left to tragic Ashley after the fatal accident (Photo: Wales Online) “I had the impression that I needed to keep quiet as I was only a bus driver.”\nMr Williams said there had been a similar incident the Monday before the incident when two pupils walked in front of the school minibus and were shouted at by a driver who managed to stop in time.\nHe said the school adopted new policies after Ashley’s death, which included extending the bus bays so they could all park on one side of the road.\nThe inquest heard there is also now a block on vehicle movements between 2.55pm and 3.10pm.\nPolice Constable Christopher Street, a forensic collision investigator, said the two boys would have been running at 6mph-10mph, while Mr Brooks was probably driving at between 14mph-17mph just before the collision.\nHe said the buses parked on either side of the road created a tunnel, restricting Mr Brook’s view.\nA bus driver claimed the incident was \"an accident waiting to happen\", an inquest heard (Photo: Wales Online) He said the speed was not excessive, there was no evidence the teacher had been distracted, and added: “He would not have had a warning as to the intention of the two boys.”\nPc Street said that even if the bus had been going at 5mph at the point of impact it could still have run over Ashley due to the lack of warning Mr Brooks had.\n“It is entirely possible that the front wheel may have gone over the casualty even at such a low speed,” he said.\nAshley, a budding mechanic and motocross fan from, was described as popular and well-loved by his classmates after his death.\nThe inquest continues.\n More On Schools Inquests", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror"], "published": "2017-02-16T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:16:40.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
