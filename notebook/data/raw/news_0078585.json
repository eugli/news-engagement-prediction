In a village where education is hard to get, him along with his other 6 brothers and 2 sisters managed to get whatever they could. What seemed like a scenario straight out of a typical Bollywood film, the village only knew three things - Wheat, Sugarcane and Guns. The part where the locality thrived on guns and violence made this humble lower middle-class family move out eventually, for a better livelihood. Source : Telfie \nWhile the family continued to have a decent living after moving outside, this boy went on and completed his graduation from a University in Haridwar and then worked as chemist in a petrochemical company in Baroda. Unable to cope up with it, he moved to Delhi and worked as a watchman at various places. In this process, he frequently visited theatres and plays and started to participate in them. He went on to join the National School of Drama (NSD) and graduated from it in 1996. It all started going uphill for him after this step. From gaining passion on acting just from the C-grade films, which occupied a majority of the bunch that came to his village, to stepping into mainstream acting in Bollywood, the versatile actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a perfect personification and example of how success comes from never giving up. \nHaving acquired a relevant degree, he moved to Mumbai to try his luck in Bollywood. With not much money behind his back during this time, Nawaz could not even afford to pay for his rent in Mumbai. He walked from studio to studio, set to set, all day, finding himself doing only petty roles or the ones where he was just a part of a crowd. He approached his NSD senior asking if he could accommodate Nawaz at his place. He agreed to it under the condition that Nawaz cooked twice a day. \nHe made his debut in films with Aamir Khan's film 'Sarfarosh' in 1999 where he played a terrorist. This was followed by small roles in a few movies over the next few years and his poverty still continued during this period of time. He even acted in television serials and a few short films but his big break happened with 'Black Friday' (2007) by Anurag Kashyap. His first major lead role was a wedding singer in 'Patang' which went to the Berlin International Film Festival and Tribeca Film Festival. However, he got his first recognition from the movie 'Peepli Live' where he plays the role of a journalist. This film had him receive a lot of accolades and praises. \nThe year 2012 was the turning point for him with films like 'Kahaani' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur' doing so well at the box office and that was when the world got to identify the real potential of this wonderful actor. Nawaz didn't look back after that. He went on to get chances to act in big movies like Talaash, Badlapur, Lunchbox, Kick, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Raees and also the recent Oscar nomination 'Lion'. \nIn an interview with DNA India , he talks about the reactions from his friends and relatives upon his stardom. He said, \"It’s a sense of satisfaction because I proved all of them wrong. All of them said ‘ kya hero banega (how will he become a hero)’ when I set out. When I go back now they say ‘ isne toh karke dikhaya (he has done it)’. I made it possible.\" \nWhen asked if he ever thought of giving up, he says, \"So many times I felt I was wasting my time because things were just not working out. But I couldn’t even go back. What would I do there? Spent all my life acting and I don’t know any other work. Also, I was afraid my friends would tease me. Arrey hero banne gaya tha, wapas laut aaya (He had gone to become an actor and has returned with nothing).\" \nFrom being just an extra and a prop to being a lead actor and traveling to film festivals like Cannes and currently being one of the most talented and versatile actors of the film industry in India, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's story is quite an inspirational rags to riches tale. \nThe 43-year old actor is now respected all across for he has been so patient and persistent on acting in films and having struggled for almost two decades to become a lead actor. \nDo you have an interesting story to share?
