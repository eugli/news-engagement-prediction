PGA golfer Steven David Bowditch (Photo: Scottsdale Police Department) \nA pro golfer arrested on suspicion of extreme DUI early Friday was back on the course competing at the Waste Management Phoenix Open after bonding out of Scottsdale City Jail, officials said.\nAustralian Steven David Bowditch, 33, had a blood-alcohol content exceeding 0.20 percent when police took him into custody about 1:10 a.m., said Sgt. Ben Hoster, a Scottsdale police spokesman. Hoster said Bowditch was booked into jail \"due to the fact that he is an out-of-state resident.\"\nPolice said another driver called 911 to report a white truck \"swerving all over the road.\" Officers found the truck at Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Drive and observed as the driver failed to move through two traffic-light cycles.\nHoster said an officer found Bowditch asleep behind the wheel and had to wake him.\nBowditch issued a statement about his arrest late Friday: “I would like to apologize to my family, friends and supporters, as well as the PGA Tour and Waste Management Phoenix Open for the incident reported today. As I intend to fully cooperate with the authorities.'' Bowditch added he would not comment further on the matter.\nBowditch is ranked 318th in golf world rankings. He made his 12:25 p.m. tee time Friday afternoon, but he failed to make the cut after two rounds of 74 and will not be playing Saturday and Sunday.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn 2017 Waste Management Phoenix Open   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
