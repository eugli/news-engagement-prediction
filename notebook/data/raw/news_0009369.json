Trump's initial job approval rating was the lowest in Gallup history, and a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the job he is doing. No other president going back to Dwight Eisenhower had majority disapproval in his first several months in office. A majority of Americans, in similar fashion, disapprove of several of the high-visibility executive actions Trump has taken within his first 10 days in the White House. \nThis polarization of opinion most likely reflects not only Trump himself -- his style and the actions he has taken -- but also the prevailing political environment today. Americans are sharply divided along political lines on any number of issues, meaning that any newly elected president these days will find it difficult to develop bipartisan support for their presidency or for specific actions. \nThese data are available in Gallup Analytics . Survey Methods \nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 30-31, 2017, on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey, with a random sample of 1,018 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is Â±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting. \nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70% cellphone respondents and 30% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. \nLearn more about how the Gallup U.S. Daily works.
