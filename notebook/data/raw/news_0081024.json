The nominees were George Bruns for “The Sword in the Stone,” André Previn for “Irma La Douce,” John Green for “Bye Bye Birdie,” Leith Stevens for “A New Kind of Love” and Maurice Jarre for “Sundays and Cybele.” \nSomeone handed Davis an envelope on stage, and he read the name on the card: “John Addison for ‘Tom Jones.’” Addison wasn’t even a nominee in that category (he won for best original score that year). \nAfter some hesitant applause died down ― and Davis realized the mistake ― he jumped back to the podium to address the blunder. \n“Oh, they gave me the wrong envelope. Wait till the NAACP hears about this,” he joked. \n“I ain’t gonna make no mistake this time, baby,” he added while pulling out a pair of glasses from his jacket. \nThe winner was André Previn. \nDavis’ flub was corrected in a matter of seconds. The same cannot be said for the 2017 Oscars , where three acceptance speeches for “La La Land” as best picture were given before the error was fixed. The rightful winner, “ Moonlight ,” was eventually announced.
