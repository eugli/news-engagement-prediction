The school opened in the fall of 2015. Abhishek Mehta, CEO of Tresata, is pictured inside the company's new offices in South End. Melissa Key “We have always been energized by the power education has to shape the future, our future and in the Charlotte Lab School we found a partner who is equally energized by it,” said Abhishek Mehta , CEO of Tresata. “Their vision to personalize education for each student is a lovely extension of our promise to enrich life, and we are excited by how our powerful analytics platform can enable the same and empower kids to be successful individuals.” This isn’t the first time Tresata has partnered with an organization in the community. The company announced it was working with Opera Carolina last fall . In exchange for tickets, Tresata donated software to Opera Carolina so the organization could get to know its customers better. Opera Carolina says the software has made life easier for the organization. “Public-private partnership such as this one are a key ingredient to improving public education for all,” said CLS Founder and Head of School Mary Moss Brown . Tresata, which provides software for businesses hoping to analyze and benefit from consumer data, moved into a new office last year in South End .
