According to Women's Health , a glass of grape juice has nine teaspoons of sugar, a glass of orange juice has six teaspoons and a glass of apple juice has seven. Drinking juice can lead to a blood sugar spike, and when the spike drops, you can find yourself craving sugar and carbs, Harvard Medical School professor Dr David Ludwig told Women's Health. Fruit juice also contains little fibre, so it's better to stick with eating fruit in it's whole form. COFFEE Find you can't function without your morning mocha? You might be less inclined to swing past your local coffee shop if you knew a cafe mocha, made on skim milk, had a staggering 220 calories . When it comes to coffee, less is best. If you're trying to lose weight, stick to a black coffee with a little milk and no sugar, as piling on the cream and chocolate sprinkles in a sure way to blow out your diet. Your morning coffee can be crammed with calories, especially if you add sugar, cream or chocolate SKIM MILK Skim milk can lead to weight gain over time, Women's Health reported. 'Observational research rather consistently shows that consumers of fat-free or one per cent milk tend to gain more weight over time than those who consume whole, unsweetened milk,' Dr Ludwig told the publication. It's also best to steer clear of milk substitutes, which can have added sugar. When it comes to dairy choose calcium-rich full cream milk, or alternatively, drink nut milk which has less calories and sugar. Store-bought iced tea is also full of sugar, with a bottle containing about 116 calories ICED TEA Just like fruit juice, store-bought iced tea is packed with sugar. In fact, one sweetened bottle of iced tea can contain as much as 116 calories, WebMB reported. You're better off making your own iced tea, without the added sugar. ALCOHOL Alcohol, especially beer and wine, are crammed with calories. In fact, a glass of beer contains about 150 calories and can directly lead to weight gain. Fruity cocktails are also best to avoid, as just like fruit juice, they are packed with sugar. Smoothies packed with fruit can also be a bad idea, make sure to keep your portion right SMOOTHIES If you're making a smoothie at home, be warned. While it may seem like a good idea to pack in the fruit, drinking large amounts at once is not the right way to go about it, Women's Health reported. Instead, choose your portions wisely by sticking to one serving of fruit and using ingredients such as avocado and Greek yoghurt.
