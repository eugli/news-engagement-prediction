SoulCycle Gym in spandex this week. Malia is warming up to a comfortable style of dress in her post-White House life — and fans are thrilled over the new look. \nMalia Obama, 18, has been hard at work in New York City where she recently began a coveted internship at the Harvey Weinstein Company, according to Daily Mail . During her time as a first daughter, Malia wore age-appropriate dresses and outfits that leaned more on the conservative side, for obvious reasons. \nOne month after her father, President Barack Obama, completed his second term in office, Malia’s wardrobe morphed into a leisure look typical of a teen of her age group. Today, she’s showing more skin and experimenting with stressed skirts, leggings, and hiking boots. She also appears to have a thing for hats.

She was seen sporting black leggings, a button-down denim shirt, a coordinating jacket, and her go-to suede boots. Judging from the images, she was moving with a purpose. \nMalia began her role with the entertainment company on Jan. 30. The pay reportedly is $9.00 per hour. Obama works in the production and development department. \nInsiders say Malia Obama hit the ground running and demonstrated to her bosses that she has an eye for what works. Already, she impresses other associates with her penchant for picking scripts that show production promise. The company’s founder is known for blockbuster projects like Pulp Fiction , Django Unchained , The King’s Speech , and Lion , to name a few.

I think she’s working incredibly hard,” she said. \nMalia returned back to work from a weekend holiday in Aspen, Colorado. She spent the three previous Presidents’ Day weekends at the mountain ski lodge with her sister Sasha Obama and their mom. \nTMZ quipped that Malia Obama was the “ poor ” kid at the table, “just another face on the ultimate rich kids ski trip.” Among her pals were Audrey Kotick, who is the daughter of Activision/Blizzard ( Call of Duty video game) CEO Robert Kotick, and Tassilo von Furstenberg, the grandson of Diane von Furstenberg. \nDuring her outing, Malia mingled with a group of friends on the inside of Cloud 9 Restaurant. Just outside, a group of about 100 others took part in the eatery’s tradition: popping dozens of champagne bottles valued at $125 apiece. Meanwhile, Malia sipped on water, according to insiders. \nMalia’s no newcomer to internships. Two summers ago, she was seen on the set of Halle Berry’s Extant series. Obama worked as a production assistant at the time. Malia Obama attends a state dinner at the White House March 10, 2016 in Washington, D.C.

During an undated interview, Michelle Obama said her daughter expressed an interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry. \nMalia was the subject of “rebellion” rumors during Barack’s term. She was seen at several events “twerking,” reportedly smoking what appeared to be a rolled cigarette, and partying in a room in the presence of a bong . \nMalia doesn’t appear to have any lingering effects from the negative controversy, as insiders report. Instead, all evidence points to Malia moving on with her life after eight years in the public’s eye. \nWhat do you think of Malia Obama’s new style of dress now that she’s out of Washington? \n[Featured Image by Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:24:51.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
