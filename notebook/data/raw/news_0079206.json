I'm trying to come up with something wonderful, but it will come from my heart.\" Photos \nOscars 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals \nPerhaps her lack of preparation is a bit of a superstition. \nDavis has previously lost the Best Supporting Actress award for Doubt in 2008 and the Best Actress award for The Help in 2011, even when the odds were in her favor. \nIn fact, in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel earlier this month, she admitted , \"I've been the odds on favorite to win before and did not. It's devastating; it makes it worse. You're sitting there and you're like, 'OK, I'm the odds-on favorite.' And then your name is not called.\" \nTo further illustrate her point, the How to Get Away With Murder actress said, \"It's like falling from a 100-story building...If you know you're losing, it's like falling from a one-story building.\" \nWe wish her all the luck that she doesn't fall from any metaphorical buildings this year!
