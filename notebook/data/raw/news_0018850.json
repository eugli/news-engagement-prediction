The latest re-imagining to be announced is Terms of Endearment , the movie that originally came out in 1983 that starred Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson and Debra Winger. Over three decades later, Hollywood is apparently ready to give Terms of Endearment an update, as it's being reported that Oprah Winfrey is preparing to board it. \nAccording to The Wrap , Oprah Winfrey is currently in talks to star in a Terms of Endearment remake that's in development at Paramount Pictures. If cast, she would score the role of Aurora Greenway, the character Shirley MacLaine played in the original. Not only that, but Lee Daniels is also being sought out to direct the new movie. Neither Winfrey nor Daniels are officially involved yet, but if both of them work out deals, this will be the first time they've worked together since 2013's The Butler , where Winfrey starred opposite Forest Whitaker. \n1983's Terms of Endearment followed 30 years of a relationship between mother Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) and daughter Emma Greenway-Horton (Debra Winger) as they searched for love and dealt with life's obstacles. Eventually Aurora meets Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), a retired astronaut who lives next door. The cast also included Danny DeVito, Jeff Daniels and John Lithgow. It was nominated for six Golden Globes and won four, and was also nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won five. So yeah, it's safe to say that this is a cinematic classic. Good luck to Lee Daniels or whoever helms the remake trying to make it anywhere near as good as its predecessor. \nAlong with her many other endeavors, Oprah Winfrey has taken the occasional acting role over the last decade. As mentioned earlier, she appeared in The Butler as Gloria Gaines, a role for which she was nominated for multiple awards. In 2014, he played civil rights activist Annie Lee Cooper in Selma . She'll appear later this year as Deborah Lacks in the TV movie The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (which she's also producing), and in 2018, she'll be seen as Mrs. Which in A Wrinkle in Time . Lee Daniels has been keeping himself busy of late with the Fox shows Empire and Star , but he's also still attached to direct the Richard Pryor biopic. \nWe'll keep you updated on how the Terms of Endearment remake is coming along as more news comes in, but in the meantime, let us know what you think of Oprah Winfrey and Lee Daniels potentially being part of it in the comments below.
