Unfortunately, the second-year Tennessee basketball coach has proof that sometimes that's the case. \n\"I know one thing, J.J. Frazier plays really well against us,\" Barnes said of the Georgia senior guard who lit up Thompson-Boling Arena with 29 points to rally his Bulldogs to a win on Feb. 11. \"So maybe the answer to your question is yes.\" \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Frazier, who has totaled 57 points in his last two meetings against the Vols. \nLast time Tennessee (15-12, 7-7 SEC) played Vanderbilt (14-13, 7-7), Bone dropped a career-high 23 points in an 87-75 win at Memorial Gymnasium in Nashville on Jan. 14. \nThe Vols meet the Commodores again on Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.) at Thompson-Boling Arena.

He still doesn’t sustain it the way we need it, but he is definitely trying.\" \nFinding comfort at home of late, Bone has sustained an elite assist-to-turnover ratio. In his last four games at Thompson-Boling Arena, he has 20 assists to just three turnovers. \n\"I think different point guards play the game differently,\" Barnes said. \" Jordan Bone and Lamonte Turner both play the position in different ways. I think what you want is a 3-to-1 ratio, if you can get it, with assists to turnovers. \n\"That is what you like to have because you want those guys to have the ball in their hands as much as possible and anything better would be awesome. I just don’t want guys to turn the ball over.\" \nTennessee has averaged 9.5 turnovers as a team over its last four home games, while averaging 17.8 assists. The ratio over the last two home games, against Missouri and Georgia, has been 19.0 assists to 7.0 turnovers. \n\"As a team (you hope) to keep it under 10 if you can, because turnovers lead to easy baskets for the other team and really hurt you when you are trying to get your defense set,\" Barnes said. \"I do like it as a team when we are sharing the ball and we are assisting on most of our baskets.\" \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
