Since, Christine Baranski has voiced her interest in portraying Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, saying in an interview , “It would seem somewhat logical — we have that strong jawline, don’t we?” Kate McKinnon portrayed DeVos in last week’s Spicer skit.

Sources from O’Donnell’s camp tell Variety that the former talk show host won’t be playing Bannon on “SNL.” Reps for the NBC show declined to comment, persisting that the network doesn’t weigh in on “guest rumors.” \nAside from her trending Twitter photo, O’Donnell has also re-tweeted messages in support of her playing Bannon on “SNL,” in addition to tweeting her praise for Alec Baldwin as Trump (“nobody does it better”), plus the prospect of Baranski playing DeVos. \n“Available — if called i will serve,” she tweeted on Monday about taking on Bannon on “SNL.” available – if called i will serve !!! https://t.co/LT84EJjfsw \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 \nO’Donnell and Trump have had a longstanding, public feud.
