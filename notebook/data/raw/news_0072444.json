They also have full authority to initiate removal proceedings against any alien who is subject to removal under any provision of the (Immigration and Nationality Act).\"\nThe young people brought to the country as children who are part of President Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program (DACA) may be safe. For now.\nBut their parents are fair game.\nAnd just about everyone else.\nThe plan is to hire thousands of new enforcement officers.\nAnd to build new detention centers.\nThe law allows us to do this. It is up to us, to those we elect, to differentiate between what we CAN do and what we SHOULD do.\nThe administration could have chosen a humane path, o ne that would not have transformed a mother like Garcia de Rays into a modern-day Rosa Parks. \nInstead, they chose mass deportation.\nThey chose goon squads and gulags.\nWelcome to the police state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:58:01.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
