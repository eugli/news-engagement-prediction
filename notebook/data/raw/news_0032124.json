Their record against City isn't great either, losing all three of their Premier League meetings and conceding 13 goals in the process. \nThe game kicks off at 8pm tonight and we'll be with you all evening to bring you team news, match action and all the reaction and analysis afterwards. Which TV channel is Bournemouth vs Man City on? \nBournemouth vs Manchester City will be shown live on Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 1 HD from 7pm on Monday, February 13. \nKick-off from the Vitality Stadium is at 8pm. \nYou can also follow all the action on our live right here. 18:37 Stuart Brennan Close affair \nFollowing on from my colleague Ciaran Kelly’s post about Eddie Howe’s programme notes, I love the shorthand that Eddie uses. \nHe said their games against City have been “challenging” which is a euphemism for “We got leathered every time” - their three meetings since promotion have ended 5-1, 4-0 and 4-0. \nBut that kind of run rarely lasts long, especially in the Premier League, and tonight’s affair should be a lot closer given the Cherries’ home record against top clubs this season. \nBut City DO play with more freedom away from home, and of they get going they can bury teams in a 20-minute period, as they showed at West Ham and West Brom this season. 18:30 Ciaran Kelly Looks in City's favour \nBournemouth have a pretty miserable record against Manchester City - conceding 13 goals in their last three league encounters. \nBut Cherries boss Eddie Howe will hope his side can summon the spirit that got positive results against both Liverpool and Arsenal here at the compact Vitality Stadium. \nWriting in his programme notes, he said: ‘Matches against Manchester City in our recent history have been challenging but equally we have learnt a great deal from each experience. \n‘Tonight will be another opportunity to see what progress we have made from those previous encounters.’ 18:18 \nGabriel Jesus or Aguero? The debate continues. 18:10 \nLooking ahead quickly to Saturday’s FA Cup game the officials have been announced. \nAnthony Taylor is the man who will be reffing. \nHe’s the guy who took charge of City’s game against Chelsea when Aguero and Fernandinho were sent off. \nAnd John Stones thought City were slightly unfairly treated, he said: “I don’t want to say too much and get in trouble for saying things but I think we have ended up on the bad side of what happened.” 18:02", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:02:33.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
