Source: AAP \nWHAT THE AUSTRALIANS ARE ALREADY MAKING \nWhatever happens on Monday, there already Australians who will make a killing in this year’s IPL. \nOver $10 million has been promised to Australian talent this season, with 17 players retained by their clubs from last season. \nFive Australians — Shane Watson, James Faulkner, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith, David Warner — have locked down contracts worth more than $1 million, with Watson leading the way with a $1.85 million deal with Royal Challengers Bangalore. \nCheck out the IPL bid prices of all the retained Australian players: \nMillionaires’ Club ($6,620,000) \nShane Watson — $1.85 million (Royal Challengers Bangalore) \nJames Faulkner — $1.46 million (Gujarat Lions) \nGlenn Maxwell — $1.17 million (Kings XI Punjab) \nSteve Smith — $1.07 million (Rising Pune Supergiants) \nDavid Warner — $1.07 million (Sunrisers Hyderabad) \nSix-Figure Club ($3,281,000) \nMitchell Starc — $973,000 (Royal Challengers Bangalore) \nMitchell Marsh — $935,000 (Rising Pune Supergiants) \nShaun Marsh — $428,000 (Kings XI Punjab) \nChris Lynn — $253,000 (Kolkata Knight Riders) \nUsman Khawaja — $195,000 (Rising Pune Supergiants) \nMoises Henriques — $195,000 (Sunrisers Hyderabad) \nAaron Finch — $195,000 (Gujarat Lions) \nMarcus Stoinis — $107,000 (Kings XI Punjab) \nFive-Figure Club ($349,000) \nBen Cutting — $97,000 (Sunrisers Hyderabad) \nAndrew Tye — $97,000 (Gujarat Lions) \nTravis Head — $97,000 (Royal Challengers Bangalore) \nAdam Zampa — $58,000 (Rising Pune Supergiants) \nTotal: $10,025,000 Shane Watson has a $1.85 million contract. Source: AFP \nTHE BIGGEST EARNERS IN THE COMPETITION \nRemarkably, Watson’s salary is nowhere near being the biggest in the competition. \nSeven players have garnered contracts worth $2.43 million, with South Africa’s David Miller the only foreign player on the list. \nUnsurprisingly, both Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni are among the seven. \nCheck out the IPL bid prices for the biggest earners in the competition: \nMS Dhoni (Rising Pune Supergiants) \nSuresh Raina (Gujarat Lions) \nDavid Miller (Kings XI Punjab) \nGautam Gambhir (Kolkata Knight Riders) \nRohit Sharma (Mumbai Indians) \nVirat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bangalore) \nShikhar Dhawan (Sunrisers Hyderabad) Between the two of them, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni will make $4.86 million this season. Source: Getty Images \nWHO HAS WHAT TO SPEND \nKings XI Punjab have approximately $4.52 million available to them for the auction despite only releasing four players from the squad they had last year. \nHaving released Johnson after a lacklustre season, Kings XI could go after a new star fast bowler. \nThe Delhi Daredevils have the next most to spend — roughly $4.17 million — and could invest in overseas talent. The Daredevils need cover for the South African trio of JP Duminy, Quinton de Kock and Chris Morris, who are all likely to leave the competition early for national duty. \nSunrisers Hyderabad are the only other side with more than $4 million ($4.04 million) to spend. Sunrisers have released six players from the squad that took them to the title last year. It wouldn’t be the worst idea for them to chase a batsman to compliment David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan. The openers were the only Hyderabad players to finish in the top 25 run-scorers last season. \nThe Kolkata Knight Riders have $3.82 million to spend and are likely use much of it on overseas players, having released six foreign stars and lost Andre Russell to an anti-doping violation. Replacing Russell’s power-hitting and quality bowling will be top of the agenda. \nHaving finished second-last in their debut season, Rising Pune Supergiants have $3.70 million to make things right this year. Pune badly need to beef up their arsenal of fast bowlers. \nThe Gujarat Lions also debuted last year and finished the regular season atop the ladder. They have $2.78 million to spend and should use most of it on Indian talent as they already have six overseas players in their squad. \nBoasting the tournament’s most powerful batting order, — Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Watson — Royal Challengers Bangalore made it all the way to the final last year. Aside from Mitchell Starc, they are short any real star power in their bowling attack so they could spend a large chunk of their $2.48 million here. \nThe Mumbai Indians have $2.24 million available to them. A quality quick to cover for the injury prone Lasith Malinga would make sense. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Johnson are both hoping to score big deals on Monday. Source: FOX SPORTS \nTOURNAMENT SCHEDULE \nThe tournament kicks off on March 2, with MS Dhoni’s Supergiants taking on Kohli’s Bangalore. \nEach of the eight sides will play each other twice, with the top four at the end of the regular season making the finals. \nThe top two teams face each other in a qualifier, with the winner going through to the final. \nThe loser of the qualifier then takes on the winner of an eliminator between third and fourth. The winner of that match goes through to the final, which will take place on May 22 in Hyderabad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:51:12.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
