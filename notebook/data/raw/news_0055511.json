They're very impressive, but as mom and fitness blogger Adrienne Osuna proves, numbers often don't mean a thing. This mother of four struggled with her weight for years before getting serious about her health, adopting a rigorous schedule of power lifting and cardio to gain muscle and a sizable following.

It shows her before she started lifting and after — an impressive physical transformation that resulted in a staggering one pound weight loss.

Osuna's pic was copied from her blog and blew up all over the Internet — on Facebook, Twitter, Imgur , and more — without giving her credit.

And it wasn't a vanity thing, but rather that the Internet can stink and her picture was being used in advertisements for weight loss products, which she's never used.
