If they have already applied as a refugee in the U.S. before showing up at a border port in Canada, and have no blood relatives here, they are turned away. But if a person crosses into Canada somewhere else and applies as a refugee, the case is heard by Canadian authorities. \nThe Canadian government has so far resisted pressure since Trump’s election to repeal the agreement. \nAlthough there’s nothing new about people skirting official border crossings to get into Canada, more people are resorting to this option in the Trump era, said Noor. \nOften travellers will arrange rides in Minneapolis and get dropped off hours later near the border in North Dakota, where drivers tell them “goodbye and good luck,” he said \nThe Minnesota State Demographic Center says the state is home to almost one-third of the total U.S. Somali population. As of 2015, as many as 65,000 were born in the East African country or had parents from there. People in the community cite higher numbers. \nREAD MORE: Toronto doctor helps refugees fleeing U.S. for asylum in Canada \nMany were jolted by comments Trump made at a Minneapolis campaign rally two days before the November election. He told supporters the state had “suffered enough” from bringing in Somali refugees. \n“That scared a lot of people who really wanted to vote for him in the beginning,” said Abdirizak Bihi, director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. \nThe concern has only intensified since the administration’s attempted crackdown last month on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. Though the ban has been blocked in court, there is still much confusion. \n“That affected every Somali-American house,” said Cali, who came to the United States more than 20 years ago. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump to unveil new travel ban next week \nNonetheless, he said, the U.S. remains the “greatest country in the world” and he hasn’t lost hope that it will remain a haven for refugees. \nLawyers with local not-for-profits began have begun holding free weekly legal clinics at a community centre in a neighbourhood just outside downtown that has a big Somali population. An interfaith coalition is opening up places of worship as sanctuaries. \nAbdinasir Abdulahi, an immigration lawyer in Minneapolis, said there was interest in Canada as an alternative before Trump’s inauguration, and it has only picked up since then. \nThe contrast between the Trump administration and the Trudeau government’s “open-arm signals” has not been lost on those looking to flee strife in their homelands, said Abdulahi, who practised law in Ethiopia before moving to the U.S. two decades ago. \n“I think the rumour and word of mouth has spread around the community that Canada is a viable alternative to go.” © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:11:55.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
