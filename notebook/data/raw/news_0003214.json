The former had started throwing torches and ice atpoliceand otherprotesters, which led to several people ending up with head injuries .

The law also implies that thousands of prison sentences will be commuted especially those of politicians sentenced for corruption and misappropriating millions in public funds.\nAnticorruption expert Laura tefan told VICERomania that\"the main beneficiary of this law is Liviu Dragnea,\"the leader of the current ruling partyPSD.Dragnea wasconvicted oforganising electoral fraud in the 2012 presidential impeachmentreferendum, and this new lawwill absolve him of thatcrimeandallow him to return to public office.\n\n\nHooligans setfire to plastic objects around Victoriei Square in Romania.

Photo by Rzvan Bltreu\nRomanians have been protesting thesespecial government decrees for over two weeks. Because of the unrest, government officials were wary of discussing the law during a normal legislative session and passed iton Tuesday night during what wasannounced asadebate on the national budget.\nThat same night, about 15,000 people gathered in the cold in front of the seat of the government in Bucharestto protest. WhenFlorin Iordache the minister of Justice wasasked in a press conference that eveningwhy this law was passed so quickly, he refused to answer andasked if there were any other questions.\n\nPhoto by Ioana Epure\nOn Wednesday, ten timesas many people as on Tuesday gathered together in Bucharest. But Romanians in other cities in the country and around Europe(like Berlin , London , Paris and Brussels ) took to the streets, too, bringing the estimated total number of protesters to 300,000 .These protests are the largestthe country has seen in 20 years.Several European leaders have warned the Romanian government thatbacktracking on corruption will hurt the country. Unfortunately, so far, thatdoesn't seem to havemade much of an impression.\n\nMore on VICE: \nI Played Illegal Pool with Mobsters in Communist Romania \nRomanian Hospital Update: A Doctor Filmed Maggots Crawling Out of a Patient's Wounds \nBeing Gay Is Beautiful in Bucharest", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:42:40.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
