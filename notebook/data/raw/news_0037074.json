On your site, be sure to include a wholesale tab so people know you offer that. Include a contact form for stores to fill out with details about themselves -- information that allows you to send line sheets if you think they’d be a good fit. \nOnce you’ve started to gain stores, you can also put a list or a map in where people can find your product in store locations. \nReach out to local buyers. Now that you’ve set your terms and have your line sheets ready, start with local companies where you see a fit for your brand.

However, to cite my personal experience, I found that, as my company grew, it was harder to track down orders and checks on a consignment basis so today we do orders only. \nAttend trade shows. Trade shows are an investment, but can be a big ticket to lots of stores and major retailers. As a fashion brand, we attend America’s Mart and Accessories the Show. Stores come to your booth and learn more about the products and write orders at the show (if they like your products). \nRelated: 4 Ways to Get Your Product on the Shelves at Whole Foods \nOnce you’ve secured stores, help them sell your product. The more they can sell, the more they will buy from you. Offer display materials or even Skype-in to their sales staff and talk about major selling points. Create a newsletter list for just your stores so you can cater your communication and news about your company to their language.
