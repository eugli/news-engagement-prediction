That’s nothing new, though. Katy always crushes it. REX/Shutterstock \nPrior to her performance, the star took to Instagram, saying, \nTonight, I’ll be making it rain Yorkshire puddings.. so ya, don’t miss it! \nHere’s her Instagram post. Believe the hype. \nIt turns out she was 100 percent correct. She shut the stage all the way down! \nHowever, there was one tiny, little fuck-up in her performance that had nothing to do with her… Do you recall the time “Left Shark” was born during Katy’s Super Bowl XLIX halftime show performance? Giphy \nYeah, those dance moves were WAY off. Well, this is similar to that. One of Katy Perry’s backup dancers has struck fame yet again after a giant flub at the Brit Awards. The dancer, dressed up as a little house, accidentally fell off the stage during the show.
