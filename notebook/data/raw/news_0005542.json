Perusing the antique furniture stalls of Paris flea markets. Although there was no mention of sharing avocado toast at brunch, the reports swirling around Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky’s recent escapades are adding up to sound like a budding romance. Yes, that’s right: The supermodel-cum-clotheshorse and hip-hop’s most fashion-obsessed star have been photographed flitting about between New York, Paris, and Miami in recent weeks, flirting along what appears to be a whirlwind and endless string of transcontinental shopping trips. It’s the stuff of a fashion girl’s dream: dating a man who not only finds your voracious appetite for clothing a turn-on, but for whom shopping represents the ultimate bonding experience. \nBecause, quite frankly, it really is. Perusing a store for new arrivals can help you learn so much about bae’s interests, tastes, and endearing quirks than a dating profile ever could. Observe as he lingers over cashmere knit sweaters, perhaps checking the label for fiber contents or to determine whether it’s truly fair trade. Perhaps he knows his pant size and doesn’t even need to try on a new pair before making a purchase. Is he an impulse buyer? A sneakerhead? Is he a jewelry fanatic like yourself? Can he actually pull off man jewelry? Wait, do you guys share the same jean size? \nOf all the numerous revelations a routine shopping trip can unearth, learning that you can combine wardrobes with your rakish beloved may prove most illuminating. Who knows if Kendall and A$AP have tapped into each other’s designer-laden arsenal just yet, but a man willing to part with, say, his Raf Simons collection is a man worth keeping around, if you ask us. Cropped Dior furs are his and hers, and diamond necklaces are practically interchangeable. Imagine all the Japanese selvage denim one could borrow or perfectly oversize flannels: The fashion connection between romantic partners may certainly pale in comparison to such virtues as trust and fidelity, but quickly an intimacy is built. After all, you’re quite literally bringing someone into your space and sharing a piece of yourself. In so many ways, borrowing a boyfriend’s perfectly worn-in moto jacket becomes a fashion statement and a vestige of your love. \nSo don’t feel guilty when you scour his closet and swipe his Marcelo Burlon track shorts or Thom Browne bucket hat. Just calmly explain it’s like having a little piece of him all around. If he’s still not buying it, don’t discourage him from layering up with your T By Alexander Wang striped knit turtleneck, while you snuggle deep into his Richardson “Stay With Me” sweatshirt. It’s bound to bring you two closer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:09:59.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
