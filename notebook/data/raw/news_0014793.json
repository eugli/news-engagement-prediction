He is not done yet... \"Anybody waiting for my downfall would be swimming in more troubles that time. My name is Peter ‘The Rock’. The man God promised he would build Ekiti and Nigeria on his shoulder. \nGovernor Ayo Fayose rides on okada to inspect projects (Twitter) \"Watch the turn of events. Some people say it is because I enjoy immunity. Don’t other governors enjoy immunity? It is dependent on who you are. They plotted to manipulate the judiciary against me, it didn’t work. The House of Assembly dominated by the All Progressives Congress members attempted to remove me, it didn’t work. \"The God that put me here does not sleep nor slumber. The God would not allow me to fall into the traps of my enemies. \"Many things would happen in this country that would amaze Nigerians,\" he added.
