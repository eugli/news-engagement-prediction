It would be so special,” he admitted.\n“I’ve never been to watch Arsenal, because I was with Gillingham as a kid and then since I was 16 I’ve been playing football every Saturday...so to play against them would be unbelievable, wouldn’t it!\n“Imagine. The first time I see them live in person is when I’m playing against them. It would be incredible.”\nRaggett celebrates his winner - and now gets a taste of Arsenal (Photo: Clive Brunskill) The Gunners still have to get past Sutton of course, and Lincoln keeper Paul Farman believes his side have shown an upset is possible, by becoming the first non-league team in the quarter final in 103 years.\n“Sutton are a good team. They are a big side which might trouble Arsenal. If they have worked like us this week then they stand a chance,” he said.\nBut if the Gunners do get through, then Lincoln will go to the Emirates in front of a massive TV audience with the chance to make history by reaching Wembley - and their manager Danny Cowley insists it is eminently possible for his side now.\nCowley is facing a trip to the Emirates - or Gander Green Lane (Photo: Clive Brunskill) “You never know in football do you? Who would have thought as a non league team starting out in the fourth qualifying round we would have got this far,” he said.\n“We have a unique style for Premier League teams and that’s what we worked on against Burnley. The way we play is very different so we present different problems.\n“Against one of the big ones we will try to put a game-plan together that uses our strengths - they will not be used to playing a side like us.”\nWhile Lincoln’s physical approach will most certainly upset the Gunners, the draw still offered the enticing prospect of north London v Manchester semi final draw, with United, City, Spurs and Arsenal kept apart in the last eight.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Lincoln fans celebrate FA Cup draw Share this video Watch Next poll loading Will Lincoln City make the SEMI-FINALS of the FA Cup? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Arsenal FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Arsenal FC Lincoln City Football Club Emirates FA Cup draw Arsenal FC", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1071/4221396001_5329184814001_5329167129001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:36:57.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
