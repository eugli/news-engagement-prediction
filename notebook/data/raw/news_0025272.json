Wonder no more! \nWhether it's the political climate, personal factors or employment opportunities, many families decide on a stint overseas, both in temporary or permanent capacities. If you're considering a move far away, then you might want to consult the findings of a recent survey done by InterNations - a network for people who live and work overseas. \nThe Family Life Index is a subcategory within a much larger survey around quality of expat life and 45 countries were canvassed according to four further subsections that were identified as most important to families; Availability of Childcare and Education, Costs of Childcare and Education, Quality of Education and Family Well-Being. \nTo be counted, each country required a minimum of 31 expat responders, who had children in their care and gave evaluations on health, well-being, education and safety. The results were averaged out, giving each country a ranking of overall quality of life for families living overseas. 123RF \nA new survey has revealed many consider Finland the best country to live in when raising little ones. \nTOP TEN: \nFinland rose to the number one spot from being number two the previous year, coming out top in every subcategory but one - Family Well-Being - in which it came fourth. 123RF \nThe Czech Republic is a beautiful place to raise a family. \nInterNations reported, \"Not one expat parent has something negative to say about children's health, children's safety, or children's well-being in Finland,\" and \"...an impressive 70 per cent say the quality of education there is excellent compared to the global average of just 21 per cent.\" The Czech Republic rose to second place having dipped out of the previous year's survey due to not enough responders, and placing 15th in 2014. Survey participants report wide availability and affordability of childcare and schooling, despite opinions on the quality of these being lower than other nations. \nThe countries which have fallen the most in ranking are Bahrain - now ranked 22nd from 8th the previous year; Spain - down from 12th place last year to 26th this year and Denmark, which has fallen from 11th last year to come in at 23rd. \nThose toppled from their high perches are Austria - down to fourth place from first place the year before - and Sweden from third to fifth place. Factors include Sweden's falling school academic results and Austria's less than friendly approach to families. \nThe very lowest scorers, in positions 44 and 45 respectively, were Saudi Arabia and Brazil. InterNations reveals those nations climbing the ladder in terms of quality of life for families; Belgium, Norway and South Korea all made significant leaps in their rankings, with Belgium making the most headway at number 9 this year, up from 24th place the previous year. \nTo see the full InterNations report with all 45 rankings and some further dissection of the results, click here . - essentialkids.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:46:33.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
