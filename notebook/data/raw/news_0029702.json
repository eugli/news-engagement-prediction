Daily Edition Veteran Group to Air Anti-Trump Commercial During Alec Baldwin-Hosted 'SNL' Episode 3:32 PM PST 2/11/2017 by Patrick Shanley COMMENTS Getty Images VoteVets, a \"political action committee\", tweet a video of their ad confirming they had bought adspace on tonight's episode. \nAlec Baldwin's impression of Donald Trump will not be the only jabs taking at the president during the upcoming episode of Saturday Night Live . \nVoteVets , an organization that claims its mission is to use public issue campaigns to give a voice to veterans on matters of national security, veterans' care, and every day issues\" and boasts the support of over 500,000 veterans, announced on its Twitter Saturday that they will be airing an ad on tonight's episode of SNL . \nThe ad features a man performing squats in a weight rack while the camera pulls out, revealing he is a veteran and an amputee who has lost one of his legs. Over the video, the veteran reads the following message: \n\"President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows. Here’s what I do every morning. Look, you lost the popular vote, you’re having trouble drawing a crowd and your approval rating keeps sinking. But kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off their health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act, and banning Muslims, won’t help. That’s not the America I sacrificed for. You want to be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one.\" \nThe organization also called on Trump on being vocal on social media following previous SNL broadcasts. \"Trump can't resist watching @nbcsnl, and tonight a combat wounded Afghanistan vet will speak to him in our latest ad,\" VoteVets tweeted.
