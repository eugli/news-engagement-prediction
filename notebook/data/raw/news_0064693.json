The state legislature proposed the other options in case others are deemed unconstitutional or become unavailable. \n“States have been having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs within the United States primarily because the American pharmaceutical manufacturers have uniformly said they don’t want their medicines used in killing prisoners,” said Robert Dunham, Director of the Death Penalty Information Center. \nThe options do not permit condemned prisoners to choose their execution method. The alternative methods are available only if the lethal injection is not available with gas chamber being the second option and electrocution the last. \nAccording to Dunham, other states have also turned to alternative ways to carry out death sentences. He notes Utah and Oklahoma have added death by firing squad as an alternate to lethal injection and Tennessee has authorized the use of the electric chair. Death by firing squad in Utah is only available to those sentenced to death prior to 2004. In all 31 states that allow the death penalty, the primary method for executions is lethal injection. \nDunham said he expects legal challenges to the most recent change in the proposed bill. The state currently faces legal challenges surrounding the drugs it uses for lethal injection executions. Opponents say the use of the drugs violate the U.S. Constitution. \nThe Magnolia State previously used the electric chair and gas chamber to execute violent criminals. Lethal injection became the state’s sole means of execution in March of 1998, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Mississippi’s most recent execution was carried out in 2012 and there are currently 47 people on death row in the state. \nThe bill will now move to the full state senate for consideration and will have to be sent back the house for approval of the amended changes before being passed on to the governor. \nWillie James Inman is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Jackson, Mississippi.
