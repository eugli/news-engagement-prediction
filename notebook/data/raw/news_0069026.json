A Welsh MP is petitioning the European Parliament to take action over Brexit. \nAnn Clwyd, the Labour MP for Cynon Valley, wants MEPs to allow UK citizens to vote on any Brexit deal after negotiations are concluded. \nShe is also calling for protections to be put in place for UK citizens working in EU countries and EU citizens working here. \nThe UK government has been asked for a response. \nMs Clwyd said: \"If a majority of the European Parliament don't like it they can in effect veto negotiations. I think that's a very big power.\" \nUnder Article 227 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union any citizen can petition the European Parliament. \nShe added: \"When the true implications of withdrawal are known a lot of people will change their minds.\" \nMs Clwyd is also urging MEPs to invite Prime Minister Theresa May to address them. \nShe said: \"The referendum was advisory and we should have looked at the advice, but still properly considered the implications of leaving the EU, which weren't clear to any of us - elected politicians didn't know.\" \n\"We here in the UK parliament are still finding out about it. We know, just in the last few days, we may have to pay an enormous bill if we exit the EU.\" \nShe said they can discuss the negotiations and vote on the impact on the UK. \nLeaving the EU would be detrimental to the Cynon Valley and the rest of Wales, she added.
