Why did it take so long? \"Jeet ka mantra hai break the glass ceiling Urvasi.\" Scroll Staff Published 19 minutes ago. \nFor 22 years, composer A R Rahman’s Urvasi Urvasi has been an anthem to “take it easy” for Indians. The Tamil song from the film Kadhalan (1994) has been dubbed into Hindi and Telugu, and got updated lyrics recently to factor in, among other things, demonetisation. \nNow, we have a feminist narrative for Urvasi, commissioned by the human rights organisationBreakthrough.

Play \nThe original song did become immense popular, however, with American hip hop artist Will.i.am and singer Cody Wise even recreating it as It’s My Birthday , which topped the UK charts in 2014.
