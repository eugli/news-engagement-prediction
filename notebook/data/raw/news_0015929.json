However, that didn't stop progressive veteran organization VoteVets.org from directly addressing Trump in a television ad now airing (in fact, it's probably the very reason their ad is so direct). VoteVets said in a statement that they decided to debut the advertisement on MSNBC's Morning Joe Monday morning to try and catch the President's attention — because Trump reportedly obsesses over the show.\nThe spot features a veteran who lost his leg in combat in Afghanistan, and starts by addressing the President's current standing in ways that are sure to needle him: his record low approval ratings, inability to draw crowds (unless they're protesting), and his loss of the popular vote during the 2016 election. The ad notes that Trump's recent actions, including his controversial immigration executive order and his agenda to repeal the Affordable Care Act , illustrate a disconnect from — and a lack of respect for, VoteVets argues — many of the veterans Trump had frequently promised to help on the campaign trail (with his 10-point Veterans Affairs reform , for example).\nFor example, the decision to repeal the ACA could leave veterans who do not quality for health coverage under the Department of Veterans Affairs without any insurance. Salon also points out that the loss of the ACA means that the requirement for mental health coverage by insurance companies could disappear, leaving a large population of veterans without care.\n\"You want to be a legitimate President, Mr. Trump?\" the ad concludes, \"[then] act like one.\" VoteVets vice chair and Navy veteran Peter Kauffman also said that the original debut was just the start of a concentrated effort to draw the President's attention. \"He’s going to hear the message of this ad again and again,\" said Kauffman. \"We’re officially putting Mr. Trump on notice.\"\nFollow Braelyn on Instagram and Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/braelyninbrooklyn", "https://twitter.com/MayaAlena", "https://twitter.com/votevets", "http://www.votevets.org/", "http://www.salon.com/2017/02/06/votevets-calls-out-president-trump-by-name-you-want-to-be-a-legitimate-president-then-act-like-one/", "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/veterans-affairs-reform"], "published": "2017-02-07T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:23:44.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
