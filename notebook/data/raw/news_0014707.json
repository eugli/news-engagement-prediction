Some Twitter users noticed the resemblance to the cartoon’s animated Lady Gaga who flew over the crowd while tied to a helicopter – much like Gaga’s air-bound entrance onto stage with a harness Sunday night (2/5) for the big game. The lights in the background are also incredibly similar. \nEven the outfits look alike! Well -- except for bra that shoots fire! \nOf course, there are some skeptics who feel that maybe “The Simpsons” didn’t predict the future, but rather, inspired it. Either way, I think we all agreed that there was no way the cartoon just guessed Donald Trump was going to be president one day! These \"predictions\" are getting crazy, right?! Remember when \"The Simpsons\" totally predicted Lady Gaga's #SuperBowl halftime set? https://t.co/IjLeVJLyeM pic.twitter.com/tdXl3uddcu ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:42:45.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
