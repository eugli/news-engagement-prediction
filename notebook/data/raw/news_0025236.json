It was an era to remember, the release of Ferrari's first mid engine V6, we had the V12 Daytona and lastly but not least the rare example known as the Dino 246 'Chairs & Flares'. \nNo ordinary Australian delivered car, this story starts in the heart of Maranello Italy. Here we have this curvaceous, rustic, beauty. A tourist delivery collected from the Ferrari factory and driven 1257 kms across the twist and turns of the unforgiving but exhilarating hills of Modena. \nFast forward 44 years and once again, this classic Italian beauty has sent a young Australian across borders to follow his dream. This car just draws you to it. It's like an unspoken siren of the sea. It's taken us all the way to 85kms out of Melbourne CBD, to a countryside barn, where it had been in a slumber for 27 years! \nWhat a discovery. \nA completely original, untouched, spartan example of one of the most rarest Ferrari Dino 246 'Chairs & Flairs' in existence. What can I say. Wow. One of only 22 right hand drives , and the only Oro Chiaro (Italian for Gold) in the world. And doesn't it feel opulent. \nWe can't wait to take this beauty for a ride. \nTo continue this story, and bring this unicorn to life on the streets of Sydney, click on the YouTube box below. \nThis article is written by Lecha Khouri at Supercar Advocates, filmed in Melbourne & Sydney, Australia.
