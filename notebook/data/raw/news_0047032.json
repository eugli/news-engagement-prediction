Oleksandr Klymenko / Reuters \n\"On Feb. 20, the ceasefire regime will start, and withdrawal of heavy military hardware will also start to the places where they are supposed to be,\" Lavrov said Saturday after the talks at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, which was attended by various world leaders. \n\"We have actively supported this decision and obviously expressed a conviction that this time, failure should not be allowed to take place,\" he said. \nIt was unclear whose \"military hardware\" Lavrov was talking about — Ukraine's or that belonging to the Russian-backed separatists — and what territory they would be moved to, as the Russian and Ukrainian governments dispute the territorial lines. \nRelated: Ukraine Fears That Putin Will 'Step Forward' if Trump Pulls Back \nWhile the specifics of the deal remain murky, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told reporters minutes before Lavrov's statement that he was \"not at all\" pleased with the conclusion of Saturday's meeting, Reuters reported. \nHe added that the so-called Normandy format — which consists of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France — formed no \"powerful results.\" Foreign Ministers of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin, France Jean-Marc Ayrault, Russia Sergey Lavrov and Germany Sigmar Gabriel pose for a photograph during the 53rd Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2017. Sven Hopp / Reuters \nIn a separate event in Munich, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke about the long conflict in Ukraine and lamented that the Minsk Protocol — brokered in September 2014 to halt the armed conflict in the Donbass region — had not been followed by the Russian-backed separatists. \nThe agreement aimed to end fighting in the disputed area of Ukraine. \n\"The Minsk agreement is the only channel we have to bring a solution to this conflict,\" Merkel said. \"The Minsk agreement started on the assumption that there was a road map, but when it was enacted there was no continuous ceasefire.\" \nNATO allies laid the consequences of the conflicts at the feet of Russia, which has claimed no responsibility for the separatist activities, although it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014. Most nations, including European Union members and the United States, do not recognize Crimea as a part of the Russian state. \nA Ukrainian hacker group named Cyber Hunta also published a gigabyte's worth of emails from the office of one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's top aides that shows conclusive evidence that Russia was actively engaged in supporting the separatist movement in Ukraine. \nSince then, European nations have grown increasingly alarmed by Russia's use of force along its western border.
