Source: News Limited \n“This is an 18-year-old man ready and willing to play top class football, and he blows it all.” \nThe court was told Sharp began using cocaine while playing for the Eagles and that he also experimented with ice. \nIn a report submitted to the court, Sharp said he used cocaine as a way to fit-in with his new teammates. \n“I had to use cocaine,” he said. \n“I thought it was a way to get in with the boys, so I used coke.” \nKilduff said Sharp was dragged into the scene by influential senior West Coast players. \nThe Herald Sun reported in 2015 that Sharp was smoking $200 worth of ice per day when he committed the robbery in December, 2014. \nAfter his arrest, Sharp told police he had been using the drug on and off for 10 years. \nWhen asked if he was using more ice at the time of the robbery, Sharp told them his habit had always been large. \n“Probably about the same really,’’ he told police. \nSharp featured in Cousins’ tell-all book Ben Cousins: My Life Story in 2010. \nIn it, Cousins said he used his last phone call to ring Sharp after he’d been arrested outside Crown while off his face.

So any player who is a member of the PA can ring in and access our services, confidentially and free. More and more players are doing that. The guys who are doing it very tough from a hardship perspective, we have a fund set up to help players when they need help in that space. Once again the numbers are growing and we’re getting referrals from former teammates.” Daniher's 40m wrong foot bomb 0:29", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:11:01.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
