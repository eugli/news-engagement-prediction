When I got home I thought someone threw meat, but my brother said it’s babies and I didn’t believe him till I got out of the car and called the cops.” \nPolice spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana, confirmed the incident and urged anyone with info to step forward. \n“A concealment of birth case has been opened for investigation after the owner of a house in Station Road found three foetuses in her the driveway. No one has been arrested as yet. \n“Anyone with information that can assist with the investigation is requested to contact Goodwood SAPS on 021 592 4430 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.” \nSome people called Sadia insensitive for posting the photos. \nBut she said she did it in the hope of catching the culprits. \nShe replied: “Something like this cannot be left unseen. Whoever dumped these souls in the road, no matter what situation they are in, gives no right to leave them on the streets and luckily we came in time or cars who have smashed them... \" Daily Voice ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:26:59.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
