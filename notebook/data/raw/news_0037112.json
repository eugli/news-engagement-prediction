The career officials voiced concern that Tillerson, a former CEO of ExxonMobil who has no previous government experience, either doesn't understand or appreciate the work of the State Department and won't be a forceful advocate for the agency with the White House. On his first day in office earlier this month, Tillerson commended the thousands of career diplomats and civil service officers worldwide. \"I am honored to be serving alongside each of you,\" the 64-year-old Texan said. \"State Department staffers in the field are not just conduits for policies and plans, you are our emissaries of our nation and the ideals we stand for. When people see you, they see America.\" But he also struck a CEO-like tone at one point, saying he would be looking to reform the agency to make it more efficient. \"Change for the sake of change can be counterproductive, and that will never be my approach,\" he told them. \"But we cannot sustain ineffective traditions over optimal outcomes.\" The move comes on the heels of a purge last month of the top management leaders at the State Department. The move left Tillerson with a huge hole at the State Department after the departure of the officials, who had a combined 150 years of institutional experience. Kenney's departure leaves Tillerson, who came to the State Department with only a handful of aides, a bare-bones staff as he seeks to assert his role in the administration as America's top diplomat. Chief among them is Tom Shannon, the former undersecretary for political affairs who served as acting secretary before Tillerson was confirmed. He is now serving as acting deputy secretary. Elliot Abrams, Tillerson's top choice to be his deputy, was rejected by Trump after the President learned that the former deputy national security adviser had criticized him during the campaign. No replacement has yet been named. Sections ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T22:18:30.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
