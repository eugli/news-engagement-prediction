Canterbury District Health Board chief executive David Meates is asking people to plan ahead. \nMajor events being held in Christchurch this week may make access to the city's main hospital challenging. \nCanterbury District Health Board (CDHB) chief executive David Meates​ said work with Christchurch Transport Operations Centre (CTOC) to mitigate the effect of heavy traffic and road closures this week has been under way for a month. \nEvents on Tuesday and Wednesday include the Bruce Springsteen concert at AMI Stadium, public and private Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial openings, and an international one-day cricket match at Hagley Oval. \nThe closure of Montreal St and Whiteleigh Ave will further exacerbate traffic delays. \nREAD MORE: * Christchurch Marathon causes panic as patients race to hospital \nA eTXT service with traffic updates would be available for key on-duty staff, and those who did get stuck in traffic would be able to phone the CDHB and be put through to the Major Events Operations Centre for help getting to the hospital, a CDHB spokeswoman said. \nMeates said staff, key managers and midwives would be informed about possible delays and people were being asked to plan ahead . \nTraffic information and updates would be included in daily staff emails to ensure they were informed and could make alternative arrangements if necessary, he said. \nCollege of Midwives Canterbury West-Coast chairwoman Kelly Dorgan​ said an email to staff on Monday did not include information about additional assistance for those stuck in traffic or the eTXT service. \n\"We're the ones, apart from emergency services, that have to get there, and get women there urgently.\" Ad Feedback \nShe said about 100 babies were born at Christchurch Women's Hospital every week, so it was likely some women would go into labour during the two days of traffic issues. \nThe CDHB issued more advice about its contingency plan to midwives later on Monday following inquiries from Stuff. \nIn 2015, several hospital staff, ambulances, patients and a woman in labour were among those stuck at an intersection near Christchurch Hospital for up to an hour during the Christchurch Marathon. \nA review of the event resulted in a changed route for the marathon and the establishment of an operations centre for emergency services, event and traffic operations. \nParking near Christchurch Hospital is in scant supply while construction of the CDHB's Acute Services Building is under way. \nThere is no public car parking at the hospital and visitors have to either take their chances with on-street parking or private car parks, or use the CDHB's park and ride service which operates from Deans Ave.​ - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:47:50.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
