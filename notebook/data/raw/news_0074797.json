Fatimat Raji-Rasaki, representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District in the Senate, has declared that Sen. Ali Modu Sheriff is the authentic national chairmam of the PDP. \nShe made the declaration on Sunday in Ado-Ekiti while speaking with newsmen at the end of a three-day capacity building training on ICT she organised for 100 beneficiaries in Ekiti Central senatorial district. \nRasaki, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Trade and Investment, also declared that the era of impunity was dead in the PDP. \nShe said that the Court of Appeal judgment which affirmed Sheriff as the national chairman of PDP had afforded the party an opportunity to put its house in order. \nShe said that recent developments in Ekiti and at the national level, would enable the PDP prepare ahead of the 2019 general elections. \nShe described the Court of Appeal judgment as a “new lease of life’’ for members of the party. \nThe senator, who distributed free laptops to participants who attended the training, stressed that anybody that wants to make impact in today’s world must be empowered technologically. \nShe urged the beneficiaries to put into practice what they learnt at the training. \nRasaki expressed sadness that impunity, lawlessness, violation of the PDP constitution and abuse of power by people whose names she did not mention, had negatively affected the party’s fortunes before the judgment. \nShe expressed hope that the PDP would emerge stronger from its crises to be a party that would allow equity, justice, fair play, adherence to due process and the principles of democracy to thrive. \nThe senator expressed satisfaction that the judiciary intervened and resolved the protracted crises rocking the party. \nShe lauded the Ekiti chapter of the party for affirming Chief Williams Ajayi as the authentic state chairman. \nShe alleged that some individuals in the PDP had turned the party into their personal property where party congresses and primaries elections to elect candidates were hijacked. \nShe added that members of the party were not allowed to choose candidates of their choice. \nShe said: “Crisis in any political party is part of democracy because we disagree to agree. \n“We, the authentic PDP, are being led by Ali Modu Sheriff and we thank God that the court judgment has put an end to impunity in our party. \n“Impunity is one thing that destroys any organisation or association where people decide and subscribe to rules and regulations guiding them. \n“It is a pity that some people turned the PDP to a place where one person will corner everything and turn it to PLC. \n“A party is supposed to be where everybody has a say because we are in a democracy. \n“In Ekiti, the authentic executive has won in court as well, so in the PDP, we have no option than to obey the rule of law.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:09:54.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
