This is one of the most mysterious and mind-boggling decrees, even among most of the Sages. This search for a Red Heifer without spot or blemish has frustrated countless individuals over the years, especially those eagerly awaiting the arrival of Moshiach and New Jerusalem (The Third Temple).\nA new candidate has JUST NOW been discovered in Baja California by Rabbi Benny Hershcovich as he was attaining some kosher milk from a farmer. This is EXTREMELY significant, as there have only been 9 Red Heifers that have been sacrificed between the time of Moses and the destruction of the Second Temple, which occurred almost 2,000 years ago!\nThe renowned Maimonides (Rambam) states in his commentary to the Mishna,\n“… and the tenth red heifer will be accomplished by the king, the Messiah; may he be revealed speedily, Amen, May it be God’s will.”\nMaimonides himself reminds us in this amazing statement of an ancient tradition; that the tenth red heifer is directly associated with the Messianic era. For those unaware, the red heifer sacrifice is for a ceremony called Tum’at HaMet, which is a ritual to purify those who have come in contact with the dead by pouring the heifer’s ashes mixed in with living water over them.\nIt is stated that this tenth Red Heifer is the final one, and a precursor to the rebuilding of the Third Temple and the ushering in of the Moshiach.\nStraight from The Armageddon Broadcast Network ’s recent episode of ABN Uncut , Torah Code Researcher Michael Harr expounds upon this momentous discovery with his new findings. He unveiled a very significant Torah Code confirming this Red Heifer’s divine significance. Please watch the full video segment below for all the details on this gift from HaShem.\nThe Torah Code discussed in the above episode can be found below.\nMain Search Term: BLOOD WHOM HERSHCOVICH FROM CATTLE-HERD NOTE EL/G-D\nAdditional Terms : Yah Implanting Girl | From Ra-El and Tau | For Present/Gift | To/For Congress/Plenum | In It Behold! Lobby | gallows\nThis search had a stunning calculated odds against random chance of 11 TRILLION to 1 ! This code shows the connection between the Rabbi Hershcovich finding this rare Red Heifer which was a divine gift from G-D and Ra-El HaMoshiach!!!!\nAdditionally, Torah Code Researcher Michael Harr also found another important matrix table pertaining to this Red Heifer. Take a look at this code.\nMain Search Term: Red Heifer Levite The Recognition\nAdditional Terms : Value Ra-Elite | R. Lear Lofty/High/Supreme | adore, like, love | sweeting, sweetie, sweetheart, true-love, love, valentine | unification | Eliam – G-d of the People\nHere we see a connection to R.Lear (Raymond Lear) being the supreme being, and then we have the valued Ra-Elites that faithfully serve him. We see in two spots the words “ love “ and “ true-love ”, showing us he does offer love to the whole world. The term “ unification ”, is not hard to make the connection between Rabbi Hershcovich’s find of the Red Heifer in Baja and the Ra-Elites stationed there. The unification is RayEl HaMoshiach, the Ra-Elite clergy, and this Red Heifer being together for the final ceremony.\nAlso highly important are these two Torah Code matrixs that were discovered by the world’s top Torah Code Researcher, Torah Code Researcher Richard Ruff. His results are found below.\nMain Search Term: Father Red Heifer Flame\nAdditional Terms : Priests | butchery, sacrifice, Zebah | ransom, redemption | cash, redeem | LEAR | Yah Lear from Flame\nMain Search Term: RED HEIFER\nAdditional Terms : Palpation Incoming Flame | HOWIE | Or Lear | RED HEIFER\nRemember that RayEl HaMoshiach’s full name is Raymond Elwood Lear , and he goes by the nickname “ HOWIE “, as referenced in the above table. All of these Codes referenced here are completely cross-verifiable with other Torah Code researchers.\nAs mentioned previously, this is the area designated for the messengers/priests/emmisarries of Ra-El/RayEl HaMoshiah. He ordered a mass-exodus for the inhabitants of The United States of America (modern-day Babylon) back in May of 2011. Shortly after that command was given, there has been a Sanctuary established in Baja California Mexico for those obedient to his command.\nThis is truly a Divine sign and gift from HaShem if the message is to be received. If so, then Ra-El/RayEl HaMoshiach will be ushered in as the Third Temple will be here soon.
