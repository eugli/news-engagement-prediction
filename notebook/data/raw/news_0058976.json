Story Continued Below \nPresident Donald Trump’s recent executive order targeting the law has only added to the confusion, some practitioners say. It ordered federal agencies to do what they can to ratchet back the law and, in response, the IRS said it would not automatically reject returns that fail to indicate whether the filer had health insurance last year. \nSome have interpreted that as a green light to ignore the law’s individual mandate, and Intuit, maker of the popular TurboTax, is now updating its software to allow users to file their returns without answering Line 61, which asks about coverage. \nBut many experts complain that neither the executive order nor the IRS’ subsequent announcement actually changed the Obamacare insurance requirement. \nAnd while they readily admit the IRS is unlikely to chase down people who ignore the mandate, some tax preparers say they won’t sign off on client’s returns that skip the insurance question because they consider omitting information from returns to be unethical, even if the IRS is unlikely to do anything about it. By Edward-Isaac Dovere \nAll of that is adding up to a lot of uncertainty, plenty of inconsistency and some uncomfortable conversations with would-be filers this tax season. \n“Some people are quite indignant,” said Christine Speidel, an attorney at Vermont Legal Aid, a nonprofit, who provides free tax help to low-income people. “They don’t want to pay it, and they don’t want to believe the provision is still in force.” \nIt is an example of the unexpected fallout from the delays in Republicans’ bid to repeal the massive health care program. Republicans have promised to immediately junk the penalty as part of their plan. But Republicans are deeply divided over how far they need to go to replace the program, and there's no agreement in sight. Asked last week when Republicans would repeal the ACA, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said “just as soon as we have the votes.” \nMeantime, millions of Americans are now doing their taxes, and the requirement to have insurance is not only still on the books — the penalty for failing to carry coverage has jumped. \nDemocrats, worried about the penalty’s unpopularity, slowly phased it in when they wrote the health care law. This year is the first it will be fully phased in, at $695 per adult and as much as $2,085 for families, or 2.5 percent of annual income, whichever is larger. \nLast year, 6.5 million paid the penalty. \nGiven the Republicans’ chesty rhetoric on Obamacare, and the fact that they now control the entire government, many filers assumed Obamacare was already history. \n“There’s been a little bit of education necessary for taxpayers because some heard that Obamacare went away,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt. \nPractitioners also blame Trump’s very first executive order that directed agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the act.” In response, the IRS said it was killing plans to automatically reject so-called silent returns that skip the question asking about insurance. By Darius Tahir \nThough it was sometimes lost in the announcement, the IRS said the underlying insurance requirement remains unchanged and warned that people who don’t have coverage can still be on the hook for the law’s “shared responsibility payment.” \n“Processing silent returns means that taxpayer returns are not systemically rejected by the IRS at the time of filing,” the agency said. “When the IRS has questions about a tax return, taxpayers may receive follow-up questions and correspondence at a future date.” \nMany practitioners complain the news media has misconstrued the administration’s actions as an indication the individual mandate has either gone by the wayside or will not be enforced. \n“It didn’t change the law one iota — and nor does this policy change the IRS just announced change the law one iota,” said Chris Condeluci, a former Republican tax aide in Congress and expert on the health care law. \nBut Intuit says it’s updating its do-it-yourself software to allow people to file returns without answering the insurance question. “Beginning March 2, TurboTax customers can e-file their return without indicating if they had health coverage last year,” said spokeswoman Julie Miller. \nSome tax preparers readily admit the IRS is unlikely to pursue those who skip Line 61, given Republicans’ efforts to repeal the law and the IRS’s chronic budget woes. \nBut preparers like Speidel say that makes no difference because they have an obligation to truthfully fill out their clients’ returns, which they note are filed under threat of perjury. \n“If you owe a penalty and you’re not assessing that deliberately, that’s a false tax return,” she said. “Tax professionals are not permitted to file a false tax return or encourage that just because the taxpayer probably won’t get caught.” \nJohn Dundon, who owns a small Denver accounting and tax firm, says he too won’t sign off on clients’ returns that skip the question — and that it’s costing him business.
