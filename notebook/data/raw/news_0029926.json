(ABC Northern Tasmania: Rick Eaves) \nGilmore was the world's best six-day racer for about five years into the early 1970s. He was based in Europe for many years and was a revered sporting identity there. \nAn Australian road and track champion as well, he was one of the very first inductees into the Tasmanian Sporting Hall of Fame in 1987.

He knocks off his 70km ride twice a week, often going home to mow the lawns afterwards! \nA Tasmanian road and track champion way back in the 1950s, Ferdie has also been Tasmanian veteran road and track champion in more recent times. \n\"They're all young boys these guys,\" said Murray, who removes his goggles to reveal the wrinkles that prove his age. The supposed wrinkles are pretty hard to see. Photo: The slow group, including Graeme Gilmore, approach Bishopsbourne on an extraordinarily pretty circuit from Carrick. (ABC Northern Tasmania: Rick Eaves) \nRon Grenda, now 78, an Australian sprint champion and legendary six-day racer in the 1960s, says past results are often reviewed and embellished during the ride. \nHe also admits that muscle memory can sometimes take over, causing impromptu and ill-advised sprints in empty main streets. \n\"There's always someone feeling their oats, having a bit of a go,\" Grenda laughed as he readied his bike for the early morning ride. \n\"These days that doesn't last too long! Personally, I'm pretty happy to get back so we can all go for coffee. \n\"But when you're in retirement, what are you going to do? Are you going to sit around or get out and do something? \n\"It's something we know how to do. We're all mates from racing years ago and I'm 78 now and I had a fair bit of weight on before I started on this. \n\"I've only been going for 18 months but some of these guys really never stopped riding together. Graeme and Roly have been going for years.\" Photo: Ron Grenda, 78, at left, and Murray Ferdie Pickett, 85-years young. Old champions who live to ride.

At 72, displays little of the competitive energy that still bubbles low down in the belly of some riders in the group. \nAs the riders leave for Whitemore, Gilmore said he was comfortable in the slow group — or what Grenda calls \"… the rehab group, they usually have new knees or new hearts or new lungs…\" \n\"Our Dad's Army has disintegrated into fast and slow groups. After a long career I'm into smelling the roses and I ride that slow I reckon I could pick them too,\" Gilmore said with a laugh. \n\"I've had a few battles, I've had a double knee replacement and a bout of cancer and to keep going, I think cycling has to be in the blood.\" \nFurther proof that cycling has to be in the blood can be found in group members Derry McCormack and Graeme Hodskiss, both of whom have had terrible crashes in recent times. \nMcCormack, now 70, was side-swiped by a truck on the West Tamar Highway five years ago and after a couple of weeks just staying alive in intensive care, he spent a further two months in hospital recovering. \n\"It does make you more cautious but when you love riding it's a bee in your brain. I did get back on the bike yeah — and my wife wasn't that happy about it, I might add\" \nMost of the old champions try to talk down any residual competitive fire but McCormack said he often had to remind a few that they are \"riding for health, not to train for the Olympics or a world championship.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:00:40.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
