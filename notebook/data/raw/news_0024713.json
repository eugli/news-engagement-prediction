I was their second choice for this commercial. But on Day 1 of shooting, the SMPP team felt I was better suited for the ad.” Although she was considered as the second option for the role, she was later called to enact the commercial. “I was out somewhere drinking San Mig[uel] Pale Pilsen when my manager called at 2 am to tell me I got the part, but I have to go home ASAP [because] the shoot was at 7 am! And the rest is history,” she added.
