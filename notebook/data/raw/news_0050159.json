Now, he's launched a tool to help those interested in protesting Trump's administration to do so on a daily basis. \nLate Sunday night, Moore tweeted a link to the calendar, which features a variety of \"anti-Trump, pro-democracy\" events, as Moore called them, across the country (and even overseas), under each day. For instance, some of Monday's events include a \"flood the phones\" initiative to call the White House comment line and Trump's companies to demand that he resign, an invitation to wear all black as a form of dissent and rallies in several cities across the country. \nPeople can also submit additional events directly on the website, with Moore's team curating the listings \"to guarantee accuracy.\" \nMoore explained why he was launching the calendar in a lengthy Facebook post on Monday morning, saying that it was the outgrowth of a planned one-stop shop to oppose the current administration. \n\"GOOD NEWS FRIENDS! I've promised you a one-stop site, a clearinghouse of all actions — a RESISTANCE CALENDAR — where you can find EVERY upcoming action, protest, march, sit-in, town hall, anti-Trump, pro-democracy event in all 50 states! A site where YOU can post your own action so all can see it. A place where you can quickly go and check it daily, ensuring that you don't miss any event in your area to stop the Trump madness,\" Moore wrote. \"So, right now, I and a team of graphic designers are launching the RESISTANCE CALENDAR!\" \nMoore said he hoped with the website that those who sought to demonstrate could better keep track of the many events being planned by an increasingly active electorate. \n\"So much is happening so fast it's hard to keep track of all the actions popping up — but our intention is to do just that,\" he said. \nThe calendar also includes, Moore wrote on Facebook, events opposing \"the Republican Congress\" and \"many of the spineless Democratic politicians out there.\" \n\"We welcome all resisters across the movement to use this tool. It's completely free,\" he added. \"There's no big 'funder' or group behind it. There will be no ads, no commercialization, no fundraising lists — all the stuff we hate. Just you, me, the volunteers donating their time to keep it going and the World Wide Web. BOOM!\" \nUsers can search for events by city, state or keyword or \"just scroll down and see every upcoming event across the country in chronological order.\" \nMoore said that the website would be upgraded with snazzier features and that the current version is just a rough site. \nHe urged his Facebook followers to share the calendar and to follow the Resistance Calendar's Facebook page and Twitter account. And he also told his Facebook followers to let his team know if they want to be part of the site's volunteer tech and curation team. \nIn closing, Moore wrote that he hopes the events will oust Trump from power and defeat politicians who oppose them. \n\"All hands on deck! It's the only way we're going to beat him and lessen the damage he's doing,\" he wrote. \"Our goal is his removal from office — and the defeat of any politician who isn't with us. WE ARE THE MAJORITY.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:48:08.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
