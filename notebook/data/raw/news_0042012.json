Michael Tomlinson, the deputy chairman of the Tory European Research Group, said 'Many thanks to the French Senate for their inquiry into our circumstances but perhaps we can agree to differ? 'We hope the French can do better under the EU but we're definitely going to do better out of it. 'For them the EU is the best solution, anything less is worse, for us non EU membership is better. 'So if they prefer they can call it a worse deal but we know it is more suited to us - access not membership.' Theresa May, pictured on a visit to Copeland yesterday, is due to officially trigger two years of talks with the EU on Brexit next month In the report, the senators branded her Lancaster House speech a 'mixture of veiled threats and pledges of goodwill'. They said the speech ignored 'the thousands of jobs that European citizens undertake in the medical sector, agriculture and several other sectors where a low-skilled labour force is needed'. It was assembled after an inquiry heard evidence from EU negotiators, technical experts and British politicians. The French report highlights what the senate considers to be the UK's vulnerabilities in the negotiations. There is focus on Britain's desire for a deal to ensure the UK does not fall out of the UK after the official two-year negotiation without any agreement. Mrs May has made clear she does not want a 'cliff edge' to Britain's EU membership and has promoted the idea of a transition or implementation phase.
