She was near Dirkiesdorp, when she came across \"several\" potholes in the road, her lawyers wrote in a letter to the MEC. \nShe wasn’t able to \"avoid all the potholes\" and her car hit \"another/second pothole\". \nDue to the impact, she lost control of the vehicle and it overturned. The car was a write-off. \nSwart sustained soft tissue injuries to her neck, back and right shoulder. There were also injuries to her forehead, the medico-legal report said. \nShe was taken by ambulance to the Piet Retief Hospital, where the injuries were treated. She was in hospital for a week and had to wear a neck brace when she was discharged. \nAccording to the report, Swart hadn’t been employed at the time. She’d previously worked in a butchery and a supermarket. \nShe hasn’t worked since the accident. She tried once to work a friend’s shift at the supermarket, but had to go home after a few hours because of a headache. \nAccording to the report, Swart’s injuries were hindering her ability to work again. She wouldn't be able to handle heavy objects and wouldn't be able to do \"manual labour\". \nHer quality of life, as well as enjoyment of life, would be moderately impaired because of the accident. \nSwart had claimed just under R1.4m from the MEC.
