He was told his behaviour was affecting the morale of the other staff and there had been complaints about him. \nWilliams believed he was dismissed for poor time keeping. He said the health and safety aspect was not mentioned. \nREAD MORE: \nAn experienced fitter and welder, Williams was employed by Custom Motor Bodies in May last year. 123RF \nAt one point, Williams was told he needed to pick up on his attitude and timekeeping. However, Williams denies ever getting a warning, verbal or otherwise for his timekeeping. \nGilling told Williams he was subject to a trial period, however he was not provided with a written employment agreement containing a trial period. \nHis agreement stated his hours of work would be from 7am to 3pm, smoko at 9.30am and lunch at 12pm. \nDuring the first week, Williams was spoken to about his time keeping - namely how long he was taking for smoko and the time he actually started work in the morning after clocking in. \nCustom Motor Bodies factory supervisor Dave Andrews, who Williams reported to, told him he was doing well, but his trial period was being extended because there were some things he needed to improve upon. Ad Feedback \nAndrews told Williams he needed to pick up on his attitude and timekeeping. \nGilling provided the authority with a diary note that showed a verbal warning was given to Williams about timekeeping, however, Gilling described this as a \"friendly warning\" and there was no mention of Williams' employment being at risk. \nWilliams got another warning soon after. \nWilliams denies ever getting a warning, verbal or otherwise for his timekeeping. \n\"If Mr Gilling did issue 'warnings', they were not clear warnings as to the risk to Mr Williams ongoing employment,\" ERA member Anna Fitzgibbon wrote in her decision. \n\"Rather, in my view Mr Williams was being told his timekeeping was poor and needed improvement.\" \nOn the day Williams was dismissed, he clocked in, but did not start work and was given a verbal warning. \nGilling told Andrews he did not think Williams was suitable and that procedures were being put in place to dismiss him. \nAfter returning from his morning break, Andrews said one of Williams' colleagues videoed him asleep at the smoko lunch room table. \nAndrews was extremely frustrated and said Williams' behaviour was affecting the morale of the other staff and he had received complaints about him. \n\"I have viewed the video footage of Mr Williams on the morning of 9 June 2016 and it shows Mr Williams sitting back with his eyes closed. It is not clear to me from the video footage that Mr Williams was asleep,\" Fitzgibbon said. \n\"Even so, this is a matter which could have been raised with Mr Williams and a matter about which he could have been spoken to and possibly warned about. This did not occur.\" \nGilling said Williams was sleeping on the job and that in itself amounted to serious misconduct which justified his dismissal. \nGilling decided to immediately dismiss Williams - which he did. \nWilliams said Gilling approached him and said he was \"clearly not listening and as he was late for morning tea that he was to pack his things up and go\". \nWhen Williams mum - Rachel Williams - got involved, she spoke to Gilling who said he was dismissed for four reasons: being a clock watcher, first to go to break and last to leave, his work production began well but then reduced, and he fell asleep at the table in the smoko room. \n\"To form a conclusion that these issues amounted to serious misconduct without a formal discussion, in my view, was not the action of a fair and reasonable employer,\" Fitzgibbon said. \nThe authority found Williams was unjustifiably dismissed. \nCustom Motor Bodies was ordered to pay Williams $6160 for lost wages and $5000 in compensation for hurt and humiliation. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:14:44.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
