The doctors and staffs at both KU Med and M.D. Anderson (in Houston, Texas) have been great; working so very well together to finalize the overall treatment plan which is being conducted in Kansas City. Both ‘teams’ have projected a positive outcome and have worked out a schedule that allows me to be in Kansas City for my regular treatments and still be back in the office on a regular basis through the first week of March. Sean, along with our coaching and support staffs, remain highly productive in carrying out their responsibilities keeping us on track.”\n[ Newsletter: Get 5 great stories from the Yahoo Sports blogs in your inbox every morning! ]\nCiting Snyder’s doctors, the release states Snyder’s prognosis as excellent.
