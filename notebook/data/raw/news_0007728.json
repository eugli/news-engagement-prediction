PUBLISHED: 03:58, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 05:24, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 \nFillon had been a favourite to win but after an Elabe poll revealed three out of four people in France are unconvinced by his defence surrounding suspicions of his wife’s fictitious jobs, the right-wing candidate is now lagging behind National Front leader Marine Le Pen and could soon be overtaken by independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. \nWith his presidency bid in disarray, MPs within his own Les Républicains party are concerned Fillon has become an electoral liability who could cost them in elections later this year.

GETTY Former Bordeaux mayor Alain Juppe is being tipped as a possible replacement for Fillon \nFillon is reported to have paid his British wife around £700,000 (€830,000) as a parliamentary assistant , which could be considered a “misuse of public funds” if prosecutors find she had not actually done any work for him. \nThe allegations, brought by investigative paper Le Canard Enchaîné, were made greater on Wednesday when the publication revealed Fillon had paid almost £70,000 (€82,000) to two of his children when he was a senator.
