And he think’s they’ll even cover the spread.\n“I like Bob Kraft, I like coach [Bill] Belichick, and Tom Brady’s my friend,” Trump reminded O’Reilly in a taped interview, which aired during the Super Bowl pregame show Sunday afternoon.\n“Tom is a winner,” Trump added.\nAsked if he was rooting for his friends, Trump did offer praise for the Falcons and their quarterback, Matt Ryan, but ultimately said he thought the Patriots’ Super Bowl experience would carry them.\n“You know once you’ve won, and you’ve done it, and they’ve done it, once you’ve done it there’s a lot less pressure,” he said. “So we’ll see what happens, but you know you have to stick up for your friends, right?” O’Reilly asked Trump to make a game prediction.\n“Well I hate to make predictions,” Trump said. “I hate to do it, but I’ll say — I don’t even know what are the odds. I guess it’s pretty even, right? Two great teams.”\nO’Reilly insisted that he make a prediction.\n“So I’ll say the Patriots will win … by eight points,” Trump said.\nThe Patriots are three-point favorites over the Falcons.\n“All right, so that’s a good presidential prediction and you don’t need data on that,” O’Reilly added.\n“I need no data,” the president agreed.\nEarlier in the interview, O’Reilly had pressed Trump on needing “data” for his unsubstantiated claims that 3 to 5 million people had illegally voted in last year’s election.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5skp50QY68?feature=oembed", "http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2017/jan/27/still-burning-trumps-claim-about-serious-voter-fra/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/magazine/the-uncomfortable-love-affair-between-donald-trump-and-the-new-england-patriots.html?smid=tw-share", "http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/15/13638186/trump-transition-appointments-cabinet", "https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/videos/10155079504166336/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:15:50.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
