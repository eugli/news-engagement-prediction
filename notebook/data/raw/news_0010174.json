Warwick Smith/Fairfax NZ \nJen Phillips found a runaway mental health patient in her clothes sleeping on her couch. \n\"It is disgusting, like what have you touched? Are you coming back? \n\"I can't sit here and relax. \n\"I want to move. I don't want to be here any more. It is too much.\" \nThe woman broke latches and climbed through her bedroom window and \"ransacked\" the house, Phillips said. Ad Feedback \n\"She took blankets off the bed and made her own little spot on the lounge.\" \nWhen Phillips arrived home, the woman said she was waiting for someone, before grabbing a bag and running off. \n\"I was like 'what the hell is going on?'\" \nPhillips had surveillance cameras on her property and it showed the woman walking past numerous times, as well as playing with the camera once she had broken in. \n\"I was looking through [the footage]. It was disturbing. It freaked me out.\" \nShe called the police, who found the woman down the road on Stanley Ave. \nPhillips said she was told by police that she could not press charges because the woman was a mental health patient. \n\"I was [fobbed off] and told there was nothing they could do.\" \nPhillips has had to have a friend stay with her since the break-in. \n\"Any little noise, it is terrifying.\" \nShe was glad she got home when she did. \n\"If I had come back the next day I think I would have come back to an empty home.\" \nMidCentral mental health clinical director Syed Ahmer said the woman failed to return from a short period of approved leave. \n\"The person in question was on a 15-minute leave break from the ward. When she failed to return, police were notified within 15 minutes. \n\"It is very regrettable that the patient allegedly entered someone's property. This is now a police matter and we are unable to comment on it.\" \nThe patient has been returned to the ward. \nAhmer said leave had an important part to play in treating and rehabilitating people with mental illness. \n\"It is used with discretion and is carefully managed. \n\"The granting of leave is a clinical judgment, balancing many factors, such as the patient's current state of wellbeing, their progress against their treatment programme, their rights and their responsibilities.\" \nActing Manawatu area prevention manager Detective Senior Sergeant Neil Forlong said staff would be talking to Phillips about her options, such as pressing charges. \nForlong said police were making inquiries into the offending. \"Police are meeting with [Phillips on Wednesday] to inform her on the latest in the investigation and provide advice and support. \n\"Police encourage anyone who is a victim of crime to lodge a formal complaint with us and we will follow up as appropriate.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:24:54.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
