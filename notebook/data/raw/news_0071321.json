It’s unfortunate the gene he carries is rare and there is nothing, no cure for him. In order to prolong his life we have daily treatments, physiotherapy twice a day, antibiotics and he requires medications every time he eats,” his mum Teresa Bazouni, 32, said. \nSimon’s condition is so rare it wasn’t picked up during the routine prick test at birth with the diagnosis coming when he was 15 months old. \n“They said at the time his life expectancy was 34-years-old so a lot of thoughts surge through your mind at the time,” Ms Bazouni said. \nThe family has been overwhelmed with the phenomenal support they have received ahead of the walkathon with $53,000 raised by Saturday. \n“He’s a happy kid … we’re very proud, he’s come a long way from what he was two years ago but without the support of the Children’s Hospital at Westmead we wouldn’t be here today,” Ms Bazouni said. \nCystic Fibrosis NSW CEO Michele Adair said while life-changing medicines have recently become more affordable on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme there remains no cure with the majority of patients passing away before their 40th birthday. \nCystic fibrosis causes irreversible lung damage and infections as well as digestive, liver and problems with other organs. \nFor more information on the 65k 4 65 Roses Walkathon or to donate to the cause visit:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:00:11.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
