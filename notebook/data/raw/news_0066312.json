Carol Moseley Braun. Mavis Staples. Michelle Obama . All, we are told, have been gussied up at the oldest black-owned beauty shop in Chicago, the life's work of two women from Mississippi who, like most of us, did not end up doing what they first set out to do with their time on... (Chris Jones) \nA few blocks away at the Biograph, Gardley is trying to deepen and rejuvenate the genre of touring shows aimed at African-American audiences — the kind of show that used to be a fixture at the New Regal Theatre on the South Side. One of those shows, Shelly Garrett's \"Beauty Shop,\" even shares a setting with Gardley's funny, uplifting and emotional play, which is a tribute to the female African-American bonding to be found in the beauty shops of Chicago's South Side, where stories are told, sisterly support is freely given and life as it is most often lived unfolds day by day. \nLike Lee, Gardley has serious as well as populist aims. \"I wanted to talk about the great migration,\" he said in an interview this week, \"without actually writing a great migration play. I also think there is such a rich Southern culture in Chicago, and that it carries down to the city's kids, helping them cope with some of the issues they have to deal with in the neighborhoods. I wanted to write about that, too.\" \nHe did. Quite beautifully, actually. And in a way that everyone can come together and understand each other a little better. \"I believe in the shared experience,\" Gardley said. \"I believe in people of all ages, races and backgrounds coming together at the theater.\" \nGardley — a writer who grew up in Oakland, Calif., but has come to love his adopted home of Chicago — told me this week that he is convinced a big audience for his show is to be found within the membership of the black churches of Chicago. It is an audience Gardley knows — he is a pastor's kid. Now it's a matter of persuading the buses to roll up at the Biograph door, which is not a usual or (for most) a familiar destination. And that is tough to change overnight. \n\"The thing about that audience is that you have to be consistent \" Gardley says, homing in on the conundrum faced by many theaters where the style and content (and quality) of the work varies drastically with every title. And with another booking on a season slated for the same theater, it's also tough to extend a show long enough to build a big word-of-mouth following. The last time Victory Gardens had a hit — the similarly excellent \"Hand to God\" — it was closed before demand fully could build. \nI don't think the Gardens will make that mistake again. But like Lee, Gardley may find that it will take a second production with familiar names to really reach the crowd with whom he most wants to have a conversation. \nHe's ready. \n\"You know the songs in the play?\" he asked. \"Those could change depending on who is starring. My dream is for this play to have a commercial run.\" \nChris Jones is a Tribune critic. \nTwitter @ChrisJonesTrib", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:44:09.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
