She told me to tell the truth. When I replied I didn't have (the orange) she beat me,\" she told AFP this week.\n\"When I shouted I was burning, she beat me around the head. There was a lot of blood.\"\nKhin Khin Tun was rescued after three years working for Aye Aye Soe, a 40-year-old widow, and her mother Tin Pyone in their home and as a waitress for their catering service.\nThe girl was sent by her father to be a domestic helper to fund his medical bills. Her younger sister Thazin Aung, now 12, was later also taken in by the women.\nAt first Khin Khin Tun was paid 30,000 kyat ($22) a month for working more than 17 hours a day, but that stopped after her father passed away in 2015. Soon the beatings started.\nHla Shwe, who also worked at the catering company, said she witnessed the boiling water attack in December.\nThe teenager was forced to strip before Aye Aye Soe \"poured hot water\" over her body, she said.\n\"I could only watch this scene. What could I do? I cannot say anything,\" she added tearfully.\nAbused Myanmar child slave Khin Khin Tun and her sister were rescued in late December when the founder of a local NGO, Thi Thi Nwe, discovered her in hospital\nThe sisters are among tens of thousands of youngsters who support their families through domestic work for the growing urban elite in Myanmar's booming cities.\nAlone, invisible and without any legal protection, experts say they are highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\nThe issue came to light last year when two teenage domestic helpers were freed from a tailor shop in Yangon, where they said they spent five years being beaten, stabbed and deprived of sleep and food.\nThe case shocked the country and the president ordered an investigation into how it was handled, but no concrete steps have been taken despite de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi's pledge to protect human rights.\n- 'Monitoring is impossible' -\n\"Monitoring is almost impossible,\" according to Piyamal Pichaiwongse, deputy liaison officer for the International Labour Organization based in Yangon.\n\"The best form of protection is still education and reducing household poverty.\"\nThe alleged abuser of Khin Khin Tun and her sister is escorted out of court in in Mawlamyine, southeast of Yangon, Myanmar\nKhin Khin Tun and her sister were rescued in late December when the founder of a local NGO, Thi Thi Nwe, discovered her in hospital.\nSitting in the NGO's office, the teenager described how her employers would accuse the girls of stealing food, then tie them up and brand them with burning wood if they denied it.\nSometimes they would be forced to hit each other until they bled, then rub chilli powder, MSG and vineger into the wounds.\n\"If we did not want to beat each other, they would beat us. So we had to do it,\" she said softly, tears in her eyes.\n\"They wanted us to hate each other.\"\nAye Aye Soe appeared in court on Monday accused of causing grievous bodily harm and voluntary hurt -- but not child abuse charges that would ensure she was denied bail.\nThe widow and her mother refused to speak to AFP journalists outside the Mawlamyine court.\nTens of thousands of youngsters support their families through domestic work for a growing urban elite in Myanmar, but alone and without any legal protection, they are highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse\nInstead they tried to get reporters barred from observing the trial.\nThe girls' aunt Hla Kyi decided to bring the case, braving Myanmar's slow and often corrupt legal system, after being contacted by Thi Thi Nwe.\nAt first the employers accused Khin Khin Tun of spilling the water on herself, saying she had \"mental problems,\" Hla Kyi told AFP.\n\"When I saw the child, I felt sorry. I'm angry too. That's why I opened the case,\" she said.\nToday Khin Khin Tun says she still feels dizzy sometimes, but is hopeful she can now forge a new life with her sister.\n\"I want my sister to go back to school,\" she said. \"Can I go back to school at this age?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:55:40.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
