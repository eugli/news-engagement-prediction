Morning Madness: Wed., Feb. 22 NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nHere's what you need to know in college hoops for Wednesday, Feb. 22. \nOh boy. Ohhh boy. It's Wednesday. We have some basketball tonight. UNC-Louisville. Butler-Villanova. Duke-Syracuse. Oregon-California. Let's get down to business. \nWhat to watch for today (Hint: everything) \n• No. 7 Louisville (22-5) at No. 8 North Carolina (23-5) in a game that in all likelihood will determine the No. 1 team in the No. 1 conference in the country. The Tar Heels have won 11 of their last 13 games, including back-to-back 24-point wins. Lousiville has won 10 of its last 13, but their past three wins have all been by five points or fewer. ( 9 ET, ESPN ) \n• No. 22 Butler (21-6) at No. 2 Villanova (26-2): The Bulldogs are the proud owners of one of Villanova's two losses this season (66-58 on Jan. 4). The Wildcats have already locked up the regular-season Big East title. ( 9 ET, FS1 ) \n• No. 10 Duke (22-5) at Syracuse (16-12): The Blue Devils had a rocky middle of the season, but they've won seven in a row and sit in second place in the ACC. Syracuse has dropped three in a row, but does have two top 10 wins in its past seven games. ( 7 ET, ESPN ) \n• No. 6 Oregon (24-4) at California (18-8): California has dropped two road games in a row and Oregon has won its past three. California leads the all-time series 84-58 and has won seven of the last 10 meetings. ( 9 ET, ESPN2 ) \n• Full Wednesday schedule In case you missed it • NC State had lost seven games in a row by an average of 17.7 points a game before Tuesday night's matchup with Georgia Tech in Atlanta, where the Yellow Jackets have some NCAA tournament hopes. But the Wolfpack pulled out the 71-69 win after Tech missed a great look at a game-winning three-pointer. • N o. 9 Baylor took down Oklahoma 60-54 , completing a season sweep for only the third time during the Big 12 era. • No. 13 Florida had little trouble with South Carolina, winning 81-66 (Watch the highlights here ). The score was tied with under a minute left in the first half before KeVaughn Allen picked up a quick steal and finished with this nasty dunk . Florida never trailed after that. • No. 11 Kentucky beat Missouri, 72-62. The Wildcats host Florida on Saturday with the SEC title in the balance. Both are 23-5, 13-2 in the conference. • It took an overtime period, but No. 14 Purdue held off Penn State 74-70. Check out the highlights . • ICYM yesterday's ICYMI, here's our reaction to this week's AP Top 25 and our look behind the numbers of the rankings. • Full Tuesday scoreboard \nStat of the day \n62-2 -- With its 109-83 win over Evansville , Wichita State improved to 62-2 at home in the past four years. That's the second best home winning percentage in that time behind Arizona (66-1). \nVIDEO: Newcomer spotlight \nMaryland had to replace four starters around Melo Trimble this year.
