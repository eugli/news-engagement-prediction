This morning, following what has been difficult week for the footballer, was no exception. \nPutting on a show of unity with his entire brood in tow, David sat front row with sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz, with daughter Harper perched on his lap. \nDavid, who has shared Instagram snaps over the last 24 hours of the family enjoying a day out at New York’s Natural History Museum and making pizza in Brooklyn during the half-term break, braved a rainy day in the US fashion capital wearing a navy duffle coat and lace-up boots, while 5-year-old Harper sported a smock blouse, a pleated wool skirt and Chelsea boots. \nThe world's most stylish family was completed by the Beckham boys who stayed true to their signature style, with Brooklyn in a flat cap and cardigan and Romeo in his favourite Burberry trench, while youngest son Cruz smartened up for the occasion in a sharp blue suit and tie. A photo posted by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Feb 12, 2017 at 4:19am PST \nKnown for their expert handling of their own public image, the Beckhams appeared unflappable today with Victoria delighted to have her entire support group present. \n“I always love to have them here with me after a week of hard work,” she said backstage. Her labour has clearly paid off as this morning's showcase was a demonstration of Beckham at her best. \nIt was, in her words, a collection which centred on “consciousness of the body rather than body conscious”. As such, the silhouette was soft, loose and free - a far cry from the figure-hugging sheath dresses on which her business was founded. \nAiry georgette pleated skirts in shades of raspberry and rose added lightness; cuddly cashmere knits a sense of warmth. This was an offering which not only looked good, but felt good to wear too. And for Beckham, such female-focused fashion has never been more timely. \n“There’s never been a more relevant time to talk about empowering women,” said the designer. “With everything that’s going on in the world right now, a woman really wants to feel secure.” A photo posted by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:03am PST \nA feeling of familiarity was offered within a host of VB signatures, from fluid calf-length jersey dresses to beautifully cut crombie coats, while a sense of security was reinforced in the addition of classic menswear tailoring, with wide tailored trousers and mannish blazers available in gentleman’s club colours of oxblood and navy. \nCurrent uncertainty surrounding the future of American politics also caused Beckham to reflect upon her \"heritage in the context of a changing landscape\". To this end, heritage fabrics, such as tartan and houndstooth, infused outerwear with a quintessentially British flavour, but in a way which would appeal to her global customer. Gigi and Bella join models for Tommy Hilfiger's 'Tommyland' showcase \nNext season’s shopper is also armed with a selection of accessories which fuse function with femininity, from bags structured like vanity cases to flat buckled shoes and leather boots with a strong wedge heel. \n“The attitude is of freedom, of confidence and power,” added Beckham. “It’s an optimistic outlook. These are clothes for reality, and a real woman’s life.” \nTrue to form, Beckham took a no-nonsense approach to getting dressed this morning, taking her bow in a navy roll-neck jumper and wide trousers from the collection.
