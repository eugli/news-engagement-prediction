(Photo: Salty Dog Maritime Marketing) \n149 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A Chandler resident is believed to be one of six people aboard a fishing vessel that went missing off the coast of Alaska early Saturday.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday night that it had called off the search for the veteran fishermen aboard a crabbing boat missing in the icy, turbulent Bering Sea.\nAccording to the U.S. Coast Guard in Alaska, crews responded to an emergency position indicating radio beacon alert (EPIRB), which indicated the fishing boat, called the Destination, was about 2 miles northwest of St. George, Alaska, on the Bering Sea. The EPIRB can be activated manually or automatically when it hits seawater.\nThe Coast Guard did not receive a mayday call indicating a problem with the vessel, Petty Officer 3rd Class Lauren Steenson said.\nThe search for the Destination, a Seattle-based crab boat, started at 10:13 a.m. Saturday and continued through Monday, officials said. The EPIRB was recovered Saturday among a debris field containing buoys, tarps, a life ring from the Destination and an oil sheen, officials said.\nThe crew members' names had not been officially confirmed as of Tuesday afternoon.\nCrews participating in the search included two HC-130 Hercules airplanes, two MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters, one MH-65 Dolphin helicopter from Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak, Coast Guard Cutter Morgenthau and watch standers in the 17th District command center coordinating the search and communications, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\nLt. Brenden Kelley, operations officer and navigator on the Kodiak-based Munro, said bad weather is the main hazard when fishing on the Bering Sea at this time of year.\nBoat captains with computer connectivity have far more tools now for watching the weather and can take steps to avoid or lessen danger, said Kelley, adding that the main factor is the wind direction and distance it travels, or fetch, which determines wave height and frequency.\nThe Bering Sea doesn't offer many places to find shelter, but the sheltered sides of St. George and St. Paul islands are two important options, Kelley said.\nThe Coast Guard released a statement Monday saying they had suspended the search for the Destination.\n“We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the six crew members during this extremely difficult time,” said Rear Adm. Michael McAllister, Coast Guard 17th District commander. “The decision to suspend a search is always difficult and is made with great care and consideration.”\n\"Deadliest Catch,\" a reality cable-TV show on the Discovery channel that follows crab-fishing crews, posted on social media: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the crew members aboard the F/V Destination and their families.\"\nAll crewmen aboard the Destination were experienced, professional fishermen, said attorney Mike Barcott, a spokesman for the boat's owner, in an email from Seattle.\nThere were no signs of the Destination crew throughout the search, and the U.S. Coast Guard says the cause of the incident is under investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:53:36.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
