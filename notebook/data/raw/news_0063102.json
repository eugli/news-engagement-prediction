Without this source of information, scientists can't be sure exactly if Neanderthal genes functioned differently than their modern human counterparts. But they can look to gene expression in modern humans who possess Neanderthal ancestry. This diagram shows that Neanderthal-inherited sequences are not silent remnants of ancient interbreeding but have a measurable impact on gene expression that may contribute to variation in modern humans today In the new study, researchers analysed RNA sequences in a dataset called the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. They looked for people who carried both Neanderthal and modern human versions of any given gene - one version from each parent. For each gene, the investigators then compared expression of the two alleles - alternative forms of a gene - in 52 different tissues. HOW OUR ANCESTORS DROVE THE SPREAD OF STIs In today's metrosexual age, Neanderthal man has a bit of an image problem. Commonly seen as a club-wielding brute, the Neanderthal's reputation has now taken another hit – for giving us an STI. Scientists believe the human papilloma virus, passed on through sex, came from the Neanderthals who interbred with humans. It means young girls now being vaccinated for HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer, have these early humans to blame. HPV16 variants A and B/C/D co-diverged with archaic and modern humans, respectively. When modern human populations left Africa and began interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans, they became infected by the viral variant that had evolved with archaic humans, causing the infection to spread in Eurasia and the Americas. Illustrated above The findings, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, follow recent studies showing almost everyone has a little bit of Neanderthal DNA in them – up to five per cent of the human genome. That comes, it has been stated, from 'hanky panky' between ancient Homo sapiens and Neanderthals before the latter died out. Unfortunately, with a roll in the hay sometimes comes a nasty infection. The HPV16 strain responsible for most cervical and mouth cancers has been mapped back to Neanderthals and Denisovans, another form of ancient human. Modern humans who left Africa and had sex with them were infected by the viral variant they carried and we did not, and it spread right up to the present day. The study on HPV, an oncogenic or tumour-causing disease, was conducted by Ville Pimenoff at the Catalan Institute of Oncology and Ignacio Bravo at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. 'The history of humans is also the history of the viruses we carry and we inherit,' Mr Bravo said. 'Our work suggests that some aggressive oncogenic viruses were transmitted by sexual contact from archaic to modern humans.' Rajiv McCoy, a postdoctoral researcher at the university, and the study's first author, said: 'We find that for about 25 per cent of all those sites that we tested, we can detect a difference in expression between the Neanderthal allele and the modern human allele.' Expression of Neanderthal alleles tended to be especially low in the brain and the testes, suggesting that those tissues may have experienced more rapid evolution since we diverged from Neanderthals approximately 700,000 years ago. Dr Akey said: 'We can infer that maybe the greatest differences in gene regulation exist in the brain and testes between modern humans and Neanderthals.' DNA (pictured) can be extracted from fossils and sequenced, but RNA - a nucleic acid that carries instructions from DNA for controlling the synthesis of proteins - cannot ANCIENT DNA CARRIES ADVANTAGES Modern humans carry traces of DNA from mixing with other hominids, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. By analysing the DNA of 1,500 people, including those from Europe, Asia and the Pacific isalnds, researchers identified 126 areas of the genome where this ancient DNA persists. They found genes relating to the immune system and skin function. Scientists believe these genes from our extinct cousins helped modern humans to thrive as they moved outwards from the African continent. One example uncovered by this study is a Neanderthal allele of a gene called ADAMTSL3 that decreases risk of schizophrenia, while also influencing height. The connection between that modified protein, height, and schizophrenia still requires more investigation, but it's an example of how small differences between modern humans and Neanderthals can contribute to variation in people. Dr Akey said: 'Hybridisation between modern humans and Neanderthals increased genomic complexity. 'Hybridisation wasn't just something that happened 50,000 years ago that we don't have to worry about anymore. 'Those little bits and pieces, our Neanderthal relics, are influencing gene expression in pervasive and important ways.' The researchers now hope to investigate whether Denisovans - another species of hominins that crossbred with modern humans - are contributing to gene expression. Previous studies have found correlations between Neanderthal genes and traits such as fat metabolism, depression, and lupus risk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:51:30.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
