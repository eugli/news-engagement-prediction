(HT Photo ) \nA South Korean was briefly held on Wednesday morning for flying a drone in the ‘no-flying zone’ over the Taj Mahal. \nChun Hong Chul, a 50-year-old professor at a South Korean university, was staying in a hotel at Agra. \nThe Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) staff traced a drone hovering over the eastern side of the Taj Mahal at around 7am. \n“The staff got active after spotting a drone. Locals helped trace the South Korean tourist stationed 100 away from the monument, holding the remote of the drone. He was asked to withdraw his drone and taken for interrogation,” said a senior CISF official. \n“The tourist expressed ignorance about the restrictions on flying drones in the vicinity of Taj Mahal and was handed over to the tourism police for further verification of his credentials,” the official added. \nAgra district magistrate Gaurav Dayal had on Monday issued an advisory banning flying of drones in the vicinity of Taj Mahal. \nPolice allowed Chul to leave after questioning and a written undertaking to cooperate in the matter. \n“We have saved the chip recovered from the drone, which could be sent to the forensic lab in Agra, if needed. A communication has been forwarded to the South Korean Embassy in Delhi, asking them to issue advisory to tourists visiting Taj Mahal,” said Preetinder Singh, SSP (Agra). tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:18.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
