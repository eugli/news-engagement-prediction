The red indicates levels of clorophyll, and compared to a similar image from September 2015, shows large losses of plant life from the recent fires, with burned areas showing as black or grey. \nSatellite pictures show the extent of damage caused by the fires that raged in the Port Hills. \nThe images, released by Spanish company Deimos Imaging, show vegetation levels on Monday and September, 2015. \nREAD MORE: The Port Hill fires, which started on February 13, ripped through about 2075 hectares. About 450 houses were evacuated, nine homes destroyed and two partially damaged. A state of emergency was declared on February 15. Deimos Imaging \nA September 2015 satellite image gives a baseline of plant life in the Port Hills, with chlorophyll levels shown as a shades of red. \nVegetation appears red in the images, captured by the company's satellite, Deimos-2. \n\"Different shades of red provide crucial information on chlorophyll content and plants' health,\" a spokeswoman from Deimos Imaging said. \nThe image after the fires clearly shows a large level of loss to the Port Hills with many areas now black or grey.
