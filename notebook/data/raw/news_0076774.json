(Picture: ITV) \nWith Lachlan having turned his back on her and now Lawrence not wanting anything to do with her, Chrissie is left questioning her future which prompts a concerned Rebecca to intervene. \nAfter telling Lawrence that Ronnie set Chrissie up, Rebecca goes a step further and handcuffs Lawrence and Chrissie together after seeing that Chrissie plans to move away for good. (Picture: ITV) \nAs Ronnie guiltily looks on, will he confess the truth? And, if so, could this be the end for him and Lawrence? \nWhatever happens, Lawrence’s future happiness seems in doubt once more as everything looks set to fall apart. \nOne to watch: Wednesday 8th March at 7pm on ITV.
