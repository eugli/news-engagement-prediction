HARRIET PUDNEY & JOSIE STEENHART Last updated 09:03, February 21 2017 FARMERS \nBoth of these looks from Farmers are available up to a size 26. \nNew Zealand brands who are willing to take a risk and make plus-size clothing will be rewarded by their customers, a fashion lecturer says. \nYvonne Chan is head of the Auckland University of Technology's fashion department. While she was initially surprised to hear that Farmers' top-selling size is an 18 (as Mandi Meyer, the store's buyer for women's fashion, recently confirmed), on consideration it made sense. \n\"Farmers is a respected New Zealand retailer and if people know that this is the place where they're going to get good quality clothing that's on trend, that has their sizes, then they will continue to shop there,\" she says. INSTAGRAM \nVogue's March cover, starring plus-size model Ashley Graham (second from left) sparked controversy thanks to its feeble attempt at diversity. \nREAD MORE: * What happened to sales when Aerie stopped editing models? \nPlus-size fashion has been on the rise for years, but it's having a particular moment right now. Ashley Graham has appeared on the cover of US Vogue (surrounded by thin models, but still), ASOS have launched a plus-size line for men, and in New Zealand, a plus-size fashion weekend will be held in April . \nChan puts it down to customers raising their voices, and brands beginning to catch on. \nKiwi fashion designer Laurinda Sutcliffe wants to dress women of all sizes. \n\"I think they are behind, but they are slowly starting to meet the demand,\" she says. \"They've probably been playing it safe, especially with the current global economy and going offshore to produce their clothingâ€¦ I think they're being cautious.\" \nMost New Zealand brands tend to top out at a size 16 (Glassons) or 14 (Moochi, Ruby) but those who cater to larger sizes tend to find it worthwhile, she says. \nOne that does is Loobie's Story, co-founded and designed by Laurinda Sutcliffe. \n\"Our standard size range is a NZ 8-16 and we also offer a size 18 in our extremely popular 'Everyday 7/8th pant',\" says Sutcliffe. Ad Feedback \n\"We don't consider a size 14 or 16 to be large - as the average New Zealand women is a size 12, it makes sense to offer at least two sizes either side of this. \n\"We introduced the size 18 Everyday pant last season, due to an overwhelming number of requests from both retailers and consumers.\" \nSutcliffe says the response to the larger sizes has been \"extremely positive\". \nAnother Kiwi label which has always retailed sizes up to a 16 is Liann Bellis, and designer Leanne Greaves says that, as of last summer, they have also stocked certain styles up to and including size 22, and have had \"a great response.\" \nLinda Leonard, merchandise director at Postie+, says the company stocks women's clothing up to size 26 on selected items. \nBased on positive feedback from the initial introduction of plus-size products within its core range - with a size 18 typically selling in a similar ratio to a size 10 - Postie+ also launched a dedicated plus-size range in September 2016, catering to sizes 18-26. \n\"The Isobelle launch has been incredibly well received by our customers,\" says Leonard. \n\"As part of one of the world's largest clothing retailers, we are very aware of the importance of offering larger sizes as a world-wide trend. We are able to leverage group sourcing to bring affordable clothing across all our ranges, including plus sizes, to the New Zealand market.\" \nThe Iconic is an Australian online store which ships to NZ and stocks from a size six to a 28. \n\"Sizes purchased across Australia and NZ have been consistently diverse over time, with no particular sizes standing out as a trend,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"As an e-tailer, The Iconic can always offer breadth to our customers since we are not confined by the physical walls of your average shop or boutique.\" \nMeyer says that Farmers' 18 Plus range goes up to a size 26 or from an L to a 4XL, depending on the fabric. Size 16 used to be its most popular, but 18 and 20 have taken over, with size 22 picking up as well. \nThey also stock men's plus sizes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:11:07.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
