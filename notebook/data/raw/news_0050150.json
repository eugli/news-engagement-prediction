GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nGill Cross went to her first Bruce Springsteen concert in 1981 and hasn't missed a tour since. \n\"There was no discussion as to his name, it was a forgone conclusion,\" Cross said. \nREAD MORE: \nTuesday's concert at Christchurch's AMI Stadium is going to be an emotional one. FAIRFAX \nBruce Springsteen will perform in Christchurch for the first time on Tuesday night - the eve of the sixth anniversary of the February 2011 earthquake. \n\"He's playing in my hometown on the eve of the sixth earthquake anniversary,\" Cross said. \n\"People are still not recovered from the earthquake, houses haven't been fixed, my house hasn't been fixed. \n\"It's going to be really emotional, especially if he plays City of Ruins .\" \nCross grew up in the UK and attended her first Springsteen concert in 1981, only managing to get a ticket after he rescheduled due to illness. Ad Feedback \n\"The concert was on the eve of my 21st birthday, so it was the best birthday present ever,\" she said. \nCross does not see herself as a groupie or a stalker, but \"just a fan that appreciates a good thing\". \nShe has no idea how much she has spent over the years, but reckons she could have bought a couple of houses with the funds. \n\"But you can't put a price on passion,\" she said. \n\"He makes me happy and life is too short not to be happy.\" \nCross has a Springsteen slush fund where any spare money goes, so there is always money for another show. \nShe works for the Government and takes annual leave to follow The Boss around the world. \n\"He's 67, but as fit as a butcher's dog, so as long as he's rocking, I'll be going.\" \nWith 150 concerts to choose from, it could be hard to pick the most memorable moment but two stand out. \nShe had a front row seat at The Spectrum in Philadelphia in 1999 and made lifelong friends. \nCross distinctly remembers the San Siro Stadium concert in Milan too. \n\"Italians go crazy over Bruce and there was even a woman there in her wedding dress,\" she said. \nThere has been only one brief encounter between Cross and her idol so far, when she asked him during his last tour if he would play in Christchurch. \n\"Hopefully that planted a seed.\" \nHer dream is to get her photo taken with him, or to get him to sign her ankle so she can get it tattooed. \n\"The photo would be the ultimate; he's been my co-pilot in life,\" she said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:45:26.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
