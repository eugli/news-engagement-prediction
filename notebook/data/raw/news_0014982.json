No one was injured, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).\nThis happened near 31 Third Hospital Avenue. SCDF said it was alerted to the incident at about 4.20pm, adding that the fire was extinguished using two water jets.\nA fire engine, a Red Rhino and two fire bikes were deployed. The cause of fire is under investigation.\n\nIn its fire safety advisory, SCDF said that the main cause of most vehicle fires in Singapore is due to ignition sources such as overheating and electrical faults within the engine compartment.\nTo prevent vehicles from catching fire, SCDF advised motorists to service their vehicles regularly at authorised vehicle workshops and to ensure that the vehicleâ€™s electrical, engine and fuel systems are checked for any defect.\nApart from scheduled servicing, SCDF said owners are also encouraged to conduct visual checks for any sign of oil leakage.\nIf any sign of smoke is spotted emitting from a vehicle while travelling, SCDF said drivers should pull over safely to the side of the road, turn off the ignition and evacuate everyone from the vehicle.\n- CNA/xk\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:51:05.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
