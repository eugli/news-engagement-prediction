We can have the confidence that they're being a bit more natural in their behaviour.\" Photo: Peter Jones developed the custom-made cameras. (ABC News: Nicole Chettle) \nThe international team involves researchers from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney and the University of Alaska Southeast. The study is published in the journal Marine Biology. \nDr Gabriel Machovsky-Capuska, from the University of Sydney, said understanding the behaviour of wild dolphins was challenging because the mammals spent 90 per cent of their time underwater. \nBut so far, the results are promising. \n\"We try to understand some social patterns,\" Dr Machovsky-Capuska said. \n\"Behaviours between mother and calf. Behaviours between the individual and the group.\" Photo: The cameras weigh just 70 grams each. (ABC News: Nicole Chettle) \nDr Machovsky-Capuska said marine predators like dolphins were \"biomonitors\" of the marine environment, and their feeding patterns could provide vital clues about ocean health. \nThe technology is being refined in a separate project to develop so-called \"shark cams\" to monitor shark behaviour off the New South Wales coast. \n\"Our goal is to try to understand what they do in the wild, from their own perspective and in their own ways, without interfering with them,\" Dr Machovsky-Capuska said. \nThe plan is to use the \"shark cam\" to better understand potentially dangerous predators when they are close to shore and might interact with humans.
