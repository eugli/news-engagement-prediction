His views on abortion are thought to be pro-life, but they are not as well defined as some of Trump’s other prospects. He sided with Hobby Lobby in their challenge to an Affordable Care Act directive requiring employers provide coverage for contraception. \nBut Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in the National Review earlier on Tuesday that Gorsuch is someone “whose legal philosophy is remarkably similar to that” of Scalia. \nHe has served on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado since 2006, and is an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. He grew up in Colorado and is an avid outdoorsman — but holds degrees from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. He even attended Harvard Law School with former President Barack Obama. \nHe has expressed skepticism over a past Supreme Court decision, in a case involving Chevron, that gave deference to federal agencies when interpreting statutes. That could prove important in media-related cases involving the FCC, although the new Republican majority could sidestep litigation on issues such a net neutrality. \nAs legal scholars scanned Gorsuch’s record as it was clear that he was on Trump’s final list, pundits made much of the way that the president made the announcement — in a prime time announcement. Earlier in the day, CNN had reported that Gorsuch and another candidate for the court, Thomas Hardiman, an appellate judge from Pittsburgh, were being brought to Washington for the event, drawing more attention to the unconventional way that Trump was rolling out his selection. CNN even tracked down Hardiman at a Bedford, Pa., gas station, where he was filling up, but he declined comment. Later, there were reports that only one of his potential picks actually made it to D.C., further confusing the situation and, perhaps pleasing to Trump and his team, heightening the anticipation. \nThe White House had originally said that Trump’s pick would be announced on Thursday, but that was moved up by two days. The timing may have been intentional, as Trump weathers criticisms and protests over his signing of an executive order banning entry from seven countries and restricting refugee immigration. \nThe broadcast networks each preempted their programming for the announcement. \nIf confirmed, Gorsuch would fill a seat that has been vacant for nearly a year after congressional Republicans refused to hold a hearing on Obama’s selection, Merrick Garland. Even before Trump announced the pick, some Democrats had vowed to try to block the nomination. \nHis mother, Anne Gorsuch, served as EPA administrator under President Ronald Reagan. \nHe clerked for justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White.
