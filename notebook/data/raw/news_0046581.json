Primark pulls item following complaint A t-shirt similar to the item withdrawn by Primark Credit: Amazon Adam Boult 21 February 2017 • 4:45pm \nA Walking Dead t-shirt, featuring a quote and image from the US TV show, has been withdrawn from sale at Primark after a customer complained it was 'racist'. \nThe shirt was emblazoned with the words 'Eeny Meeny Miny Moe', along with a picture of a baseball bat, in reference to an episode of The Walking Dead in which a character says the phrase before beating a character to death. \nShopper Ian Lucraft told the Sheffield Star he first spotted the item while shopping with his wife. He said: \"We were shocked when we came face to face with a new t-shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text. \n\"It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no-one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.

This image relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America. \n\"It is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.\" Watch | The Walking Dead season 7 trailer 03:06 \n'Eeeny meenie miny moe' has been in existence as a counting-out rhyme since at least the early 20th century, in various iterations. While the use of the N-word was once commonplace, it has generally been replaced with 'Tiger' where the rhyme is still used. \nI n the episode of The Walking Dead the t-shirt refers to, the character who says the rhyme uses the 'Catch a tiger by toe' version. \nMr Lucraft submitted his complaint directly to Primark Chief Executive Paul Marchant, saying: \"I assume that with some past incidents that I see have happened with Primark goods, you are anxious to prevent further bad publicity, and do not want to offend other shoppers.
