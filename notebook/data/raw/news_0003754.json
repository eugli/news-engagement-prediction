See Rihanna's steamy 'Bates Motel' cameo Maeve McDermott , USATODAY 5:59 p.m. ET Jan. 31, 2017 \nRihanna is breathing new life into one of Alfred Hitchcock's most iconic characters. \nThe singer guest-stars as Marion Crane, the Psycho character made famous by Janet Leigh, in the fifth and final season of A&E's Bates Motel . Rihanna heads to 'Bates Motel' for final season \nA new trailer shows her checking into the titular hotel, teasing one line of dialogue, \"Can I get a room?\" \nAs fans familiar with Hitchcock's source material know, Rih will likely suffer a gristly ending in the Psycho prequel series. In the movie, Marion checks into the Bates Motel before Norman, dressed like his mother, Norma, stabs her in the shower. \n\"We wanted to thrust the iconic role (of Marion Crane) into a contemporary spotlight and redefine it in a meaningful and exciting new way. We also heard Rihanna was a fan of the show, and we were huge fans of hers, so it was the perfect collision of creativity and fate,\" Bates Motel executive producers Carlton Cuse and Kerry Ehrin told USA TODAY in a statement. \nBates Motel returns on Feb. 20. \nRihanna checks in.
