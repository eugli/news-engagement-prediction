Getty Images No need to call Kanye West, world— Adele is taking care of this one. The \"Hello\" singer pulled her own Kanye Sunday night at the 2017 Grammys by tearfully dedicating her \"Album of the Year\" award—for 25 —to Beyoncé, insisting that the singer should've won for her visually-stunning album Lemonade . Despite being nominated nine times Sunday night (and putting on a show-stopping performance ), Beyoncé only took home two gramophones for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video (\"Formation\"). Meanwhile Adele swept the award show, snagging five Grammys, beating out Beyoncé for both of the two main categories. Adele first credited the Lemonade singer when accepting her Record of the Year, quickly calling her \"my idol\" and asking, adorably, if Bey could be her \"mummy.\" \"And, of course, my dream, my dream and my idol is queen Bey, and I adore you. You move my soul every single day. And you have done for nearly 17 years. I adore you, and I want you to by my mummy,\" she said. But it wasn't until moments later when Adele took the stage again for \"Album of the Year\" that she fully dedicated her award to Beyoncé, insisting Bey deserved the honor more than her. Her words were extraordinarily humble, and epitomized how many Beyoncé fans felt in the moment. \"I can't possibly accept this award, and I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious,\" Adele said. \"But my life is Beyoncé, and the album to me, the Lemonade album, Beyoncé, was so monumental, and so well-thought out.\" The British artist continued, mentioning the impact Beyoncé has had on black artists and how her honest album was ground-breaking for females everywhere. [It was] so beautiful and soul bearing and we all got to see another side of you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all us artists adore you. You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. And I love you. I always have. And I always will. Beyoncé had a very gracious and emotional reaction to the moment—as the camera panned to her, she had tears flowing down her face. The entire incident recalled the 2009 VMAs when Kanye West rushed the stage as Taylor Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" won over Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies\" for Best Female Video, insisting that Beyoncé's snub was unacceptable—mostly due to systemic racism in the music industry that highlights white artists over black ones. The conversation around the topic has only swelled in recent years with artists like Frank Ocean openly boycotting the Grammys over similar feelings. While Adele's sweet message won't put an end to that, it at least drew attention to Beyoncé's memorable album and her continued efforts to produce revolutionary and thought-provoking art.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:02:10.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
