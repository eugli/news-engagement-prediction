Uttar Pradesh elections 2017: Priyanka Gandhi will accompany her brother at rallies in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathgaon, Rae Bareli and Maharajganj districts. By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 17, 2017 7:15 pm Uttar Pradesh elections: Priyanka Gandhi with brother and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Rae Bareli. \nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Friday took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally in Rae Bareli questioning PM Modi’s claims that the state of Uttar Pradesh has ‘adopted’ him, adding that there was no dearth of youth in that state for an outsider to help develop it. \nReferring to Modi’s remarks claiming that he’s a son of Varanasi and a son of Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said: “…a thought came to my mind, does UP need to adopt an outsider?” \nWATCH VIDEO | Rahul, Priyanka Address Joint Rally In Rae Bareli, Takes Jibe At PM Modi’s ‘Loan Waiver’ Promise \n“PM had said UP has adopted him and that he will look after UP’s development. Does UP need to adopt anyone to look after its development?” Priyanka Gandhi said at the rally, adding: “Is there no youth here that can take UP forward? Each youth here has the potential to become a politician and work for the development of UP… every one has that hope.” \nPriyanka joined her brother and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi at the rally in Rae Bareli. This is her first campaign in the 2017 assembly elections. \nParty’s workers have long been demanding that Priyanka campaign across the state. The Congress high command has clarified that she will restrict her campaign only to Amethi and Rae Bareli. In both these constituencies, Priyanka will campaign for the ten candidates of the Congress Party. It hasn’t yet been decided if she will also campaign for the Samajwadi Party candidates. \nWATCH VIDEO | This Is How Samajwadi Party Patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav Was Attacked on March 4, 1984 \nWhile Priyanka may have decided against a full-fledged campaign, she has been credited with doing much of the back-end work for the on-going seven-phase election. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:12:15.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
