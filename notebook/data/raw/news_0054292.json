Odds are anybody 21 and up got that reference. Then, earlier in 2017, we found out that he was going to be a player-coach in the upcoming Big3 League, though the practice schedule for that is still to be determined.\nOn a similar note, Iverson bumped into a TMZ cameraman who again asked the noticeably buzzed 41-year-old Hall of Famer whether he had any interest in being an NBA coach. His answer was unequivocal. \"Hell no!\" he stated, as he got ready to be driven away. \"[Because] I ain&apos;t coaching no motherfuckers who make more money than me. How the hell am I gonna tell them anything?\"\nRelated Allen Iverson Will be a Player-Coach in Ice Cube's 3-on-3 Bball League Allen Iverson Explains Why He Would Never Want to Coach Allen Iverson Wants to Work for the 76ers' Front Office In case you are unaware, Iverson, along with Kenyon Martin, Gary Payton, Rashard Lewis, Chauncey Billups, Jason Williams, Jermaine O&apos;Neal, and Stephen Jackson, is one of several ex-players confirmed to be in the new league.\nStill, despite the incoming of retired talent, he made it clear that he&apos;d like to also see another ex-MVP come aboard, even if he realizes there&apos;s no chance in hell that&apos;ll actually become a reality. We say that because the camera guy asked him if Kobe Bryant should join, to which AI answered in the affirmative. \"I hope he would,\" he said. \"But I know he ain&apos;t going to do nothing like that.\" He then admitted, like many Lakers/Sixers fans before him, that it&apos;d be a dream of his to team up with Kobe.\nFinally, he also stated that he wanted another legend to sign-up so they could be teammates, even if it would ruin the entire competitive balance. \"My whole thing is I want Shaq to play with me too,\" he said. \"But it ain&apos;t going to go down like that. It&apos;d be too easy.\"\nThe new league is set to debut this summer.
