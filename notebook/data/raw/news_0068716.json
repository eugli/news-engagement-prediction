Virat Kohli will be aiming to continue India’s dominant run while Australia will be hoping to turn their poor record in India around. \nAustralia, ranked second in the world, have lost their last nine Tests in Asia and opted to pack their squad with four specialist spin bowlers to bog down an Indian side unbeaten in their last 19 Tests. \nIndia skipper Virat Kohli said he was not surprised that the opposition were not leaning on their traditional strength of attacking with fast bowlers. \n“Coming to India, playing in summers. Wickets are meant to be dry and they are meant to turn,” Kohli said. “You will have a stronger spin bowling attack then getting six, seven fast bowlers. That is a pretty natural selection.” \nIndia have to be watchful against Mitchell Starc. And Kohli’s know a bit about the 27-year-old paceman who played IPL with him as part of Royal Challengers Bangalore side. \nMitchell Starc was the leading wicket-taker (24) for the side on the turning pitches in Sri Lanka last year, a series in which Australia were blanked 3-0. \n“He has really taken his game to the next level and that’s why he is counted among the top bowlers in world cricket and deserves to be there because he has worked really hard and the results are evident.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:14:51.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
