were on the floor as teenage big-man Thon Maker enjoyed the performance of his debut season so far for the Milwaukee Bucks. \nThat, and more, in the NBA Wrap. \nAUSSIES IN ACTION \nOn a busy night for Australians in the league, Thon Maker enjoyed the performance of his NBA career so far after starting in Milwaukee’s 104-88 loss at Utah. \nMaker scored 12 points — including three 3-pointers, all assisted by countryman Matthew Dellavedova — and the 19-year-old also had three blocks, five rebounds (also individual highs in his debut season) and a steal in a strong all-round performance. media_camera Thon Maker defends against Utah Jazz centre Rudy Gobert. \nDellavedova finished with seven assists and five points while Joe Ingles (five assists, three steals, three points) was one of Utah’s best with a plus/minus rating of +23. Dante Exum had three points in eight minutes off the bench. \nAron Baynes had eight points and seven rebounds off the bench in Detroit’s 118-98 win over New Orleans, amid speculation he could soon be traded . \nAndrew Bogut missed Dallas’ 113-95 win over Philadelphia with a right hamstring injury. — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 2, 2017 \nATLANTA HAWKS 93 — MIAMI HEAT 116 \nGoran Dragic scored 27 points, Dion Waiters added 20 and the Miami Heat pushed the NBA’s longest current winning streak to nine games by easing past the Atlanta Hawks 116-93 on Wednesday night. \nHassan Whiteside scored 18 points and grabbed 18 rebounds for the Heat, who hadn’t won nine straight since November 2013. James Johnson scored 16 before getting ejected in the fourth quarter for Miami (20-30). \nKent Bazemore scored 14 and Dennis Schroder scored 12 for the Hawks (28-21). \nAtlanta’s Taurean Prince was ejected midway through the fourth quarter for pulling Whiteside down from behind and being assessed a flagrant-2. James Johnson retaliated in Whiteside’s defence, and was ejected after getting a technical. \nThat was about the only moment in which the game was competitive after halftime. The 23-point margin of victory matched Miami’s best this season. media_camera Miami Heat forward James Johnson and guard Goran Dragic battle for a loose ball. \nINDIANA PACERS 98 — ORLANDO MAGIC 88 \nC.J. Miles scored 16 points, Glenn Robinson III added 14 and the Indiana Pacers held on to beat the Orlando Magic 98-88 on Wednesday night. \nThe Pacers used their smaller line-up and timely 3-point shooting to keep the struggling Magic from rallying. Orlando didn’t have an answer for Miles’ 3-point shooting, including a trey that pushed the lead to 96-88 in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. Orlando moved within five points a few times in the final period but could not come any closer. \nJeff Teague had 13 points and nine assists and was 8 for 9 from the free-throw line to join six Pacers in double figures. Serge Ibaka led five Magic players in double figures with 20 points. \nThe Pacers have defeated their former coach Frank Vogel four straight times this season and look like a team on the rise. They have won four straight to stay in the Eastern Conference playoff mix. \nOrlando, meanwhile, is letting its playoff hopes fade fast with its second straight loss and fifth in its last six games. The Magic slipped to 8-16 at Amway Center. \nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES 97 — CLEVELAND CAVALIERS 125 \nLeBron James scored 27 points, Kyrie Irving had 14 and a career-high 14 assists and the Cleveland Cavaliers, coming off a losing record in January, defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-97 on Wednesday night. \nCleveland, which went 7-8 last month, began February looking like the defending NBA champions. The Cavaliers held a three-point halftime lead and took control midway through the third quarter. James’ three-point play gave the Cavaliers a 90-70 lead. \nCleveland All-Star forward Kevin Love missed his second straight game because of back spasms, but the Cavaliers had five players in double figures in scoring. \nJames was 11 of 14 from the field, and Irving scored 14 points. Kyle Korver, who has struggled since being acquired from Atlanta last month, scored 20 points, going 8 of 11 from the field and hitting four 3-pointers. Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 14 rebounds. \nKarl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 26 points and Andrew Wiggins added 23 for the Timberwolves, who won five of six to finish January. \nNEW YORK KNICKS 95 — BROOKLYN NETS 90 \nKristaps Porzingis had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and joined a group of mostly substitutes who led a big fourth-quarter turnaround that carried the New York Knicks to a 95-90 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. \nCarmelo Anthony had 15 points for the Knicks, but he was on the bench for the entire fourth quarter after shooting 6 for 22 from the field. Instead, the Knicks rallied behind Willy Hernangomez, who had 16 points and 16 rebounds, and Sasha Vujacic, who made team history by converting a pair of four-point plays in the game. \nThe only other starter on the floor for the comeback was Brandon Jennings -- and he was only starting because point guard Derrick Rose remained out with a sprained ankle. media_camera Kristaps Porzingis. \nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS 98 — DETROIT PISTONS 118 \nKentavious Caldwell-Pope scored a career-high 38 points, leading the Detroit Pistons to a 118-98 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night. \nTobias Harris added 19 points and Andre Drummond 17 for the Pistons, who ended an eight-game losing streak to New Orleans. Detroit had lost three in a row overall. \nNew Orleans blew a nine-point lead in the third quarter and lost its third straight and fourth in five games. Anthony Davis, who scored a career-high 59 points last February at Detroit, had 31 points and 12 rebounds, while Jrue Holliday added 22 points and 11 assists. \nMEMPHIS GRIZZLIES 119— DENVER NUGGETS 99 \nMarc Gasol scored 24 points, Mike Conley had 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the shorthanded Denver Nuggets. \nMemphis led for most of the game and won its third in a row. \nEmmanuel Mudiay had 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds in his return to the Nuggets lineup. Denver came into the game without Nikola Jokic (left hip flexor strain) and Will Barton (left ankle soreness) and then lost two more players before the night ended. \nPoint guard Jameer Nelson was ejected just 4:07 into the game, leaving the Nuggets with three guards, and leading scorer Danilo Gallinari exited late in the third quarter with a left groin strain. \nThe Grizzlies took advantage of a tired Nuggets team that lost on the road to the Lakers on Tuesday. They led by 16 in the first half and increased it to 19 in the third when Gasol had 10 points. \nMILWAUKEE BUCKS 88 — UTAH JAZZ 104 \nRudy Gobert scored 26 points and grabbed 15 rebounds, leading the Utah Jazz to an easy victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. \nThe double-double was Gobert’s 33rd of the season for the Jazz, who also got 27 points from Gordon Hayward. \nUtah took a 61-43 lead into halftime after dominating the second quarter. The Jazz allowed the Bucks to score consecutive baskets just once in the second 12 minutes and their 31 points tied for the third-most they have scored in the second quarter this season. Gobert scored 15 of those 31. \nThe Bucks shot well from 3-point range in the first quarter, going 5 for 8, but were just 4 for 15 the rest of the night. Jabari Parker paced the Bucks with 17 points. \nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS 124 — PHOENIX SUNS 114 \nBlake Griffin scored 29 points and the Los Angeles Clippers bounced back from a humiliating 46-point loss at Golden State to beat the Phoenix Suns. \nThe victory over the team with the worst record in the West left Los Angeles 2-4 since Chris Paul went down with a torn left thumb ligament. \nRaymond Felton added 18 points and J.J. Redick 16 for the Clippers. Los Angeles never trailed, but Phoenix cut the lead to two four times and was down by just one at 94-93 with 10:26 to play. \nEric Bledsoe scored 41 to tie the career high he set two games ago, but Phoenix lost its fifth in a row. Devin Booker added 20 points, his 14th straight game scoring at least 20. \nThe Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan drew a flagrant foul two for flattening Phoenix’s Marquese Chriss and was ejected with 4:52 left in the third quarter. media_camera Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin. \nCHARLOTTE HORNETS 111 — GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS 126 \nWith dad Dell watching live Wednesday night, Stephen Curry hit 11 3-pointers and scored 39 points in three quarters, coming back with vengeance from a one-game absence while ill and leading the Golden State Warriors to a 126-111 blowout of his hometown Charlotte Hornets. \nKlay Thompson added 29 points, matched his career high with eight assists and Kevin Durant had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the NBA-leading Warriors (42-7). \nCurry recorded his fifth career game with at least 11 3s, shot 14 for 20 and 11 of 15 from long range and dished out eight assists facing Charlotte for the second time in exactly a week. \nThe two-time reigning NBA MVP was sick -- his shooting, that is. He sat out Sunday night at Portland with the stomach flu. Nothing slowed him down this night, and he even hit one third-quarter 3 while falling into the front row of fans. \nTORONTO RAPTORS 104 — BOSTON CELTICS 109 \nIsaiah Thomas has started a new trend that’s growing with each fantastic fourth quarter. \nThomas scored 19 of his 44 points in the final quarter to lift the Boston Celtics over the Toronto Raptors 109-104 on Wednesday night in a showdown for first place in the Atlantic Division. \nWhen Thomas hits a shot in the fourth now, his teammates and many in the stands look down at their wrists, simulating looking at a watch to signal that it’s Thomas’ time. \n“I just did it one game and it kept going,” he said. “I’ve got teammates, the fans, signs, everybody in social media is saying: `You know what time it is.” \nIn his last game, Thomas had 24 in the fourth in a victory over Detroit. He’s had four games with 20 or more in the fourth. No other player in the league entered Wednesday with more than one. \n“You have to trap him and get the ball out of his hands,” Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. “He got three wide-open looks in the fourth. That can’t happen.” \nIt was the fifth straight win for Boston, which moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the Raptors in the division and holds the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 seed. \nJae Crowder scored 14 points for the Celtics and Al Horford had 11. Thomas had 18 of Boston’s final 23 points. \nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS 95 — DALLAS MAVERICKS 118 \nSalah Mejri combined to play only nine minutes in Dallas’ recent victories over San Antonio and Cleveland. The Mavericks got another nice victory Wednesday night, and Mejri wasn’t left out of this one. \nThe Tunisian center had 16 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, Seth Curry scored 22 points and Dallas beat the Philadelphia 76ers 113-95 for its third win in a row and fifth in six games. \nThe 7-foot-1 Mejri played 21 minutes with Andrew Bogut out of action and helped Dallas -- the NBA’s worst-rebounding team -- set a season high for boards and outrebound the Sixers 51-39. \nHe scored 10 points, all on dunks, early in the fourth quarter to help the Mavericks lead by 22. Mejri’s point total was one shy of his career high. \nHarrison Barnes added 16 points for Dallas, and Devin Harris had 14. \nJahlil Okafor led the 76ers with 16 points, and Ersan Ilyasova added 13 points and 10 boards. Philadelphia played without starters Robert Covington (bruised right hand) and Joel Embiid (left knee contusion). media_camera \nCHICAGO BULLS 128 — OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER 100 \nThe Chicago Bulls got just the start they needed for their six-game road trip. \nJimmy Butler scored 28 points to help the Bulls rout the Oklahoma City Thunder 128-100 on Wednesday night. \nDwyane Wade had 18 points and seven assists for the Bulls, who shot 60.5 percent from the field overall and 68 percent in the second half. They needed the momentum on a trip that includes games at Houston and Golden State. \n“This was just a great team win from start to finish,” Wade said. “We really came out and executed our game plan, especially offensively.” \nRussell Westbrook had 28 points and eight assists, and Jerami Grant scored a season-high 15 points for the Thunder, who lost their third straight overall and had their five-game home winning streak snapped. \nWestbrook made 10 of 23 shots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:39:09.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
