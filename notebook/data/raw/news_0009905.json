Those protesters, all dressed in black, began throwing bricks and lit fireworks at police the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union building hosting the event. \nEventually, the vandals lit a gas-powered portable floodlight on fire and used police barriers to break the glass windows to the campus books store that takes up the first floor of the student union building. \nAt about 6:20 p.m., UC campus police announced that the event had been cancelled. Officers ordered the crowd to disperse, calling it an unlawful assembly. \nWhile protesters eventually left the area to march in the streets of Berkeley, the violence wasn’t over. \nBy 8 p.m., a large crowd of people had moved off the campus and onto Telegraph Avenue. They smashed ATMs at a Bank of America branch and set several trash fires on Telegraph Avenue. \nAfter marching west on Durant Avenue, the group moved north on Shattuck Avenue, smashing windows and vandalizing a Mechanics Bank branch near the corner of Bancroft Way. \nChase and Wells Fargo branches were also vandalized. A Starbucks location near campus was vandalized and looted. \nPolice also received reports that banks were set on fire in the area of Center Street and Shattuck Avenue. \nIn a statement Thursday morning, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin said, “Unfortunately, last night, a small minority of the protesters who had assembled in opposition to a speaking engagement featuring a prominent white nationalist engaged in violence and property damage.” \n“They also provided the ultra-nationalist far right exactly the images they want to use to try to discredit the vast majority of peaceful protesters in Berkeley and across America who are deeply concerned about where our country is headed,” Arreguin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:02:12.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
