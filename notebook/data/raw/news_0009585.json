After falling to the fringes of contention in July, they bolstered their farm system by dealing Chapman to the Chicago Cubs for a package that included blue chip shortstop prospect Gleyber Torres. \nChapman's dominant relief work with the Cubs was crucial to their World Series championship, and he signed his record deal with the Yankees one month later. \nThe Yankees, mired in their biggest playoff drought since 1994, believe that Chapman will still be in his prime when they do start winning again, perhaps sooner than people envision. \nThey aren’t trying to fool anyone into believing their prospects one day will become their Core Four of Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, but certainly have their fan base believing in their future. \n“There’s a lot of excitement already going on in Tampa,’’ said Steinbrenner, “and we know from our fans, this is as excited as they’ve been in a while. Every spring training brings new hope, but this one feels different. And there’s no doubt the kids are part of it. \n“It’s clear from monitoring social media, and talking to our fans directly, they want to see these kids. Clearly, there’s excitement, the fans want to get to know these guys.’’ \nThe Yankees lowered their payroll this year, and still hope to get below the $197 million luxury tax in 2018. They have $59 million coming off the books after next year with the expiring contracts of retired Alex Rodriguez (who will spend two stints in spring training working with their young players) CC Sabathia and Matt Holliday. Yet, if the Yankees have a chance to win, Steinbrenner insists, they’ll go for it. \n“We will put money back into the club like we always do,’’ Steinbrenner says, “but I think the threshold is a good payroll. I don’t think any team should have to be more than that to win a championship.’’ \nNo one is predicting the Yankees to be in the World Series this year, but if you listen to Steinbrenner, he believes they at least have a shot to return to the postseason. \nAnd whenever that happens, Steinbrenner insists, the family will still own the Yankees. It is not for sale, Steinbrenner repeated four times. The plan is to keep it in the Steinbrenner family forever.’ \n“Look, look this is a family business,’’ Steinbrenner says. “A family business is not always the easiest thing in the world. It has its blessings, and it has its difficulties, but we all work together. And it isn’t going anywhere. \n“We all feel that my Dad did so much for all of us, he would want this. And we love doing it.’’ \nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook: @Bnightengale GALLERY: Largest contracts for relievers Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:00:04.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
