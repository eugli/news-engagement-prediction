The note that was allegedly dispensed at 8.57am was strikingly similar to the ones dispensed by another SBI ATM in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar on February 6. \n“When I checked the note, I could not believe my eyes. It had the words ‘Churan Lable’, ‘Bharatiya Manoranjan Bank’ and ‘Children Bank of India’ written on it. I immediately realised something was wrong and showed it to the guard at the ATM before visiting the branch manager,” said Shashikar. \nThe bank manager, however, returned the hand-written letter to Shashikar by writing that the note in question did not pertain to them “as all the notes are sorted before replenishing them in the ATM”. \nAn angry Shashikar did not report to work that day and returned home to complain about the error and the bank manager’s alleged response to his aunt. \nHis aunt immediately shot off a mail to SBI officials at gm.customer@sbi.co.in, but allegedly received no response. \n“There is no redressal system where I can seek help. Your customer care numbers have been constantly busy and not responding and not giving me the right choice. Your website is not opening,” she wrote in her mail. \nThe family said they did not approach the police as they had little hopes from them, but had safely kept the note with them all this while. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:42.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
