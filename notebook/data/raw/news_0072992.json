Pin \nAt the loft, Ciara bitches at Claire, calling her selfish for not wanting to go to David Banning's funeral. Claire calls that \"really harsh.\" She's going but thinks it's weird since they never met the guy. Ciara says they're going for Julie. Theo gets in between them and they finish arguing. Ciara takes off and Claire goes to change. \nFrom the pub, Julie takes a call from Hope who has food poisoning and can't make the funeral. Julie is understanding. She disconnects and tells Maggie and Doug she doesn't deserve to go to her son's funeral. She feels her son never wanted her around and doesn't blame him. \"I gave him up!\" They remind her she was a teenager. Julie feels they didn't bond because she missed his early years. Maggie doesn't believe that. She and Daniel bonded when they learned they were mother and son, late in life. Maggie knows what Julie's going through, losing a child. Julie isn't sure how she can grieve in front of everyone since she let her son down. Ciara arrives. She overheard some of the conversation and reminds Julie that she's been there when her mom was in prison. \"You're always the one I can count on.\" Julie's touched. Claire arrives and Ciara enlists her help in cheering Julie enough that she agrees to go to the church. \nJust In: Love It or List It hosts Hilary Farr & David Visentin guest on Harry \nAbe finds Valerie at the hospital on her last day on the job.

Dr. Grant interrupts, examines him, and goes. Once she's gone, Chad admits to Abigail that he kissed Gabi. Abigail tears up. She blames it on the hypothermia, knowing he's committed to her. She goes and Chad flashes to her return after faking her death and dancing with her. \nNews: Ex-Days of our Lives writer, Danielle Paige, publishes new novel \nAt TBD, Eduardo tells Dario that Gabs will be fine. Kate appears and curses Eduardo. Dario gives them space and she rants about Eddie kidnapping Sonny, behind her back. Eddie's sorry. Chad and Gabi's lives were on the line. Kate wishes she hadn't started opening her heart to him again. She storms out. Dario returns. Eddie questions if there's something going on between him and Abigail. Dario says she's married. He doesn't want to see his friends get hurt. That's all. \nAt SPD, JJ and Lani agree they made a good team on this last case. JJ admits he suggested to SPD that they rehire her, but Lani's made a life for herself in Miami. She agrees to reconsider moving and they head to the funeral together. \nNew: Hallmark's Chesapeake Shores returns this summer \nAt St. Luke's, Valerie stands by David's casket and says they fought so hard to be together and yet it didn't work out.

Later, her son Eli, played by Lamon Archey , shows up. \"I came to bury my father,\" he tells her when she asks why he's there. \nAbigail walks to the park and gazes at the statue Chad had created in her memory. She regrets letting Chad believe she was dead, and starts beating on the statue with her purse. She grabs the statue and throws it to the ground, sobbing. Dario finds her. She opens up about the kiss between Gabi and Chad. Dario's sorry. He's not surprised. He heard Chad call Gabi's name in his sleep in the hospital. Abby wonders if it's too late for her and Chad. Dario doesn't want to see his sister hurt but thinks Chad will forget about Gabi. Abigail thanks Dario for his friendship and hugs him. \nAbigail returns to Chad's bedside at the hospital and snuggles him.
