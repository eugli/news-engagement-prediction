The pastor had reportedly posted a comment on Twitter, saying, “I curse with anger anyone busy sponsoring Big Brother Nigeria. If they attempt to sponsor it next year, may their resources dry up.” No sooner had the tweet gone viral on social media than Seyi Law and Nwachukwu reacted to the comment on Instagram and Twitter . Reminding the pastor that even Jesus Christ in a moment of anger did not curse those who turned the sacred Temple of Jerusalem into a marketplace, Seyi wrote, “I am not in support of the immoral acts in Big Brother Naija, but as a Christian when the devil brings darkness, you shine your light. If you don’t like what they protray, change your channel. “This type of prayer should be said in your closet, not in public, Mr. Pastor. “You are praying that their resources should run dry. Pastor, do you know how many people that are on the employment list of Payporte and Dufil, the makers of Indomie? “Is Big Brother promoting immorality? Absolutely. Is it good? No. Is Big Brother entertaining? Yes. Does that justify the immorality? No. What are the organisers doing about it? This, as far as I know, the organisers cancelled the shower hours to reduce the level of obscenity and DStv gave us the choice to watch or not. depending on you. What does this mean? It means watching is by CHOICE and not FORCE. Does that mean we can’t voice out our opinions about the decadence of the morality in house? Of course, we can. “Is it right to demand or rain curses for cancellation because of your own beliefs? No. If you don’t like it, stop watching, others watching are not using your eyes. Don’t be a moral bigot at the detriment of others entertainment. This is the reason Christ did not force anybody to be a Christian. He is subtle in convincing you.” Also, tweeting his reaction, Nwachukwu wondered why a pastor should be judging other people. He compared the attitude of some pastors to that of politicians and declared that there is no difference. Addressing the pastor, he queried, “Are you a virgin? Do you drink? Do you smoke? Do you get angry ? What’s your point? Your hypocrisy will only limit you. Change.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
