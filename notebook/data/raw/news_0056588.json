He inspires young players in, like, Scottsdale to pick up a stick. But most of all, he inspires … hip-hop anthems.\nYes, like Alex Ovechkin , Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux before him , Auston Matthews has served as a rap muse. RBLx, a collective from Ottawa that’s dedicated to “be the voice of the youth,” dropped a track called “Auston Matthews” that’s both a tribute to his greatness and the moment in which “Auston Matthews” becomes synonymous with being a young, rich baller on the mean Canadian streets.\nHere’s the video. WARNING: SOME ADULT LANGUAGE.\nWe asked Samuel Siboko, founder of RBLx , about what the hell we just listened to:\nQ. So how does a song about Auston Matthews come about? What inspires it?\nSIBOKO: Auston was the No. 1 draft pick, so everybody was excited to finally see him play. After I witnessed him score four goals, his name was stuck in my head. A few weeks later I got a beat that I really wanted to write a song to and the only thing I could think of was Auston Matthews and the rest is history…\nQ. What lyric best captures the spirit of the song?\nSIBOKO: “19 in the NHL and I ain’t sitting on the bench.”\nQ. Do the Leafs have hip-hop cred?\nSIBOKO: Toronto is one of the biggest cities in hip-hop right now, and I’ve seen a few Maple Leafs players attend Kanye’s and Drake’s concerts.\nQ. When can we expect a Connor McDavid or Patrick Laine diss track?\nSIBOKO: Ha ha ha ha, I don’t think that’s going to happen. Shout out to McDavid though. He’s Canadian.\nQ. Anything else we should know?\nSIBOKO: A lot of people are saying this is a marketing scheme, but it really wasn’t. Making the record wasn’t planned at all, my intention was to make a great song, and I suggest that everyone go check out more of my music.\n—\nYou can find more of that music here.\nSo in the never-ending battles between NHL phenoms, who had the best rap anthem: Auston Matthews above, or Raspy Balboa’s Connor McDavid track?\nWow, that’s close. In the end, we’re guessing our favorite is eventually Marner’s.\n—\nGreg Wyshynski is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Contact him at puckdaddyblog@yahoo.com or find him on Twitter.
