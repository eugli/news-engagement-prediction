Betsy DeVos: Chip Somodevilla/Getty. Grizzly bear: Flickr/Lisa Williams \nBetsy DeVos, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick for Secretary of Education, was just confirmed after Vice President Mike Pence voted for her to break a tie in the Senate. \nMany, including groups like the Teachers Federation of America , are devastated by the outcome, citing her complete lack of experience and the fact that she donated $200 million to the Republican party. People are taking to Twitter to express their outrage, and the point that’s stuck with them most is, unsurprisingly, DeVos’ comment about needing guns in school to protect kids from grizzly bear attacks. \nThey’re hoping she gets eaten by one. Here's hoping Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos is eaten by a grizzly bear. \n— Lisa Pitt (@LisaPitt) February 7, 2017 Betsy freaking De Vos… don't you know nobody likes you. You better hope a grizzly bear doesn't get you @BetsyDeVos \n— Susie Terasaki (@SusieKika4) February 7, 2017 @Bernie_Facts @lhfang Maybe politely ask her over for dinner then feed her to a grizzly bear. \n— Canis leftist (@pseudoscorpione) February 7, 2017 \nThey’re also comparing her to a grizzly bear. . @BetsyDeVos is a threat to public ed, special ed, kids' safety, science, a well-educated citizenry. In short, she is the grizzly bear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:41:11.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
