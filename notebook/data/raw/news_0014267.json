He is like magic. He is pure madness when it comes to dancing. But that's a good thing, every one should have some talent which you're best at.\" \n\nNawaz feels that Tiger is extremely hardworking when it comes to dancing which is his forte. \"You can be a good actor, you can be a great dancer or a singer. When he (Tiger) dances 'mujhe toh bukhaar chadh jaata hai' (I get fever). He is that good with his craft and works hard too.\" \n\n'Munna Michael' is a romantic-musical where Tiger will play the titular role of a boy from the street who idolises pop icon Michael Jackson. \n\nNawazuddin, however, did not divulge much information about his character but he mentioned that it will be a departure from the roles he has often played. \"It is going to be a very different role for me. I can't talk much about it but it's absolutely a good break from the roles I've done in the past. You should see it to realise,\" he said. \n\nApart from this, the 42-year-old actor will also be seen in the biopic of writer Manto , directed by Nandita Das . \n\nNawazuddin does moonwalk with Tiger Shroff 00:25 \nParties & Events 1 78 Parties & Events Tiger Shroff during the premiere of Bollywood film A Flying Jatt held in Mumbai on August 24, 2016.
