Like a scene from a Hollywood blockbuster, a vast and pervasive darkness hangs over Qayyarah, as toxic black smoke billows from the burning wells.\nOil has been a key source of income for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group, making Qayyarah an important strategic town. Its recapture last August by Iraqi forces was a significant gain in their advance towards Mosul.\nBefore fleeing, ISIL fighters used explosives to torch several oil wells, initially as a defensive measure to thwart coalition air strikes. But as the group began losing ground to Iraqi forces, they adopted a scorched-earth strategy, destroying as many oil wells as possible.\nThe operation to extinguish the fires, now into its fifth month, is proving to be a difficult, dangerous and time-consuming task. Teams of firefighters, machine operators, mechanics, engineers and safety experts have come from across the country to join the effort - but regardless of when the flames are extinguished, the human and environmental costs will probably linger for years.\nThick black smoke rises from the burning oil wells of Qayyarah. The wells were set ablaze by retreating ISIL fighters. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nWhen the wind is strong, the thick, toxic smoke spreads throughout the area, often blocking out the sun for days at a time. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nThe danger does not end when the fires are extinguished. Firefighter Joseph Abdullah Juad explains that after the fires are put out, the gas that is then released can be even more deadly. When you smell the gas, after one hour you feel dizzy and cannot breathe, he says.

[Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nFirefighters stand on the edge of a blazing oil pit as they work to extinguish the flames, while one holds up his phone to take a selfie. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nJuad explains how they are fighting the flames by pumping large volumes of water into the heart of the blaze. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nOperations to extinguish the fires have been going on for months. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nFires have been raging since the town of Qayyarah was retaken by Iraqi forces in August. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nA machine operator proudly shows a burn on his hand sustained while fighting a fire. Several firefighters have suffered injuries or developed respiratory problems. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nThe crews working to extinguish the fires include firefighters, machine operators, mechanics, engineers and health and safety experts. [Claire Thomas/Al Jazeera]\nSigns of ISIL are common in Qayyarah, which was under the group's control for more than two years. The ISIL flag is seen painted on an old oil tank by the road leading to the oil wells, a road that was littered with explosives planted by ISIL.
