When is George Michael’s funeral? \nGeorge Michael is expected to have two funerals – one for close pals and family and one for his extended circle of friends. \nThe services were expected to take place in January but could be postponed for longer as delays rumble on. \nThames Valley Police are still awaiting the results of toxicology tests on his organs to work out what caused his death. \nDetectives have said his death is being treated as “non-suspicious”. \nMichael’s funeral cannot take place until his body has been released by the coroner. \nIt has been rumoured his pal Sir Elton John could perform at one of the events. \nHe was reportedly left “physically shaking” after singing their 1991 collaboration Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me – the song he is rumoured to be planning to play at the service. \nElton famously sang Goodbye England’s Rose at Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997.

The results of these tests are unlikely to be known for several weeks. \n“Thames Valley Police will prepare a file for the Oxfordshire Coroner. \n“Mr Michael’s death is still being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.” Who will inherit George Michael’s fortune? \nPrior to his tragic death at the age of just 53, George is believed to have amassed a huge fortune worth a reported £105million. \nHe raked in huge sums over the years, with his accounts showing he earned more than £48million from touring between April 2006 and March 2008 alone. \nAnd with no husband, children or any obvious heirs there has been some speculation over what will happen to his estate. \nIt has not yet been confirmed who will inherit the Wham! singer’s fortune, but there is a shortlist of his nearest and dearest who are expected to be remembered in his will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:35:57.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
