(Kyodo News via AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, February 25, 2017, 5:18 AM \nOne of the women suspected of carrying out a spy novel-like attack that killed North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s half-brother has revealed that she was paid $90 for what she thought was going to be a prank, an official said Saturday. \nSiti Aisyah, a 25-year-old Indonesian native, killed Kim Jong Nam at the Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia on Feb. 13 by spraying him in the face with the VX nerve agent — one of the most powerful poisons in the world. \nMalaysian officials have previously rejected Aisyah’s claim that she and Doan Thi Huong were duped into smearing something onto Kim’s face while he was walking through one of the airport’s terminals. The story went viral after it became apparent that Doan had worn a sweatshirt with the letters “LOL” emblazoned across the front.

She also told investigators that she did not want her parents to visit her while in custody. \nTrump, Abe discussed N.

Though Kim Jong Nam wasn’t a political threat — having been exiled from North Korea for taking a secret trip to Japan’s Disneyland in 2001 — Kim Jong Un might have considered him a potential rival in the secluded country’s dynastic dictatorship. \nThe revelation that the VX nerve agent most likely caused Kim’s death appears to be yet another indication that North Korea could have been behind the mysterious murder. The nation never signed a treaty that banned the deadly substance and has spent decades developing a sophisticated chemical weapons program. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:46:40.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
