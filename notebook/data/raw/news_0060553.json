No.” \nMorgan then asked Farage about former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, who was once recorded telling activists that Britain should not be sending foreign aid to developing countries, which he referred to as “Bongo Bongo Land.” \nAlthough Farage said Bloom “was wrong to use the term ‘Bongo Bongo Land,’” he defended the ex-MEP’s stance on foreign aid. \n“Was he right about us sending foreign aid to corrupt regimes all over the world when we could spend it better at home? Of course.” \nAsked if he would ever consider running for prime minister, Farage said: “If this political class let us down on Brexit, then anything can happen.” \nWhen Morgan asked Farage about his intention of moving to America, Farage said he will not go anywhere until he is certain that Brexit has been carried out appropriately.

I’ll see out my time in the European Parliament, so I’ll be there until 2019.” \nFarage also took the opportunity to deny accusations that his party takes a racist stance. \n“Our policies are common-sense policies and when you look at the sheer hundreds of hours of interviews and speeches I have done, you really struggle to find anything you can put in that category.” \nDuring the interview, Farage expressed his devotion to his work, saying it is not “a job, but a calling.” \n“It’s dominated my life from the mid-1990s, this is what I did seven days a week,” he said. \n“When you’re building it, you work like crazy, and when you’ve built it, there’s no escape from it.” \nMorgan also asked Farage about his marriage after his wife Kirsten admitted they had been living “separate lives” for years. \nFarage replied that one of the toughest aspects of being married was the “abuse” he received from critics. \n“I think it’s very difficult to be married to me, before I was in politics it was tricky, very difficult,” he said. \n“I can take the abuse, it doesn’t bother me, but it has had an effect on everyone around me. There’s the nasty side to it.” \nFarage admitted that he does place his “UKIP fanaticism” above anything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:15:13.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
