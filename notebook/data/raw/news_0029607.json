That would be a democracy, would it? The fact that people voted for Brexit ?\" GETTY Actress Isabelle Huppert said Brexit would make 'everyone poorer' \nHe continued: “And listen, we'll have to see how Donald Trump turns out. Much of what Mr Trump has done is absolutely reprehensible, but guess what? He also won by democracy. \n“If these people loathe it so much, go into politics.
