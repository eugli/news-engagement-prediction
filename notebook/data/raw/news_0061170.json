Of arguments and division, of headshaking, jaw-clenching, meal-spitting anger. \nBecause let’s face it, irrespective of what side of the fence, or ahem wall, you’re on, tensions now run higher than ever. \nDon’t get me wrong, I’m not about to pretend to be a picture of pristine calmness, I mean, I’m angry a lot of the time. On the face of it, I think anger is a perfectly understandable and justifiable response to what is occurring around us daily. \nBut understandable and justifiable aren’t the same as effective — just ask anyone whose frustration has led them to break the very thing they were trying to fix. Donald Trump’s Muslim ban caused a mass outpouring of anger, and action, such as this demonstration at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, but it’s important not to allow anger to cancel out empathy.

I never have to look hard to see the collateral damage of overwhelming and crippling stress, broken relationships, blunted communication and emotional hurt which trails behind them. In most cases the anger is a secondary emotion, the outward, observable expression of some other usually much deeper, emotion — sadness, hurt, fear, or uncertainty.
