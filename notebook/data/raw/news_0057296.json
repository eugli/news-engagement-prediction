It is especially so because three of these worlds are capable of having oceans. Of all the so-called exoplanets we have found, these are in the category most likely to be able to support life.\nDetecting an exoplanet is no easy thing. Their light is swamped by the far brighter star they are orbiting, and so their existence is inferred indirectly. Instead we look for transits, as when the planet of Venus in our own solar system transits across our star, the sun. Whenever a planet transits in front of another star, the star appears slightly dimmer. From the size of the dimming we can tell how large the planet is; from how often it repeats we can infer the length of a planet's 'year, and from the length of its year we can infer how far away it is from its parent star.\nTrappist-1 planet discovery T hese factors matter enormously to the question of where we might find life. Size matters because large planets tend to be gas planets, like our neighbours Saturn and Jupiter. These are not thought to be propitious for life, wherever they are found. Distance matters because there is only a narrow range of temperatures in which water can survive in liquid form. Too cold and it freezes; too hot and it all boils away. Since liquid water is necessary for and chemically foundational to all life on earth, it is in this range that we would expect life to develop. Three of the seven planets announced this week are in this \"goldilocks\" zone.\nThis gives us a hint that finding a second earth is not just a matter of if, but when. You can just imagine how many worlds are out there that could have a habitable ecosystem that we can explore Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa O f course we don't yet understand how life began on earth, and it could be that a quite different kind of life could begin in a quite different way. In our solar system there is a moon of Saturn called Titan which is minus 160 degrees celsius and hosts lakes of liquid methane. There can't be any earth-like life there, but there could be a different kind. But the best way to start is to look for what we know, where we know – a strategy of \"searching under the streetlight\". We should deploy all available techniques to discover whether any ex-planet resembling the Earth displays evidence of supporting a biosphere.\nBecause this is only the start. We may not yet have big enough telescopes to observe exoplanets directly, but we will in ten years' time. The James Webb Space Telescope , along with the next generation of 30+ meter ground-based telescopes, will come online in the 2020s, With those, we will be able to really learn something about these planets – whether they have atmospheres with water, whether they show any evidence of liveability, even whether they look green. Of course they will still be pinpricks of light to us, but we can analyse that light and see if it has colours characteristic of a biosphere.\nWatch | What are exoplanets? 01:32 M oreover, the discovery of these planets make it almost inevitable that others like them will be found. In order to detect a planet its orbit must take it across the path of its sun - from our perspective. But the chance of this actually happening with any random orbit is about one in 50. That means that the exoplanets we can detect via the transit method are only a small fraction of the exoplanets which exist. That is a very significant point, because it implies that there must be very many life-supporting planets – and those announced this week are unlikely to be the closest.\nThe discovery of multiple rocky planets with surface temperatures which allow for liquid water make this amazing system an exciting future target in the search for life. Dr Chris Copperwheat J ust because a planet is habitable it does not mean it is actually inhabited . Even if it was, it might only be inhabited by very simple life. Although the origins of life are growing less mysterious every year, we still don't understand them, and we can't exclude the possibility that its appearance here was a fluke so rare it could only happen once in the entire galacy. Beyond that, the course of evolution on Earth was influenced by many specific factors such as phases of glaciation, the Earth's tectonic history, asteroid impacts, and so forth. So it's possible that evolution has \"bottlenecks\" key stages in the process which are hard for anything to get through, of which the transition from single-celled life (which emerged quite quickly here) to multi-cellular life (which took another 3 billion years) may be one.\nIt is very hard to say whether there are other life forms out there. This is more a question for biologists than for astronomers. But I'd guess that simple forms of life may be widespread, while advanced (even \"intelligent\") life is rare. It is unreasonable to make any firm bets at this stage.\nStill, we may in this decade come to understand life's origins – and if we are to find life beyond the Earth, these relatively nearby planets are specially good candidates. They are also very unlikely to be the last, which will be encouraging to astronomers as they continue their search through this vast but potentially teeming galaxy.\nNASA Greatest Achievements and Discoveries, in Pictures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:10:51.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
