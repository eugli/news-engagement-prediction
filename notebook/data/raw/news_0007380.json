Photo: Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images President Trump’s “big, beautiful” wall on the U.S.-Mexican border will be done in the “next two years” if Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has his way.\nIn an interview set to air Thursday on Fox News , Kelly says the wall will not be built all at once. “The wall will be built where it’s needed first, and then it will be filled in. That’s the way I look at it,” he says.\nKelly mentions in the interview that the wall will not look the same along the entirety of the border. While some areas will call for the physical barrier most have in mind, others will require a higher-tech approach. “There will be the physical wall and then parts of the wall that you can actually see through because it will rely on sensors and other technology,” he says.\nIf Kelly is to achieve his ambitious timeline of finishing the wall by 2019, he’s going to need some help from Congress to pay for it. Cost estimates to build the wall range as high as $25 billion, and Thursday morning on Fox & Friends, House Speaker Paul Ryan said “we will give the financing to Secretary Kelly and the border security plan.”\n“He will have the funding to do it,” Ryan adde, without mentioning that the funding, despite what Trump has promised, won’t be coming from Mexico.\n. @SpeakerRyan : President Trump will have the funding to build the wall, and he already has the authorization to do it pic.twitter.com/gCP91csxII\n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) February 2, 2017 Tags: john kelly border wall mexico Top Stories Trump Throws Curveball at Bibi, Urging No ‘Unilateral’ Action on Settlements An Asteroid Buzzed Earth Today, the Fourth Near-Miss of the Year Most Americans Disapprove of Trump — and His Executive Orders Most Viewed Stories U.S. Military Sources Claim Trump Approved Yemen Strike Without Enough Preparation The Serial Creators’ Next Podcast Series Sounds Like a Juicy, Bingeable Delight Trump Is Reportedly Obsessed With How the People Who Work For Him Dress America’s Leading Authoritarian Intellectual Is Working for Trump What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 There Was One Explicit Sex Scene in Girls That Even HBO Wouldn’t Allow This Poll Is the Best News Liberals Have Had in a Long Time Here’s the Full Beyoncé Maternity Photo Shoot You Were Waiting For A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ White House Considers Deporting Legal Immigrants for Being Poor Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Who Are the ‘Black Bloc’ Protesters Who Rioted on Inauguration Weekend?
