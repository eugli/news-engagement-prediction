The case is being investigated under Section 379 of the Penal Code for theft. \nACP Alzafny said investigations revealed that the alleged theft was solely motivated by profit. \n“Our initial investigations also indicated that those arrested did not know they had taken items which were radioactive,” he said. \nHe also did not know how many in his 16-member team had been exposed to radiation. \n“Blood tests will be taken from all the policemen involved as well as the suspects to determine that,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:45:56.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
