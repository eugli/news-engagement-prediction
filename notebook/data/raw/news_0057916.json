Stephen Bear en route to his second date (Photo: E4) \nWell, he was meant to be going on his second date. \nHe had already swiftly ended their first, not actually telling her he was leaving and ditching her in a pub on her own. \nFor some reason, she decided to give him a second chance and agreed to meet up with him again. She soon regretted it... (Photo: E4) \nBut in the taxi on the way to the restaurant, he claimed he was going to really try to leave his 'Bear' character at home and be the real Stephen. \nThen he appeared to get cold feet, saying he couldn't do it and jumping out of the taxi, leaving Stacey sitting on her own in the restaurant for over an hour. Poor Blue Lips was left on her own (Photo: E4) \nStacey eventually realised what was happening and called the dating agency to let Nadia Essex know she'd been stood up. \nOne Twitter user didn't mince his words, saying: \"What a disgusting piece of sh** Bear is. Leaving that poor girl high and dry. What a pr***.\" \nAnother young woman commented: \"I take it back what he did was f***ing awful. Who the hell does he think he is to do that to women.\" \nOne said she hated Bear, adding: \"His attitude to women is f***ing atrocious!! That poor girl how humiliating!!\" \nThe preview for tonight's show, played at the end of the episode, seemed to suggest that it might be the end of the road for Bear. \nWill Nadia and Eden finally kick him off?
