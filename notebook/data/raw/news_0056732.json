This is a crime against their own people,” the former Ukrainian leader said. \n“The current authorities did not make a single attempt to talk to the people, who were against the coup,” he argued, adding that Kiev should have found a way towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict at that stage. \n“Any blockade of the Donbass region is not in the interests of Ukraine… if they do not need Donbass, they should say it openly, but if they do, then start negotiations with these people, why torment them?” he said.

The report also shed light on a government-run torture program and clandestine detention centers.
