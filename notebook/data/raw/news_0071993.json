It's one of the companies the media establishment is betting on to capture the interest of the next generation of smartphone-addicted video customers. \nAwesomenessTV's ownership structure has changed over the last few years. In 2013, DreamWorks Animation bought it for \"at least $33 million,\" according to Variety . When Comcast bought DreamWorks, it took over the majority stake. But Verizon and Hearst also own a piece of AwesomenessTV, to the tune of 24.5% each. Verizon's investment valued the company at $650 million . \nBrett Boutier, AwesomenessTV's president, will take the reins. \nIn a memo to staff Wednesday announcing his departure, Robbins didn't give much away. “After an amazing ride, five fantastic years building an awesome company and brand alongside an incredible team of people, the time is right for me to pass the baton and seek new challenges,” he wrote . \nThe big question is what's next for AwesomenessTV. \nVerizon and AwesomenessTV recently killed plans for a premium service designed to be an \"sort of HBO for millennials,\" according to Variety . Their partnership will instead focus on Go90, Verizon's free mobile app. \nLast week, at the Code Media conference , Robbins said he wanted to open AwesomenessTV up to political coverage in the wake of President Trump. \n“I’ve kind of been urging our company to really move this way for the last year, and it’s mostly because — obviously I care about what’s going on and am very impacted by it personally — but in my house, my 18 and 17 year old ... until this past year, all we talked about was basketball. We've grown up talking about sports and stuff, and all of a sudden, all of our conversations with my two boys is politics, and it’s about what's going on,\" Robbins said. \nBut now Robbins is out, and it will be left to Boutier to chart the direction of the company.
