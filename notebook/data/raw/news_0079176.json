The Mercedes has trialled a ‘T-wing’ to achieve the same goal. The Ferrari has both, along with very slender sidepod openings. \nNow Red Bull’s RB13 has thrown another aero feature into the mix: a large hole in the tip of its nose. The hole in question, clearly visible on the tip of the nose. Source: Supplied \nUnder both the old and new F1 rules, cars are allowed to have a hole in the nose to duct air into the cockpit in the name of keeping the driver cool. \nBut Red Bull’s design team may just have pulled a fast one on their rivals, according to former F1 technical director Gary Anderson. \n“This duct is a good idea, because if you look at the other 2017 cars there is a solid surface at the end of the nose and for the airflow to get around this it has to decide on its stagnation point, in other words where it separated,” Anderson told Autosport . \n“With this duct you will probably get more uniform airflow around the sides of the nose structure. \n“There are some other ducts where the nose meets the chassis, and while it’s impossible to know for sure there’s every chance they are to feed the cooling of ERS components that will be located low down in the sidepods and close to the centre of the car.” A rear-facing duct is also visible just behind the bulkhead at the front of the chassis. Source: Supplied \nTo his trained eye, the hole appears to be much bigger than the allowable 1500 square millimetres under the rules — although he concedes that it may converge down to the legal size. \nThe car will appear on track for the first time on Monday when the first round of preseason testing gets underway in Spain. \nBBC Sport’s Andrew Benson expects the car to look different to its launch spec, while its first open sighting will allow a better look at what the purpose of the nose hole may be. \n“The angle of the Red Bull shown in the video did not allow sight of what are expected to be a complicated and intricate series of airflow conditioners behind the nose, in between the front wheels and beside the cockpit, which enhance aerodynamic downforce,” Benson wrote. Ricciardo happy to be pushed 0:34 \n“It is suspected that the car was launched without many of its aerodynamic parts, which it will run in testing. \n“Their chassis was pretty much there with the (Mercedes) in 2016 and it would be a surprise if that was not the case again this year — Red Bull were the team who best interpreted the last major chassis rule change, dominating from 2010-13.” Top view of the Red Bull RB13’s nose. Source: Supplied \nThe drivers of the RB13 are quite happy with how their new car looks. \n“First impression was that it looks quite beautiful,” Daniel Ricciardo said of his new ride. \n“It looks quite sleek; they look like the fastest cars in the world.” \nTeammate Max Verstappen agreed, particularly pleased with the RB13’s “aggressive” look. \n“Hopefully when it looks that aggressive it will be fast, but we still have to wait and see,” he said. \nNot everyone is a fan, however; Spanish publication Marca jokingly suggested the tip is “almost shaped like a vacuum cleaner” ...
