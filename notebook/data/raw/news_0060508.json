Not even Ricky Rubio or Derrick Rose? \nAs the clock struck midnight (er, 3 p.m. ET) on Thursday's NBA trade deadline, the basketball world was left wanting more, as all of the marquee players whose names were tossed around in recent trade talks stayed put. Combined with the fact that the blockbuster DeMarcus Cousins-New Orleans Pelicans trade went down four days earlier — the league's highly-anticipated, oft-chaotic post-All-Star break tradition was nothing short of underwhelming. \nThere were, however, several under-the-radar moves made that could have immediate — as well as long-term — implications. Thursday's three biggest winners \nDallas Mavericks: Nerlens Noel, the No. 6 pick in the 2013 draft, was traded by the Philadelphia 76ers to the Mavs for Justin Anderson, Andrew Bogut and a heavily-protected 2017 first-round pick. Noel's presence gives the Mavs a young, defensive-minded big man to build around as Dirk Nowitzki's Hall of Fame career winds down and the franchise looks forward. Veteran Deron Williams was waived two hours after the deadline, a move that will likely put the 23-year-old Cinderella Story, Yogi Ferrell, in the driver's seat at point guard. \nGALLERY: TRADE DEADLINE TRACKER", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:12:01.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
