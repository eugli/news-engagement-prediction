Their conditions can prevent them from earning a living, keeping them locked in a cycle of poverty. \nThe Huffington Post recently sat down to discuss the link between poverty and disease with Dr. Frank Richards, an expert in parasitic infections and a director of multiple programs at The Carter Center , which works with public health issues around the globe. \nRichards describes the neglected illnesses as “horror movie diseases.” He told HuffPost that although afflicted communities face huge obstacles to eliminating these conditions, local people recognize the importance of new medicines and information and are volunteering to make sure critical treatments reach their families and neighbors. \n“I believe it’s a big piece of community empowerment,” Richards said, “where we can move away from a perpetually paternalistic attitude, to self-help, community environment and stories that we always like to hear of people taking control of their own lives.” \nWatch the full interview with Richards, above. \nVideo produced by Will Tooke, shot by Chelsea Moynehan, Dan Fox, Shane Handler and Mike Caravella and edited by Lillian Janney.
