Fans will vote online for five finalists from a 10-man group that also includes Steve Bedrosian, Scott Rolen, Placido Polanco and Manny Trillo. A selection committee then will select the 2017 honoree. Major League Baseball recently approved the Phils' request to honor Rose, who remains ineligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a result of betting on baseball. \n\"He was a big part of the 1980 championship,\" MacPhail said. \"I think that's appropriate.\" \nâ€¢ Phillies Wall of Famers \nIt is difficult to imagine Rose not being inducted in 2017. The Phillies inducted Jim Thome last summer. Thome played just three-plus seasons (2003-05, 2012) with the team, finishing fourth in National League MVP Award voting in 2003 and making the '04 NL All-Star team. Rose is arguably the greatest free-agent signing in franchise history. He played five seasons with the Phils (1979-83), helping them win the 1980 World Series and the '83 NL pennant. Rose also made four NL All-Star teams, won one Silver Slugger Award and finished in the top 15 in NL MVP Award voting twice. \nOh yeah, Rose's 4,256 career hits also are the most in MLB history. \nThe Reds inducted Rose into their Hall of Fame last summer. The Phillies deferred to the Reds, wanting them to honor him first. \n\"We were aware that the Commissioner made a distinction between potential employment for Rose as opposed to being honored for his achievements,\" MacPhail said. has covered the Phillies since 2003, and for MLB.com since 2009.
