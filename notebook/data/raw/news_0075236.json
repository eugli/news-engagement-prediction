Joined by his pregnant wife Storm and his children, the 39-year-old took to his social media sites to share a beautiful picture with his loved ones ahead of the glamourous soiree. In the caption, he wrote: “Here we go! #EmeraldsandIvy2017 Back on the steps of the beautiful @corinthialondon #HomefromHome #London @cr_uk @mariekeatingfoundation.” \nHis charity, the Marie Keating Foundation, was set up by the star and his four siblings after their beloved mother passed away from cancer when Ronan was just 20. Since then, Ronan has tried to raise funds for Cancer Research. The former pop star looked dapper in a velvet emerald green blazer, while his wife happily showcased her blossoming bump in an elegant black strapless gown. Their new baby will be the first child for the couple - Ronan has three children from his previous marriage to Yvonne Connolly - Jack, 17, Missy , 15, and 11-year-old Ali .

Ali FaceTimes every day – how big is the bump, can I see the bump?'\" His wife Storm, who announced her pregnancy news in December, added: \"She rubs the belly when it kicks. She has the most amazing questions, some of them are really grown up and I don't even know how to answer them.\" Storm also noted: \"Every time I see him with his kids I fall more and more in love, he is the most incredible father.\" A post shared by Storm Keating (@stormykeating) on Feb 26, 2017 at 9:26am PST \nEXCLUSIVE: Ronan and Storm's wedding album \nThe pair - who married at the Archerfield House in East Lothian, Scotland, in August, 2015 - originally met on the set of Australia's X Factor in 2012, when Ronan acted as a judge following the breakdown of their previous marriages. Ronan ended his 17-year-union with Yvonne Keating , while Storm, 35, divorced Sydney financial director Tim Ivers in April 2012.
