The ad — which has already been released on YouTube — doesn’t mention Trump by name, but it spurred the 45th president to slam it early this morning on Twitter as “bad” and an attempt by the company to “help save its failing reputation.”\nFor first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation.
