Participants will also draft a concrete plan of action for implementing the policy visions and strategies that they develop in the workshops. \nThe conference is structured around three main formats: keynote speeches, panels, and workshops. The first day of the conference will begin with an opening ceremony with keynote speaker David O’Sullivan, ambassador of the European Union to the United States, before focusing on the first two workshop sessions: each featuring a policy adviser, professor, and moderator. The themes of the workshops include identity, migration, political legitimacy of institutions, productivity, foreign and security policy, and entrepreneurship. \nThe afternoon will feature an European Horitzons Chapter Information Session after the “Opportunities of Brexit” panel. Moderator Eileen O’Connor, formerly with the U.S. State Department and now vice president of communications at Yale, will lead the discussion with panelists Ambassador Peter Wittig from Germany, Ambassador Gérard Araud from France, O’Sullivan, Professor Robert Shiller of Yale, and Catherine Stihler, a member of the European Parliament. \nThe second day of the conference will begin the “European Public Sphere panel,” where moderator Michael Kaczmarek from the European Parliament Research Service (EPRS) will talk with participants Kevin Delaney from Quartz, Martin Sandbu from the Financial Times, Eschel Alpermann from EPRS, and Alexander Goerlach of Harvard. Participants will also have a third workshop to continue their discussions and policy proposals. \nSee a detailed schedule of the conference. \nEuropean Horizons convenes several conferences throughout the year, publishes research and policy papers through its academic journal, The Review of European and Transatlantic Affairs, and maintains chapters across universities in the United States and Europe.
