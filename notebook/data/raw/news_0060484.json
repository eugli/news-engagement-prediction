Credit: AP \nA 10-year-old boy who was bitten by a funnel web spider has survived after being treated with 12 vials of antivenom - reportedly the largest dose ever administered in Australian history. \nMatthew Mitchell was bitten on his finger by a spider hidden in a shoe at his home in Berkley Valeon, New South Wales, on Monday evening. \nThe boy, who was helping his father clean the house at the time, managed to flick the funnel-web off his finger with his other hand. \nThe boy was taken to Gosford Hospital where his symptoms worsened. \nHe suffered numerous seizures and reportedly began sweating and frothing at the mouth as his eyes dilated. \nDoctors administered 12 vials of life-saving antivenom before he stabilised, and was released the following day. \nTim Faulkner, General Manager of the Australian Reptile Park, said: \"I've never heard of it, it's incredible.\" \nSpeaking to AAP, he said the boy is \"as lucky as they get\" following the bite. \n\"And to walk out of hospital a day later with no effects is a testament to the antivenom.\" \nThe spider was caught and taken to the Australian Reptile Park where it is being used for the antivenom milking programme.
