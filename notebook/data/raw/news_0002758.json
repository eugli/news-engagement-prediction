She did not apologize for spreading misinformation. \nRelated: Trump adviser cites non-existent 'massacre' defending ban \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is sure to be pressed about it at Friday afternoon's briefing. \nConway's error was widely mocked on social media Thursday night and on cable news Friday morning. Observers say it is part of a pattern -- Conway and other Trump aides have been called out for multiple misstatements during live television interviews and briefings. And then they've attacked the press for reporting on them. \nSome critics say television networks should think twice before booking Conway. \nIn this case, MSNBC's Chris Matthews was the interviewer, and the interview was taped ahead of time. \nConway cited the case of two Iraqi refugees (who were, in fact, arrested in 2011 on terrorism charges), then said they \"were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn't get covered.\" \nThere was no massacre. \nMatthews moved on when Conway said it, and he didn't correct the record later on in the program. \nSo far, there's been no response from Matthews. \nBut the alternative fact lit up social media. Conway didn't respond overnight. On Friday morning, she tweeted that \"I meant to say 'Bowling Green terrorists,'\" citing a story from ABC News. \nConway later deleted that tweet, but posted other tweets about it , saying \"Honest mistakes abound.\" She said \"last night, prominent editor of liberal site apologized for almost running a story re: tweet from fake account.\" \nThen she once again brought up the Time magazine reporter's error from January 20. \nThat reporter, Zeke Miller, was one of the pool reporters on Trump's first day in office. When he was in the Oval Office, he spotted a bust of Winston Churchill in a new location. He mentioned this in a group email, which led other reporters to ask about the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., which had replaced the Churchill bust during the Obama years, sparking a brief controversy. \n\"Zeke said he had looked for it and not seen it,\" Time's editor in chief Nancy Gibbs explained later. \"As a result, a pool report by another reporter sent out at 7:31 p.m., based partly on Zeke's observations, included this: 'More decorating details: Apart from the return of the Churchill bust, the MLK bust was no longer on display.'\" \nMiller and other reporters tweeted out the erroneous information. It was not reported on television networks like CNN. \nWithin minutes, Miller found out that the MLK bust was still in the office. \"It was apparently obscured by a door and an agent earlier. My sincerest apologies,\" he wrote to his colleagues. \nSpicer said in a tweet that he accepted Miller's apology, but at a White House briefing later, he asked where the apology to President Trump was for what he termed a \"racially charged\" report and accusation. \nAnd Trump was outraged by the error. He brought it up repeatedly in speeches and interviews. \n\"They're not saying the bust is taken out. What they're saying is I'm a racist. That's what they're saying. That's a very serious charge,\" Trump told Sean Hannity almost a full week later. \nConway also blasted Miller's error multiple times. She told Hannity that the media did not take the mistake seriously enough. \n\"The MLK bust story is so significant in this way -- and I -- I talked about it on 'Meet The Press,' I talked about it on 'This Week,' I talked about it on all three Sunday shows. I know Reince talked about it on your network. And it got zero coverage.\" \nShe said \"that is a crime\" and suggested it is proof of a \"presumptive negativity\" among the White House press corps. \nThe next time a reporter makes a simple error like Miller's, perhaps Conway and the rest of the Trump team might remember her own words: \"honest mistakes abound.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published February 3, 2017: 12:10 PM ET ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:40:00.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
