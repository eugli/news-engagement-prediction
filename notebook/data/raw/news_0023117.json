Twenty returning castaways are set to dig their toes in the sand for another attempt at winning $1 million on Survivor . In its 34th edition, Survivor is twisting things up again with a \"Game Changers\" theme featuring a cast of former strategic, strong players. \n\"Let's be clear what we call a game changer,\" host Jeff Probst said. \"My definition is people who are willing to make a move to try to change the game. We picked 20 people who love to play.\" \nFor me, that means people like winners Tony Vlachos or Sandra Diaz-Twine. Those signify true \"game changers,\" and thankfully both of them will be on this season. Could Sandra pull off her third victory? We shall see. \nMore: Why Survivor 's Jeff Probst is wrong about not doing an all-winner season \nBut when looking at the lineup, many of these contestants don't match Probst's definition at all. Some of them are questionable when it comes to being qualified as a game changer. With dozens upon dozens of previous strategic competitors worthy of retribution, we're stuck with a gaggle of forgettable, boring choices. \nLet me explain. Image: CBS \nFirst up, there's Hali Ford. I bet you can't remember who she is without a quick Google search. Heck, you may still not recall anything about her even if you did look her up. Let me refresh your brain a bit. Image: Tumblr \nShe competed on Survivor: Worlds Apart (Season 30) as part of the \"No Collar\" tribe. The most notable thing she did the entire season was create the merged tribe's name, which just so happened to be among the worst ever -- Merica. Overall, she was the eighth person booted that season, becoming the first member of the jury. Game changer? Nope. \nThen there's Brad Culpepper. Image: Giphy \nWhile I could see him reaching a pseudo \"game changer\" level for setting a precedent of burning hidden Idol clues, he also doesn't stand out much beyond that. He was the sixth person eliminated from Survivor: Blood Vs. Water (Season 27), and didn't even land on the jury. \nWe also have Troy \"Troyzan\" Robertson, who is most remembered for shouting \"this is my island!\" when his back was up against the wall on the lackluster Survivor: One World (Season 24). Image: Tumblr \nAlthough I think his nickname alone makes him memorable, I don't necessarily think there's a strong argument to be made that he's a true \"game changer.\" \nThe casting of Brad and Troyzan has another odd layer to it, though. I think what makes the decision to cast these men even so strange is connected to the fan vote, which determined the cast of Survivor: Cambodia â€” Second Chance (Season 31). If the fans didn't tally enough ballots to bring these guys back for that season, then what makes the producers at CBS think we suddenly want to watch them play again? I know I don't. \nThen we have Debbie Wanner. Image: Tumblr \nMemorable? Absolutely. Game changer? Forget about it. Although she stuck around Survivor: Kaoh Rong (Season 32) for quite a while, her biggest moments came from the kooky Coach-esque conversations she gushed when describing her endless list of jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:04:07.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
