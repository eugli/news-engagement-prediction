Editor Advertisement \nFinally, the huge fire at the Tuas Waste management plant was put out. It took about 200 fireman 4 hours to successfully fight the fire. Thankfully, all the workers at the plant managed to be evacuated before the fire engulfed the while building. \nThere was only one reported case of injury in the fire, that of a firefighter who went down with exhaustion. Periodic explosions were also heard as the firefighters were fighting the blaze. As the fire involved chemical waste and flammable materials, the police had advised the public to stay away from the area. \nWe should give our gratitude to these firefighters, who risked their life and spent 4 exhaustive hours in trying to fight the fire. Thank you, SCDF! \nLenny P \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
