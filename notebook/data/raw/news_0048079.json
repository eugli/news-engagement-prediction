We are getting a little saturated here. Doing that first one in a new market will be the toughest one.\" \nThe diner-style food at Kerbey Lane routinely makes Austin best-of lists for the queso, pancakes, and sandwiches. \nKerbey Lane's blog keeps track of all the most important stats from each year of business. According to a year in review post, they served up 265,000 bowls of queso in 2016. \nLook no further for the perfect fluffy pancake! Media: MediaOS Video \nKerbey Lane's famous pancake mix is sold in Whole Foods and H-E-B locations. They sold 1.48 million pancakes in 2016 alone. They offer featured pancakes each month at each location to boot. March's lineup includes Rocky Road, S'mores, Triple Chocolate Cherry and Elvis-inspired (peanut butter, bacon, and banana) pancakes \nNO MORE: Austin-based My Fit Foods announces closure of all stores \nThe first Kerbey Lane location opened up in the spring of 1980. Over the years it expanded to all points in Austin, so eaters were never too far away from a Kerbey Lane. There is even a location in Round Rock now. Only four of the seven locations are open 24 hours. \nMost former University of Texas students will tell you though that the best location is the one near the UT campus, off Guadalupe.
