Navarro wants a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on imports from China, which Trump advocated at times during the campaign.\nBut Ross has tried to calm senators concerned about a potential trade war with China, saying he would help the U.S. renegotiate more favorable outcomes U.S. companies doing business in China.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Poll: More have confidence in Trump than media The numbers are fairly similar to those in 2014, the last time the same poll asked the same question.\nBy Eddie Scarry â€¢ 02/27/17 6:39 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:51:26.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
