Charities have praised Corrie for tackling the tough issue given the prevalence of such dangers out there for young people. \nDiscussing the story at the Coronation Street: The Next 56 Years panel in Salford, in which behind the scenes staff talk openly about Corrie and the future, writer Jan McVerry explained: ‘I think it’s an important story to tell for young people, particularly those who may be lacking in self-confidence. ‘There are worries these unscrupulous bastards get in your lives and lure you away. It is a very dark subject. My own children are teenagers, but others with very young children have asked “should we be going into this darker territory?” ‘We have had many discussions on how to tell the story.’ (Picture: ITV) \nSo far the story has been a slow burner as Nathan has employed devious and gaslighting tactics to groom Bethany and pull her into his murky world. And his intentions are set to be revealed in full over coming months as Bethany’s situation gets desperate.
