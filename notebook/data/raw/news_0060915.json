While not specifying parts of the refugee legislation that might be abandoned, it adds that deporting refugees en masse would still be ruled out. \nFor the time being, the 28-member bloc can return asylum seekers under a controversial ‘one in, one out’ agreement signed last year between Brussels and Ankara amid massive influx of refugees into Europe. The scheme, full of complex moral and legal issues, stipulates that one refugee stranded in the EU will be returned to Turkey and another asylum seeker in Turkey will be allowed to come to Europe in exchange. \nThe refugee deal – met with stark criticism by rights groups and humanitarian organizations – has nonetheless helped stem the flow of people into the continent, and the German paper cites it as a blueprint for future policies. \nIf introduced, the measure would include deportations to other countries south of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Libya, Tunisia or Egypt, diplomats in Brussels told Reuters. Notably, certain areas of countries otherwise deemed dangerous might be recognized as “safe zones” fit for accommodating the returnees.

It is about combating illegal immigration, which has already cost the lives of thousands, and about replacing it by a regulated system of legal admissions, combined with humane living conditions, assured by the EU in third countries,” the document said, adding that the proposal would also be instrumental in “discouraging people-smugglers.” \nEU agencies offered no comment on the report so far, but a spokesman for the French mission to the bloc has already denied any involvement in developing such a proposal. \n“France categorically denies having worked on such a document,” the spokesman told Reuters later on Tuesday. \nGermany, one of primary destinations for hundreds of thousands of migrants, has advocated tougher stance on refugees as their numbers skyrocketed in 2015. It is now easier to deport failed applicants while guidelines for granting asylum or a residence permit have been tightened. \nAt the EU level, Berlin championed an idea of funding refugee camps outside the bloc to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean. \n“The idea is to send them to a safe place, without bringing them into Europe,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere explained at an EU ministerial meeting in late January. \nAccording to the German minister, “the people taken by the smugglers need to be saved and brought to a safe place.” He stressed, however, that from there “only those who require protection” would be forwarded to Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:35:47.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
