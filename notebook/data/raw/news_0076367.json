SOURCE: NZME 'Unthinkable tragedy': Cop pulls over car with 13 people packed inside \nConstable Sheryll Pearce responded to a call from a member of the public about the safety of unrestrained children in a car on Auckland's Northern Motorway last month. \nBut when she got there she was left astounded at the number of children roaming free inside the already packed vehicle. \nAccording to Pearce, only two adults in the front were wearing seat belts, while three women and eight children, including a baby, were packed into five back seats. \nShe told the Herald on Sunday that there could have been an \"unthinkable\" tragedy if police weren't alerted. \n\"When I opened the door, there was just this seething mass of unrestrained humanity. I just could not believe how many bodies were inside,\" Pearce told the Herald on Sunday. \n\"It's unthinkable that adults who have children they love could not care enough about making sure their children were secure. I was appalled.\" Constable Sheryll Pearce was nearly in tears after the family couldn't understand why she was so upset at the situation. Photo: SNPA/Screengrab \nPearce revealed one of the women in the car thought it was acceptable to breast-feed her baby and got angry at the Constable, nearly reducing Pearce to tears. \nThe family of 13 could have been issued a total of 11 tickets, but Pearce issued just two, instead sending the family to a car shop to buy appropriate child seating. \nShe told the Herald on Sunday that education was more important than a hefty fine. \n\"I felt their money was better spent getting child restraints than fining them into the ground. I really hope what happened has made a difference to them in the long-term. \n\"If their vehicle had been in a crash, there could have been a lot of deaths, or very serious injuries. You're talking about cars travelling about 100km/h.\" \nPearce had the family arrange another vehicle before they were allowed to continue their journey. \nNational road policing manager Superintendent Steve Greally praised Pearce's handling of the situation, saying her approach ensured the kids were safer and noted that too many infringement notices could have led to no payment and no benefit to the children.
