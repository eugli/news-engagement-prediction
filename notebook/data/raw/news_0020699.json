Editor Advertisement \nNow, the LTA has already said that private hire car drivers from operators such as Uber and Grab are now required to obtain a vocational licence under the amendments made to the Road Traffic Act. \nThis is so they said the drivers will be equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills to provide the services safely. The drivers must also now affix their cars with decals issued by the LTA. So, does this mean it is the end of the road, the beginning of the end for the Uber and Grab drivers? Might as well be taxi drivers now, because these new rules equate to the same thing. \nBut one other thing. You mean now the Uber and Grab drivers are not really equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills? Or is this just another way for the Govt to make more money at the expense of the average Singaporeans? \nAziz Ad \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
