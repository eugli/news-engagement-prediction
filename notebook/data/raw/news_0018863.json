A fun fact: Those of us at Cosmopolitan.com actually work in an office — we call it ~Club Cosmo~ — in a separate building around the corner from the print magazine, so we don't always know all the sexy, gossipy, reality TV-worthy madness they get up to on the daily. At least not until now! A video posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Feb 4, 2017 at 5:28pm PST So much happened in the season premiere and I'm, quite frankly, squealing over all of it, but what I really want to discuss first and foremost is \"fitness contributor/coordinator\" Evan Betts. Literally, no one has ever made riding the Hearst Tower elevators (in slo-mo?) such an alluring experience. — So Cosmo! (@SoCosmoOnE) February 9, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Hired by the team to do over Diandra's crushing-on-you-so-can't-work-with-you objections, Evan is clearly going to be a stellar employee. An abs -olutely stellar employee. And can I just say, Diandra, we work at a sex-positive publication, so just follow your heart. Pitch an \"8 Ways to Make Out in the Office Supplies Closet Without Getting a Paper Cut\" listicle and suddenly everything is fair game, you know? So , in lieu of the application traditionally expected of folks hired at magazines (not to say that Evan can't write good, just that we didn't see his edit test on the show), here's a selection of his best qualifications: He can read.

A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Oct 19, 2015 at 10:11am PDT He has a strong core, which is important when you have to sit at a desk all day, or so people with strong cores tell me. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Nov 15, 2016 at 4:42am PST LOL, I went to the Hearst gym once. Don't @ me! And an inner savage ... let's not pretend that journalism isn't cut-throat these days, OK? A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Nov 5, 2016 at 3:44am PDT This, just this. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Sep 17, 2016 at 12:19pm PDT He's aware of the latest developments in social media — this wonderful Instagram feed notwithstanding, he was also on FB Live with cute puppies that one time. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Oct 15, 2016 at 2:36pm PDT Look, he once hashtagged #KimKardashian.

A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Dec 9, 2015 at 9:58am PST And he's aware of the latest developments in beauty and style also. See: a floral crown! A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Oct 5, 2016 at 3:36pm PDT He has great taste in aesthetics generally, like interior design. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Jan 28, 2017 at 6:10pm PST Seriously, Evan, where did you get that gold leaf cushion from — I really want one? He's not afraid to work hard. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Feb 19, 2016 at 4:05pm PST I mean, that tractor tire looks heavy? And OMG, spoiler alert, this is a move straight out of the new Fifty Shades movie so he clearly gets what makes Cosmo readers tick. A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Feb 9, 2016 at 4:00am PST He also understands wanderlust, and travel coverage is so hot right now.

A photo posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Apr 9, 2016 at 6:15pm PDT He is a rock climber. Good for you, Evan! A video posted by Evan Betts (@evanfitness_nyc) on Nov 21, 2016 at 3:36pm PST (IDK what a \"flamingo finish\" is but maybe let's discuss it over coffee?) Again with the flamingos, Evan.
