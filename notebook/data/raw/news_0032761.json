Photo: Supplied \nMelbourne mother Tanya Humphrey, whose five-year-old son Lachlan was diagnosed with autism last year, said she felt politicians were point-scoring off people's lives. \n\"It feels like they are holding the NDIS to ransom â€“ that unless you are willing to take a budget cut, we won't help fund therapy,\" she said. \nJo Briskey, the executive director of lobby group The Parenthood, said she had not been concerned about the scheme's future prior to this week. \n\"Now obviously it has come into question,\" she said. \n\"I hope that the Turnbull government sees that they have made a mistake here, they have made a misjudgment, that the NDIS should be above party politics, should be above the petty politics that is happening at the moment and every politician in Canberra should be getting behind the future of the NDIS.\" \nThe chair of Deaf Services Queensland, former LNP MP David Gibson, said fighting \"put at risk\" public support for the scheme. \n\"As a former conservative MP I understand the mantra of the need to balance the budget and I fully agree that for too long governments of all political persuasions have spent up big with very little to show for it, but the NDIS is different.\" \nSocial Services Minister Christian Porter has insisted the NDIS will be \"completely funded\" and the government was committed to it. \nMs Humphrey, whose son's future depends on the therapy he receives in the next few years, said both parties should put people above politics. \n\"I look at it as the future,\" she said. \"I know the NDIS covers the elderly as well, but for me, they need to stop playing with the futures of children and help them, not hinder them.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:10:20.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
