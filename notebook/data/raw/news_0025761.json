I know ppl are gonna go in on this 😬 #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/dGlmyJwdfc — Tristan Spears (@Tristan_Spears_) February 13, 2017 \nKaty Perry faced a backlash before the Grammys had even begun on Sunday (12 February), with a comment about Britney Spears that some have branded distasteful. \nOn her way into the ceremony, Katy stopped to speak to E!’s Ryan Seacrest, who asked her about what she’d been up to during her time off, prior to the release of her new single, ‘Chained To The Rhythm’ . \nShe commented that she had been “taking care of her mental health” in her time off, before alluding to Britney’s past personal troubles when she joked: “[It’s been] fantastic… I haven’t shaved my head yet.” Alberto E. Rodriguez via Getty Images Katy Perry at the Grammys \nClearly sensing she was onto a winner, Katy then repeated the joke in an interview with CBS, this time suggesting that she’d been through so many hair colours, all that would be left would be shaving her head, which she remarked she was “saving for a very public breakdown”. \nBritney made headlines back in 2007, when at the height of her very public personal issues, she went into a Los Angeles hair salon and shaved off all of her hair, later being photographed hitting a paparazzo’s car with an umbrella.
