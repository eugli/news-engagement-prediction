Article continues below \n\"Claudio, appointed City manager in July 2015, led the Foxes to the greatest triumph in the Clubâ€™s 133-year history last season, as we were crowned champions of England for the first time. \n\"His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question.

No one expected Leicester to successfully defend their title and very few gave them any chance of even finishing in the top 10. \nSo to sack a manager that masterminded the greatest title triumph in Premier League history not even a year ago is embarrassing. \nBut the decision has been made and Leicester must now go about finding a new manager to steer them out of trouble. \nAnd according to Sky Sports sources, they've already approached a former Premier League winner: ex-Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. \nFormal discussions for Mancini - who is currently unattached - to take over haven't yet begun, though the Italian is hot favourite to replace Ranieri. \nAlso in contention for the role are Nigel Pearson, Avram Grant, Guus Hiddink and Alan Pardew. \nHowever, it would seem Leicester want to appoint someone with a proven track record in the Premier League, with Mancini winning the title with Man City in 2012. \nMore to follow... \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
