Those \"active\" DPs can be replaced at the beginning of each of the next two rounds, but only by another DP. Once a DP has been replaced, he cannot return to the active roster for a subsequent round. And if a DP joins for the second round, he can be replaced for the championship round, but only by another DP. \nThis means that three pitchers could get limited or no exposure at all during World Baseball Classic play. \nOh and Molina are intimately familiar with how to navigate through the World Baseball Classic while getting ready for a season, as both have been through this process before. In fact, they are two of just 16 players to have appeared in each of the first three World Baseball Classic events. \nHow long all of these players will be away from Cardinals camp will be determined by when their country begins pool play and how deep the team advances in the tournament. In some cases, the absence could stretch to nearly three weeks. \nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 6-22. In the U.S., games will air live exclusively in English on MLB Network and on an authenticated basis via MLBNetwork.com/watch , while ESPN Deportes and WatchESPN will provide the exclusive Spanish-language coverage.
