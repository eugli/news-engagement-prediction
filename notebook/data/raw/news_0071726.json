But it delivered us product worth Rs 13 lakh only. Upon follow-up, we could get products plus money totaling Rs 14 lakh,\" it claimed in the FIR. \n\nThe owners of Ayam Enterprises claim that they were threatened with life if they asked for the rest Rs 16 lakh \"again and again\". \n\nRinging Bells had begun the sale of Freedom 251 handsets, touted as the world's cheapest, via its website in February last year. \n\nIt landed in a controversy, however, with some alleging it was like ponzi scheme . The firm had claimed that around 30,000 customers had booked the phone despite some glitch and seven crore people registered for it.
