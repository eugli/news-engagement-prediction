But now, her fans have to say goodbye, as Bao Bao is moving to Chengdy, China, on February 21. Bao Bao was born on August 23, 2013, and visitors flocked to the National Zoo in Northwest Washington to get a glimpse of the panda cub during her first public debut in January 2014.

'You know, as soon as she hit the ground, we all knew, she's going to be going to China at some point. So we started training her and doing all the things we would need to do to help make her trip better,' National Zoo animal keeper Marty Dearie told CNN . Bao Bao has been living separately from her mother, Mei Xiang, for nearly as two years, as pandas do in the wild. Bao Bao has been living separately from her mother, Mei Xiang, for nearly as two years, as pandas do in the wild She already underwent a full veterinary exam ahead of her flight, and Dearie told CNN that they have no concerns for her health, noting that everything 'seems pretty normal right now'. The popular panda will fly nonstop from Dulles International Airport to Chengdy, China, in a large crate aboard the 'FedEx Panda Express' 777F aircraft, accompanied by a keeper and veterinarian, reported CNN. The team have been getting Bao Bao accustomed to her crate for a few weeks, and will continuously monitor the panda through her trip. They'll also be traveling with a supply of her favorite treats including bamboo, apples, pears, cooked sweet potatoes and water, according to the Zoo. She is headed to China so that she can enter a breeding program in Chengdy when she reaches five or six, in order to help repopulate the panda population. The panda-fueled relationship between China and the United States began in 1972, when the National Zoo received a gift of two pandas from China following President Richard Nixon's visit, reported CNN.
