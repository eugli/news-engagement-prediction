(Supplied: Department of Water) \nMr Munro hoped the river flow would flush-out the salty water, which has plagued the irrigation area since 2010. \n\"The unrestricted pumping of this quality water means a lot, because our water has a certain amount of salt in it, and the more salt you put on the bananas, it does affect your yields,\" he said. \n\"So the fresher the water the better, and this flow is really good. \n\"I'm looking forward to good yields and this river flow will sure-up [Carnarvon's] water-supply for the next 18 months.\" \nTroy Sinclair from the Department of Water in Carnarvon said the unrestricted pumping would be reviewed at the start of March. \n\"So if the river is still flowing in March we'll keep unrestricted pumping going provided the water quality is still good enough,\" he said. \n\"Given the forecast is looking fairly wet for the next week or so, lets hope we can continue this through to March when a lot of the planting starts to happen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:51:14.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
