The production team went to such great lengths to keep the plot under wraps that it drove David and his co-star Olivia Colman \"mad\". Speaking to the Radio Times , the actor, who plays Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, said the cast were given special, individual passwords and watermarked scripts. \nFirst look at Broadchurch season 3 \n\"Everyone found it rather exhausting,\" said David, 45. \"We were all issued with different passwords for different things. So new bits of script would come through and you'd forget what your password was and have to phone somebody up and prove it was you. That drove me mad, if I'm honest. I'd phone up the office and go, 'I need it on paper, I can't cope!'\" The third and final series of Broadchurch returns to ITV on Monday 28 February. David and his co-star Olivia, who plays Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller, are called in to investigate a new crime â€“ this time a brutal sexual assault at a party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:45:53.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
