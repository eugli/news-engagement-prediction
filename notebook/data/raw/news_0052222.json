GETTY Prime Minister Rajoy apparently has 2500 special advisors \nAnd that current Prime Minister Rajoy has employed 2500 special advisors in his central government as opposed to other leaders. \nHe said: ”Our economic future requires drastic decisions to cut public waste, such as eliminating thousands of useless public companies, thousands of useless advisers, [Prime Minister Mariano] Rajoy has 2,500 in Moncloa, compared to Obama's 600, Merkel's 400 or the 250 working for Theresa May. \n\"There's disastrous management of Health and Education, the cost of which has skyrocketed 60 per cent since they were transferred to the Autonomous Communities while the quality plummeted.\" GETTY Spanish banks could end up running out of money \nMr Centento also said the Government and the European Union's estimations of GDP are completely wrong and has presented them with figures he claims are accurate. He said the country is currently suffering from a \"third world production model\". \nHe added: \"We have a third world production model of speculators and waiters, with a labour market where the majority of jobs created are temporary and with remunerations of 600 euros, the largest wage decline in living memory, \n\"And all this was completed with a broken pension system and an insolvent financial system.” \nForecasting an unprecedented shock to the European financial model, Mr Centento is calling for an immediate audit despite a recent revelation that the ECB is failing in its supervisory role over Europe's banks. \nHe also claimed the Spanish government and European Union leaders have been manipulating figures since 2008. \nMr Centento said: \"We will require the European Commission and Eurostat to audit and audit the Spanish accounting system for serious accounting discrepancies that may jeopardise stability.
