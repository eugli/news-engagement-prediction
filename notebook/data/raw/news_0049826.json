External Link: Commonwealth Bank accused of employer super ripoff Majority of underpaid workers women \nMs Angrisano said 89 per cent of the underpaid Commonwealth Bank workers were women who did additional hours to manage staff shortages and peak periods. \n\"They are the lowest-paid, they are the frontline staff and we believe they have contributed to the bank's profit-making machine,\" she said. \n\"They deserve their superannuation to be paid — we're determined to get justice for our members.\" \nThe latest allegations embroiling the Commonwealth Bank follow a report late last year by Industry Super Australia and CBus showing around a third of Australian workers are being ripped off on their superannuation entitlements. \nThe Commonwealth Bank said the complaints were being examined but that the 7,000 figure cited by the FSU was inflated. \n\"We have assured the FSU that CBA understands the importance of superannuation to help secure and enhance the financial wellbeing of our employees, and are committed to ensuring that we comply with obligations to employees on this issue,\" a spokeswoman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:25:13.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
