GDP growth of 0.6pc could be seen in the first quarter if this pace of expansion is sustained into March,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. \n“With inflows of new orders also surging and firms becoming even more optimistic about the year ahead, growth could even lift higher in coming months. The survey therefore indicates that companies are currently firmly focused on expanding in the face of rising sales and fuller order books.” \nT he composite PMI number for the eurozone climbed to 56 for February, up from 54.4 in January. Any number above 50 indicates growth. \nFrance’s PMI hit a 69-month high of 56.2 - indicating it is now expanding more quickly than the eurozone average - while Germany’s index score rose to 56.1, a 34-month high. \nIt is the first time French growth has exceeded Germany’s since 2012. \nThe last time the PMIs were this high the European Central Bank hiked interest rates in a move which was widely blamed for derailing the economy.
