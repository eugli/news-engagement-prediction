I gave them some shocking haircuts at the start. But I got better in time. \n“Now I’ve got myself a nice pair of clippers.” \nA Junior Kiwis representative, Levi made his NRL debut in 2015. A post shared by Mickey Paea (@mickey_paea) on Jan 12, 2017 at 11:08pm PST \nTipped as one of the players set to have a bright future at the Knights, Levi will add to his 25 games when he starts in the No.9 against the Warriors this weekend. \nWhile rugby league is his focus, he’s seen several of his teammates’ careers come to a sudden end almost overnight in recent seasons. \nIt’s a reminder how quickly the dream can be over and why forward thinking is so important. \n“It is important to have something outside of footy,” he explained. \n“It’s something I’d definitely like to pursue when I finish footy or even during it. It’s something I enjoy. \n“I was watching the barber cut my hair and picking up tips. A post shared by Cut To The point (@cuttothepointdl) on Feb 10, 2017 at 7:28pm PST \n“I’d practise on myself and then at the start of last year I started cutting the boys’ hair. I convinced them by telling them how good I was so (the Saifiti brothers) gave me a chance. Now I’ve got most of the team coming around asking for haircuts.” \nNot only is Levi cutting hair but he’s doing what barbers do best — chatting with his clients. \nAnd fans have the chance to listen to the barbershop chatter in Levi’s podcast ‘ Cut To The Point ’ which can be found on SoundCloud.

I was cutting my nephew’s hair and they came up with an idea of a podcast while I cut the boys’ hair. \n“I thought that was an awesome idea and pretty unique. They came up with the name and logo so it was my job to cut the boys’ hair and have a chat with them. \n“We’ve got two (podcasts) at the moment. We’ll try and do them every few weeks.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
