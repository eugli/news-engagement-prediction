Based all on primary sources, with extensive references and footnotes. Without General Relativity, it seemed that the tiny anomaly in Mercury's orbit implied another planet (Vulcan) even closer to the Sun. – user254665 Jun 1 '16 at 18:29 10 La Varrier actually turned his methods for finding Neptune towards finding the hypothetical planet Vulcan, and was convinced it existed even if he couldn't make the equations come out right. – Stella Biderman Jun 1 '16 at 18:37 14 The Le Verrier (and Adams) story is an inspiring example of the power of theory, but there was nothing accidental about it. They brilliantly executed a complicated exercise that was, in principle, doable by methods of their time, and was expected to have a good chance of delivering an important result (with New Planet as the leading contender for what the result would be). – zyx Jun 2 '16 at 2:00 8 @zyx: as I read it, this example was “accidental” in the sense the question asks for — when Newton’s equations of motion were first formulated, and applied to celestial motion, they were not expected to predict a new planet. The calculations leading to the realisation that an extra “particle” is needed, and the calculations/experiments needed to find it, are of course not going to be accidental in any instance of this story. – Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine Jun 3 '16 at 9:43 5 There were several people other than Adams and Le Verrier who had predicted a perturbation by a large object. Adams was convinced by the arguments and decided to try and do the calculations. The issue was whether enough observational data existed to show a genuine anomaly and pin down the orbital parameters of the object causing the anomaly. As you wrote, Le Verrier was convinced the same approach would work for Mercury even after he tried and failed with it. The idea that the Newtonian system was complete was rather powerful in those times especially after Laplace. @StellaBiderma – zyx Jun 3 '16 at 15:57 up vote 145 down vote \nHere's a rather different example which came up recently (see the Journal of Recreational Mathematics) : \nA couple of mathematicians were studying juggling. They came up with a way to encode the 'ball catch' patterns as simple numeric sequences. Then they derived the sequences for all known juggling patterns, and inferred from them a set of rules governing which number sequences can be legal 'juggling' sequences and which cannot. Then they worked the rules backwards, and re-derived all the sequences that they had started with - plus one other . It then turned out that it is in fact possible to juggle according to that extra number sequence. In fact, one of the mathematicians described the resulting juggle motion as 'hauntingly beautiful'. \nThink - just a little simple fiddling with numbers uncovered a way to juggle that had gone unnoticed by Man for thousands of years.
