It has done something you don't want done to your head. \n\"The bone will heal but it is the damage we are worried about.\" \nThe Sylvester family were waiting on news of more brain scans conducted on Sunday morning. \nJake Sylvester is a two-time pro junior winner at Surfest and former Australasian Pro Junior champion, who was eliminated in the second round of the Maitland and Port Stephens Toyota Pro on Tuesday. \nPolice were only told about the assault on Saturday afternoon and started an investigation. \n\"Police from Newcastle City Local Area Command were alerted to the incident yesterday afternoon and initiated inquiries,\" a statement said. \n\"They are appealing to any witnesses to the incident to contact Newcastle Police Station or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:21:42.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
