Their third-best player, shooting guard Khris Middleton, played his first game of the season Wednesday night after recovering from a torn hamstring in the offseason, but Parker went down in the same game. \nMilwaukee has been trying to build momentum toward the opening of a new stadium in two years around an up-and-coming roster, but Parker’s injury will be a significant setback for a team that entered the season hoping to make it to the playoffs for only the fourth time in 12 years.
