The roof collapsed on the home while firefighters attempted to gain control of the fire. The cause of the house fire which killed Quentin Moses and Andria and Jasmine is still being investigated. \n“Our thoughts and prayers are with Quentin’s family,” said UGA Director of Athletics Greg McGarity. \n“We are shocked and saddened by this tragic news. Quentin was an outstanding representative of not only the University of Georgia but also his hometown of Athens. On behalf UGA Athletics, we extend our most sincere condolences to his family.” \nThe Georgia head coach Kirby Smart also gave a statement regarding the tragic death of this former NFL player on Twitter.

He, however, never played for the team. The Miami Dolphins ended up claiming him off waivers after he was released from the Raiders before the 2007 NFL Season started, according to ESPN . \nIn the four seasons Quentin played for the Miami Dolphins he had three and a half sacks and 35 tackles. Jason Taylor, who is being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame later on in the year, was among many of Quentin’s former teammates who took to social media to express their sadness for his death. My heart breaks for former teammate and friend Quentin Moses and his family. Thoughts, prayers and tears! So sad. Life is too short #RIP \n— Jason Taylor (@JasonTaylor) February 12, 2017 \nA former Cedar Shoals teammate Jonathan Bush claimed Quentin was the team’s Michael Jordan. \nA photo posted by td58 (@td58) on Feb 12, 2017 at 8:22am PST \nPer ESPN , Moses was also the defensive MVP for the Georgia Bulldogs in 2005. In fact, the 2005 Georgia Bulldogs team even one the SEC championship. During his college football career, Moses acquired 133 tackles and 25 sacks. \nAfter retiring as an NFL football player, Quentin Moses went on to coach football instead. He was currently in his fifth year as the defensive line coach at Reinhardt University. James Miller, the head football coach at Reinhardt University believes he speaks for everyone when he says how much Quentin will be missed. \n“Quentin Moses was an integral part of our coaching staff, but more than that he was a person who believed in our student-athletes and worked hard every day to help each athlete perform at the highest level on the field and in the classroom. We will miss his leadership, and I will miss his friendship.” \nRest in peace Quentin Moses. \n[Featured Image by Greg Trott/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:42:34.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
