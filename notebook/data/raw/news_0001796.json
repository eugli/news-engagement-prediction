Lee/Globe staff\nRyan Reynolds after receiving the Hasty Pudding Award gives it a kiss at Farkas Hall.\nBy Aimee Ortiz Globe Staff February 04, 2017\nHollywood came to Harvard Friday night, when actor Ryan Reynolds accepted Hasty Pudding Theatricals ’ “Man of the Year” honors.\nFresh from a Golden Globe nomination for his record-breaking film “Deadpool,” Reynolds collected the coveted pudding pot at Farkas Hall.\nAdvertisement\nHe was feted with the traditional roasting before attending the opening night performance of the troupe’s 169th presentation, “Casino Evil.”\nTaking a seat at center stage, Reynolds dared the theatricals to give him their best shot.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Reynolds said it was a great night for him.\n“This is the only reason they’d ever let me in on this campus,” Reynolds said before complimenting the university’s students.\n“There’s something pretty exceptional about all these young men and women, because, it’s sort of like hanging out with a bunch of people with the acumen of a worldly 40-year-old.”\nReynolds is the 51st man to win the award from the Harvard organization. The Hasty Pudding 2017 Woman of the Year, Octavia Spencer , was awarded her Pudding Pot last week following a parade and roast.\nMore photos:\nThe Boston Globe\nRyan Reynolds during the Hasty Pudding Award.\nMatthew J.
