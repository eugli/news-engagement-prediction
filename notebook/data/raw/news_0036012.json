By David Moye 380 \nPresident Donald Trump’s unique style of shaking hands has some people shaking their heads, and one martial arts instructor providing some timely self-defense advice. \nTrump tends to shake hands in an awkward way that pulls people towards him. \nHere he is going mano a mano with Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo: Twitter \nWatch him pull Secretary of State Rex Tillerson into him. Twitter \nSupreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch also got shaken up by Trump’s handshake. YouTube \nThe trend inspired Robin Gieseler, a jiujitsu instructor in Columbus, Ohio, to produce a video showing viewers what to do if someone tries to “over-dominate” them in a similar fashion. \nThe defense video can be seen below, but it basically works by leaning into the shake and then wrapping the arm around the shaker’s elbow. \n”As he grabs really hard and pulls you in, I go with it. I step in with the outside foot, I wrap around the elbow,” he says in the video. “As I do that, I’m going to block his arm from here, I bend the wrist in, the other hand wraps over the top of the knuckles and boom ― now you have what we call a goose neck.” \nThis GIF provides a shortcut: \nvia GIPHY \nIn the interest of self-preservation, Gieseler is quick to add that this is only a demonstration and not a threat to the president. \n“Secret Service, I promise, if I meet the president, I probably won’t wrist lock him,” he says in the video.
