However he later appointed an advisory panel to determine whether the decision was correct.\nRead more US universities gripped by identity crisis Statue row is part of global protest On Saturday, Mr Salovey said that Calhoun College, which was given the name in the early 1930s, was an exceptional case because the former US vice-president's legacy was at odds with the university's values.\n\"We have a strong presumption against renaming buildings on this campus,\" Mr Salovey said, adding: \"I have been concerned all along and remain concerned that we do not do things that erase history.\"\nCalhoun, a member of the Yale class of 1804, was a senator from South Carolina and a leading voice for those opposed to abolishing slavery. He served as vice-president from 1825 to 1832.\nThe university said it will not remove symbols of Calhoun from its campus and will allow alumni to continue associating with the Calhoun name instead of Grace Hopper College.\nRear Admiral Grace Hopper used her mathematics \"to fight fascism during World War Two\" However Mr Salovey said he hoped the university community would now \"embrace Grace Hopper and get to know her better\".\nShe graduated from Yale in 1930 and earned a doctorate in mathematics and mathematical physics from the university in 1934.\nHopper later enlisted in the Navy and \"used her mathematical knowledge to fight fascism during World War Two,\" the university said.\nHopper then invented the first computer compiler, which helped computers understand simple commands.\nShe retired as a Navy rear admiral aged 79, and died in 1992 at the age of 85.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A179/production/_94273314_hopper.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35006719", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-33244710", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35441074", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/139D1/production/_94273308_yale.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-12T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:44:49.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
