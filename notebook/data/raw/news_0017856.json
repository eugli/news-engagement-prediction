If anyone's got my beautiful princess, bring her home.’ Kate’s sentiments coming out of Karen’s mouth. Kate’s Cuddle Cat, Karen’s brown teddy. Kate and Karen. Matthews and McCann. Clear parallels being drawn. It’s possible Karen was also influenced by an episode of Shameless, which featured a fake kidnap and aired a few weeks before Shannon was stuffed away, drugged, under a bed. Karen Matthews had no shame. A complete absence of the stuff. Her own sister says she taped plastic bags to her babies’ bottoms to save buying nappies. Madeleine McCann (pictured left) disappeared in 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz. Shannon Louise Matthews (right) was reported missing by her mother in Dewsbury on February 19, 2008 Detectives say she had so many different relationships with so many different men that when the police built up a family tree it had more branches than Tescos, with 300 names on it. This same absence of shame allowed her to sacrifice a daughter into the ‘keeping’ of a man whose own daughters had been taken into care after he allegedly made them watch him have sex with a prostitute. However, I’m not sure the McCanns can so easily set themselves apart. Would you choose to leave your children in the hands of the monster you know — or all alone and take your chance with the devil you don’t? Which mother was more desperate: the one with nothing and no hope of ever having anything, or the one with friends waiting at the tapas bar by the pool? The search for Maddie cost around £12 million. The hunt for Matthews around £3.2 million What is clear is that in both cases the public has paid a price for these decisions. The search for Maddie cost around £12 million. The hunt for Matthews around £3.2 million. Karen Matthews is clearly guilty of this huge waste. And has paid for it, to some extent, with four years in prison and a pretty uncertain future. We are told she is now receiving death threats as a whole new generation has been appalled by this monster of a mother. You might say, for Karen, justice has been served.But the matter of guilt or innocence is never far from the front door of the McCanns. This week the Portuguese Supreme Court judges made clear that the archiving of the criminal case into Maddie’s disappearance did not mean Kate and Gerry were innocent. There is a significant and not merely a semantic difference, they said. What does justice look like for the McCanns? Perhaps we can agree Karen Matthews is a monster. But some kind of monsters came for Maddie at night. She was lost because she was left to be found. Shannon Matthews was born lost, and desperately needed to be found. Shameless or desperate? The monster you know or the devil you don’t? Rich or poor? Better or worse? Justice or just deserts? These are hard calls to make. Two very different families. Two very different children yet, strangely, uncomfortably connected.
