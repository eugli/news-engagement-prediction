John Dorrian, the Baghdad-based spokesman, to Pentagon reporters. \nThe news comes days after the U.S. commander of American and allied forces in Iraq and Syria told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and other traveling press in Baghdad that U.S. troops were operating closer than ever to the front lines. \nDorrian said Wednesday that some U.S. troops are operating “very close” to the front against ISIS near Mosul. \nISIS is estimated to have between 1,000 and 3,000 fighters in Mosul, Dorrian said. \n\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.
