Set in the last year of the introspective, self-questioning US that went back to sleep after Reagan won the 1980 election, it’s an elegy for the time in which they lived, for the lovely, dilapidated beach town that Santa Barbara once was, and for a particular questing, optimistic late-70s state of mind, all now utterly vanished. \nMills evokes his boyhood period in a flurry of details: a Talking Heads: 77 T-shirt; a totemic copy of Our Bodies, Ourselves; a primitive pregnancy-test kit; Jimmy Carter’s “Malaise” speech of 1979 . But he also frames it by stretching the arc of his story, letting us see what is soon to be lost. As Dorothea points out in the voiceover: “They don’t know that this is the end of punk. They don’t know that Reagan is coming.” Annette Bening: ‘I like being a veteran, I have fewer illusions’ Read more \nGrounding this coming-of-age story is Bening’s warm and wise performance as Dorothea, born in 1924, Depression-raised, trained as a pilot in the second world war, the first woman draughtsman in her architecture practice, but, sadly, too early a pioneer to make much difference. She’s a little daffy and New Age, but her life is a jerry-rigged masterpiece of strength, barter and klutzy ingenuity. Of course she embarrasses the hell out of Jamie, which is why she needs help to keep him on the straight and narrow. Which they manage, sort of. \nTheir lodger, Abbie, is a failed escapee from Santa Barbara, “where everybody was so happy it made her want to scream”, just back from a New York that broke her. She embraces punk partly out of blind fury that she can’t bear children. Julie has been Jamie’s friend since kindergarten, but is tired of him “now that you’re horny all the time”. She tries teaching him to smoke, Abbie takes him to punk shows in LA, while the only man around is sweet, dim 40-year-old handyman William (Billy Crudup), confused by post-60s California morals but delighted about all the easy sex he’s getting. Somehow, by trial and error, a boy is raised to be a man. \nA feminist-inflected love letter to Mills’s mother, to be sure, 20th Century Woman also pre-echoes our own, far more dire moment in American history. I wonder what, in 40 years’ time, an elegy for the last months of the pre-Trump US will look like. \n20th Century Women is out in UK cinemas from Friday 10 February ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:05:17.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
