By Kyle Mizokami Feb 7, 2017 The U.S. Navy has hundreds of strike fighters, both the original F/A-18C Hornet and newer F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Unfortunately, according to DefenseNews , the majority of the Navy's fighter arsenal is down for maintenance due to a lack of money for repairs. The problem is just part of a larger maintenance issue that has the service begging President Trump and Congress for funds to fix the fleet's problems before new ships are built. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below According to DefenseNews , 62 percent of U.S. Navy fighters are down for maintenance . Meanwhile 27 percent need major depot work, while 35 percent are waiting for spare parts. Of the Navy's 1,700 total aircraft (not all of which are fighters) 53 percent are unable to fly. While it is perfectly normal for a portion of aircraft to be out of service at any given time, this is the worst readiness problem the Navy has faced in years. Most Popular The problem is due to a number of factors. One is the inability of the Congress and President to pass a budget on time, which forces the military to be funded through continuing resolutions that trickle out less-than-full funding. Nine consecutive years of continuing resolutions have created budgetary havoc and forced the military to prioritize at the expense of maintenance, the backlog of which grows every year. Another factor is that the naval version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is five years late, should have started to replace existing F/A-18C Hornet fighters by now. These Hornets are decades old and increasingly difficult to maintain, especially since spare parts for them are no longer made, further stressing an already stressed Navy-wide maintenance system. The situation is so bad that the Navy has signaled to the new Trump Administration that it would prefer funds to help it clear the maintenance backlog before spending any on new ships. President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of a 350 ship Navy, up from 274, but the Navy would rather first fix the ships and planes it now.
