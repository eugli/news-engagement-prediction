Mahdzir was commenting on a bullying case victim, a Form 1 student of a school in the capital city who sustained head injury after he was bullied by two senior students. He said during the suspension period, the offender would undergo rehabilitation such as at the Henry Gurney School for a few weeks at the discretion of the disciplinary committee. However, he said, the disciplinary committee should be fair and must conduct a thorough investigation before making any decision. \n\"They (committee) are only responsible for cases involving bullying incidents in schools. For criminal cases, we will leave these to the police to investigate,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Mahdzir admitted that schools were lacking in new economic growth areas such as Kota Samarahan in Sarawak, Kota Kemuning in Selangor and Sungai Petani, Kedah. \n\"The ministry is looking into this matter and we are aware that shortage of schools has resulted in some schools having to accommodate 3,000 students,\" he said. \nThe 'Dialogue with the Education Minister' session is among activities organised by the Education Ministry under its nationwide roadshow to highlight to the public, the ministry's key policies through exhibitions and education advisory services. - Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:20:41.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
