But it could have been an incredibly different story. \n“Please help the BHF fund even more life saving research and together, we can fight back against these conditions that rip families apart.” \nThe BHF has launched a new television campaign to raise awareness of the sudden devastation caused by heart disease . \nIn the advert, a bridesmaid suffers a cardiac arrest due to an inherited heart condition on her sister’s wedding day. \nFor more information and advice about inherited heart conditions and to support the BHF to fund more research, visit www.bhf.org. uk /unexpected .
