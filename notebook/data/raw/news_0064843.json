Opposition calls for changes to country MP allowance \nOpposition leader Matthew Guy said the rules around MPs' entitlements must be tightened. \n\"We can't have a situation where city MPs can claim a country members' allowance. I just can't believe that is somehow allowable under the rules,\" he said. \nMr Guy said the dated entitlements system needed an overhaul, so allowances were linked to an MP's electorate, rather than where they live. \nDuring the 2015-16 financial year, Mr Languiller spent more than $50,000 on six taxpayer-funded overseas trips, including two to his native Uruguay. \nMr Languiller later provided an explanation to the Parliament, in which he said he rented the Queenscliff property as a result of \"complex family matters relating to marriage, children and parents\". \n\"I apologise for this error of judgment,\" he said.
