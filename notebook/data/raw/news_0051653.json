And now one of the clubs responsible, Bad Axe Throwing , has plans to go worldwide with their own league. \nBad Axe Throwing is currently in ten cities across Canada and just opened their first U.S. club in Chicago. They plan to open 5-6 more locations throughout the U.S. in 2017, along with other locations overseas, before starting the very first ‘World Axe Throwing League.’ \nAccording to Mario Zelaya, the league’s chairman, the amateur league will consist of several axe throwing facilities around the world, eventually crowning a world champion that will win prize money. \n“Because of the strong demand for the sport of urban axe throwing, we’re establishing a World Axe Throwing League – similar to what you would expect for the NHL, UFC, NBA, MLB, etc.,” said Zelaya. \n“This global league will the first and only of its kind, led by Bad Axe Throwing but inviting other axe throwing facilities that have been replicating our business model around the world [we’re unifying the sport on a global scale],” he said. \nHere’s a Bad Axe Throwing promo from last year: \nAnd here are just a few pics of some ‘urban axe throwers’ in action: The format Similar to golf or darts in that individuals would face-off against one-another each week in their particular league in their home city.
