The note, as reported by Hindustan Times , looked normal at first glance but on careful observation, there are about 10 major bloopers in them. \nThe incident, which has come to light only now, first took place on 6 February, when a customer care executive named Rohit withdrew Rs 8,000 from the ATM, only to find them to be fake. Later, he filed a complaint with the police. Representational image. PTI \n\"All the four notes that I withdrew were fake,\" the daily quoted Rohit as saying. \n“We sent a sub-inspector to verify the allegations. He withdrew one Rs 2,000 note and that also turned out to be fake,” the police was quoted by Outlook as saying. \nThe errors in the notes are funny. Instead of Bharatiya Reserve Bank, the note states Bharatiya Manoranjan Bank. The rupee sign is missing while instead of the usual leaf markings on the right hand corner, the note has a \"Churan label\". The gaffes become funnier as instead of the RBI seal, the note had the \"PK\" logo, while the Reserve Bank of India was transformed to \"Children Bank of India.\" \nWhile the real note has the signature of the governor of the RBI, the fake note instead had no signature at all. Moreover, the legal tender is backed by the \"Children Government.\" \nThe perpetrators of this cruel joke have not yet been caught. A case has been registered at Sangam Vihar police station, reported DNA . \nOn 8 November, the government scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and introduced a new Rs 2,000 note into the economy. The incident comes after the government reiterated that the new notes cannot be counterfeited. The Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das had also added that counterfeiting the new notes would be very low as they are completely indigenous.
