And giving them something in return.\nChanging nappies/feminism \nI’m not into women’s lib and that sort of thing.\n\nHis wife’s reaction to Morrisons’ Safeway bid \nStrangely enough, I didn’t tell my wife at the beginning. What did she say when I did tell her? She said nothing, she said: ‘Your tea’s ready.’\nHow to decide on where to locate stores \nWell, we get on a bus and we look for chimney pots.\nSuccession planning and his health \nThat’s an extremely rude question. I’ve had about enough of this.\nHis management style \nIf you mop the floor, or you’re the managing director, a nice pat on the head goes down well occasionally. Just as a kick up the backside is required sometimes.\nInternet shopping \nI don’t think it is awfully relevant. People like to smell and see their food before they buy it.\nHome delivery \nI started my career doing that [on a bicycle] and I don’t intend to do it again.\nWhether Morrisons would hire management consultants to help with the integration of Safeway \nIf you don’t know how to run your own business, it’s time to give up isn’t it?\nAnd after he’d left, speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting \nThe results were described by the chairman and chief executive as ‘disappointing’. I personally thought they were disastrous.\nWhen I left work and started working as a hobby, I chose to raise cattle. I have something like 1,000 bullocks and, having listened to your presentation, Dalton*, you’ve got a lot more bullshit than me.\n*Dalton Philips, then chief executive of Morrisons .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:46:04.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
