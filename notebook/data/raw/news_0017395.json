Would I like to see Hollywood reflect what our country looks like more? Absolutely ,” Miranda told HuffPost. “But again, we have amazing Latino directors who win tons of Oscars. We have Guillermo del Toro, we have [Alejandro G.] Iñarritu, we have [Alfonso] Cuarón. There’s no shortage of Latino talent, both in front of and behind the camera.” \nAs far as the star is concerned, there’s not a lot that comes out of scrutinizing the list of Oscar nominees each year. \n“I just think to make every year a bellwether.. I don’t know. I don’t know what that does,” he added. Still, Miranda thinks the industry should continue “to try to make more work and make more opportunities available.” \nThe Puerto Rican actor, playwright and composer is currently nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category for “How Far I’ll Go” in Disney’s Moana. If he wins, Miranda will be one of the very few artist’s in the industry to have won an Emmy, a Grammy, a Tony and an Oscar ― not to mention he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner and a MacArthur fellow. \nWhile Miranda feels diversity in the Oscars changes depending on the year, Latino actors have proved to be repeatedly left out of the list of nominees. For example, a Latina has never won the Academy Award for Best Actress , and the last time one was even nominated in the category was in 2004.
