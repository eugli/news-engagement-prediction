But the reality could not have been more stark as England sought to crack down on any sense of complacency ahead of the visit of Italy to Twickenham on Sunday. \nNot only were the England players sent on exhausting conditioning drills, but they also took part in a “full-on” physical session despite the bruising victory over Wales. Wales England ratings puff \n“The Tuesday session was one of the hardest sessions I have ever been involved in,” revealed Courtney Lawes, one of England’s most experienced forwards and a player who prides himself on his physicality. “It was pretty physical – a lot of running, fitness… and it was quite full-on as well. Physicality is always encouraged. But we got through it. \n“It was probably just to test us mentally and surprise us a bit. I don’t think we were expecting that, but there is always method to the madness and I am sure he [Jones] knows what he wants. \n“It was about the same length [as other sessions] but I didn’t know when it was going to end. It was just relentless mentally but we just got on with it. We are used to it.” Courtney Lawes in action against Wales \nJ ones had hinted in the wake of the win over Wales, which kept England’s hopes of a second successive Grand Slam on course, that his squad would face a tough week despite a desire to freshen things up by switching from their training base in Pennyhill Park to central London and several off-field activities. \n“I don’t think we are every going to get any down time with Eddie,” Lawes added. “He loves to keep you on your toes. It is all good. The boys all want to improve and we got on with it. It was a tough week, we trained really hard. \n“It doesn’t matter where we train. We train with intent. We are more comfortable at Pennyhill because everything is set up ready for us, but it is good to get away and mix it up so it doesn’t get too stagnant.” \nIt was not all pain for the England, players, however. “It was good to be with the boys in the middle of London,” Lawes added. “It meant we could get out and socialise and had a few meals out. It was nice to know the pressure was off for the weekend at least. “I played a lot of pool with Nathan Hughes. I beat him 10 games to three, it was convincing.” \nLawes has been one of the outstanding forwards in the Six Nations campaign, pressing claims for a Lions place with his fierce ball-carrying and tackling, but also his versatility.

I have played a lot of six for the Saints, not so much this year because we have been down on second rows, but last year I played a lot of big games at six and I am very comfortable with it. Obviously I need to be aware about defending off the scrum.” Six Nations 2017 fixtures, dates, kick-off times and TV schedule \nSeveral changes are expected for the third game against Italy on Sunday, but Lawes hopes to be involved again and is eager to remain on the blindside flank if required. \n“I enjoy it there, you probably get a couple of extra carries and tackles and the more impacts I have on the game, generally the better I am going to play,” he added. “I am keen to play there, but I will play wherever I am put. \n“We haven’t played to our potential in the last two games. That is really motivating us. We don’t want to scrap a win. We want to go out at the weekend and show people what we can really play like. The boys will be up for it. I can’t wait to get out on the pitch.” \n\nC ourtney Lawes was speaking on behalf of Mitsubishi Motors UK, Official Performance Partner of England Rugby.
