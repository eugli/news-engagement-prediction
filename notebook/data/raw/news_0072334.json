The Bulldogs did all three of those things Wednesday night at Villanova.\nButler, which came in as a 10-point underdog, knocked off the second-ranked Wildcats for the second time this season, this time with a 74-66 win in the Philadelphia suburbs. In doing so, the Bulldogs became the first team to beat Villanova at The Pavilion in over four years.\nAfter a sluggish first half that saw Butler take an early lead, Villanova opened the second half like the top-five team that it is. The Wildcats led by seven with 10 minutes remaining in the game.\n[ Tourney Pick’em is open! Sign up now | Bracket Big Board ]\nBut the Bulldogs roared back with a combination of defense and timely shooting. They held Villanova without a point for six-and-a-half minutes. They forced multiple turnovers, multiple missed 2s and multiple missed 3s.\nMore On the other end, Kelan Martin and Tyler Lewis both drilled long-range bombs. Lewis’ triple tied up the game with just over eight minutes to play, but Butler’s run wasn’t complete — in fact, it wasn’t even halfway done. Minutes later, another Martin 3 capped an 18-0 run that put the underdogs up 60-49.\nVillanova tried to mount a comeback late, and created some necessary chaos. The Wildcats forced a few turnovers, and had the ball, down six, with a couple minutes remaining. But the home team couldn’t hit enough clutch shots to really put pressure on Butler.\nIf this story sounds familiar, that’s because to some extent it is — in two different senses.\nIn one, it’s a story similar to the one that played out at Hinkle Fieldhouse in January. Butler upset the then-No. 1 Wildcats and dealt them their first loss of the season. In another, the second-half Butler run evoked Villanova’s other previous loss this season, when it went cold over the final 10 minutes and blew a double-digit lead at Marquette.\nBut one thing that isn’t familiar: A loss for Villanova at home. The Wildcats play some games at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, but play most of their home games at The Pavilion, a cozy on-campus gym that seats fewer than 7,000. Their last loss at The Pavilion was Feb. 3, 2013, 55-52 to Providence.\nThis group of Villanova seniors had never lost in their home gym. Thanks to Butler, now they have.", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2kfnksG", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4SxRUE6cdj7IVERJftQPYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTcw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/1dd2b64adacb7068e50d2ad987107090);", "https://bit.ly/2kfnksG&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4SxRUE6cdj7IVERJftQPYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTcw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/1dd2b64adacb7068e50d2ad987107090", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "published": "2017-02-23T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:24:31.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
