Getty/Jesse Grant \nHome sound system manufacturer Sonos has become the latest technology company to announce significant price rises for British customers in the wake of the EU referendum vote. \nSome of the company’s products are increasing in price by up to 25%, as a result of the collapse in GBP induced by the Brexit vote of June 2016. The price rises were announced on Monday, but will not be put in place until Thursday 23 February. \n“We pay for everything we make in US dollars,” the California-domiciled Sonos said in a statement. “Over recent months, there has been a significant change on the US dollar to GBP exchange rate. As a result, our existing pricing has become unsustainable and, like many other companies, we have to increase prices for all products priced in GBP.” \nThe company’s key products, the Play:1, 3 and 5 speakers, are seeing prices rise by around 15% from £169/£259/£429 respectively to £199/£299/£499; its more specialist Connect line, which allows listeners to use Sonos technology to broadcast digital music through their pre-existing speaker set-up, is seeing the full 25% rise, from £279 for the Connect and £399 for the Connect:Amp to £349 and £499 respectively. \nSonos joins a growing list of technology companies announcing significant price increases following the vote to leave the EU. Apple was one of the first to move, with prices rising by around a fifth in October 2016 . Later that month, Microsoft increased its cloud-hosted service pricing, by up to 22% . In January, Apple moved again, increasing app prices by 25% . Companies which charge customers in dollars, such as Amazon Web Services, have also passed sterling’s collapse on to consumers .
