By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 7, 2017 10:08 am Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address Parliament today. (file photo) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday will reply to the discussion on motion of thanks to the President’s joint address to the Parliament on Budget Day. The motion, tabled by Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma, witnessed heated discussion as the Opposition blamed the government for job losses, economic slowdown, agricultural distress caused by demonetisation. Sharma also hit out at the Opposition for dividing the society on religious lines. He added that it was ‘shameful’ that they had sought “evidence for patriotism” after surgical strikes. \nCongress floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge countered, asking whether the government had a contract over patriotism. He accused the ruling-BJP of invoking the name of god to emotionally blackmail public. In an obvious reference to PM Modi, Kharge said that just empty words will not fill hungry stomachs. He slammed the budget saying the government failed in implementing NREGA and turning around the loss-making Railways. \nParliament LIVE UPDATES: \nstay tuned for live updates © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:42:50.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
