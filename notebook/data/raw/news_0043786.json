The \"One Dance\" singer appeared on Saturday's OVO Sound radio show on Beats 1, where he took a moment to discuss the apparent feud between himself and the \"Famous\" rapper, who just last year, were said to be working on a collaborative album. \"I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, because in the same breath, I went from being … like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly s**ting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much,\" the 30-year-old rapper said. \"Whatever it is that you're going through, I accept it. I don't respect it all.\" MORE: Kanye West's Difficult 2016: A Timeline From 'Life of Pablo' to Kim Kardashian's Robbery to His Breakdown In the November rant in question -- which directly preceded the rapper's public breakdown and hospitalization -- Kanye suggested to a Sacramento crowd that Drake and DJ Khaled's song may be overplayed, though to be fair, Yeezy continued the same speech by elaborating, \"And when I say that bulls**t, what I’m saying is we love Drake. Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too.\" \"I just go and continue working on my own thing,\" Drake continued in the radio interview, calling into question his long-rumored album with Kanye. \"The more and more this progresses, the more and more I feel like keeping to myself.\" Kanye, for his part, denied dissing Drake in recent paparazzi video , saying, \"I never said that.\" For all the drama surrounding these two rappers, it seems they don't even feel like it's an issue. Back to Drake's interview, the rapper also addressed Kanye and Jay Z being taken off the final version of \"Pop Style\" for Drake's album, Views , which Yeezy explained at the time as \" some Apple/Tidal bulls**t .\" WATCH: Kim Kardashian Kisses Kanye West in Romantic Valentine's Day Pic \"I was dealing directly with 'Ye.

At that time, we were working together pretty heavy. And he wanted to be on the record.\" Watch Drake's interview below.
