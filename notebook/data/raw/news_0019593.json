Ther ad promotes an energy drink originating from the UK with the name \"PUSSY\". \nThe advert asks consumers if they have tasted PUSSY yet. As you may already know, pussy is another term for female genitalia and this suggestive marketing language displayed in public is disturbing. \nIs there no guidelines on the types of advertisement allowed in public? Is this advert considered children friendly? \nMrs Lim A.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
