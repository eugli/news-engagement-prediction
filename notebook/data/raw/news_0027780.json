That’s because, when it opens this Thursday, February 16, former Saison chef de cuisine Scott Clark will be in the kitchen , serving up nostalgic, fun takes on Americana classics. The menu is chock full of the kind of food you want during a road trip — burgers, hot dogs, sweets — and it’s headlined by a “hamburger sandwich,” made with grass-fed beef, egg, melted cheese, pickled red onion, special sauce, and lettuce on grilled white bread. You can see the menu in full below, which focuses on local produce.
