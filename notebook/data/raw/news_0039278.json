Miller responded by removing his pants, turning his back to police, and exposing his buttocks. \nThe court heard Miller also invited officers to \"check up there\". \nHis lawyer Steven Chopping told the court when officers had asked Miller if he had anything in his pockets, he'd \"put two and two together and got 111\" and thought he was about to be strip-searched. \nMagistrate Olivia McTaggart said she was challenging that belief saying it was \"far fetched\" and \"fanciful\". \n\"I don't accept that you thought you were being strip-searched,\" she said. \"[You] were just making the police work more difficult when they were lawfully apprehending you.\" \nMiller's lawyer argued that it was on the lower end of the spectrum of prohibited behaviour, particularly at that time of the morning. \n\"It's perhaps not the worse thing that happened that night in that street,\" Mr Chopping said. \nMagistrate McTaggart disqualified Miller from driving for eight months and fined him $640 for drink-driving and a further $300 for the prohibited behaviour and abusive language.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:56:49.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
