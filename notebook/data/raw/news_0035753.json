This morning Sasikala asked for a TV set so she could watch the interesting events back in her home state, but the jail officials refused. \nInstead, they arranged for her to watch the trust vote in the neighbouring cell. \nJail officials said Sasikala surfed several Tamil news channels to know various angles to the story. She watched the entire Assembly proceedings for more than 40 minutes and sat on while the channel switched to a Tamil serial. \nWith the special court striking down her request for additional facilities in jail, Parappana Agrahara officials have not considered any of Sasikala’s demands, either for home-made food or a TV. It has been all of four days since Sasikala checked into her Parappana Agrahara lodgings.
