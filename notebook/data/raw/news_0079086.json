Whoever they are. \nI mean, I know they have a roving eye and your friends hate them, but – they’re not so bad… are they…? \nExcept, slow down. Pause for moment before the fear of dying alone drives you to make a decision you may regret. \nHere’s why you shouldn’t settle when looking for ‘The One’. Love yourself, not someone who doesn’t deserve you (Credit: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) \nThere is just something fundamentally wrong with the word settle. It automatically suggests you’re doing some kind of major compromise. \nI know this because I became this close to doing just that. \nThe truth is, a couple of years ago I was on the edge of settling. At university, I had someone who I was pretty sure was ‘The One’. To this day, it remains the happiest, most comfortable relationship I’ve ever been in. Why it’s time to stop holding out for The One and start settling \nIt turns out he wasn’t ‘The One’ for many reasons, but mainly because of all the things that would have had to have happened for us to remain together. \nI couldn’t have lived in London, where I’d wanted to be post-graduation throughout uni – he was a small town boy from the countryside who was always going to live at home. \nFor a while, we both entertained a fantasy of being in London together. \nBut the truth is, he was never going to be comfortable living in the big city with me while I pursued my journalistic dreams. \nIt was just wasn’t who he was, or what he wanted to do with his life. Me probably if I’d stayed in my long term relationship (Credit: Erin Aniker) \nI couldn’t have had my career. Well, at least, not in quite the same way I have it now. \nHours and hard commitment have been spent getting to where I am now working at a national publication. \nTime I couldn’t have dedicated if I was living anywhere else. \nThere was a point though as I was struggling to pin down that crucial first job, worrying that I wasn’t good enough to make it in journalism, where I was staring down the barrel of a potential life with him. I swiped right to all the men on Tinder and this is what happened \nBut without London and without my career. I was ready to ditch it all and just settle for the love I had. \nLife, however, had other plans in the form of an actual job, and as it turns out in the end so did he. With someone else. But that’s a different part of the story. \nI’ve never been so grateful though upon reflection. I would have lost a huge part of myself and the opportunity to do things that have now given me so much pride and self-worth. \nI get to write articles like this, meet stars at glitzy premieres and give big issues like the junior doctors’ strike last year the important coverage they need. Me doing some important journalism at one of the junior doctors strikes (Picture: Helen Smith/Metro) \nAnd so could you. Or, you know, chase the equivalent of your dream life and job. \nWhen you’re in your 20s and 30s, you’ve got the liberty and time to figure things out. \nMany of us are taught we can do anything in life, so why cut your options short now for someone if they’re not right for you? \nThat nagging feeling that you might be missing out on something, I hate to say, might not go away. Dreaming of life where the glass is not half empty..(Credit: Erin Aniker for Metro.co.uk) \nFor me personally though, it’s not just about someone who fits into the life I’ve built. Judge me all you want for being a hopeless romantic, but I want butterflies – that fluttery, can’t get enough of you feeling. \nAt least initially, as we all know in long-term relationships that fades away. Dating with balls: Could a feminist dating coach transform your love-life? \nI have been on dates with people where, practically and objectively , it might have been a wise idea to get into a relationship with them. \nThey were good looking, had good jobs in finance or law and, most importantly, lived in London. My parents would have loved them. \nThe problem? No butterflies. Nada. \nTo quote How I Met Your Mother, love is the best thing we do. So, I thought, why do it badly? \nLet me be clear, it’s not like I believe in the idea of there being one complete spiritual person made for me. There is a reason why ‘The One’ is in quotation marks all the way through here. \nI, like my colleagues before me , think there could be many potential ‘ones’, many men suited for me that I could have great chemistry with. If there wasn’t, jeez, now that’s what would be really depressing. How to meet the love of your life at the gym \nBut if you’re using the word ‘settling’ in your love life, you’re selling yourself short. \nYou deserve a partner that’s going to help you to realise and achieve your goals, and one that gives you that fluttery feeling and makes you feel special. \nSomeone you can feasibly laugh through life with without getting sick of them – my relationship goals in a sentence really. \nIs that really asking for too much? Is he…the one? (Credit: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) \nIf you already have that then great. Hang on it and by all means don’t throw it away. \nIf you’ve found someone who makes you feel like a million and you’re achieving your life goals, then well done. You’re honestly an inspiration to us all. \nBut if not, all I’m saying is that it might be time to ask yourself – why are you settling for anything less? \nMaybe it’s time you didn’t.
