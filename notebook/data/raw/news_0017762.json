The label said Ivanka Trump, and for her that changed things. \nNaylor won’t buy anything with the name “Trump” because of whom it’s associated with — she said her views clash with those of the U.S. president.\nNaylor’s feelings about Ivanka Trump products were shaped, not by the quality or look of them, but instead by their connection to the first daughter’s father and his controversial politics. She’s not alone.\nIn the U.S., a boycott campaign called #GrabYourWallet has been gaining momentum since last October, pushing people to stop supporting businesses selling Trump family products.\n  Read more: \nGrowing online backlash over Ivanka Trump brand offered at The Bay \nNordstrom stock rises, breaking the curse of the Trump tweet \nTrump aide ‘counselled’ after Ivanka pitch on Fox News, White House says \nIn Canada, an online petition is asking people to boycott Hudson’s Bay Company for selling Ivanka Trump products. \n“…We want them to get rid of Ivanka Trump’s brand otherwise they will be known as a company that values misogyny, racism and hypocrisy over diversity, inclusion and compassion,” the petition states. As of Thursday afternoon, it has 275 signatures. \nBrigitte Timmins, corporate communications manager at the Bay, was asked whether the store was considering dropping the brand. \n“Across our banners, we aim to a deliver a strong assortment of fashion. We respect our customers’ right to choose the brands that work for them,” Timmins wrote in an e-mail. “In turn, our customers’ choices inform our decisions on which merchandise we offer.” \nMeanwhile, other major businesses around the continent have been cutting ties with the Ivanka Trump brand.\nEarlier this week, Marshalls and T.J. Maxx stores in the U.S. had received a memo, asking that they remove all Ivanka Trump brand signs and place the brand’s products amongst others. \nIn an email, Doreen Thompson, spokesperson for those stores’ parent business TJX Companies, clarified that the memo said to “mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor.”\nThompson confirmed that TJX Canada stores, Marshalls and Winners, will continue to sell the Ivanka Trump brand. \n“We aim to offer a merchandise mix that gives our customers a choice in what they may want to purchase,” Thompson wrote. \nSome shoppers in Toronto spoke highly of Ivanka Trump products, saying they were good quality and especially great for wearing to work, with one calling a boycott “a little ridiculous.”\nEarlier on Thursday, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway drew sharp criticism and complaints over the ethics of using her position to promote Ivanka Trump products, a day after the president attacked Nordstrom for dropping them.\nFederal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products or for the private gain of friends.\n“Go buy Ivanka’s stuff . . . I’m going to go get some myself today,” Conway told Fox News in an interview from the White House. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody.”\nConway has “been counselled,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, “and that’s all we’re going to say.”\nConway spoke from the White House briefing room and encouraged people to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” She made the comments a day after Trump attacked Nordstrom on Twitter for dropping his daughter’s fashion line.\nOn Wednesday, Trump jumped to his daughter’s defence, tweeting: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!”\nFollowing the president’s tweet, Nordstrom’s stocks climbed by four per cent.\nMeanwhile, Shopify’s CEO is defending the e-commerce company’s decision to keep hosting an online store for the controversial right-wing U.S. media organization Breitbart News.\nTobi Lutke posted a statement online Wednesday that says he has received more than 10,000 messages asking the Ottawa-based company to stop hosting Breitbart’s online store.\nBut Lutke says that to do so would be an act of censorship and would interfere with the free exchange of goods that is at the heart of commerce.\nWith files from Star wire services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:19:12.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
