Moreover, the Act applies to those establishments where the number of employees is not less than 10. \nThe statement said the application of amended provision regarding maximum amount should be made effective from January 1, 2016 as done in the case of central government employees. \nBesides that rate of 15 days wages for each completed year of service be raised to 30 days wages, the unions demanded. \nThe proposed amendment to the Payment of Gratuity Act as circulated by the government along with the letter dated February 15, 2017 only deals with enhancing the ceiling of maximum amount under Section 4(3) of the Act from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, the unions said. \nThey pointed out during the meeting that the proposed amendment is being brought to bring the maximum ceiling amount to Rs 20 lakh in line with recommendation of 7th Central Pay Commission as accepted by the government. \n7th Pay Commission: Gratuity ceiling doubled to Rs 20 lakh \nThe relevant amendment for central government employees was notified on July 25, 2016 and the enhanced amount ceiling was made effective from January 1, 2016. \nThe unions are of the view that the delay of 8 months for employees covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act should not result in adversely affecting the interest of the concerned employees. \nThe employers as well as state representatives also agreed to the proposal of raising the amount of gratuity to Rs 20 lakh, it said.
