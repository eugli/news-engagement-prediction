The image shown above is said to be of the LG G6 and considering this seems to be an official press render of the device, it does provide one of the best overall views of the smartphone so far. The image highlights the front of the device, the back of the device, as well as both sides of the device. \nConsistent with previous leaks, this latest image does clearly show that the LG G6 will come with a large portion of of its front side reserved for the actual screen, thanks to a reduction in bezel size compared to previous LG G models. In short, this is a smartphone that is ‘all display’, an element which combined with its novel aspect ratio is what LG is now referring to as a ‘Full Vision’ display. In fact, this latest render does quite neatly highlight that the ‘real life’ images that have been coming through of late, do seem to be of the LG G6, as this image is largely identical to previous images that have shown the front of the device. Likewise, the previous leaked images of the back also seem to be on point, as the current render matches up neatly, with the dual camera configuration, fingerprint sensor and logo placement all on line with previous images. \nWhile the last few weeks have been full of leaks, in traditional LG form, a number of those leaks have come directly from LG. Although, they have been more of a teasing nature than a leaking one. In either case though, those teases have provided further insight into what can be expected beyond the standard flagship smartphone spec list. For instance, it does seem that the LG G6 is going to be a ‘smarter’ smartphone, it is going to be waterproof (to some degree), and it is going to place a focus on the display and the camera abilities, among other things. Points which will likely all be confirmed in a few days time when LG takes to the stage at MWC 2017 .
