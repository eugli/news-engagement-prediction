Several legislators are restive after not making it to the 30-member council of ministers, sources said.

His camp was boosted by an internal report that “some MLAs are ready to cross over”. \nLate in the evening, Panneerselvam made a last-ditch attempt to woo AIADMK lawmakers. “Please vote against the trust vote and uphold Amma’s interests,” he told reporters. \nPanneerselvam has been buoyed by the opposition DMK grouping – DMK, Congress and Indian Union Muslim League – deciding to vote against the government .

(AFP Photo) \nOn Saturday, the assembly’s effective strength will come down from 234 to 231 -- The late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s seat is vacant, ailing DMK chief M Karunanidhi won’t be present and speaker P Dhanapal cannot vote unless a tie occurs. So, the new majority mark is 116. \nPalaniswami had submitted a list of 124 MLAs to the governor on Thursday but now has 123 lawmakers – just seven more than majority. Panneerselvam, therefore, needs just eight legislators to switch sides. \nSasikala– a long-time confidante of Jayalalithaa – was anointed as the late CM’s successor by the state’s ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in December and was due to be sworn in last week. \nBut she was pulled into a bitter struggle last week by Panneerselvam, who alleged he was forced to resign. Since then, he has been backed by several party MPs and MLAs but a majority of the party is said to be behind Sasikala and Palaniswami. \nOn Friday, DMK working president MK Stalin and former Congress state chief EVKS Elangovan both confirmed that they would vote against the government.

Where is the question of otherwise?” \nThe bitterness between the camps was apparent in a string of tit-for-tat sackings throughout the day. Panneerselvam loyalist E Madhusudanan expelled Sasikala, her nephews TTV Dinakaran and S Venktatesh and all the ministers of the new government, claiming that their camp was the real AIADMK. \nLate in the evening, the election commission sent a notice to Sasikala on a petition by Panneerselvam’s camp challenging her elevation as interim party chief last month. Panneerselvam also met the assembly speaker P Dhanpal and urged him to conduct a secret ballot that will enable MLAs to vote according to their conscience but was turned down. \nThe Sasikala faction also appointed senior minister KA Sengottiyan as the floor leader for the party. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:10.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
