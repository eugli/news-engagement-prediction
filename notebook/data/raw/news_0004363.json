By Pete Forester Feb 3, 2017 \nThis is a week of extremes. We have some of the most intense sneaker designs we've seen in a minute, all releasing alongside some of the most elegantly understated. En Noir hits first with a duo of Puma silhouettes in all black that show a mastery of texture and tone, as well as sets of Air Jordan 1s and Adidas City Socks, all offered in black and white. On the other side of the spectrum is a true head-scratcher from Adidas with BAPE and Neighborhood on an update of the Superstar that is certainly unique, and an Atmos x Titolo x Puma Disc that combines a lot of colors and patterns all onto one shoe. (And there's a whole lot more.) Wherever you sit in the range of simple to extraordinary, there's something for you this week.

The Ignite EvoKnit that En Noir created with Puma utilizes a custom rubberized patterned upper on an entirely blacked-out look. It's a play of texture and graphics on one of Puma's latest silhouettes, bringing a classic take to a new sneaker. \nRelease: 2/1 \n$180, rise45.com Puma x En Noir Clyde \nOn the other side of the spectrum is En Noir's riff on the Clyde, one of Puma's earliest silhouettes. En Noir uses a light touch on this model, opting for a minimalist approach with black nubuck from tongue to toe. The tongue is unlined, with the En Noir logo printed at the top in tonal black with a little bit of shine. If you're looking for an understated sneaker, this is the one for you. \nRelease: 2/1 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Adidas Pure Boost 2.0 \nThe revamped Pure Boost is Adidas' latest foray into blending street sensibilities with running technology, making for a sneaker that bridges those two worlds. It hasn't inspired the same passion and fervor as the Ultra Boost and NMD (yet), but early adopters have certainly taken a shine to it. There are at least five colorways dropping this week, making this a sneaker that's already hard to keep track of. \nRelease: 2/1 \n$140, adidas.com Reebok Pump Supreme \"Jacquard Tape\" \nOne of the most exciting aspects of the glut of collaborations in recent years is that it's resurfaced forgotten silhouettes as collaborators look to create something special. Reebok's Pump Supreme was thrown back into the popular spotlight thanks to a collaboration with Vetements, but this week you can grab an inline pair that likely would have never reached the market without the earlier collab. The sneaker is mostly mesh and gets its structure from a zig-zag pumpable air bubble. These are truly something different. \nRelease: 2/2 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Reebok x Hanon Club C \"Claymore\" \nLast week we predicted an upsurge of Club Cs from Reebok ,and one week later we already see a new offering with Hanon. The Aberdeen-based sneaker store reaches back into regional history for inspiration, looking to the classic \"Great Sword\" of Scotland. Gray, brown, and steel blue mix to represent the physical weapon in sneaker form. \nRelease: 2/3 \n£89, hanon-shop.com Air Jordan 4 \"Royalty\" \nSometimes elegance is simplicity. The Air Jordan 4 \"Royalty\" isn't making any huge innovations in design, but it's an instant classic. An upper comprised almost entirely of black suede sits on top of a black mudguard and white sole. What elevates the sneaker is hits of gold on the lacing system, tongue logo, and in the air bubble at the heel. These are supremely wearable and will be in the style conversation for years. \nRelease: 2/4 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Air Jordan 1 \"Perforated Pack\" \nIf you're looking for something basic this week, you cannot beat the Air Jordan 1 \"Perforated\" pack. Two sneakers are offered as a part of this release, a fully blacked-out version and a white version. Tumbled leather and perforated leather balance the uppers while the outsole counters with the opposite color. These are understated, classic, and will fit into any situation. \nRelease: 2/4 \n$160, nike.com Adidas NMD City Sock \"Gum Bottom Pack\" \nAs the sister sneaker to the wildly popular NMD Runner, the City Sock doesn't necessarily get its due. It's a harder sneaker to pull off with its totally laceless look, but it's doable with just a little bit of effort. This weekend's releases of a \"Gum Bottom\" pack brings that most beloved of sole treatments to very classic colorways of white and black. If you're thinking of trying the City Sock, now's the time. \nRelease: 2/4 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Vans x Undercover Authentic & Old Skool \nUndercover is not messing around this week, offering five different styles of collaborative Vans. The brands worked on two different silhouettes in a handful of colors. First are the Old Skools that feature tonal uppers in suede, leather, and a rosebud-printed canvas. The Authentics use contrast stitching on three colorways, each featuring lyrics from Temple's single \"Shelter Song\": \"Take me in time, time to the music / Take me away to the twilight zone.\" \nRelease: 2/4 \n$125-149, caliroots.com Adidas x BAPE x Neighborhood Superstar Boost \nWe're not going to lie: These sneakers are a heavy lift for most people. The Superstar Boost is something that we're expecting to see a lot more of, but it's definitely not for everyone. The front of the sneaker is traditional enough with the classic shell toe, but as you move back, Boost technology is bursting out the sides of the sole at the arches. By the time you get to the throat the sneaker has given way to a Primeknit upper. If there's any ambassador to introduce this silhouette, we leave it to BAPE and Neighborhood—but we also know not all of you are going to love it. \nRelease: 2/4 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:19:12.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
