He'd put together a team and they were having so much fun that a logical question followed.\n\"Why doesn't this exist in Saskatoon?\"\nSo they started Prairie Lily, the first and only LGBT curling league in Saskatchewan.\nHomophobia in sports still pervasive in Canada, new study shows\nThere's data out that suggests homophobia is still alive and well in in sports. A 2015 online survey found that 81 per cent of respondents had witnessed or experienced homophobia in sports. Plus, an overwhelming majority of gay men and lesbians had faced hurtful slurs, the survey found.\n\"Being gay in sport shouldn't matter. We're all out there with a common goal, and that's to win,\" said Evanochko.\nBut he said that's why Prairie Lily exists â€” so that LGBT curlers \"are not going to have any uncomfortable looks, or any uncomfortable questions. They can just be themselves and be happy.\"\nIn fact, Evanochko said, they've had so much fun and success on the ice they may expand to new fields of play in the future.\n\"Maybe there is a need for [a gay league for] badminton or tennis or volleyball?\"\nwith files from Saskatoon Morning", "external_links": ["http://www.prairielilycurling.com/"], "published": "2017-02-10T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:22:45.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
