As we know, Donald Trump is a close friend of Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In fact, Trump called Kraft every week to check in on him after Kraft’s wife died six years ago. (This fact was generally unreported or underreported by the media in the pre-game media hype over Super Bowl LI, in what I’m sure was just an oversight or something.) \nBrady is also a Trump friend, a fact that has earned him plenty of shade from the media ; a USA Today writer penned a stunning hit piece on the Pats QB in the run-up to the game which stopped just short of suggesting that Brady should be physically forced to sit before a clutch of empaneled media and answer questions like, “Are you now or have you ever been in the basket of deplorables?” \nAnd then there was the fact that while Trump may be a Patriots friend, Rep.

Lewis making the media rounds on Monday, claiming the Falcons won the popular vote and calling for an investigation into hacking by Russian sports gamblers. \nBut perhaps the greatest thing is that it showed, in microcosm, just how the media got it wrong on election night.
