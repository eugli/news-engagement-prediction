Photo: Jonathan Bachman/Reuters Republican lawmakers brave enough to go home and face constituents in their districts got rewarded with huge turnouts — and some raucous crowds. Angry constituents packed venues to capacity. They shouted, cheered, brought signs. They even dressed up.\nPresident Donald Trump claimed that the protests were “planned out” by liberal activists, and while groups such as Indivisible are helping to rally people to attend these meetings, the crowds who turned out asked serious questions about the Affordable Care Act, immigration, and whether anyone in Congress was going to investigate Trump. Here are some highlights from Wednesday night:\nSpringdale, Arkansas -- Cotton town hall--> pic.twitter.com/8AnKhBsf5Z\n— Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) February 22, 2017 A crowd of about 2,000 filled the high-school auditorium in Springdale, Arkansas, for Senator Tom Cotton ’s town hall. Cotton, an immigration hard-liner , got an earful from the crowd, who chanted “Do your job” and “Tax return.”\nTom Cotton shouted down with chants of \"TAX RETURNS!\" pic.twitter.com/iEcQDqHnCx\n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 23, 2017 Crowd at Sen.

One woman, a 25-year-old constituent, challenged Tom Cotton on whether coverage for preexisting conditions would be available under a new health-care law.\nWoman in Tom Cotton town hall asks everyone affected by the ACA to stand up.\nThe response: pic.twitter.com/eXlEkyJnFM\n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 22, 2017 Cotton tried to deflect the question, but the woman — who said she relied on Obamacare for coverage, as she suffered from a rare disorder — refused to let the senator off the hook:\nThis is a young woman challenging Cotton on ACA replacement plan. 2000 here inside. pic.twitter.com/bBEqIVuzoF\n— Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) February 22, 2017 Cotton improved a bit in an exchange with another attendee, Mary Story, who drew large cheers when she stood up and announced that she was not a paid protester. “I don’t care if anybody here is paid or not. You’re all Arkansans,” Cotton said. “Thank you for everyone coming out.”\nArk. woman to Tom Cotton: \"First of all, I am Mary Story from Fayetteville and I am not a paid protester.\" pic.twitter.com/0ULnW6gWwI\n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 23, 2017 Immigration, Trump’s taxes, and the border wall also came up. A 7-year-old protested PBS cuts. The barrage of questions forced Cotton to extend the town hall about a half-hour.\nHour & 15 in...look of the line pic.twitter.com/4rPd7EqPGP\n— Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) February 23, 2017 Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy inadvertently warmed up the crowd by showing up late to his town hall meeting at a library in Metairie, outside of New Orleans.\nCrowd \"Where is he?\" at Bill Cassidy Town Hall pic.twitter.com/o7uyngwFOk\n— Matthew Hinton (@MattHintonPhoto) February 22, 2017 It took a little more than 20 minutes, but Cassidy finally showed up.

It likely beat the attendance record of all of the congressman’s other town halls combined, and even with the largely anti-Trump turnout, was a mostly civil affair. Or as the Star Tribune put it: “Minnesota Nice.” (The congressman’s staff had also warned ahead of time that he would leave if things got too out of hand.)\nRousing rendition of \"This Land is Your Land\" waiting to enter Rep Emmer's town hall meeting Sartell. pic.twitter.com/R1o1OSftp3\n— Glen Stubbe (@gspphoto) February 23, 2017 The most heated exchanges came over the Affordable Care Act, which Emmer lambasted as a “disaster.”\nSue, of Sartell, says her life is in Emmer's hands with ACA repeal.

Hundreds more packed an overflow room. Hundreds more protested outside the venue. So did some llamas:\nNEW-llamas join demo at GOP town hall of Rep. Leonard Lance NJ @NBCNewYork @maggieNYT #politics pic.twitter.com/cNmkcIqaoA\n— Brian Thompson (@brian4NY) February 22, 2017 According to the Washington Post , Russia questions dominated this town hall, an issue on which Lance is pretty hawkish. “My views are that Russia is not a friend of the United States, and that Vladimir Putin has been a bad actor on the world stage,” Lance assured the audience.\nPeople react in agreement to a question posed to New Jersey Republican congressman Leonard Lance during a town hall meeting at Raritan Valley Community College on February 22, 2017 in Branchburg, New Jersey.
