That is better and you don’t have to wait for people to pressure you to do so,” Khalid told mStar Online yesterday. \nClaiming that Annuar was not suited for the job, he said: “The national football scene is already plagued with problems. \n“There has been so many failures on the field. \n“And we (FAM) don’t need a ‘future’ president who is problematic, too.” \nAnother sports analyst and critic Prof Emeritus Tan Sri Dr Khoo Kay Kim echoed Khalid’s views, saying that Annuar should quit the race in view of his “poor track record” in leading an institution. \n“I think he lacks experience and knowledge,” Dr Khoo said in an interview yesterday. \nAnnuar is one of the four individuals named as contenders for the FAM president post. \nThe other three are Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, Johor Tunku Mahkota Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim and Tan Sri Aseh Che Mat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:01:09.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
