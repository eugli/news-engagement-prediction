A vast majority of actresses this year got the subtlety memo, choosing neutral colors or demure silhouettes in lieu of the vibrant, fishtailed frocks you might come to expect—but, hey, don’t call this year’s carpet boring. The Oscars’s newfound, understated ease is something worth celebrating because it means that we’re entering a new age of unfussy style—and that’s good news for everyone involved. Here, the seven trends that ruled the red carpet. Gold Stars 1 / 3 Photo: Getty Images Emma Stone , Jessica Biel , and Charlize Theron opted to channel the Oscars statue itself with gowns of all shades of gold this evening. Stone’s custom Givenchy Haute Couture number was a lesson in red carpet dynamism, with feet of beaded fringe, while Biel’s was a trompe l’oeil work by KaufmanFranco that had mock tears throughout. As for Oscar winner Theron, she knows the value of a simple, plunging gold dress by Dior. The Evening Sleeve 1 / 5 Photo: Getty Images Who said sex appeal was all about revealing cuts? Dakota Johnson ’s Gucci number serves up Old Hollywood vamp appeal, and the same could be said of Jessica Biel’s golden dress or Chrissy Teigen’s beaded Zuhair Murad stunner. Nominees Isabelle Huppert, in Armani Privé, and Ruth Negga, in Valentino, also went the demure route in long-sleeved dresses with a stately elegance. Optic White 1 / 3 Photo: Getty Images This year’s Oscars were so white—in red carpet dresses, that is. Naomie Harris made the arrival of the evening in a tea-length Calvin Klein dress, while Karlie Kloss, in Stella McCartney, and Priyanka Chopra, in Ralph & Russo, chose architectural outfits with a similarly arty edge. Dark Glamour 1 / 3 Photo: Getty Images Vixens, take note\" this is how you do drama in dark times. Taraji P. Henson turned heads this evening in a velvety Alberta Feretti dress with a curvaceous cut. Similarly, Kirsten Dunst, in Dior Haute Couture, Brie Larson, in Oscar de la Renta, and Alicia Vikander, in Louis Vuitton, chose sculptural, sexy pieces in jet black to make a vampy statement on the carpet. Full-Skirted Drama 1 / 3 Photo: Getty Images Sometimes, you just need to make a statement. Janelle Monae knows the value of this, which is why she chose a ball-skirted Elie Saab dress complete with feathers and embroidery for the evening. Ava DuVernay also went for a dramatic shape in silvery Ashi Studio, as did Leslie Mann in a daisy-colored Zac Posen ensemble. Fire-Engine Red 1 / 2 Photo: Getty Images Some bold women matched their looks to the Oscars red carpet. Academy Award winner Viola Davis chose a resplendent Armani dress for the evening, while Ruth Negga stunned in a bright Valentino-red gown by the house. Sheer, Shimmery, and Champagne-Colored 1 / 4 Photo: Getty Images Felicity Jones’s pale Dior Haute Couture dress set the mood for the Oscars' simple sparkle this evening, with Chrissy Teigen, Isabelle Huppert, and Hailee Seinfeld in Ralph & Russo also choosing gowns with an iridescent shine.
