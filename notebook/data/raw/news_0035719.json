between themselves and Napoli in their Champions League last 16 clash, and tennis star Rafa Nadal was among the great and the good to take in the first leg clash.\nThe Australian Open runner-up was joined by his sister Maria Isabel and father Sebastian at the Bernabeu on Wednesday night to witness the reigning European champions take a two-goal advantage to Italy.\nLifelong Madrid fan Nadal is often pictured at home games, and with Diego Maradona and King Juan Carlos also present in the Spanish capital, the hosts overcame a shaky start to seal a deserved 3-1 victory over the 1989 UEFA Cup winners.\nTennis star and Real Madrid fan Rafael Nadal watched on as the Spanish side beat Napoli 3-1\nNadal applauds the players out onto the pitch for the Champions League last 16 contest\nArgentina and Napoli legend Diego Maradona was also in the stands to watch the encounter\nToni Kroos is congratulated by Marcelo after the German stroked Madrid in front on the night\nLorenzo Insigne sent the 10,000 Napoli fans who made the trip to Madrid into raptures by surprising Keylor Navas with an audacious effort to give the visitors the lead after eight minutes.\nBut Real responded, and levelled after Dani Carvajal's cross with the outside of his boot was headed past Pepe Reina by Karim Benzema, who became the highest scoring Frenchman in the Champions League with 51 goals.\nMadrid quickly came out the blocks in the second half, taking the lead when Toni Kroos stroked home from Cristiano Ronaldo's cut-back, and a beaming smile broke across Nadal's face after Casemiro crashed in a third shortly afterwards.\nThe two-goal cushion Madrid take to the San Paolo stadium did not flatter the hosts, and Nadal will hope the La Liga giants can finish off the job in Naples in three weeks' time.\nNadal was happy to see his boyhood club enjoy more success in Europe on Wednesday night\nThe 30-year-old shows his delight after Casemiro's thunderbolt for Zinedine Zidane's side\nMadrid recovered from a goal down to take a solid advantage with them in the second leg\nJuan Carlos I of Spain looks on from the stands ahead of the Champions League last 16 tie\nThe Mallorcan has enjoyed a resurgent 2017 so far having come within a set of beating Roger Federer in Melbourne last month, and the world No 6 will hope to build on narrowly missing out on his 15th major title in the lead up to Roland Garros at the end of May.\nNadal's public appearances comes in the same week that it emerged his uncle Toni will step down as his coach after this year's ATP Tour, as he feels he has been sidelined by other figures in the player's entourage.\nThe 55-year-old has been with his nephew since before the Spaniard broke into the big-time by winning the French Open as a teenager in 2005.",
