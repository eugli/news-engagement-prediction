(Photo: Elaine Thompson/Assocaited Press) \nIt all depends, I suppose, on what you consider great. \nBut President Donald Trump's articulation of his central campaign promise leaves little room for doubt. America, in his telling, is a humbled nation, bullied by stronger countries with tougher leaders into obviously foolish deals — all to the world's benefit and America's ill-favor. \nTrump promised to change all that. He'd push back, hard, demanding the respect that he believes previous presidents squandered. And America would be great again. \nWhen was America last great? Most of Trump's rhetoric hearkens back to the post-World War II era, a boom time for U.S. manufacturing, a time when rigid social norms, weighted by racism and sexism, dictated public and private life, and before the messy social upsurges of the 1960s and 1970s — and the period when the U.S. began to use its war-bolstered authority to claim a lead role on the global stage. \nThis is the goal Trump has set; it is fair to judge his performance against those parameters. \nRead more: Judge holds President Donald Trump's feet to fire on travel ban tweak \nAnd so far, it's a flop. The bluff bravado Trump believes is strength plays as weakness on the world stage. Barring refugees from American shores is contrary to the country's values and it undermines the moral authority America exercises to demand that other nations play humanitarian roles. His instinct for limiting America's reach in global trade creates a leadership vacuum that countries hostile to American interests will rush to fill. And his willingness to direct tough talk not at our enemies but at valuable allies or trading partners? That's just bad sense. \nConsider what has happened in two short weeks. An executive order banning visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days and halting admittance of refugees from any country for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely has prompted thousands to protest and has been declared unconstitutional by federal judges in multiple districts (whose orders have been ignored by many federal workers). \nEmpowered Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress are eager to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans, to fundamentally weaken Medicare and Medicaid, and to privatize Social Security. Trump and congressional Republicans are also rushing to lift regulation imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and to loosen environmental rules that keep our water clean. \nExiting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade deal that became a controversial campaign point, leaves China in the driver's seat . \nRead more: In the age of Trump, finding hope from a cat, a crisis and a cop \nAnd in a flurry of aggressive communication, Trump alienated Mexico, our third-largest trading partner, over his long-standing desire to build a wall along our shared southern border, at Mexico's expense, and Australia, a country with whom the U.S. has tight political, diplomatic and intelligence ties. Republicans, according to a New York Times survey , view Australia as America's closest ally. \nNone of this makes us stronger. Disregard for governing norms, for the authority of our courts, and policy that yields a nation sicker, poorer, more divided, a smaller player in global trade, and on the skids with our allies — that's a weaker America, and it's not an America that's on the path to greatness. \n\"It's hard to turn back the clock,\" said Matt Zierler, an associate professor of international relations at Michigan State University's James Madison College. After World War II, he said, \"through economic institutions, building the United Nations, we were able to preserve global institutions that preserve U.S. values. Open trade, free trade, is something that’s been developing over decades; it’s a set of values we like. ... If an alternate sphere operates, and the U.S. isn’t a part of it, that’s not good for the U.S.\" \nAnd when the U.S. declines to participate, other countries are ready to step in. \n\"I can't weigh in on whether the particulars of TPP,\" the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \"were good or not, but when you withdraw from the process, you do cede the authority,\" Zierler said. \"At the end of\" World War II, \"when a lot of these current institutions were created, we had a lot of authority, so we were able to do a lot. We still have a lot of authority, but other countries are starting to be leaders.\" \nOther presidents — Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon — adopted aggressive postures toward other nations, Zierler said. But all of them tried to reduce, not inflame, tensions. \n\"Even as we pushed, and Reagan and Nixon clearly pushed, they worked with allies, committed to NATO, pursued diplomatic solutions,\" he said. \"What’s unusual is (Trump's) tenor, his tone, because international politics is predicated on reducing fear and reducing uncertainty. The more fear, the more unknowns, the more times there’s confusion or misinformation, when intentions can be misread — that’s when you get weird outcomes.\" \nA headline in the U.K. publication the Independent made it plain: (German Chancellor) \" Angela Merkel is now the leader of the free world, not Donald Trump .\" The Economist suggests that Trump finds allies to be a burden , not a help. NPR reports that Trump is facing 50 lawsuits . And he has been in office for a little more than two weeks. \nThe America telegraphed by Trump's first weeks is a smaller nation, not a greater one. And it's profoundly unclear what role this new America can play. Or how any of it will make America great, again.
