More videos Trump defends 'tough' phone call with Australia \nPresident Donald Trump has defended his \"tough\" approach to speaking with foreign leaders in his first public remarks since details of his phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull became public. \nBut Mr Dutton said he was confident Australia could take Mr Trump at his word and expected transfers to start within the next \"couple\" of months, sooner than the six to 12 months that had been suggested by some on the islands. \n\"All of the signs indicate the [US] officials are working well. It's the case that we take the US at its word. We appreciate the support of President Trump to continue the arrangement,\" he told Sky News on Tuesday.

He also conceded the deal could be characterised as a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement, referring to the Turnbull government's promise to accept a cohort of Central American refugees currently awaiting resettlement in camps in Costa Rica. \n\"It wasn't a people swap deal if that's the language people want to use [but] I don't have any problem with that characterisation if people want to put that,\" he said. \"It was beneficial to us and it was beneficial to US.\" SHARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:09:47.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
