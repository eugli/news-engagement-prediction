Themes of emancipation and freedom are at the forefront of an event that's about taking back what was stolen from the ancestors of Montreal's Caribbean Community. \nColorful costumes, vibrant music, copious exclamations of joy and dance come with the territory but unlike carnival traditions schedule just before the Christian observance of Lent like in New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, or even Greece, carnival time comes in the thick of summer in Montreal since, well, Lent occurs in the smack of winter on the North American continent. \nConsidering THIS is what winter looks like in Montreal , you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone crazy enough to don flesh-baring carnival costumes in subzero weather. \nBesides, Carifiesta isn't really a pre-Lent observation in the first place. It never was. \nInstead, Carifête is a celebration of Montreal's Caribbean communities and perhaps a reminder that not too long ago, many ancestors of these community members were enslaved. Furthermore, their slave \"owners\" did not let them join in those pre-Lent celebrations. \nWith that in mind, Carnival's and Carifiesta's roots lie in emancipation, freedom, a chance to symbolically take back what too many ancestors lost. It's also an opportunity to honor various island cultures and even Central and South American communities which contribute to Montreal's multifaceted and multicultural nature. The city would be lesser without them. \n\nThis Carifiesta profile is for information purposes only.
