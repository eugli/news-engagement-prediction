It might have even dropped into Lake Michigan, where it was briefly spotted on radar near Cheboygan, Michigan, at about 1:30 a.m. Central Standard Time. In suburban Chicago, a Lisle, Illinois, police dashcam recorded a video that drew thousands of views and shares on Facebook. Read More Weather Service meteorologists in Chicago, Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin, said meteor showers are common in the area -- but a spectacular view like this is rare. People reported seeing it from Wisconsin to Illinois to Indiana. Some in Wisconsin reported hearing a sonic boom, which is caused when a meteor enters the atmosphere, said NWS meteorologist Sarah Marquardt in Milwaukee. Comments on social media indicated a range of responses from fear to excitement. On Facebook, Sherry Udit wrote that she saw it in Oswego, Illinois, adding, \"Thought I was just imagining things!\" And football fan Ryan Grubbs observed, \"That was Matt Ryan's star crashing back to Earth ... lol.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:07:38.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
