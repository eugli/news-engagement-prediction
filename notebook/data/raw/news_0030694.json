That isn't special enough though — right? Wait until you see the buns. Not only in the shape of the world-famous building bricks, Brick Burger features buns in various shades of colors, including red, orange, yellow, and black. \nAnd when they say burgers, they mean burgers. According to their menu, Brick Burger offers upwards of ten different varieties to their brick-shaped sandwiches ranging from the Darth Burger with its bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms to the Cheesy Mac burger that includes a normal hamburger with a dollop of everyone’s favorite cheesy pasta dish: good ol’ macaroni and cheese. While it’s mainly a burger joint, Brick Burger also boasts about the chicken wings, pasta, and appetizers they also serve. (Photo: Brick Burger) \nThe best part of it all? They give sets of building blocks play with while you wait for your food. Not only can you munch on mozzarella sticks while you wait for your Wildstyle burger (traditional burger with onion rings and barbeque sauce) to come out, you can also practice your best architectural skills. \nAlthough the restaurant isn’t officially affiliated with the Danish toymaker, it appears to be a top stop for any LEGO fans finding their way to the Philippines. \nMORE: LEGO Batman, John Wick, Fifty Shades Battle At The Box Office / LEGO Batman Meets CW's Arrowverse In TV Spot / Gotham, Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl and WBTV Go LEGO for LEGO Batman Movie Release --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
