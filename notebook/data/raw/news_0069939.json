Fury at Labour government's £1m compensation for innocent Brit\". \nHe said the man's release in 2004 had \"followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition\". \nThe former PM continued: \"He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government... \n\"The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took. \n\"The reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations.\" \nA senior Labour source told the Press Association detention camps like Guantanamo had been \"a significant recruiter for terrorism\".
