(Picture: REX Features) More All dog owners will know that puppies and babies are pretty similar – they make a lot of noise, they’re incredibly needy, yet they’re also responsible for giving your life a whole new meaning and you wouldn’t change anything about them.\nNow, craft beer firm BrewDog has truly realised those similarities and is offering paid leave for new dog owners. It’s dogernity leave if you will, (we definitely haven’t just coined that phrase).\nThe new Puppy Parental Leave means that dog owners can take days off to care for their pets without it coming directly from their holiday allowance.\nView photos\nToo cute. More Once the owners return to work, the dogs are also welcome to join them – with BrewDog’s Aberdeenshire HQ currently boasting more than 50 dogs.\nJames Watt, BrewDog’s co-founder, said: ‘It’s not easy trying to juggle work and settle a new dog into your life, and many members of our crew have four-legged friends at home.\nMORE: Kim Jong-nam murder: Female ‘assassin’ wearing LOL jumper pictured at Malaysia airport\nMORE: Father jailed after leaving sons aged 1 and 2 in sweltering car as he went to pub\n‘So we wanted to take the stress out of the situation and let our teams take the time they need to welcome their new puppy or dog into their family.\n‘We always want to raise the bar when it comes to offering our staff the best possible benefits; at BrewDog we care about two things above all else. People and beer.\n‘We also just really, really like dogs.’\nUs too James, us too.
