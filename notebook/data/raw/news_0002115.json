We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two,” said a statement signed “The Carters,” Jay Z’s real last name.

The little girl served as the inspiration for Jay Z’s hit song “Glory,” and she’s appeared in music videos alongside her mother. \nBeyonce, who set a record in December for earning Grammy Award nominations in the rock, pop, R&B and rap categories in the same year with her diverse album, “Lemonade,” announced her last pregnancy at the 2011 MTV VMAs.
