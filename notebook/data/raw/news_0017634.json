Now, the restaurant’s sister concept Sweet Times has officially made its debut. The Houston Business Journal reports that Sweet Times opened its doors at 6356 Richmond Avenue over the weekend . The restaurant is a project of James “Tim” Norman, the son of Sweetie Pie’s founder Robbie Montgomery, and serves up soul-food favorites like fried chicken, pork steaks, and a selection of sides, including mac & cheese. The restaurant’s opening comes just months after Montgomery filed a lawsuit against Norman for opening restaurants in California and Missouri using the Sweetie Pie’s pedigree without her consent. That litigation is still pending, but it clearly hasn’t stopped Norman from moving forward in opening his Houston restaurant. At present, a post to Norman’s Facebook page indicates that the opening was a Super Bowl-related “pop-up,” which could mean that an official grand opening is still in the works. Stay tuned for more details.
