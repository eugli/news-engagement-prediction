(David J. Phillip/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  01 AM \nNew England was not alone in celebrating the Patriots' Super Bowl victory — they had the abhorred leader of far-right extremists cheering Tom Brady as an “Aryan Avatar.” \nRichard Spencer, the author of the National Policy Institute known for promoting thinly-veiled white supremacy, applauded the 34-28 overtime win as a triumph for white pride in a bizarre post-Super Bowl tweet storm. \n“For the white race, it's never over,\" Spencer wrote with a gif of Brady kissing his supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen. \n\"I'm proud of the NFL's Whitest team,\" he added, noting that he was born in Boston. \nSpencer continued to gloat, even as a legion of Twitter users poked and prodded at his arguments. \nRebecca Griffin, a sports columnist with an Israeli newspaper, pointed out that Bündchen is Brazilian — and an immigrant. \n“Sorry, but @giseleofficial is a white Brazilian,” Spencer replied. \nA writer for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” tried to bring Spencer down a notchbefore the Boston team’s surprise victory. \n“How does it feel to be losing to America’s blackest gayest city you nazi piece of f---ing garbage,” wrote Chase Mitchell. A masked assailant punched Richard Spencer as he celebrated Trump's inauguration in January. (Via Facebook/ABC News) \nAs the Falcons lost, Mitchell conceded that he would be happy just to see Spencer “publically assaulted again.” \nSpencer, 38, inspired a world of internet hilarity after taking a punch to the face — twice — at President Trump’s inauguration. \nThe second assault was caught on camera during an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview on his alleged affiliation with neo-Nazis. \nA masked assailant sucker leaped into the frame, punched him and bolted. \nThe next day, Spencer filed a police report and said he had been punched earlier in the day. He did not seek medical attention for either attacks, the report states. \nSpencer's support for Trump continued after the Super Bowl as he shared news graphics from the U.S. presidential election that predicted Hillary Clinton would win. In a similar fashion, sports analysts predicted the Atlanta Falcons had a 91% chance that nag the championship. \n“Nothing is written. No fate but what we make,” Spencer added.
