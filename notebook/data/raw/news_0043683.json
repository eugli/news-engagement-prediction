Fante's Coffee , a new coffee shop near Cherokee Park, is set to open on Feb. 27. This new spot in in a former hair salon at 2501 Grinstead Drive, between Cherokee Parkway and Lexington Road. But if you ever went there for a hairdo, you likely won't recognize the place. The shop's owner, Leo Fante, has completely redecorated, adding a variety of seating in the front room â€” including tables, couches and chairs. 15 photos Fante's Coffee at 2501 Grinstead Drive will open on Feb. 27. Fante has paid a lot of attention to detail in setting up the new place. For instance, a display of coffee beans on the mantel in the main dining room is arranged from light roasted to dark roasted. He also put a lot of thought into the logo, which features two gold rings and four beans. The two gold rings represent his and his wife's wedding bands, and the four beans represent four Leo Fantes (including himself and his son) who have been in the family. Not all the effort has been spent on decorating, though. Fante also added a kitchen that's full of new equipment and a room where beans can be custom-roasted before being brewed. Louisville has a great coffee culture, said Fante, an industry veteran who's worked for both John Conti Coffee Co. and Consumers Choice Coffee. But he said this coffee shop will be somewhat different in that it will offer alcoholic beverages as well as sandwiches, soups and salads. \"We wanted everybody to come in here and feel welcome,\" he said, which is why food and alcohol is on the menu. Coffees range from $3.25 to $4.60 and sandwiches go for about $7.99. Fante has hired about 17 workers so far, and his brothers, Greg and Stephen Fante, have helped him get the place ready. The shop is being operated in space Fante leases from Jefferson Development Group. It's in the area of properties that the company has acquired for a hotel and office complex hotel and office complex , two high-rise condominiums, a retail and apartment center all planned on about four acres. We recently sent photographer William DeShazer to Fante's Coffee for a look around. You can find his photos in the attached slideshow. David A. Mann covers these beats: Restaurants, beverage industry, manufacturing, distribution/logistics, unions.
