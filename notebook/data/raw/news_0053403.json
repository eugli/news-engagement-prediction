In addition, both GAAP and non-GAAP.\" \nTesla also said that it expects to be producing 5,000 of its forthcoming Model 3 mass-market vehicle \"at some point in the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.\" \nA little back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that Tesla should deliver something like 150,000 vehicles in 2017, if it can make those numbers. \nThis means that Tesla will require a significant increase in deliveries to meet CEO Elon Musk's pledge to deliver 500,000 vehicles annually by 2018. \nTesla didn't immediately respond to requests for a comment on its deliveries guidance. \nBut after softly rolling back guidance in 2016, when the 80-90,000 vehicles for the full year became 50,000 for the second half, Tesla appears to be preemptively dialing back on its ambitious deliveries targets ahead of the Model 3 launch. \nHowever, if taking a breather on Musk's guidance goals means Tesla will launch the Model 3 on schedule, investors may reward the company's caginess on deliveries. Tesla shares were trading up after hours, about 2% to $278. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:54:51.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
