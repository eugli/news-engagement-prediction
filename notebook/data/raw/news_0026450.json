That includes $3 million upon federal environmental approval, 35 per cent of the first $2 million in royalties received by the province annually and 3.5 per cent of additional royalties. \nChris Zahovskis, who is president and CEO of Northcliff Resources which co-owns the Sisson Partnership, says finalizing the agreements is a big step in having the project move forward. \nVillage of Stanley Mayor Mark Foreman said the agreement is a chance for growth in the communities surrounding the future mine. Foreman, who was one of several mayors in attendance Friday, said the village has been involved with the project for 15 years. \n“It’s about time,” Foreman said. “I think it’s good news for everybody involved. They’ve (the province) worked out issues with everybody that we had to and I guess we can move on from this point.” \nHe said it means “guaranteed employment” for New Brunswickers and said it will “bring people home.” \nCarelton-Victoria Liberal MLA Andrew Harvey said the company has committed to employing New Brunswickers. \nHarvey said all the communities will benefit from economic growth including jobs and tax revenue. \nThe province and the First Nations have jointly submitted the agreement to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. \nThe agreement will become part of the agency’s review, and the provincial government says it expects this should result in a decision on federal environmental approval within months. \nNo members from the Maliseet First Nations communities attended the announcement on Friday and calls were not returned by deadline. \n– With files from The Canadian Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
