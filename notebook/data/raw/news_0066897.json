Brazilian waxes often leave a small strip, triangle, square, rectangle or oval shaped piece of hair in the front, while taking all hair in between and your backside. \nOn the other hand, a Hollywood Wax, removes all of the hair from the front, middle and all the way to the backside. This means it gets rid of all genital hair so the zone will be entirely bald. \nThe only difference between a Brazilian and a Hollywood is the shape that's often left in the front with the Brazilian. If no shape of hair is desired, then it basically becomes a Hollywood which is why many salons call it a Full Brazilian. This is why there might be some confusion on why the two styles are often referred to as the same bikini wax. Bikini Styles on Salon and Spa Menus \nWhen a salon or spa creates their menu, you might see these different bikini wax style names listed for a couple different reasons. \ncontinue reading below our video Bikini Wax Styles for Women First of all, they want you to know generally how much you're going to pay when checking out. \nSimply cleaning up a little bit of hair outside the underwear is going to take more time and product than removing more, or even all of the genital hair. Therefore, price points vary for these various styles.They don't want you to be surprised or irritated when paying your bill if you're assuming you're paying a lesser price. \nThey also want to schedule your service correctly and block out the right amount of time for your service. A Hollywood bikini wax involves more time, than say, just waxing the bikini line. And instead of you having to explain just exactly where you want hair removed and left when you make the appointment, it makes it easier and much less embarrassing to simply request a certain style. \nThe salons wants to put you with the right person for the job. Keep in mind that all the techs may not be willing to do every type of bikini wax. I worked at a spa where a couple of the techs would do Brazilians or specialty waxes and others would not. Also, some pros will do all types of bikini waxes on women, but not on men. It would be frustrating to you and the tech if they weren't willing or properly trained to do a specialty wax at your appointment.While there are a lot of names or styles for bikini waxes , most people customize their wax to how much hair they want left and removed. You donâ€™t need to be locked into any one kind of bikini wax , just go with your personal preference. Just be aware that the price often goes up with more hair removed, or if it involves added time- like getting a perfect and even shape with a Brazilian.

Waxing your bikini area bald from the get-go may be more than you bargained for. Removing hair from the root gets easier over time.Just make sure when you do get your wax, that you have fully communicated with the technician your preferences of what hair you want removed and left.

Men are also experimenting with different bikini waxes , from a clean up to removing it all.
