Whether it’s Brad Stevens or Chris Holtmann at the helm, Butler is somehow always underrated -- and almost always overachieves. \nMaybe Butler likes playing as an underdog. Or maybe Holtmann’s team responds best to the intense pressure of playing top teams. \nWhatever the case, it’s time the Bulldogs received their due. \nButler had its back to the wall, trailing by seven with 10 minutes to play. But the Bulldogs mounted a 15-0 run stitched together by hard-nosed defense and forcing the veteran Wildcats into making rookie mistakes with untimely turnovers and ill-advised shots. \n“It didn’t look real good when we fell behind [in the second half],” Holtmann said, “but our guys showed some grit tonight.” \nButler outscored Villanova 32-17 over the final 10 minutes. \nGrit is an understatement. \nTwo of Villanova’s three losses have come to Butler. And while the Bulldogs likely won’t get a huge boost for beating a conference foe (with the Big East standings all but set), it made them just the third team to reach six wins over ranked opponents. — Butler Basketball HQ (@ButlerBBHQ) February 23, 2017 Add a comment ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:45:59.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
