Photo: Andrew Meares \nLast week, five asylum seekers who were found not to be owed protection accepted a $20,000 offer to voluntarily return to Nepal, Mr Rintoul said. But about 170 rejected asylum seekers remain on Manus Island, refusing to leave. \nThe PNG lawyer representing the asylum seekers, Ben Lomai, said he would file an urgent application this week to injunct any deportations until a separate bid to have the asylum seekers brought to Australia is heard in court. Advertisement \nMr Lomai said his clients were worried they may face persecution back in their home countries, despite having their asylum claims knocked back. Many of those decisions had not yet been subject to judicial review, he said. \nWhile the Turnbull government is confident of its resettlement deal with the US for those found to be owed asylum, PNG has been left to deal with the smaller contingent of asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. \nOf particular concern are the Iranians, the largest group, because Iran has long refused to accept any person who is repatriated involuntarily. It confirmed that position as recently as March , despite attempts by Australia to strike a deal. \nOne such person is the Iranian asylum seeker and cartoonist known by pen name Eaten Fish. The 25-year-old, whose real name is Ali, suffers severe mental illness and has been on a hunger strike for one week, according to advocates. \nThe PNG Supreme Court ruled in April that the indefinite detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island was unconstitutional and therefore that the processing centre must close, increasing pressure on Australia to find a solution. \nThe position of the Australian government is that those found not to be refugees should return home, and those found to be genuine should resettle in Nauru or PNG, or a third country such as the US where a deal is struck. \nPNG's acting chief migration officer Solomon Kantha said on Monday: \"Non-refugees who do not elect to depart voluntarily will have their departure enforced, consistent with PNG domestic legislation and our international obligations.\" \n\"[PNG] is actively seeking travel documents for these non-refugees, and is in the advanced stages of planning the removal of this group, which currently numbers 168 persons,\" Mr Kantha reportedly told PNG's The Post Courier . \n\"Travel document applications have been lodged with respect of 60 persons, and as a result it is expected the first removals will commence in a few weeks, with these continuing on a regular basis as travel documents are issued.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:11:08.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
