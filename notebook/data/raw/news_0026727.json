Enter into that National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who stands accused of potentially violating the law about a discussion he had with the Russian ambassador to the US, misleading the vice president about that conversation, and changing his public stance on whether it might have happened or not. Toss that into the cutthroat battle for influence in the Trump White House and one of President Trump’s highest-profile and closest advisers has a countdown clock ticking over him. Or, make that two such people, with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also in a fight to keep his job. Newsmax CEO (and Trump friend) Chris Ruddy went on TV over the weekend to opine, “I think there's a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff.” This is a nasty, ugly story. What might save Flynn and Priebus, at least for now, is that there are so many warring White House factions and so many competing Trump storylines that the lack of focus could be Flynn’s friend. THE SLEEPER STORY: Did the “deportation force” get its marching orders? That’s the concern in some immigrant communities, which are seeing aggressive enforcement actions that they fear speaks to a new tone as well as a new policy under the Trump administration. It’s not yet clear if this marks a true break by ICE from the previous administration. But a Trump executive order did make clear that ICE officers can judge whether an individual broadly poses “a risk to public safety” in prioritizing deportation. And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told ABC’s Jim Avila last week that his department is just following the letter of the law: “People like me and ICE and other private citizens can’t pick and choose the laws they are gonna obey.” With the president’s travel ban stalled in court and more executive actions expected, how much Trump makes good on one of his shifting campaign promises – deportation – will become a bigger deal in coming days. THE SHINY STORY: So the Department of Education can’t spell. More accurately, whoever runs the Department of Education’s Twitter account made an unfortunate series of typos – spelling W.E.B. Du Bois’ last name wrong in a quote, then typing “apologizes” instead of “apologies” in cleaning it up. It’s bad timing for careless errors, with an already embattled Cabinet secretary, Betsy DeVos, not even in the job for a full week, and critics of the department’s new leadership still energized after a nearly successful campaign to block her. But does anyone think dinging DeVos underlings for spelling – or blocking the secretary herself from entering a DC public school, for that matter – makes a point that will improve public education in this country? DeVos is in place for the long haul now. Both her fans and her detractors will need to look for true teachable moments, not gotcha spell-checks. TLDR: The pressure on National Security Advisor Michael Flynn continues to mount, as it becomes clearer the conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the US may have been more than his original story, potentially misleading the VP and even violating the law.
