It has long been a very real possibility but, as Bayern Munich tore the team he built to shreds over 45 excruciating second-half minutes on Wednesday night, it became a clear probability that this would be his 21st and last season at Arsenal. \nIt is a moment that will test the entire club; not least those fans whose right to an opinion is not questioned but who have, on occasion, crossed the line into outright disrespect for their club’s greatest manager. \nThere is a banner hanging from a hoarding inside the Emirates that reads, ‘You can’t buy class’ and it would be a desperately sad and lasting blot if Wenger’s final weeks as manager were accompanied by the sort of toxic atmosphere that has become increasingly evident. \nBrian Clough did not have to put up with that when he was leading Nottingham Forest to relegation in his final season and Arsenal are not even remotely close to that sort of collapse. \nThat the end is now likely is a conclusion not derived from any particular observation of Wenger’s body language in defeat against Bayern – he always seems to turn almost visibly grey and sick-looking in defeat - but simply a consistent interpretation of what was expected when he signed a new contract in 2014. Wenger saw his team humbled in Munich on Wednesday night Credit: AP \nA myth about Arsenal is that nothing will ever change and that a new contract would be dished out and signed just so long as a top four finish is achieved. There was certainly a sense that Champions League qualification represented a decent performance in those years from 2007 until around 2014 when the financial restrictions from moving stadium were at their greatest. Yet it was different then. \nWenger had rebuilt the ‘Invincible’ team and ambitiously believed that a new core headed by Cecs Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri, Andrei Arshavin and Theo Walcott could defy the spending power of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United. \nIt did not happen and his best players jumped ship but, in the circumstances of still regularly challenging at the edges, this was not regarded as a resigning or sacking offence. Yet expectations shifted after 2014 once the club were freed from restrictive 10-year sponsorship deals that were tied to the construction of the Emirates. \nWenger was given the opportunity to rebuild again. There have been few financial restrictions in recent years. The signings last summer of Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka were supposed to be the final pieces in a jigsaw that had been constructed around the marquee signings of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Petr Cech. \nNo major player has left. There is money in the bank and yet still the team has remained prone to the same sort of humiliating defeats against the very best opposition. \nThere was little mitigation in Munich. There is not a long list of injuries and, in overlooking the experience and presence of players like Petr Cech, Olivier Giroud, Mohamed Elneny, Danny Welbeck, Theo Walcott and even Per Mertesacker once Laurent Koscielny came off, Wenger clearly got his selections wrong. \nHow they then folded mentality was frightening. If we are blunt, Wednesday night’s 5-1 scoreline was more flattering to Arsenal than Bayern . It was similar against Chelsea earlier this month in the sense that the match rarely ever looked likely to end in anything but an Arsenal defeat. Watch | Arsene Wenger describes ‘nightmare’ match against Bayern Munich 01:46 \nW enger’s instinct will probably be to fight on for now. Not in the sense that he will be minded to sign a new contract. That will be the last thing on his mind; but in the sense that it is February and that a successful ending to the season is still just about feasible. \nOverturning a 5-1 deficit against Bayern and a 10-point gap to Chelsea probably are impossible tasks but, while there is a glimmer of hope, Wenger is unlikely to make definitive statements about the future. \nIt must now be tempting; it would certainly take much of the tension and pressure out of the situation. It might even turn his final matches into a celebration of an extraordinary 20 years at the club but he is likely to be moved. \nNear the end of the season was always his timescale on a decision and he is unlikely to be budged from that. There will be those of course who say he should have gone long before now; that Wednesday night only proved their point but it is an easy argument. Bayern v Arsenal ratings \nW enger’s record never previously made change the natural decision to take. He was the club’s most successful manager. He had the fourth biggest budget in the Premier League. He never finished outside the top four. He had taken the club into a new stadium and to a point where they could feasibly compete with the very best. \nIt was logical to give him the chance to turn that dream into reality. There are also few guarantees that change would have made much difference. \nYou only have to look at how Jurgen Klopp, Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino have done relative to Wenger over the last few Premier League season to see that. Only Mourinho, when Chelsea won the league in 2015, has finished above Arsenal. \nYet following the new three-year contract in 2014, it was always a personal view that Arsenal would need to challenge to win either the Premier League or Champions League over the three years that followed for Wenger to go on. \nThat is now highly unlikely and, while finishing third and then second in the league, as well as a record-breaking sixth FA Cup hardly constitutes disaster since 2014, it is still short of what the club wanted. \nThere is no need for excessive rage – and there can be little certainly of an improvement under a new manager - but the sense of deja-vu in the manner of Arsenal’s defeats against the very best has become damning. \nThere has been a clear ceiling on performances and, as Arsenal left Munich on Wednesday night, there was an unmistakeable sense that change is both necessary and now coming.
