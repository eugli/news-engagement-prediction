(Photo: Josh Peter, USA TODAY Sports)   \nLOS ANGELES — Hundred dollar bills bearing the face of Floyd Mayweather hang from a \"Money\" tree outside the ballroom in which his 40th birthday party will be held on Saturday night at a hotel in downtown Los Angeles, but that won’t be the most stunning sight at the boxer’s bash. \nAs Mayweather, whose legendary spending habits are nearly as remarkable as his brilliance in the boxing ring, prepares to celebrate in style, event organizers revealed that two caged Siberian tigers would also be in attendance. \nSinger Bobby Brown is scheduled to perform and celebrities expected to attend include Justin Bieber and Mariah Carey. There was no word however, on whether mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been linked with a fight against Mayweather, got an invitation. \nDespite rumors of that potential super-fight dominating talk in both the boxing and MMA worlds and a highly-lucrative showdown appearing to move closer, Mayweather has repeatedly insisted he is content to enjoy his retirement. He was certainly poised to do so on Saturday night. \nContributing: Martin Rogers.
