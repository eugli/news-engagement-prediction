Pin \nNick arrives at Chelsea’s studio to apologize for Faith and finds her wearing a wedding gown from her collection. Chelsea wonders if she should start sketching a wedding dress for Sharon. Nick assures her he will never get back with Sharon, but Chelsea laughs; getting back with your ex is practically a Newman family tradition. Nick helps with a jammed zipper and they wind up in close proximity briefly. Talk turns back to Faith’s meddling. Chelsea says Sharon still loves Dylan; being with his brother would be little comfort right now. Nick asks if she’s talking about Sharon, or them. He asks her out to dinner. Chelsea jokes, but accepts, though she doesn’t think tonight is ideal. “It’s Valentine’s Day.” Nick agrees it’s a lot of pressure. She takes a call and he leaves. \nAt Crimson Lights, Lily learns Sharon poured milk over Nikki and says she understands about in-laws. Sharon explains that she’s the sole owner of the coffee house since Dylan left and is divorcing her. She plans to make her new reality work. \nIn her car, Sharon pulls out a photo of Dylan and cries. She flashes through everyone who went off on her for lying about Sully/Christian and starts the car. \nMore: CBS Daytime celebrates 30 year milestone with photo shoot \nCane and Billy debate about work strategies at Brash & Sassy.
