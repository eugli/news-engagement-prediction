The initiative will likely reduce transaction costs by about 70 basis points in two years for Bharat Financial that lends at 19.75% a year, the lowest rate in the microfinance industry. \n\nIndia's micro-loan borrowers need access to inexpensive credit as funding costs in the $2-trillion South Asian nation is among the highest in economies of comparable size. Credit costs for prime category borrowers start at about 8.5% a year for low-risk collateralised loans, such as home mortgages. \n\n\n\nThe company expects the cost to income ratio to fall to 40% in two years from 47% at present. The technology rollout will involve a three-step process - Aadhar-based and online customer documentation, credit bureau authentication and e-signing. The system will cut down the time taken for loan approval from seven days to seven minutes. \n\nBharat Financial has 66 lakh customers across one lakh villages in 16 states. Its gross loan portfolio , excluding Andhra and Telangana , was Rs 8,531 crore at the end of December, 2016, registering a 38% year-on-year growth. \n\nThe linking of Aadhaar will help crediting the loan directly into borrowers' bank accounts. The lender had run a pilot in Odisha in September-December 2016. \n\nâ€œThe system will be rolled out across India by June 30,\" chief operating officer KV Rao said. \n\nBharat Financial is experimenting using neighbourhood grocers as rural distribution service points to dispense cash to borrowers. Rao said if the initiative is successful, this would ensure last mile connectivity and field workers need not carry cash with them for either disbursements or repayments. \n\nThe lender had failed to get a small-finance bank licence and can't access low-cost public savings, limiting its capacity to reduce fund costs.
