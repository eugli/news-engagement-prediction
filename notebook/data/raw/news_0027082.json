The figure is far below the totals of similar raids conducted under the Obama administration. \nThe raids have left immigrant communities worried about stepped-up enforcement efforts and the White House taking credit for arrests. But Homeland Security described the roundups as routine. \nDHS Secretary John Kelly said Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeted immigrants who are a threat to public safety, including convicted criminals and gang members. He said 75 percent of those arrested were criminals, some of whom had been convicted of homicide and aggravated sexual assault. \nICE officials said 161 people from 13 countries were arrested in the Los Angeles area, all but 10 of whom were convicted criminals. More than 100 people arrested there were from Mexico. In Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina 190 immigrants were arrested, 127 of whom were convicted criminals. \nKelly said arrests were also made by agents working in New York, Atlanta, Chicago and San Antonio. \nDetails of who was arrested were not made available, but the arrests and rumors about other raids sparked fear and confusion among immigrants. \nImmigration advocates and the White House both suggested the arrests were President Donald Trump’s first salvo in what he has promised will be a stepped up campaign to find and deport criminal immigrants and others living in the U.S. illegally. \nTrump on Monday bragged that his administration was following through on his campaign pledge and targeting “the bad ones.” U.S. President Donald Trump (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) \n“I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we are going to get them out,” Trump said at a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \nICE officials and Kelly, however, have said the arrests were part of routine enforcement efforts. Similar roundups under former President Barack Obama yielded far more arrests. In March 2015, ICE said a five-day enforcement effort ended with more than 2,000 arrests. \nDuring the Obama administration, however, ICE agents generally arrested wanted immigration fugitives and convicted criminals. Last week’s arrests included immigrants whose only offense was an immigration violation. \nBy ALICIA A. CALDWELL, Associated Press \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
