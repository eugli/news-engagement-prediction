Today the photo was leading plenty more websites and fat shaming was in full swing. Quade Cooper & his opponent Jack McInnes fighting tonight!. Who is your tip to win? @apaulrove #MundineGreen2 @telegraph_sport @TripleM_NRL pic.twitter.com/xF8GjTujzF — Ali Chahrour (@AliChahrour94) February 3, 2017 \nSo, how did McInnes react to the social media trolls, why does he look so out of shape, and how the bloody hell did this apparent mismatch (on Body Mass Index grounds at least) come about? \nMcInnes’s coach Craig Glover, explained everything to foxsports.com.au. \nWHO IS HE? \nMcInnes, 22, is a part time fighter and full time plasterer, originally from Cooktown, who is now handled in Hervey Bay by Glover. \n“He works all day, comes into the ring dripping with plaster and belts out a few rounds on the pads,” Glover says. \n“He has a heart the size of an elephant. You could put him in against anyone and know it will be a quality fight.” \nAlthough McInnes has had two boxing matches for two losses, his passion is for Thai kickboxing and he’s made some money in several pro bouts among 50 plus career fights. \n“He’s tough he’s always been the underdog and he’s never had an easy fight,” said Glover. “He’s not a big road runner, as his physique indicates, he’s just got a big heart. “ \nTO ORDER THE FIGHT, LOG ON TO mainevent.com.au , CALL 131-999 OR USE THE MYFOXTEL APP. COVERAGE BEGINS AT 6PM AEDT ON FOX SPORTS 5 AND ON MAIN EVENT FROM 7PM AEDT. \nWHY DOES HE LOOK OUT OF SHAPE? \nIn this case, looks do not deceive. This is not Jack McInnes in prime condition and there’s a very good reason for that. \n“When he got the call up for this — a whole two weeks ago — he said he do it to give Quade someone to fight,” said Glover. \n“As the photos indicate, he’s not in peak fitness. He’s only been training the last two weeks for this one, which is more than he’s trained for his only two boxing fights.” \nWhen the call came, the fight was set for 93kg. McInnes was 106. \n“He told them he didn’t think he’d get down that low,” says Glover. \nBut McInnes, who can get a bit hungry after a big work day on the hawk and trowel, started on the salads. Then he suffered an elbow injury. \n“We actually pulled out a week ago because of the injury but he was talked back into it,” says Glover. \nHe told the promoters he would never make the weight. \n“When he pulled out he ate lots. He was sick of eating lettuce so he went off and had a couple of decent feeds and put the kilos back on.” \nThe promoters abandoned 93 and gave him a benchmark of 99. He weighed in on Thursday in the 96s. \nTHE PHOTO AND THE FALLOUT \nGlover said the picture and subsequent public response might just be the best thing that could have happened for McInnes, even though they were both shocked by the intensity and number of comments. \n“We arranged after the weigh in to have dinner and (he’s) come into my room and said it’s on Facebook. I saw it and thought ‘crikey, it’s gone viral.’ \n“He was concerned and said ‘some of it’s not good, they’re really picking on me’. \n“I had a look and turned everything into a positive for him, and 1000 comments later he was joking about it. \n“He realises what it’s done is taken all the pressure off him and, unfortunately for Quade, put all the pressure on Quade. \n“Quade’s in a difficult situation here. If he wins people are probably going to chastise him, and if he doesn’t then probably the same.” \nAnd McInnes quickly went from being an unknown to someone the fans at Friday’s fight could get behind. \n“Aussies like the underdogs and apparently we’ve got a fair bit of Kiwi support as well!” joked Glover, winking at Cooper’s hostile relationship with Kiwi fans. \n“While we were at dinner he had about 60 friend requests and 30 randoms inboxing him wishing him the best of luck and telling him not to worry about Facebook comments. He’s got so much support, more than he would ever have had. I’ve got a feeling when he walks out tonight he’ll have most of the crowd behind him.” \nGlover revealed McInnes’s third career boxing bout — will likely be his last. \n“Work has to be his No. 1 priority now he has a young bloke, and is settling down with a lovely lady. He’s copped a few injuries. You don’t have 55 fights and walk out unscathed.” \nAlthough, weight aside, unscathed is how he looks, with many mentioning McInnes’ youthfulness. \n“I was saying, ‘mate they can’t help you’ve had a good life, kept yourself fit and so young looking. Let’s show them what this baby-faced 22 year old can dish out’.” 'No Green with no Mundine' 2:00 \nBoxing: Ahead of their big clash, Mundine claims 'there would be no Danny Green without Anthony Mundine' February 3rd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:03:43.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
