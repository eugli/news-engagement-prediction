Reuters Gareth Bale scored on his comeback for Real Madrid against Espanyol \nAnd now the European champions are within touching distance of the Catalans’ 63-year-old goalscoring record too. \nKeep up to date with ALL the latest Real Madrid news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nGoals from Alvaro Morata and the returning Gareth Bale in the 2-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday meant Madrid have now netted in 42 consecutive matches. \nThat figure includes ALL 37 games so far this season, plus the final five of the last campaign. \nIt is already a club record – having topped Jose Mourinho ’s mark of 41 from 2011-12. \nBut, with away clashes against Valencia and Villarreal to come this week, the Bernabeu giants could level Barca’s historic 44-game streak.
