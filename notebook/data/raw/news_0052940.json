Check it out here: \nThe initial prognosis was that the former Malaga midfielder would return in March and Arsene Wenger was hopeful that the Spaniard would be back to give his side a boost in the latter stages of the season. \nSpeaking in January, he said: \n\"Santi is far from starting to run again. He had a little procedure and we have a meeting with the medical people today to see what it really was.'Certainly he will not be available in the next six weeks, that is for sure. \n\"Will he play again this season? I hope so because once you start to go outside, you have to count six weeks' preparation. \n\"At the moment he is not at that level. 'Let's hope he can come back in the next three or four weeks on the pitch.\" \nEvidence suggested that Cazorla wasn't anywhere near ready for a return to action just over a week ago when he was pictured out in London, wearing a flip-flop on his injured foot.

He is also well-liked around the club and in the Arsenal squad. \nA big blow for Arsenal.
