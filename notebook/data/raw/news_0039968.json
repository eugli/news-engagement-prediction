Everyone’s ears pricked up,” Thornton said. \n“It was taking longer than usual, but I expected that. When I rocked up and it was my turn to talk to the Customs and Border Protection officer he asked all the regular questions. It was nothing out of the ordinary.” \nHowever, it wasn’t long before the interview took a very strange turn. \n“Have you been here before?” \n“Yes.” \n“How long are you here?” \n“10 days.” \n“What will you be doing?” \n“Vacationing.” \nThornton told news.com.au he got the sense he was about to be allowed in, so he picked up his bags as the officer asked one last question. \n“What do you do for a living?” \n“I told him I’m a software engineer. He asked if I knew Python code, and I said yes. It’s a programming language, like C or Java, and it’s pretty standard,\" Thornton said. \nThe follow-up question was something he’d ever been asked before. Eventually he was allowed in, and he took this snap of the city’s skyline. Source: Supplied \n“‘I’ve got a problem, I’m trying to write a computer program, can you help me?’” \nThornton said he was so surprised he didn’t know what to think. \n“I was a little bit taken aback, because I thought I was going to get straight in. \n“He started to read off his computer, and I got the feeling he was trying to trick me. I just wanted to get into the US, so I said: ‘Of course’.” \nHe said the officer appeared to be mid to senior level, and there’s no chance the conversation would have been overheard by anyone else in line. \nFor the next few minutes, he was forced to prove his worth — even given a pen and paper to record his answers. \n“He administered a literal computer science test. It wasn’t a savant-level one like you hear of at Google, but it was definitely a test. \n“The vibe I got was weird. He asked me a question, then asked me a follow-up question to prove I wasn’t lying. \n“Do they not allow bad software engineers into the United States?” Thornton joked. \nHe clearly passed, because he was allowed into the country a short time later, and spent a few days exploring New York before visiting family friends in Texas. \nEven his American mates were surprised by the odd line of questioning. \nSeth Porges, a science and technology journalist who frequently appears on the Discovery Channel and National Geographic, went so far as to tweet about it. \n“Australian guy I know was just stopped at [the airport]. CBP asked what he does. “Computer programmer.’ Then had him solve a CS problem. #NotKidding.” \nReflecting on the incident, Thornton said it was strange considering he didn’t think of his job as being particularly contentious. \n“Do I think this will put people off? For sure,” he told news.com.au. \n“What would I say about my experience? Just make sure you study up before you enter the United States!” Trump loses appeal to reinstate travel ban 3:46 \nA US federal appeals court has maintained a suspension of President Donald Trump's immigration order.
