Key points: Boars are eating mushrooms containing Caesium 137 Boar meat is a delicacy in the Czech Republic 47 per cent of boars tested from 2014 to 2016 exceeded radioactivity limits \nA cold and snowy winter is forcing them to feed on false truffles, an underground mushroom common in the Sumava mountain region shared by Czechs, Austrians, Germans — and wild boars. \nThe mushrooms can absorb high levels of the radioactive isotope Caesium 137. And three decades ago the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl released Caesium 137 that eventually drifted down on the Sumava mountains. \nNow the boars are eating the mushrooms and ingesting the Caesium 137 along with them — which is making their meat radioactive, Jiri Drapal at the State Veterinary Administration said. \n\"It is more or less a seasonal issue,\" Mr Drapal said. \nBut it is a long season. The half life of Caesium 137 is 30 years — that is, it takes 30 years for the radioactivity of the isotope to fall to half its original value. \nThen another 30 to fall to half again, and so on. The boars could be radioactive for quite a while. \n\"We can expect to find [affected] food for a number of years from now,\" Mr Drapal said. \nAnd that could cause some problems with the supply of boar meat, which is a delicacy in the Czech Republic. \nIt often shows up on restaurant menus in goulash, a thick stew of meat, sauce and dumplings. \nAny boar that ends up as goulash ought to be safe. Every wild animal hunted, not only boars, must be inspected before its meat can get to customers. \nRadioactive meat is banned from circulation, Mr Drapal said. \nThat is the good news. The bad news is that 614 animals were inspected from 2014 to 2016, and 47 per cent were above the limit — almost half. \nThe semi-good news is that even meat from radioactive animals would be a health hazard only in large doses, Mr Drapal said. \nYou would have to eat it several times a week for couple of months to get sick, he said. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:40.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
