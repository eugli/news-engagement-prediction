Credit Tonner Doll Company Inc. From the moment she learned how to walk and talk, Jazz Jennings gravitated toward dresses and dolls. They were among the earliest signs that Jazz, born male, identified as female. Now Ms. Jennings, 16, who rose to fame as one of the youngest people ever documented as transgender, will have a new doll to call her own — one modeled after her. “Ever since I was little, I always loved playing with dolls,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “It was a great way to show my parents that I was a girl, because I could just express myself as I am.

I thought she was an amazing kid with amazing parents.” Ms. Walters first interviewed Ms. Jennings on the ABC News program “20/20” in a 2007 episode that focused on transgender children and their families . That appearance vaulted Ms. Jennings into the national spotlight. She was just 6 years old at the time. 20/20 - My Secret Self Pt.2 Video by BastisWifey07 Since then, she has written two books: a 2014 children’s book, with Jessica Herthel, and a memoir, released last year.
