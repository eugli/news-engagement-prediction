Ezekiel Elliott hurdles Eagles defender (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:39 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:39 p.m. ET \nCowboys legend Tony Dorsett was greatly impressed when rookie phenom Ezekiel Elliott earned the league rushing title for Dallas in 2016, but that doesn't mean Dorsett doesn't have some advice for the young Dallas running back. \nDorsett, who recently opened about on his battle with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), said Elliott will need to stop one aspect of his play if he wants to leave the NFL in relatively healthy condition. \nMORE: NFL players diagnosed with CTE \nDorsett, when asked what he thought of Elliott hurdling defenders, said he cringes whenever he sees the Cowboys running back's acrobatics. \n\"He better stop that. He better stop that,\" Dorsett said in a video interview with the Star-Telegram . \"That's one thing I don't like. Because when you're getting airborne, you're at the mercy of the hit, and you can't protect yourself. \n\"I think as he gets older, he may take that out of his repertoire.\" \nElliott certainly dazzled in his rookie campaign, but he may consider taking Dorsett's advice â€” at least if he wants to continue making defenders look silly.
