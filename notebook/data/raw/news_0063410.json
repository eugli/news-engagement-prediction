It is pickpocketing the people to feed jumbo budgets through unbridled revenue collection,\" he said. \nThe BNP leader said the people will 'never accept' the decision to collect revenue by 'holding them hostage'. \n\"We strongly demand cancellation of this unethical, irrational and anti-public government decision to raise gas prices,\" he said. \nAsked if the party is announcing any demonstration in support of the demand, he said, \"We will let you know about this later.\" According to the new prices, the household consumers will have to shell out 50 percent more for stoves than they are now while those using meters will have an additional 60 percent added to their bills\nPrice of compressed natural gas (CNG), used for automobiles, will go up by 14.28 percent. For power generation, fertiliser production, industries and commercial entities, gas prices are rising by 5 to 50 percent. \nMirza Fakhrul criticised the government's 'import-based' policy to buy different types of fuel. \n\"Fuel security will face a threat of diversification because of the move,\" he said. \n\"We think the economy will be hit hard following the hike in gas prices. Export-oriented garment and other sectors will face a crisis.\" \n\"Transport fare will rise. The poor will be under pressure,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:23:58.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
