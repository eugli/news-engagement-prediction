Robinson Niñal/Presidential Photo MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang clarified Monday that President Rodrigo Duterte did not order the release of P2 billion to quake-hit areas in Surigao City. During his visit to earthquake survivors last Sunday, the president vowed to release money for those who lost their loved ones and sources of living. “I’ll release a little. Is two billion enough for you? You won’t really be able to spend all that, will you? Why don’t we just buy them all a subdivision and house and lot,” the official English translation of the president’s Bisaya speech read. Several media outlets then reported that the president directed the release of P2 billion to assist communities affected by the earthquake. Andanar, however, said the president was referring to the mining issue when he made the statement. “I would like to clarify that the president was saying that in the context of the mining. He said when mining firms are closed, people will lose jobs. Okay, people will lose jobs so he will give money, P2 billion,” he told radio station dzRH. Asked to confirm that the amount was not necessarily for rehabilitation of quake-hit areas, Andanar replied: “That’s how I understood it.” He said that even Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go did not hear anything about disbursing P2 billion for earthquake survivors. “He (Duterte) said there is P1 billion given to DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) for medicines, another P1 billion for those who need help,” the president’s chief communications strategist said. “That’s how I understand it. That was the one discussed by the president, he was talking about the mining problem all throughout, then he inserted the P2 billion,” he added. As this developed, Malacañang said authorities have improved the distribution of assistance in Surigao following complaints about the slow delivery of aid. “The relief goods were delivered Sunday from Butuan. Distribution was initially hampered by an inadequate distribution system. The victims were already expecting the relief goods as early as 5 a.m., but the local government made a judgment call to wait for the president who arrived by 1 p.m.,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said. “Food packs were finally distributed around 2 p.m. after (the president) made the initial distribution. Three thousand family food packs were then successfully shared after DSWD Caraga officials, local government, barangay officials and Surigao City mayor worked out a more efficient distribution system,” he added.
