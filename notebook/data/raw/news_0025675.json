(Representative photo) \nInvigilators for intermediate examination, which began Tuesday, heaved a sigh of relief after the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) late Monday evening clarified that male invigilators were not supposed to frisk girls and submit an undertaking to this effect. \nThe BSEB had earlier issued instructions to invigilators to frisk examinees and submit written undertaking to centre superintendents to this effect. \nThe written declaration would have made the invigilators liable to face action should any chit be found on any examinee. \nMore than the departmental action, their worry was having to face sexual harassment charge in course of frisking girls. \n“Orders have now been issued that women invigilators be deputed at such centres. If not, male invigilators will not frisk girl examinees and they will not have to submit such an undertaking,” BSEB chairman Anand Kishor told HT late Monday evening. \nOn examination eve, general secretary of the Bihar Secondary Teachers Association, Shatrughan Prasad Singh, a former MP from Begusarai, was livid with BSEB’s earlier order. Taking up cudgels for male teacher-invigilators, Singh had asked them neither to frisk girl examinees, nor give any written undertaking. \nIn keeping with BSEB directive to randomise teachers for invigilation duty, many male teachers had been deputed at women examination centres. \n“I have received specific information from at least four districts, including Begusarai, Munger, Jehanabad and Vaishali that male invigilators have been deputed at women examination centres. I have asked them to keep away from frisking girls and giving any written undertaking to this effect,” he said. \nOf the 12.61 lakh intermediate examinees, 5.56 lakh are girls. There is one invigilator for every 25 examinees. Each of Bihar’s 38 districts has roughly 2-4 centres exclusively for girls. \nThe BSEB, in an attempt to redeem its image after the merit scam in 2016, has taken a slew of measures to check unfair means at exams. One such decision is to frisk examinees before they enter examination halls. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:45.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
