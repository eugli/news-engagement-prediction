(Photo: =AFP/Getty Images) 5 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON — As much as he criticized countries like Mexico and China during his presidential campaign, Donald Trump also had some harsh words for Japan — the starting points for Friday's visit to the White House by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \nAbe plans to address Trump's concerns about Japanese trade policies and defense spending during a summit scheduled to stretch out over two days. After Friday meetings at the White House, the Japanese leader is expected to join Trump on Air Force One for a trip to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. The Saturday agenda includes a round of golf. \n\"The amount of time that the president is going to spend with Prime Minister Abe is considerable,\" said Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia and Japan at the Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies. \"Abe clearly wants to start a relationship with the current administration.\" \nFor his part, Trump is expected to reaffirm the nation's commitment to the U.S-Japan friendship, including the security alliance. \nAbe, who also met with Trump in New York City during the post-election transition, told reporters before leaving Tokyo that \"I want to hold a summit that can send a message saying the Japan-U.S. alliance will strengthen further with President Trump.\" \nOne thing Abe likely won't do: ask Trump to revive the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, the seemingly defunct 12-nation trade deal in which Japan would have been a key player. Trump notified allies last month he would not ask Congress to ratify the proposed agreement that he said would have sent U.S. jobs overseas. \nInstead, Abe is expected to begin talks about a revising bilateral trade agreements between the United States and Japan, and to commit to Japanese investments in the U.S. economy. \"We will develop the two countries' economies even more based on free and fair rules,\" Abe told reporters. \nAccording to Japanese media reports, Abe will push the \"Japan-US Growth and Employment Initiative,\" including investments in U.S. infrastructure projects that could help to create up to 700,000 jobs. \nTrump's complaints about Japanese trade practices, including what he calls currency manipulation, stretch back to his days as a businessman in the 1980s, a time when Japan's economy was growing rapidly. \nRead more: The first 100 days of the Trump presidency \nIn his presidential campaign, Trump also complained about what he-called \"one-sided\" deals in which the United States supplies troops and general defense assistance to allies, but bear a disproportionate share of the costs. \nCandidate Trump often singled out Japan. Told once that the Japanese pay at least half the costs, Trump said: “Why don’t they pay 100%?\" \nIn Japan, Abe has proposed increased defense spending in the face of critics who cite the demilitarization of the county after its defeat in World War II. Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada said last week that \"appropriate burden sharing is happening\" pursuant to existing agreements between the two countries. \nDuring a recent trip to Japan, Trump Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reaffirmed the United States commitment to defending Japan. Mattis singled out an issue involving a group of disputed islands also claimed by China — another expected topic of the Obama-Abe summit. \nIn addition to meetings, Trump and Abe will conduct a joint news conference early Friday afternoon before leaving for Florida. Many implications \nThe weekend \"is fraught with implications for the U.S.-Japan alliance, the global economy, and Asian-Pacific security,\" said Patrick Cronin, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program with the Center for a New American Security. \nThe two men reportedly got on well after their November meeting, aides said, and are expected to do so again this weekend — especially on the golf course. \n\"We’re going to have a round of golf, which is a great thing,\" Trump told Westwood One Sports Radio in a recent interview. \"That’s the one thing about golf — you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch.\" \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinsuke Kishi, right, and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower play golf in 1957. Kishi is the grandfather of current Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (Photo: AP) \nThe Abe-Trump golf outing is a nod to history — his grandfather, also a prime minister of Japan, hit the links with President Dwight Eisenhower. \nGreen, a member of the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said the odds favor a smooth Trump-Abe summit. On the other hand, Trump has had contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, so who knows? \n\"With President Trump,\" Green said, \"anything can happen.\" Facebook Posted!
