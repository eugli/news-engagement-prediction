We therefore hold that the conduct for which Stutzman was cited and fined in this case — refusing her commercially marketed wedding floral services to Ingersoll and Freed because theirs would be a same-sex wedding constitutes sexual orientation discrimination under the WLAD (Washington Law Against Discrimination),\" the opinion stated. \n\"We also hold that the WLAD may be enforced against Stutzman because it does not infringe any constitutional protection. As applied in this case, the WLAD does not compel speech or association.\" \nStutzman had long served Rob Ingersoll, one of the men who sued, selling flowers to him for nearly a decade. But when he asked her to provide flowers for his same-sex wedding, she felt she could not act against her Christian conviction to serve her friend. \nThe Family Research Council said it was \"stunned\" by the court's Thursday decision. \n\"Americans were told repeatedly that redefining marriage would have little impact on their lives. Yet now courts are seeking to drive families from their businesses – and now today even their homes as the result of crippling government imposed fines designed to force them to deny their faith,\" FRC President Tony Perkins said. \n\"Cultural elites,\" he argued, are succeeding in convincing judges to \"strip away the livelihoods of people.\" But he insisted that they will not sway public opinion. \n\"The Supreme Court must correct this gross injustice and we urge President [Donald] Trump to sign an executive order protecting religious freedom to ensure the federal government does not engage in the same discriminatory behavior as rogue states like Washington,\" Perkins stated. \n\"Americans of all backgrounds have suffered the loss of their religious freedoms because of [former President Barack] Obama-era policies. The time to protect religious freedom is now.\" \nAlliance Defending Freedom, the law firm backing Stutzman, has meanwhile issued a call for one million people to donate $24, in order to help the florist appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nADF noted that Stutzman has to pay attorneys' fees \"that the ACLU racked up in suing her\" and that oftentimes those fees end up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n\"It is alarming to think that Barronelle, a small business owner and creative professional who loves and respects everyone who walks through her shop's doors, stands to lose all she owns – her retirement, her life savings, her home. It's all at risk simply because her long-time friend and customer asked her to create custom art for one event that violated her conscience,\" the group wrote. \n\"This is a devastating loss, and Barronelle needs our prayers.\" Follow Stoyan Zaimov on Facebook: CPSZaimov ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:02:10.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
