Should Panthers look at DE Jared Odrick to solve pass-rush problem? By Matthew Stevens 16 hours ago Follow @MatthewS_Car 183 shares By: Matthew Stevens | 16 hours ago Follow @MatthewS_Car \nThe Carolina Panthers might have finished among the top teams in the NFL at rushing the quarterback last season, but for the first half of the year, it was rough going. It eventually took defensive end Mario Addison stepping up and leading the way before Carolina found its groove. \nNow with Addison and veteran defensive end Charles Johnson set to be free agents this offseason, a large bit of their pass-rushing talent could leave. The Panthers will have to address that this offseason, even if just re-signing their own and adding some outside talent. One option in free agency could be the recently released Jared Odrick .

As an all-around defensive lineman than can play at defensive end or defensive tackle, Odrick has versatility that Carolinaâ€™s defense could use right now with so much likely changing over the next few seasons. \nOdrick had injury trouble last season, allowing him to only play in six games. However, when healthy for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Odrick counted for 29 tackles, 5.5 sacks, three passes defended and a forced fumble. If signed to a more cap-friendly deal than the $7 million he was originally owed in 2017, Odrick could be a great pickup.

The move also looks to be the typical value-based signing typically attributed to general manager Dave Gettleman.
