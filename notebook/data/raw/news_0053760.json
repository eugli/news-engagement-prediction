The actress, 26, put on a glamorous appearance in blue with co-star and fellow Brit Dan Stevens, 34, who plays the Beast\nEmma recently opened up dished about imbuing her Belle with fearless girl power in the new live action version of the classic fairy tale, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, due out on Friday.\n'In the original you don't get much sense of Belle, who she is before she meets Beast, so I wanted to create a backstory,' the brunette shared.\n'We made her this mad wacky inventor,' in effect taking over from her father's character in the cartoon.\nThe opening song sets up the challenges Belle faces when it shows the boys going to school as the girls do the laundry.\nShe invents a washing machine powered by a donkey that frees the little girls from their chores and gives her the time to teach one how to read.\n'In the original you don't get much sense of Belle, who she is before she meets Beast, so I wanted to create a backstory,' the 26-year-old recently said\nStylish: Flashing a glimpse of her toned legs, she teamed it with a pair of black designer ankle boots\nSuave: She posed alongside Dan Stevens, who looked dapper in an olive green suit, coordinating shirt and funky glitter-encrusted Dr Martens\n'We made her this mad wacky inventor,' in effect taking over from her father's character in the cartoon,' she said of Belle\n(L-R) Actors Dan Stevens, Emma Watson and Luke Evans, who plays Gaston\nBut the deeply suspicious villagers destroy it.\n'They don’t think women should read and it goes further than that,' the Harry Potter star said.\n'Breaking the washing machine is symbolic of ... them really trying to break her spirit and trying to push her and mold her into a more \"acceptable\" version of herself.'\nIt's probably little wonder that Belle finds something to admire in the Beast, played by Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens, when she falls into his clutches.\nOf course, we all know that the Beast is a cursed prince condemned by a spell to live in his mansion as a giant hairy monster.\n(L-R) Josh Gad- who plays LeFou, Dan Stevens, Actress Emma Watson and Luke Evans\nThe stunning starlet may be trying out a bold new role, but she revealed she was left in tears looking back at her breakthrough role in Harry Potter.\nEmma soared to fame playing Hermione in the film series so was quick to see JK Rowling's spin-off play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child during the theatre production in London.\nRevealing she cried happy tears watching her character be played years on by Noma Dumezweni, she told People : It was so strange. It was so emotional seeing Noma’s performance in a way that I had not anticipated at all.\n'She walked in the room and I just spontaneously burst into tears … I had played that character so intensely up until that point, that to know that Hermione was going to be okay — I know it sounds crazy — but to know that everything turned out all right and everything in the world was okay, that there was someone else carrying her on and carrying her forward … it was just such a relief.'\nSuave: Josh Gad and Luke Evans looked dapper in smart wear for the photocall\nEmma also revealed that her latest role \"really toughened\" her up.\nShe told the March issue of Elle : 'There is a level of criticism that comes with being an actress and a public figure, which I expect but once you take a stance on something like feminism, that's a completely different ball game. It really toughened me up.'\nHowever, the actress doesn't want the focus to be on her but instead on making the world better.\n'Let’s see what we can do to \"move the needle\" and make a difference,' she said.\nThe crew: (L-R) Director Bill Condon, Actors Alexis Loizon, Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, Emma Watson, Luke Evans and composer Alan Menken\nThe star added that she is a 'sucker' for self-help books.\nShe shared: 'I love it. I will get really excited reading something like Ariana Huffington's 'The Sleep Revolution'. I am a sucker for anything that promises to change my life.\"\nAnd the brunette beauty has had numerous people ask her to write a book on feminism but insists she won't be doing something like that until she is older.\nShe said: 'I need to see and do a bit more first. It's not like I have been reading this material for years and I don't have an encyclopaedic knowledge. It can be a lot of pressure sometimes, as people expect me to know so much.\n'I'm no expert, and when people push me into a corner of \"Here's Emma Watson to lecture you on feminism\", it's uncomfortable because I am aware I have a long way to go. I am not sure I deserve all the respect I get yet, but I'm working on it.'\nBeauty And The Beast is due out on March 17.", "external_links": ["http://www.elleuk.com/", "http://people.com/movies/emma-watson-cried-happy-tears-seeing-hermiones-future-in-cursed-child/?xid=socialflow_twitter_peoplemag", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-21T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:54:53.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
