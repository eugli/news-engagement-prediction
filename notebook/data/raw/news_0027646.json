Stephen Curry (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:37 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:37 a.m. ET \nThe Nuggets' rout of the Warriors may go down as the biggest upset of the season considering what Denver was dealing with.Â \nWilson Chandler (illness), Mason Plumlee (trade), Emmanuel Mudiay (back), Danilo Gallinari (groin), Kenneth Faried (ankle) and Darrell Arthur (knee) were all sitting out Monday's game in Denver, but that didn't slow the Nuggets offensively against the best team in the NBA.Â \nMORE:Â Charles Oakley, James Dolan move toward truce in meeting with Adam Silver \nNikola Jokic recordedÂ his second career triple-double and theÂ Nuggets tied an NBA record with 24 3-pointers while routing the WarriorsÂ 132-110. \"The Joker\"Â set career highs in rebounds (21) and assists (12) to go with 17 points. \nThe Nuggets tied the 3-point mark set by the Rockets in December and had two 3-point attemptsÂ in the final minute to break the record, but failed to connect.Â Denver finished 24 of 40 from beyond the arc while Golden State wasÂ just 8 of 32 from long range, including 1 of 11 by an ice-cold Stephen Curry. \nKevin Durant led Golden State with 25 points while Curry had only 11Â in the Warriors' ninth loss of the season, tying their loss total from last year when they set an NBA record by winning 73 games.Â \nStud of the night \nEric Bledsoe bustedÂ out of his recent slump by dropping 37 points in a 110-108 loss to the Pelicans. The Phoenix point guard added five assists, three steals and two rebounds.Â \nDuds of the night \nDuring a 120-98Â loss to the Wizards, the Thunder missed 24 straight shots in the third quarter. Russell Westbrook went 0 for 9 from the field during the stretch in which they were outscored 32-5.Â \nHighlights \nAt 40-years-old Vince Carter can still provide us withÂ insane plays, like thisÂ obscure and-1Â in theÂ Grizzlies' 112-103 win over the Nets. When you've been playing as long as Vince, you've got a few tricks up your sleeve... pic.twitter.com/7tqrTlg6LM â NBA (@NBA) February 14, 2017 \nHopefully when John Wall is 40 he'll still be turning out dimes like hisÂ between-the-legs assist toÂ a streaking Otto Porter.
