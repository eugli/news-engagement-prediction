DC's planned solo Batman movie is back on. With a director. And Ben Affleck in the lead. And it's a name you have heard before. Matt Reeves, of Planet of the Apes fame, is back on as the director and producer of the next solo Batman movie. And he even has a statement! Reeves says: \nI have loved the Batman story since I was a child. He is such an iconic and compelling character, and one that resonates with me deeply. I am incredibly honored and excited to be working with Warner Bros. to bring an epic and emotional new take on the Caped Crusader to the big screen. \nAccording to a release by Warner Bros., Matt Reeves will also serve as a producer on the new standalone Batman movie, though the release neglects to mention a release date, a start of production, or even Ben Affleck, who many assume will still star as both Bruce Wayne and the Caped Crusader. In fact, Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter took to Twitter in the aftermath to confirm: Curiously, the Warners release makes no mention of Ben Affleck. Although insiders say he still attached. — Borys Kit (@Borys_Kit) February 23, 2017 \nThe announcement os Matt Reeve's hiring was made by Toby Emmerich, President and Chief Content Officer, Warner Bros. Pictures Group, who added: \nWe are thrilled to have Matt Reeves taking the helm of Batman, the crown jewel of our DC slate. Matt's deep roots in genre films and his evolution into an emotional world-building director make him the perfect filmmaker to guide the Dark Knight through this next journey.
