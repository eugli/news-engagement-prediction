Kobe Bryant reacts to Chris Child fight (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:37 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:37 a.m. ET \nBack in 2000, a young Kobe Bryant was playing the Knicks and got involved in a heated fight with Chris Childs. According to Childs, Bryant is lucky the fight didn't get more serious. \nSpeaking on ESPN's True Hoop podcast , the former New York guard detailed what led to the fight. He's placing the blame on Bryant, because of course he is. \nMORE: Magic, Raptors both winners in Serge Ibaka trade \n“I mean, if you watch the tape, he elbowed me twice. He started it. The reason I did…I looked at the ref and said, ‘Are you gonna do something about this?’ [The ref] put his hands out like, ‘Whatever.’ I’m like, ‘Okay, no problem, I got this.’ We run up and down the court and I say, ‘Young fella, if you do that again, I’ma take off on ya. I’ma take off.' \n\"So when you watch the tape, when he comes around a pick, he kind of lightweight head butts me to get me off. So once he did that, he’s taller than me and I’m in striking distance. So I took off on him. I didn’t want to knock him out, ’cause I could have. But if I did, I’d still be suspended right now. I didn’t put the shoulder in, I didn’t lean into it. I didn’t want to hurt him.\" \nAs the video shows, Childs got two punches in on Bryant, so the moment became a sort of legend considering his historic career. Childs said he took it easy on him because there was no need to get serious with it.
