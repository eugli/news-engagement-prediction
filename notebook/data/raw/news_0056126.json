The 39-year-old chef from Chauvin, Louisiana, is trying to keep real Cajun food — the kind her mama, Maxine, and her aunts and their mamas cooked — alive, some 70 miles away in New Orleans. \nEvery Thursday night (or very nearly), Melissa hosts a supper club that's both humble and rich. The menu changes according to the season and what's available, but might include oyster soup and buttermilk biscuits, okra and étouffée, and beignets dipped in cane syrup. She's made a few changes to her family recipes — she uses Poirier's Cane Syrup instead of Steen's, which is what she grew up with, and her biscuits and pies and yeast rolls are made using locally milled whole-grain flour from Bellegarde Bakery — but this feels like the kind of food your grandmother would cook (if grandma were an excellent Cajun cook). A post shared by Melissa Martin (@mosquitosupperclub) on Dec 3, 2016 at 10:12am PST \nAnd sitting down at Melissa's table feels like sitting down with family. To that end, it's a BYO affair, but the drizzly night that I attended her Mosquito Supper Club . the gathering kicked off with hot toddies and ended with a group of us sharing whatever wine was leftover from the crowd. The point is: You won't go hungry or thirsty. \nThe supper club started as a pop-up in the French Quarter, but it now has a permanent location in a double-shotgun in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood. It's yellow with colorful trim and flamboyant foliage out front; inside there are soaring ceilings, spare furnishings, and her brother's art. \nBut that is Melissa's place of work; her real home, which she shares with her son, is in the Lower Ninth Ward, four blocks from the Mississippi River. A Visit with Melissa Martin & Her Kitchen Tell us about your home and your kitchen. \nI bought our home 3 1/2 years ago. We got it under contract and then spearheaded a renovation with the Preservation Resource Center and moved in at the end of 2013. (Image credit: Jacqueline Marque ) \nMy kitchen has no built-ins. It is a 12x12 room with a 1980s Wolf Range, a custom-built sink that we rehabbed from the Green Project and had retrofitted by a local carpenter, shelves from a local furniture maker from recycled lumber, a cypress table, and my dad's old work bench as an island. How would you describe your style? \nMy philosophy is \"only have what you need.\" I don't have china or silverware stowed away. I'm a minimalist and I only keep what I need to create and share meals. I do maybe have a couple too many jars. (Image credit: Jacqueline Marque ) Do you have a favorite thing in your kitchen? \nMy favorite thing in my kitchen is the old island that was in my mom's home growing up. I love having it in my kitchen. \nAlso, my grandmother's Magnalite pot. My mom recently let me take it home and it's my favorite thing in my kitchen right now. I leave it on top of my range so I can be reminded of her strength and grace and the curiosity and security I found in her kitchen. What's the last great thing you cooked? \nHomemade pasta with Kale from my garden, fresh tomatoes, anchovies, cracked red pepper, and Parmesan cheese. \nI also have a way with leftovers: I always keep most of my pho broth and repurpose it with garden greens, rice, and whatever protein I have in my refrigerator.
