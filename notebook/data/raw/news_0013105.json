But David’s incident involved an earlier S6 model.\nHe told the Daily Record : “Samantha and I were asleep when I was woken up by what I can only describe as an explosion.\n“There was a flashing light and smell of burning. The flames burned into a book the phone was sitting on.”\nDavid Millar and his partner Samantha were asleep when the handset blew up The Samsung Galaxy S6 exploded while charging... bursting into flames (Photo: Sunday Mail) Samantha’s S6 phone had been charging on the bedside table when it caught fire at 6.45am last Saturday.\nDavid, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, said: “I grabbed the phone, took it into the bathroom, threw it into the sink and turned the water on.\n“I’d managed to lift it by the side and received superficial burns to my fingers. The phone had been on charge.”\nThe fire woke the ex-copper who grabbed the device and threw it in his bathroom sink (Photo: Sunday Mail) David, 46, who served with the military police in the 90s before joining Strathclyde Police, said: “The flames shot out in various directions. The fire burned a hole through three chapters of my book.\n“The bedside table and the side of the bed, which are both oak, were also burned. It also damaged the bedsheets.\n“The bedding had to be thrown out as it was speckled with particles of molten plastic. The fire caused about £1500 worth of damage.\nDavid suffered a lot of damage to his possessions after the phone overheated (Photo: Sunday Mail) “If overnight charging is an issue, people should be made aware of this.”\nThe couple returned the device to an O2 store in Glasgow’s Buchanan Street and were offered a replacement.\nBut Samantha, 25, a civil servant, added: “They refused to give us a different type of phone but I don’t want to have another S6.\nThe fire burned a hole through three chapters of David's book (Photo: Sunday Mail) “It was a frightening experience.”\nSamsung said: “There are no known issues with the Galaxy S6.\n“Customer safety remains our highest priority and we’ll work with any customer who has experienced an issue with a Samsung product in order to investigate the matter.”\nO2 said: “We offered to have the phone sent back to us so we can assess the damage and replace it with the same model if necessary but this was refused.\n“We’ll be happy to arrange this again.”\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Samsung Inc.
