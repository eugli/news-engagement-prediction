But there is one leaked detail about her show that should set it apart, even in the pantheon of Super Bowl halftimes. \nAccording to a report from CNN Money, Gaga‚Äôs show will be aided by the use of ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of aerial drones, lit up for all to see. While the precise function of the drones isn‚Äôt yet clear, it‚Äôs a safe bet that you‚Äôll see them overhead of the performance, perhaps flashing an image or message against the black night sky. Outside of that, not many details about the performance have made it out, although Gaga herself has shot down rumors that Beyonce, a superstar Houston native, might pay a surprise visit. \nThe NFL has also denied a report that Gaga was instructed not to mention President Trump in the performance. #SuperBowlSunday @ladygaga motorcade looks like she's the US President on a casual stroll. #PepsiHalfTime pic.twitter.com/2ccLEXJhv4 ‚Äî Spartan Drones üì° (@SpartanDrones) February 5, 2017 In years past, there have been unbelievable spectacles on display during the halftime show, perhaps one of the most memorable coming during Katy Perry‚Äôs 2015 show. Specifically, it included both Perry riding into the stadium on the back of an enormous gold lion, and the first-ballot Hall of Fame meme that was Left Shark . \nThe game is scheduled to start at 6:30 pm ET. It‚Äôll be airing on your local Fox station, and although it‚Äôs impossible to say with precise certainty when the halftime show will roll around, the whole game typically takes close to four hours to play out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:58:09.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
