The story seems to change every day with Trump. There's something new bubbling under. It's hard to get your head around such a big subject. The challenge with Trump would be... something so abhorrent that walks on two legs and is a human being, you have to explore where his foibles come from.\" The star also revealed he had an upcoming three-part series which was due to air on BBC2, saying: \"Hopefully people will like it. It's good.\" \nVIEW GALLERY Louis spoke about making a documentary about the president Fans were quick to discuss his exciting plans, with one writing: \"So David Attenborough is making a Blue Planet 2 and Louis Theroux's next documentary will be him taking on Donald Trump.
