She was 'always the spotty one' amongst her friends growing up and struggled with severe acne throughout her school years Pictures of Hanna's tummy, taken before and after overhauling her diet, show the incredible difference in both her skin and her body shape as it also helped her slim down Hanna went to extreme lengths to get rid of her psoriasis and even tried coal tar shampoo which her boyfriend joked made her smell of 'tarmac', but to no avail - it got so bad she began dreading holidays and summer weddings where her skin would be on show. 'I used foundation and concealer on my arms, I wore long sleeves and trousers in summer, I did everything I could to cover up and hide,' Hanna said. 'I absolutely hated my skin.' On one occasion, she was waiting to board a flight to Egypt when the girl behind the check-in desk started pointing and called for her colleague. Covering up: While suffering from psoriasis, Hanna would wear gloves to cover her hands. She believes her first flare-up was caused by her poor diet, the stress of GCSE exams and her parents splitting up Hanna covers up during a sunny day on the beach. 'My skin was at its worst here,' says Hanna. 'I was wearing gloves to stop people commenting on my hands and I could barely open my eyes because the eczema on my eyelids was so bad' 'In front of a long queue of people they began a huge discussion over whether my skin was contagious,' Hanna recalled. 'I was absolutely distraught.' During her worst flares, the pain and itching was 'unbearable' and Hanna would wake up to 10 times in the night to slather on moisturiser to try and soothe it.

'I was shocked,' said Hanna. 'This was chemotherapy medication and I didn't have cancer, just a skin problem. 'I went home to read and research a little more. The list of side effects - which include organ failure - made the decision an easy one. I was petrified, there was absolutely no way I was going down that route.' Hanna began trawling the internet for alternative solutions and read about men who had healed their autoimmune skin conditions by juicing - extracting the juice from fresh fruit and vegetables to give their bodies a 'break from digestion'. 'From that day onwards my skin got better and better': Hanna says she saw a little change 'each day' after embarking on her new lifestyle three years ago Hanna recently launched a blog, MyGoodnessRecipes.com, with her favourite new recipes which led to a free guide and eventually a book of all her favourite dishes called Radiant 'I absolutely love food and knew I couldn't live on juice for the rest of my life,' said Hanna, who began developing her own anti-inflammatory recipes despite having 'n catering experience whatsoever.
