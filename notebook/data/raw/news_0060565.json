Doesn't Amazon just sell books? \nNo longer. Amazon in the US now sells everything from fresh food to electronics. \nAs well as its own products, it has Amazon Marketplace, which enables third-party retailers to sell their wares. \nIn the US, there's little you can't get from there. What is Amazon Prime? \nA subscription service which costs $US99 a year in the US. It's a club-like concept where once you join, you get free streaming, free deliveries, and fast deliveries: in some cities in the US, that's within the hour. \nAmazon Prime is where the company makes a lot of its money, because having paid the annual fee, people feel compelled to make use of it — and spend. And what about Amazon Prime Video? \nPrime Video competes with Netflix and includes some of Amazon's own produced television series. \nIn December it was launched in multiple new countries, including Australia. \nThat gives Amazon a direct-billing relationship with a whole new batch of consumers, says the Australian Financial Review's John McDuling. \nThey will then be \"primed\" to become e-commerce consumers when that service arrives here. How are Amazon products so cheap? \nThey don't try to maximise their profits or their bottom line. \nUsing built-in price comparison software, they reinvest all their cash flow into keeping prices low, and extending their distribution networks. \nThe aim is to lock you in as long-term consumers. How do they target their consumer base? \nLike Google, Facebook and Apple, Amazon is a big collector of customer data. \nThey know a lot about you: what you might be looking to buy, what's going on in your life. \nUnlike those other companies, Amazon can offer you want you want to buy, and then deliver it to you. \nBrad Stone, Bloomberg correspondent and author of The Everything Store, says Amazon has a \"maniacal customer focus\" that comes before being a good corporate citizen or a good employer. Which sectors might they threaten? Photo: Amazon could disrupt local companies, but also become a new sales outlet for some retailers. (Getty Images: Peter Macdiarmid) \nJB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman could be in for a fight over cheap electronics. \nThe fashion sector, already challenged by \"fast fashion\" such as the Zara chain, could be greatly disrupted by this new player. \nMany are waiting to see if Amazon in Australia will get into groceries, affecting the existing supermarket dominance. \nAny big operator who uses their scale to increase their margin, rather than innovate for customers, should be worried. Might Australian retailers benefit? \nYes. Amazon would be a new sales outlet for them. This could help niche products especially — such as health foods, for example. \nAustralian manufacturers will have a new platform to get their products out — both to Australians, and to global markets. How should consumers respond to Amazon? \nAssociate Professor Elizabeth Maitland, from UNSW School of Management, says consumers could wield their data power. \n\"I think what will be interesting is [whether] Australian customers get smart and not hand over their information for free,\" says Professor Maitland. \n\"We're very good at giving these retailers our information, which they then data mine for us. \n\"Maybe we'll get smarter at saying: 'If you want my data, if you want my purchasing habits, I want you to offer me more value in what you do.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:42:58.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
