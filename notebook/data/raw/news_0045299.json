Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nNo incident occurred in Sweden and the country's baffled government asked the US State Department to explain. \nOf course, jokes and memes sprung up on social media and people sprang up to share their views about what on Earth happened in Sweden.
