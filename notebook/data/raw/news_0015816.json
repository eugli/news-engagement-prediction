We were both under the same agency once too.” Jo In Sung mentioned previously that Jung Woo Sung has always been his role model . \nJung Woo Sung continued, “When I was directing the music video for g.o.d’s fourth album that tied together three songs, [Jo In Sung and I] met for the first time as director and actor.” \n“I lived while thinking that camaraderie between colleagues is important, but if I look back at how much concern I showed him, it’s little to the point that I feel sorry,” he continued. \n“There should be sharing between seniors and juniors of the same industry. I’m embarrassed and sorry that I didn’t take care of him. I hope that he can gain something from me through “The King.” On the filming set, as I looked at Jo In Sung’s mature image, I thought that I have to become a cooler actor.” \n“Rather than looking out for the juniors, I worry more about how I should share my experiences with them as a senior. Instead of unilaterally recounting my experiences, [both of us] share our experiences with each other. When Jo In Sung was first casted for ‘The King,’ I wanted to share with him the words I couldn’t say before previously,” he said. \nJung Woo Sung also explained why he visited the set even on days when he had no filming. \n“I often visit the set even if I have no filming parts, but I visited more for ‘The King.’ It’s because I can build up teamwork and trust with the other actors, not just Jo In Sung. Because of that significance, I kept going [to the set.] I think I’ll keep going to the set in future.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:02:16.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
