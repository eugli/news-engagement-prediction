Mike Feuer. Branden Camp / Associated Press Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer. Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer. (Branden Camp / Associated Press) Daniel Miller filed a criminal complaint against a Beverly Hills talent agency and its principals for allegedly violating the state law.\n“I hope the filing of these charges against five so-called casting workshops and a number of individuals ... sends a strong message that any talent scam is going to be strongly pursued by this office,” Feuer said at a news conference Thursday. \nThe cases center on companies Actors Alley, the Actors Link, the Actor’s Key, Your Studio Productions and the Casting Network. The 25 individuals facing criminal charges include business owners and operators, and casting directors, associates and assistants involved with the workshops. \nAmong those people are several well-known casting professionals, including Peter Pappas, whose credits include the CBS sitcoms “Two and a Half Men” and “Mom”; Ty Harman, whose credits include ABC’s “The Real O'Neals” and Netflix’s “Santa Clarita Diet”; and Ricki Maslar, whose credits include the films “Twister” and “Dahmer.” \nHarman and Maslar did not respond to requests for comment. A woman who answered the telephone at a business number listed for Pappas said “not interested” and hung up. \nThe five workshop companies either did not respond to requests for interviews or could not be reached for comment. (The Actors Link closed within the last year, according to the city attorney’s office.) \nVeteran casting director Billy DaMota, who for several years has spoken out about alleged abuses at casting workshops, said the city attorney’s action would have a significant chilling effect on the workshop business. \n“You are going to see the workshop business shrivel up and blow away,” said DaMota, who estimates there are about 30 casting workshops on offer in the L.A. area. “You can’t have this kind of scrutiny and not have an effect on the workshop industry.” \nThe city attorney’s office began investigating the matter last year with the help of an undercover informant — an unnamed professional actor — who from February 2016 to April 2016 attended 13 workshops offered by the five companies named in the cases this week. \nEach of the lawsuits includes as a defendant at least one owner or operating member of a workshop business and at least one casting professional. In addition to allegations that they charged for auditions, some defendants face allegations that they failed to use required contracts. \nIf convicted, each individual could face up to a year in jail and/or $10,000 in fines plus penalty assessments. Arraignments in the cases are scheduled for mid- to late-March; they are being prosecuted by Deputy City Atty. Mark Lambert. \nOn Thursday, Feuer’s office distributed a set of guidelines that workshop operations should follow in order to comply with the Krekorian Act, including a requirement that they make clear that participation is not a guarantee of employment. \nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, general counsel for SAG-AFTRA, said at the news conference that the union receives complaints about casting workshops “on a daily basis.” \n“In terms of these pay-to-play … situations, we hear about it all the time,” he said. \nSeveral of the individuals named in the lawsuits are members of the Casting Society of America, a trade organization with more than 750 members. CSA President Richard Hicks said in a statement that his organization supports the work of the city attorney’s office. \n“Along with SAG-AFTRA, CSA stands in support of treating actors with dignity and respect, and those CSA members who teach should do so only with workshop companies which are fully compliant with both the workshop guidelines and the Krekorian Act,” Hicks said. \nCasting professionals typically appear at workshops as guest instructors. But DaMota said that actors who pay to participate in these workshops have for years been exploited by some operators and casting directors who “know they are not delivering education.” \n“The actors … are people with dreams who want to find success in this town and will do anything to get it,” DaMota said. \nThe Krekorian Act is named for Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Krekorian, who spearheaded the legislation when he served in the state Assembly. In years past, the law has mostly been used to target talent agents and managers who’ve been accused of charging their clients illegal upfront fees in exchange for representation. \nIn January, Feuer filed a seven-count criminal complaint against Patrick Arnold Simpson, Paul Atteukenian and their Beverly Hills talent agency, Network International Models & Talent, alleging that they violated the Krekorian Act by charging a client illegal fees.
