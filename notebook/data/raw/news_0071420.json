(The answer, of course, is nothing at all. Overnight stays are by invitation only.) If you've got your sights set on waking up in the middle of the Magic Kingdom, in royal fashion, your best bet is to enter one of the sweepstakes from Disney . \nDisney Family Movies is running one, the Cinderella Fantasy Sweepstakes , right now. The grand prize is a vacation for four at Walt Disney World , including a stay one night in the fabulously exclusive suite. They'll throw in a few extras, too, like a $1,000 gift card. \nA free vacation. Wouldn't that be magical? \nHere are a few other places at Disney World where you can rest your royal head: The Royal Rooms at Disney's Port Orleans Riverside Resort feature articles borrowed from Princess Tiana and her Prince and Princess buddies, including Aladdin's magic carpet , the Little Mermaid's fork, and in-room fireworks courtesy of, well, Tinkerbell? You'll feel like a VIP staying at Disney's Contemporary Resort or Bay Lake Tower , when you can bypass the crowds and walk to and from your resort from the Magic Kingdom . Another Disney princess, the Little Mermaid , has her own themed section of Disney's Art of Animation Resort . \nImage of the Cinderella Bathtub in the Castle Suite courtesy Walt Disney World", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:15:29.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
