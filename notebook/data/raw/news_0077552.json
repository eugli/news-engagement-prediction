He has added 19 goals and 15 assists in 70 playoff games. You slayed the dragon, shot arrows to the heavens and never backed down.

His best offensive days are behind him — he has nine goals in 55 games this season — but he will still bring sandpaper to a Senators team that is pressuring Montreal for top spot in the Atlantic Division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:18.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
