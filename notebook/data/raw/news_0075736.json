It was a sign of how hard-working they were. More regulations with higher costs gave a bureaucrat high status.\nNow someone in the shop will be pushing back, with the White House executive orders urging them on.\nIn the 1940s, Congress created the Byrd Committee (named after the conservative senator from Virginia, Harry Byrd) whose job was to write and submit legislation that reduced spending. It was an anti-appropriations committee. Some $40 billion in today's dollars was eliminated.\nNow there will be at least one full-time staffer pushing back on over-regulation.\nThis is a big deal. A game-changer.\nPresident Ronald Reagan would have loved it.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump makes unannounced trip to Trump hotel for dinner Trump's public schedule had no events planned for the day.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/25/17 8:53 PM Grover Norquist ( @GroverNorquist ) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.
