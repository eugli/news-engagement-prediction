I'm about to get on the car. Through practice I'll be live on Instagram from the cockpit to give you something new, so tune in,\" he said on Twitter. \nThe coverage consisted of footage shot in the pit lane and garage, but not on the track, and lasting no more than 10 seconds.

Watchthe #RB13 take its first laps of the year at #F1testing in Barcelona. \nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said fans would now have more behind-the-scenes access to drivers. \n\"You've probably noticed the teams are putting out a bit more content of what their drivers are up to in the paddock, not what's happening trackside because that belongs to the broadcasters,\" he told reporters. \n\"You could have had breakfast with (Australian) Daniel Ricciardo this morning, seen what he does prior to getting in the car and to the point where he's got in the car to drive out and do his first lap. \n\"Which is something that obviously hasn't been possible in previous years.\" \nHorner said Ecclestone's departure from a hands-on role, with the Briton now handed the title of \"Chairman Emeritus\", would take some getting used to. \nThe new owners had a clear vision of what they wanted, however. \n\"They seem very keen to embrace ideas to make the sport more accessible and entertaining,\" said Horner. \"In the immediacy, what we can see is that Formula One will perhaps be made slightly more accessible.\" \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:02:24.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
