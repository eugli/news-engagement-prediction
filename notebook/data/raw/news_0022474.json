Having put Iran “on notice”, the administration is risking the ire of erstwhile supporters, amid questions about how the US has conducted recent wars under less chaotic regimes. And we’re getting more opportunities to consider the batshit curriculum that people such as Steve Bannon have imbibed on their way to the administration of a superpower. \nHow I stopped Believing in Democracy Publication : Curits Yarvin, AKA Mencius Moldbug\nAuthor : Yarvin is a key thinker in the so-called “ neoreactionary ” movement. From around 2007, Yarvin, a computer scientist, started producing a body of work which rejected liberal precepts of equality, progress and democratic government. His elitist prescriptions found favor with other Silicon Valley weirdos, notably sea-steading blood enthusiast Peter Thiel, who has financially backed Yarvin’s start-up. \nWhy you should read it : Last week, Politico published a list of thinkers who have allegedly influenced Steve Bannon, and Yarvin’s work was described as “laying the theoretical groundwork for Trumpism”. In this (admittedly long and dense) blogpost, Yarvin/Moldbug dismisses a belief in democratic suffrage as a quaint superstition, and implicitly promotes the idea of oligarchy in the name of efficiency. If, as Politico suggests, he really does have an indirect line to the White House chief strategist, we should know that it’s likely that Bannon sees democracy primarily as an obstacle. \nExtract: “And, if our goal is really just the faithful execution of a trust, why assume that electoral suffrage of any sort is the most effective way to constitute it? Surely the shareholders of Google have entrusted its management with a tremendous trust – $170 billion worth, last time I checked. Surely this is worth as much as Georgia, or at least Georgia in the 1870s. How does Google just skate along without any suffrage at all, whereas Georgia needs elections? And which trust would you guess is more effectively exercised?”\nJoe Rogan Experience #911 – Alex Jones & Eddie Bravo Publication : Joe Rogan Experience (podcast)\nHost: Joe Rogan has one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world. He began it in 2009 after stints in stand-up and TV comedy and, later, as a UFC announcer. Last week he brought in Austin’s own doyen of multimedia conspiracy culture and, latterly, Trumpism, for episode #911 of his show. He and Alex Jones are longtime friends, so you could say it was an inside job. \nWhy you should listen : “Answer not a fool according to his folly,” it says in Proverbs, “lest thou also be like unto him.” Jones’s appearance on Rogan’s show is a cautionary tale. Rogan tries to push back on Jones’s talk of “psychic vampires” and “globalist combines” for a while, but the idea that everything is connected turns out to be virulently contagious. \nExtract : Go to 6:35 in the YouTube snippet of the podcast, and listen to Rogan’s initial scepticism about elite paedophile rings collapse under Jones’s of torrent of half-truths and arrant nonsense. \nWhat Effective Protest Could Look Like Publication : The Atlantic\nAuthor : As I explained last week, David Frum coined “Axis of Evil” as a George W Bush speechwriter, supported the invasion of Iraq, recanted ( sort of ) but later seemed to suggest that he was right all along. Nevertheless, he has for some time occupied a perch as a moderate conservative at the Atlantic. \nWhy you should read it : There is a lot of debate on the left at the moment about what the appropriate tactics and targets are for protesting the Trump administration. Frum offers some advice: make over protests with patriotic iconography, limit demands and don’t neglect what Weber called the “strong and slow boring of hard boards” outside protests. “The more conservative protests are, the more radical they are,” he argues. \nThe idea is that to build a mass movement in America, you mustn’t alienate what Frum sees as core American values. For better or worse, few on the left will be persuaded by these recommendations, from this source. But as a spectacle, this column is instructive. Perhaps the most striking thing about Trumpism is that it has so thoroughly rehabilitated some of the people whose adventurism started us down the road to this mess. Strange days. \nExtract: “Midlife brings strange changes to us all. After a lifetime of viewing demonstrations from the other side of the barricades, I was one of the many who admired the orderly commitment and resolution of the women’s march on Washington the day after President Trump’s inauguration. Yet my admiration is mixed with worry. As I step through the police lines, I bring a message with me: Your demonstrations are engineered to fail. They didn’t stop the Iraq war. They won’t stop Donald Trump.”\nThe Coming Clash With Iran Publication : The American Conservative\nAuthor : Pat Buchanan started in politics as a Nixon opposition researcher and then as Reagan’s director of communications. Later, he ran as a proto-Trump “paleoconservative” Republican in 1992 (when he made a few early inroads in primaries) and 1996. In 2000, he headed the Reform party ticket. He never got on with movement conservatives – they charged him with antisemitism, he charged them of betraying “America first” conservatism. He later started the American Conservative, and there (and in his role as a media commentator) he has been a reliable Trump booster. Until now. \nWhy you should read it: Eventually, Trump plays everyone. Buchanan’s support was premised on the idea that Trump, like him, was some kind of isolationist. There’s a hint of panic in this piece that tries to make sense of Michael Flynn’s saber-rattling at the Islamic republic. Trump’s nihilistic slipperiness on every matter of principle may have gained him supporters during the campaign. But in office it seems to be exacting a cost. The question is whether this comeuppance is happening too late to avert disaster. \nExtract : “Is the United States making new demands on Iran not written into the nuclear treaty or international law – to provoke a confrontation? Did Flynn coordinate with our allies about this warning of possible military action against Iran? Is NATO obligated to join any action we might take? Or are we going to carry out any retaliation alone, as our NATO allies observe, while the Israelis, Gulf Arabs, Saudis and the Beltway War Party, which wishes to be rid of Trump, cheer him on?”\nThe US military’s stats on deadly airstrikes are wrong. Thousands have gone unreported Publication : Military Times\nAuthor : Shawn Snow and Andrew DeGrandpre are reporters and editors at the military “trade” outlet Military Times. Snow is a Marine Corps veteran. \nWhy you should read/listen: Trump is having his laugh-a-minute press sec, Sean Spicer, oscillate between lying to the press corps and berating them. Washington stories may become wholly dependent on leaks. The big scoops of Trump’s years in power may emerge in unusual venues that progressives aren’t used to reading, and from reporters whose skills are geared to a specialist audience. The Military Times’s primary audience are those currently serving in the US military or veterans – people with a reputation for conservative politics. But this remarkable story suggests that the US military has been undercounting the amount of airstrikes on foreign nations, perhaps as far back as 2001. We have been fighting a hot war in the Middle East for a generation. If the story is true, then put simply, we have no real idea what has been done in our name. \nExtract: “Most alarming is the prospect this data has been incomplete since the war on terrorism began in October 2001. If that is the case, it would fundamentally undermine confidence in much of what the Pentagon has disclosed about its prosecution of these wars, prompt critics to call into question whether the military sought to mislead the American public, and cast doubt on the competency with which other vital data collection is being performed and publicized. Those other key metrics include American combat casualties, taxpayer expense and the military’s overall progress in degrading enemy capabilities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:48:17.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
