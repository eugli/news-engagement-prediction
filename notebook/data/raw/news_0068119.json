Article continues below \nAccording to Autosport , he reiterated this stance yesterday at the launch of Mercedes’ car for the 2017 season, claiming it would make for a better spectacle if the driver's didn't share their data. \nHowever, his team mate from McLaren’s 2007 team Fernando Alonso found his stance “strange”, especially as the Mercedes team already shares data extensively between engineers to help both the drivers. Article continues below \nSpeaking at the launch of McLaren’s new MCL32, Alonso also joked that if Hamilton was following the driving data from teammate Nico Rosberg last season, then he would not have finished the season in the second place. \nHe joked : \"He said many times that he was learning from the data. \n\"Mercedes are one of those teams that are using more of the data between the engineers to help the drivers, so he said something that was a little bit strange. \n\"If he was watching more data from Rosberg last year, maybe he would have won the championship!\" \nRosberg retired after topping the standings last season, and the 35-year-old Spaniard had a few comments about him as well. \nHe said: \"I respect his decision, but if you are winning, you have that adrenaline, that final result you work for the year for in Formula 1... in my case I cannot stop. it's like a drug.\" \nWith Hamilton’s view point about data sharing with teammates, along with his new teammate's confidence that he can beat the Brit, this season promises to be an interesting and eventful one for the Mercedes AMG Petronas team, who are chasing their fourth consecutive constructors’ title this season. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
