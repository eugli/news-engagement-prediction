Dipika was a part of the show for six years. tv Updated: Feb 23, 2017 18:41 IST Hindustan Times Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar is going to be the new Simar on Sasural Simar Ka. \nActor Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar is returning to television after a gap of six years. She will replace Dipika Kakar on COLORS’s popular show Sasural Simar Ka. \nDipika, who played the lead character Simar on the show for six years, has decided to move on to give more time to her personal life. “Yes, it’s true. I’m leaving the show because I need some time off for my personal life. But I am refraining from talking about in at length because I don’t want anyone to feel and say that it’s some sort of a stunt to get a pay hike,” Dipika had told HT in an interview in January. Deepika Samson played the protagonist on the show for six years. \nKeerti played the antagonist on Zee TV’s Choti Bahu. She was also a part of the second season of Nach Baliye in 2006, in which she participated with her actor husband Sharad Kelkar.

The show will bring its focus back on the mother-daughter relationship; I believe that I suit the role perfectly since I am also a mother.” That being said, Keerti says that the role is challenging in its own way. She explained, “ Though the character of Simar is already established, the challenge lies in adding some freshness to it. I wouldn’t have taken it up if it wasn’t so challenging. I am nervous and excited at the same time to face the camera after so long.” \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:12.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
