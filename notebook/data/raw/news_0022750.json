Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA 10-year-old boy who walked into a shop with a gun is set to become among the youngest to ever appear in court in Stockport - once the council find him. \nThe youngster, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was listed to appear before magistrates for an interim ASBO hearing on Wednesday. \nBut speaking on behalf of the council at the hearing, Alex Bongatel said authorities had been unable to find him or his family to serve the necessary documents to bring him to court. \nThe boy is to appear in relation to long-running problems caused around the Lancashire Hill and Heaton Norris area.

Hopefully when we find where they are we can serve.” \nThe case was adjourned until March 1. \nThe council - along with police , Stagecoach Manchester and the Unite Union - is currently tackling an increase in anti-social behaviour across Stockport. \nMany instances have involved buses, with a driver attacked, windows smashed and threats issued , as well as taxis. \nIn response police have been patrolling on buses, two teenagers have been arrested and civil enforcement options such as barring individuals from bus travel are being explored. \nBut a legal expert has questioned the wisdom of using civil means such as ASBOs and youth injunctions as a means to tackle such problems.

But when a youngster gets things such as an ASBO unless they breach the terms there is no sanction or punishment it is just restrictions, so if they have done anything they get away with it. \n“I am not a fan of how they are used as a way to label someone. If youngsters are accused of something get them through the criminal justice system so they can be either convicted or acquitted.” \nReport anti-social behaviour by calling police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
