It will feature old and new material, hundreds of chemsex-related puns and thousands of rhinestones.That sounds exciting,if a little confusing, so Ispoke to Dom Top and Le Strange one half of the Sex Shells to find out more.\nVICE: How did XL come about? \nLe Strange: We've been strutting our stuff on various stages around east Londonand the provinces for a while now, and XL islike a greatest hits show. alongwith somepunchy new material. The whole thing iscouched within a massiveneo-classical golden-age-of-Hollywood set and we're wearingcrystal-encrusted costumes. It has a muchhigher production value than our older shows had.\nDom Top: The musical stuff is a mix of West End show tunes, Broadway show tunes, pop musicand Disney songs, of course. We've all reworked and rewritten themso all of the lyrics relate to anything to do with thethe queereast London experience.\nHas the tone of your shows changed over time? \nLe Strange: Our earlier showsall dealt with the chemsex phenomenon, afterparties, getting off our tits on mephedrone that kind of stuff.We've slowly grown our wholesome wings,so we now also deal withthings like love stories at the self service checkout machine.And our hearts have grown big enough that we've been thinking about the drug journeys of others, so I'm going to be playing Nigella Lawson at the peak of the cocaine scandal.\nDom Top: We tend to do stuff that's about gay hookup apps as well we have Grindr love storiesand songs about finding love in Londonbut having to cross the river for it,and how difficult itis to go from east to south because gays are lazy andjust want something within 300 metres of them. \nLe Strange: We're just taking it a lot further.Wehavethe complete lifecycle of the gay from leaving a provincialtown to finally being ensconced in a wealthy pink pounded mnage-a-trois, to the tune of 15 different ABBA songs, I believe.\nThat is a lot of ABBA songs. \nDom Top: The majority of the ABBAsongs are truncated versions in the medley, so you won't be hearing all 15. Some of the sketches we'll be doing are slightly condensed versions of ones that have been longer in other shows, mainly because we just want to get the joke across and then move on quickly. Keep hitting people between the eyes. \nLe Strange: It's going to be flash, flash, pow, flash, flash, flash.\nDo you perform outside of east London? \nDom Top: Weperformed at Latitude over the summeras part of The Glory's lineup, which was our first real big tour kind of experience. And we also opened the first ever Channel Islands Pride in September of 2015. \nLe Strange: That was extremely special. We left the parade on a bus with various island dignitaries, including a Shirley Bassey impersonator. I'm from Jersey, and having grown up flouncing past Waterstone's wearing a rhinestone top and foundation and being snarled at throughout my teenage years, it meant a lot thatsuddenly there were 3,000 people filling the streets because of us.It was perfect.\nDom Top I missed the bus because I went home with a couple and wrecked their marriage.\nLe Strange: It was a very meaningful weekend.\nSounds like it. \nDom Top: And we did the Brighton Fringe last year, which was a fun experience even though we did treat it more like a giant piss-up.We had a show every night for four nights, andwe would just go get drunk during the day.\nLe Strange: We became regular features at one of the rollercoasters on the pier. We would queue up outside it, squealing like banshees at holidaymakers to get in the queue too,until there were enough of us to fill it. So we're happy tobe taking ourshow around to festivals this year again.\nSo what's the new show going to look like? \nDom Top : For one, we're going to have actual production value for the first time ever. So we've got sets, some partsof which have been stolen from Shoreditch High Street. Usually the setup for our shows is built with dental floss and Blu-Tack. \nLe Strange: We're going to be slick, choreographed, there will be a lot ofcrystals. I've got an Elizabethan ruff in black lace and pink satin.\nDom Top : I have a jewel-encrusted leather harness.\nLe Strange: We also feature a jewel-encrusted codpiece,and Rose our fantastic pianist will be sporting a look that'slike Queen Amidala goes to Spain.\nDom Top: Generally, a lot of jewels.Don't shine anything too bright on us oryou'll go blind.\nSo is everything ready? Do you have anythingleft to prepare before the premiere?\nLe Strange: Well, I've got 744 pale rose crystals to glue to our costumes this afternoon.\nXL runsfrom the 23rd of February until the 4th of March at The Glory, and you can get tickets here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:03:09.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
