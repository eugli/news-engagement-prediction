Against this backdrop, Abdullah Al-Sadoun, chairman of the security committee of the Shoura Council, called for \"thoroughly scrutinizing\" the Pakistanis before they are recruited for work in the Kingdom. \n\nHe asked for more closer coordination with the concerned authorities in Pakistan to thoroughly check those coming to work in the Kingdom due to the involvement of a number of Pakistanis in security issues, the report said. \n\nSadoun said the political and religious inclinations of the Pakistanis coming to work in the Kingdom should be known to both sides before they are recruited for work. \n\n\"Pakistan itself is plagued with terrorism due to its close proximity with Afghanistan. The Taliban extremist movement was itself born in Pakistan,\" he said. \n\nMeanwhile, according to Nafithat Tawasul (communications window) of the Interior Ministry, they are 82 Pakistani suspects of terror and security issues who are currently held in intelligence prisons. \n\nAccording to the report, as many as 15 Pakistanis, including a woman, were nabbed following the recent terrorist operations in Al-Harazat and Al-Naseem districts in Jeddah. \n\nThe ministry recalled that last Ramadan, Abdullah Ghulzar Khan, a Pakistani, exploded himself at the car park of Dr. Soliman Fakheeh Hospital near the US consulate in Jeddah. \n\nHe lived in the Kingdom for 12 years with his wife and her parents. He had arrived in Saudi Arabia on a private driver's visa. \n\nLast year, the security forces had foiled a terrorist operation in which two Pakistanis, a Syrian and a Sudanese were held for plotting to explode Al-Jawhara Stadium in Jeddah where more than 60,000 spectators were gathered to watch a soccer match between the national teams of the Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. \n\nThey were planning to use a booby trapped truck loaded with 400 kg of explosives to undertake the terror attack, the report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:05:04.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
