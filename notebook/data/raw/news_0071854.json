Stabbing victim: Omer Raza, who was stabbed to death near Turnpike Lane station \nHis brother Ali Raza, a supermarket worker, told today of his disbelief that anyone would want to kill his younger sibling. \nMr Raza, 27, said: “They took his phone and watch, nothing else. Nobody can believe that for this small reason somebody would do this. \n“Everyone in Walthamstow knew him – old men and young kids. This is what I don’t understand. I think somebody planned to get rid of him, but we don’t know why.” \nMr Raza said his friend Raja Rashid Ali was stabbed to death by a gang wielding knives, chains and baseball bats who dragged him from his car in Dagenham last year. \nHe said his brother had not been working but would help their elderly mother around the house. \nHe added: “Mum collapsed when she saw the body. Dad says he’s lost his right hand. Pictured: BMW driver chased and stabbed to death in north London \n“I know Omar’s in a good place, I know he’s in peace rather than this hectic life - but of course I want justice. \n“He had a good heart, he was clean. He would joke with everyone. That’s why I was shocked when they called me – why has he been murdered?” \nMr Raza, who works at the Tesco superstore in Leyton, said: “I’m smiling now thinking about him, but maybe in two hours I’ll be crying again. But he doesn’t want me to cry.” \nA friend of the brothers said: “Omar was full of life, he was always smiling. Even though we never had any money in our pockets, we would always do something. He was a caring guy.” \nDetective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner from the Homicide and Major Crime Command today appealed for witnesses of the attack to come forward. \nHe said: “Omar had travelled to Ivatt Way in a silver convertible BMW, which is where we believe he was first attacked. \n“I am keen to establish exactly what time he arrived there and why. \n“We then believe the victim ran from the car and into Downhills Park Road, possibly being chased by the suspect. If you were in the area and saw anything please get in contact with us.” \nThree teenagers aged 17,18 and 19 have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
