Dame Helen Mirren at the Prince’s Trust centre Credit: L'Oreal \nB ut as Dame Helen Mirren took to a small stage at the Prince’s Trust centre in London this morning, she admitted even she gets struck with insecurity sometimes. “I had a moment of incredible self doubt before coming up here and thought, ‘Oh my god I can’t go up there, I’m not good enough, and I don’t know what to say, and I can’t do it’. But you have to hold your chin up and get up there and do it. That’s something I’ve learnt as an actor. ” The Prince’s Trust and L’Oreal Paris’ All Worth It campaign with 14 inspirational influencers, including Helen Mirren and Cheryl Coles Credit: L'Oreal Paris \nI t’s also something that she’s hoping young people will learn with the help of the Prince’s Trust and L’Oreal Paris’s new All Worth It campaign. Mirren is joined by Cheryl Cole, who unveiled her baby bump in the campaign , and 12 other inspirational ambassadors who share their stories of overcoming their self-esteem issues in the video below. \nT he programme aims to help over 10,000 young people across the UK turn their self-doubt into self-worth with confidence-boosting courses. However, Mirren hopes that the campaign will help those of all ages. “It’s not an age thing. I know it’s the hardest when you’re young, but it’s not something that you miraculously grow out of,” said Mirren. “It’s an ongoing battle that one has with oneself and the world about you.” Helen Mirren’s confidence-boosting tips \nEnjoy the moment: “I know people say ‘just enjoy it’ and when you’re really nervous and your hearts pounding and almost out of your body, it’s very hard to relax and enjoy the moment. But, if it’s possible then do try to.” \nHave sense of humour: “Of course, you have to take yourself seriously because if you don’t you can’t travel on through life and you have to believe in yourself. But, similarly you have to have a sense of humour about yourself and the people you’re interacting with.” \nYou’re not alone: “Understand that it’s not you against them and we’re all in the same boat here is important. Everyone has moments of self-doubt, self-criticism and insecurity. It’s not about not having it, it’s how to deal with it when you do have those moment.” \nMates are great: “I’m incredibly private in my moment of self-doubt, I tend not to share them with anyone because I don’t know, I’m frightened of the weakness that it shows. Of course, it’s great to have a loved one and I do share to a certain extent with my husband. But, even with him I tend to keep those feelings to myself and bottled up. Mates in a funny way are better than husbands because you can be completely honest with them, especially with the ones you’ve known for your whole life and they’ve seen you through everything.” \nBiggest life lesson: “Be on time and don’t be an arsehole.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:36:43.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
