The new commission will oversee the 11th parliamentary elections scheduled to be held by January 2019. \nThe Kazi Rakibuddin commission supervised the 10th parliamentary elections in 2014. The BNP, which boycotted the polls, has termed the current EC as 'subservient to the government'. \nThe outgoing CEC told Hasina that his commission completed the 10th parliamentary election 'strongly' amidst violent opposition by the boycotting parties. He also said the BNP took part in local government elections held under the current EC and thanked the commission after victories.\nThe BNP's view on the EC, however, did not change. Many political analysts also saw a lack of strength in the EC's activities, sometimes terming it ‘toothless tiger’. \nKarim said Rakibuddin thanked Hasina for following rules and never influencing their activities. \nAfter the 45-minute meeting, Karim said the prime minister thanked them for working with courage. \nElection Commissioner Hafiz told bdnews24.com: \"We also thanked her for helping us hold the elections.\" \nThe outgoing election commissioners will pay respect to the Liberation War martyrs at the National Memorial in Savar and meet President Md Abdul Hamid on Feb 7. The CEC and three other commissioners' tenure is ending on Feb 8 while the other end office on Feb 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:16:51.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
