Maness is recovering from elbow surgery that ended his season last year.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com \nWith an audience and a chance to show baseball what he and his doctor have believed would be possible, Seth Maness had a few flutters of nerves as he readied to throw for scouts Monday. \n“It was different for sure. I didn’t really know what to expect,” Maness said. “I had some butterflies when I woke up this morning. Then I get on the mound, and it’s like, ‘You’ve done this your whole life.’ And that takes over.” \nWith one significant difference. \nNo pro has yet done what he’s attempting. \nAt least 18 scouts representing 16 major-league teams arrived at John Burroughs School in Ladue to see Maness throw a swift, 30-pitch bullpen session. The former Cardinals righthander is auditioning for an offer — and proving that he’ll be ready for spring training despite having elbow surgery last August. Maness had an alternative to Tommy John surgery, one with a shorter rehab time and little history with professional pitchers. \nHe is the first established major-leaguer to have “primary repair” and make his return. \n“People have been thinking I was going to be missing this whole year,” Maness said after his workout. “That makes you kind of mad. That makes you motivated. I’m going to be ready. I’m out there and it’s just stay within in yourself and trust what Dr. (George) Paletta did.” \nManess’ fastball worked between 81 mph and 84 mph, and he touched 85 mph. His velocity should hasten with arm strength. He flashed a curveball that he abandoned as a groundball-greedy reliever for the Cardinals. Some radar guns remained stashed, because the focus was his health — how free and easy he threw, how comfortable he looked with his elbow, how confident they could be in the elbow. \nThe Cardinals apparently did not have a scout at the showcase, but several of their rivals did: the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee and Cincinnati. Washington, Kansas City, Cleveland, Baltimore, Houston and Minnesota also had at least one scout present. A few had two. \nFormer Cardinals pitcher Cal Eldred, who got to know Maness while working for the team during spring training, attended Maness’ session. Eldred now is with the Royals as a special assistant to the general manager. \nMore than the scouts present Monday are watching Maness. \nOne of the most unrelenting strike-throwers in the game, Maness, 28, lost most of last season to a torn ligament in his right elbow. Reconstructive surgery, or “Tommy John” surgery, usually is needed to repair the damage. Paletta saw in Maness’ scans that he could be eligible for a relatively new technique, “primary repair.” \nOn Aug. 18, the surgeon repaired the ligament at the bone and used tape to create a scaffolding for the ligament to aid and support it during healing. \nManess and Mitch Harris, who remains with the Cardinals, are two of the three pro pitchers who have had “primary repair.” \nA benefit of the surgery Maness had was trimming his recovery time , allowing him to not miss 2017. His throwing program started a month earlier than on the Tommy John schedule and it was at least a month shorter. \nHe’s been throwing off the mound for more than two weeks. \nMonday was his first session outdoors. \nIt brought a crowd. It probably will yield an offer. \nFrom there, he’ll get a chance to show if his return could mean a change for other pitchers who previously have needed Tommy John surgery to do what Maness did Monday. \n“I’m healthy,” Maness said, “and I feel like I can get outs again.” Cardinals Update e-newsletter Cardinals Update from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nGet breaking news, features and the latest talk about the St. Louis Cardinals.
