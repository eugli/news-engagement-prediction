Find me on Twitter @gen_vanvee \nIt's hard not to love #LinManuelMiranda . The musical theater genius behind #Broadway 's breakout hit #Hamilton has accomplished more in his 37 years of life than most people do in a lifetime. He's got an Emmy, a Grammy, a handful of Tonys, and now he's nominated for the Oscar for Best Song, thanks to his breathtaking new addition to the Disney playlist, \"How Far I'll Go\" ( #Moana ). If he wins, Miranda will be the youngest person ever to have an E.G.O.T. (Emmy+Grammy+Oscar+Tony), which means he'll basically have won at life. \nIf you haven't heard \"How Far I'll Go,\" listen now! \nIf all those accolades weren't enough reason to love him, Miranda also happens to be a Twitter junkie, who never hesitates to share a gif or 140 eloquent characters with his dedicated following. \nCurrently, Miranda is living in England while he's shooting the #MaryPoppinsReboot , in which he plays a new character, Jack the Lamplighter. On the day of the #Oscars Luncheon, he flew to LA in order to celebrate with all the other honorees. The adventure started off with this promising tweet: I am HAVING A BIT OF A DAY. Stories soon. https://t.co/XxacL3mpEz — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 6, 2017 \nWhile he hasn't yet confirmed the exact details behind those caps, he DID manage to give us a little inside look at just what goes down at the Oscars Luncheon. \nThere's a pool. With the word \"Oscars\" floating in the middle of it. There were Oscars pool floaties at the thing. pic.twitter.com/GhttmNZwSw — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 6, 2017 \nMiranda's mother is from Puerto Rico, and this adorable interaction between her and Viggo Mortensen, who's nominated for Best Actor for Captain Fantastic , is enough to melt your corazón. Not to mention, how cute is it that Miranda brought his mom?! We met Viggo Mortensen. He speaks gorgeous fluent Spanish. My mom almost floated away. — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 6, 2017 \nNext up, Miranda live-tweeted the moment where they took the giant group pic of all the honorees. You eat lunch and they put you on a giant dais to take a prom pic with all the nominees. Here is Oscar's butt and Pharrell. pic.twitter.com/ai1ANvWgzW — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 7, 2017 \nHere he is geeking out over meeting Matt Damon and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman looks equally stoked. That is a Matt Damon and a Natalie Portman. pic.twitter.com/VDxZQrn9DB — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 7, 2017 \nMrs. Miranda got a precious photo-op with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg & my mom. I mean what even. pic.twitter.com/PUZwtfGMvn — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 7, 2017 \nAn hour later, Miranda was back on a plane to the UK. And now I'm getting on a plane back to . Did you like the mix? — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 7, 2017 Poll Did you like Lin-Manuel Miranda's collection of tweets from the Oscars Luncheon? Sure, it was cute. Yes! Everything he does is gold. IDGAF about lunches, just tell me who wins already! Who the hell is Oscar?
