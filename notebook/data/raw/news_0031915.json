At Kwik Fit, checks are offered free with a full service, with customers charged £49.95 if they need a standard realignment. The Mail on Sunday sent a reporter's Citroen C2 into a city-centre Kwik Fit in Nottingham for a full service costing £139.96. The vehicle's wheels had already been aligned at an independent garage, but the reporter was told by the garage that his alignment had been tested and was out. The Kwik Fit staff member later showed the reporter a diagram of the supposed alignment issues, telling him: 'We have adjusted it for you. Now we've set it back dead straight. It has gone from being over to smack down the middle.' Kwik Fit also quoted the reporter for £650 worth of other urgent repairs, which our expert found was reasonable. Warning: A Kwik Fit worker in Birmingham talking to our reporter A Kwik Fit spokesman said: 'We are confident that our staff followed the correct procedure for wheel alignment. After The Mail on Sunday advised us of discrepancies with their measurements, we found that the publicly available MOT record of the car shows that it may have damage to a front strut. This damage would explain the variance in alignment readings. We encourage the car owner to have the strut repaired.' Our expert said: 'Not even slight movement was found in the strut by me or the MOT test I oversaw before the car went to Kwik Fit. Either it was so slight it was not worthy of mention, or it no longer existed.' In Birmingham, our reporter was told her car needed a replacement hub bearing in the nearside rear wheel at a cost of £151.60. A staff member told her: 'Like I says madam, I don't want to scare you because we're not in the game to scare you but in the worst case scenario they can actually dry up and they get hot, basically, and then dry up and it could actually collapse.' Asked whether the wheel could come off, he replied: 'The worst case scenario, yes.' A colleague also said that this would only occur in a worst case scenario. We were also charged for changing four spark plugs – which ignite fuel and create combustion in the engine – even though the mechanic simply left the old ones in. Staff also quoted for a further £548 work of work, which our expert said was necessary. Our expert used ultraviolet (UV) ink, which the naked eye can't see, to mark the bolts fastening the coil packs, which on this car must be removed to take out the plugs. They remained in exactly the same position when inspected afterwards. A Kwik Fit spokesman said: 'We cannot accept that the centre's diagnosis of a faulty wheel bearing is incorrect without re-examining the car. However, our own investigation confirmed that the spark plugs were not changed in this case and we fully apologise for that.' Our expert said: 'The wheel bearing showed no signs of wear or impending failure. The bearing was certainly not noisy in operation and there was no adverse effect on either our wheel-alignment results or those reported by Kwik Fit.' He added: 'Detachment of a wheel due to a wheel bearing fault is extremely rare.' The Kwik Fit in Mansfield left a leaking oil filter on a reporter's Mini, which our expert said could have caused the engine to seize up. The reporter was told her car was finished and 'everything is fine'. But when she went to collect it, an employee said they could not replace her oil filter – something they are meant to do as part of their standard full service – because they did not have the correct part in stock. Asked what would happen if she did not get the oil filter changed, the Kwik Fit employee said: 'Nothing. You can leave it until your next service, but you've paid for it so if you nip into town or anything at the weekend you can drop it in and we'll put a new one in.' Our expert said: 'Had the leak not been detected and all the oil lost, the engine could potentially seize up and stop working. This would be potentially very dangerous if this occurred, say, on the outside lane of the motorway.' A Kwik Fit spokesman said: 'We were very clear to the customer that we had not been able to change the filter on the day as it did not arrive from our supplier in time. We have had the correct oil filter ready and waiting for the customer since that afternoon and do not believe that if there was any oil leaking it would have been serious enough to cause damage without advance warning.' In Derby, our expert found evidence to suggest Kwik Fit had not added sufficient anti-freeze when topping up a screen-wash tank. The reporter was also quoted £189 for other work, which the expert said was necessary. Our expert said: 'In the winter months additive is essential to increase the strength of screen wash solution so that the screen washers can still be used even in freezing conditions.' Staff at another Nottingham Kwik Fit told a reporter they had changed his Ford KA's spark plugs when evidence discovered by the expert suggested they had not. Prior to the car being sent in, the expert made invisible UV marks on the terminals of three of the four spark plugs. All the marks remained when inspected afterwards. Two of the plugs were inspected afterwards and were found to have combustion stains that were not consistent with brand new plugs, according to the expert. The Kwik Fit spokesman said: 'We are confident the spark plugs were changed. Our investigation found the original Ford plugs from the car in question, along with an order for, and packing from, the new plugs. 'Unless The Mail on Sunday can show that the original plugs are still in the car, there is no reason to state that they were not changed.'
