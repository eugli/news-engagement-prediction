Some even showed up before registration was set up. \n\"I was surprised, in a good way. It definitely made all the hard work pay off,\" she said. \nSurrey high school student Gian Soquana was one of those keen to attend. High school student Gian Soquana said his admiration for his father is what has spurred him on to pursue medicine as a career. (CBC) \n\"My dad was a doctor, and he's a very knowledgeable person and I admire him, and I admire how much he knows about medicine,\" he said of his interest in becoming a doctor. \nSoquana is originally from the Philippines, where he said the environment is \"pretty bad\" and many people are too poor to buy medicine. \n\"I want to make a change and help out,\" he said. \nThe event was first held in 2013 and also takes place in Toronto.
