(Jeffrey F. Bill/Maryland Zoo) It’s a girl! And she’s rather tall.\nThe Maryland Zoo in Baltimore said Thursday that a female giraffe calf, standing six feet tall and weighing about 125 pounds, was born at the facility last week. Born Feb. 6 to Juma and Caesar, the calf is the first giraffe to be born at the facility in over 20 years, officials said.\nZookeepers described the calf as doing well. Samantha Sander, an associate veterinarian at the zoo, said the baby giraffe “looks pretty perfect so far.”\n“We couldn’t be happier to welcome this beautiful calf to the zoo family,” Don Hutchinson, president and chief executive of the zoo, said in a statement. He said she brings “a lot of excitement” to the giraffe exhibit and makes a “wonderful addition to the herd.”\nThe mother giraffe, Juma, went into labor around 3 p.m. on Feb. 6, and her calf was born at 4:35 p.m. The gestation period for a giraffe is 14 to 15 months.\nThe baby giraffe has not yet been named. Zoo officials said keepers will offer up four names and then ask the public to vote on them. The most popular one will be picked.\nHUGE BABY NEWS: A giraffe calf was born at the Zoo for the 1st time in 20+ years. It's a healthy 6ft 1in baby girl! https://t.co/dO9Fe0AxWL pic.twitter.com/jyK0g10f6s\n— Maryland Zoo (@marylandzoo) February 16, 2017\nFor a baby giraffe, the first major milestone comes shorty after birth: the ability to stand. “She was able to stand on her own in just 50 minutes,” said Erin Cantwell, a mammal collection and conservation manager at the zoo.\nAnd mama giraffe’s instincts, zookeepers said, are “on target.” She is a first-time mom. “She is very attentive and has been very patient with the calf as she learns to nurse,” Cantwell said of the mother. The two are bonding and settling into a routine, keepers said.\nThe baby giraffe and her mom won’t be seen by the public right away. Zookeepers want to keep them in a quiet setting for a bit longer and allow them to interact with each other and the rest of the herd.\nA baby giraffe was born at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. It is the first time in 20 years the facility has had a newborn giraffe. (Jeffrey F. Bill/Maryland Zoo) No specific time frame was given for the baby giraffe’s debut, but officials said it is likely to be in the next few weeks.\nGiraffes can be found in eastern, central and southern Africa. Their population has dropped about 40 percent over the last three decades, experts said. They are considered to be “vulnerable” under a list put out by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/marylandzoo/status/832234686105657344"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:57:37.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
