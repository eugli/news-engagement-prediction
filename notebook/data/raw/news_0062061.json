They should also reap whatever economic benefits are generated.\nEach area could have different rules, depending on local priorities.\n\"We want it to be driven from the bottom up,\" Simon said. \"It's really managing your own lands.\"\nSpeed up Parks Canada action Putting Inuit in charge could also speed up Parks Canada action on Arctic protection, she said. For example, Lancaster Sound on the eastern gate of the Northwest Passage was first proposed for protection by the Inuit in 1987 and still hasn't achieved marine protected area status.\nIt would also ensure that land would be managed by those with local commitments and ties instead of by southerners who move on after a few years. More responsibility for the land would also reinforce cultural bonds, Simon said.\n\"It's bringing back this connection that people have to their homeland and allowing people to create much healthier communities.\"\nIn fact, Simon believes the Inuit should have a greater role in managing the Arctic overall, including responsibility for environmental monitoring.\nCanadian Rangers could play a role The Canadian Rangers — a largely Aboriginal army reserve unit that acts as the military's northern eyes and ears — could be made responsible for keeping track of things such as shipping.\n\"We'd like to see the northern Rangers have more capacity to monitor the region.\"\nShipping corridors could be defined in accordance with local concerns about impacts on wildlife and hunting.\n\"It's also a contribution to the country,\" Simon said. \"We can address sovereignty concerns.\"\nShe said the idea of an Indigenous protected area already exists in places such as Haida Gwaii, a Haida-controlled group of islands north of Vancouver Island. Other examples exist in Australia and New Zealand.\nSuch status doesn't exist yet in law.\nSimon said Bennett's office and other federal ministers have been receptive to the idea.\n\"The government is really working to make it work,\" she said. \"I think it's going to happen.\"\nOfficials from Bennett's office were not available for comment.\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-25T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:49:40.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
