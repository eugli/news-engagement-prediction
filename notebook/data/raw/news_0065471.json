News can reveal a few more familiar faces taking the stage inside the Dolby Theatre and serving as presenters Sunday night. \nJason Bateman , Warren Beatty , Sofia Boutella , Faye Dunaway , Michael J. Fox and Dev Patel round out the A-list names. Photos \n2017 Oscars: Meet the Presenters Getty Images \nAs you likely could have guessed, the biggest award show of the year is turning out to be more than just a little star-studded. \nWhile the stars are more than enough to get viewers tuned in, many are pumped to see Jimmy Kimmel host the event for the very first time. \nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live star has his whole writing staff preparing clever and unique jokes for Sunday's audience. That team also includes his wife Molly McNearney . \n\"We talk about it at the house a lot. Sometimes I wake up in the night and I look over at her to see if she's up because I think of something and then if she's not up, I try to make sure she gets up so I can run some stupid idea—they're never good—by her,\" Jimmy shared with E! News' Jason Kennedy . \nPerhaps the late-night host's kids have a different outlook on dad's humor? \n\"My kids, they don't give me any advice. In fact, my kids will be completely in the dark,\" he shared. \"They know I'm hosting. They are aware of it. I made sure they had appropriate clothing to wear and they will be picked up at a certain time, but other than that, they're not involved.\" Watch E!'s live 2017 Oscars red carpet coverage on Sunday, Feb. 26 starting at 1:30 p.m. ET/10:30 a.m. PT, and join the conversation on Oscar.com and across social with #oscars and #eredcarpet.
