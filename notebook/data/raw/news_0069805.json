It had been on the market for a little more than 24 hours as of Wednesday afternoon. Related Stories Trump Island in San Juans listed for $8.7M \nThe property offers a 4,700-square-foot main home, plus a 744-square-foot guest cottage and an 894-square-foot garage. The primary home was built in 2003 and features pristine white walls, dark hardwood floors and a large outdoor living space with a wood-burning fireplace. \nThe home has a delightful nautical-feeling interior, and takes full advantage of its 225 feet of sandy, no-bank waterfront. The master suite opens up to a beach-side veranda and a spa. \nThe home looks out toward Useless Bay, which isn't as grim as it sounds. KUOW notes the bay got its name because it's so shallow that it's nearly dry at low tide. For those interested in the views and the beachcombing opportunities though, that shouldn't be a problem. \nThe home has four bedrooms and 3Â¾ bathrooms. You can see the full listing here.
