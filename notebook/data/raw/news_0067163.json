Lizzie Porter 22 February 2017 • 2:29pm \nA n expert guide to the best hotels near Regent's Park, including the best for quiet, green locations, swimming pools, spas, swanky bars, fine dining and luxurious rooms, near Marylebone Station, Madame Tussauds and London Zoo. Marylebone, London, England 8 Telegraph expert rating A boldly designed boutique hotel by Kit Kemp, five minutes from Regent’s Park. Ms Kemp's approach is so self-assured that she can handle vibrant colour and contrasting, unusual fabrics, and the place exudes energy and a sense of well-being. Rooms combine scintillating design with uncomplicated, gadget-light comfort. In the Potting Shed restaurant, an erudite lighting installation by Martha Freud delights diners with its constantly changing, luminous words of wisdom, and the modern British menu (liver, bacon, mash, caper sauce; beer battered pollock) is well executed. The hotel stands within sight of Marylebone Station.
