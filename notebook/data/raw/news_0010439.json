This man has caused so much damage, so much hurt and it’s all been dishonest.” \nHe said Mr Shiner’s claims had damaged the Army’s reputation.\nHe added: “You get this drip, drip, drip on the stone from someone like Shiner and some people start to believe it. None of this is to condone any unlawful behaviour by soldiers, but why did it take so long to bring this man to book?” \nThe findings against Mr Shiner throw into doubt the future of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) inquiry. Mr Shiner has put forward more than 2,000 allegations of the total 3,400 but has yet to see a single soldier convicted of abuse.\nPhil Shiner the lawyer who acted for Iraqi families passed anti war demonstrators as he arrived at the High Court Credit: Stephen Lock L ast night an Ihat spokesman said it was looking at dismissing a raft of cases, amid concerns they are tainted by evidence Mr Shiner gathered.\nThe Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found Mr Shiner guilty of 22 misconduct charges, including five counts of dishonesty after a two-day hearing which he had refused to attend.\nWatch | Lawyer: It's incomprehensible Phil Shiner wasn't struck off before 01:50 T he tribunal heard he had paid a local agent £500 for each Iraqi he could find with allegations against troops, and then made £1.6 million in an improper deal to carve up the profits made suing the Ministry of Defence.\nAllegations that British troops had murdered and tortured after the 2004 Battle of Danny Boy led to the five-year-long, £25 million Al-Sweady inquiry, which later found Mr Shiner’s claims were based on calculated lies by Iraqis.\nJohnny Mercer MP, a former Army officer leading a parliamentary inquiry into the welfare of troops under investigation, called Mr Shiner a “modern-day traitor”.\nHe said: “He should face police investigation. We now need to work out how we seek some sort of reparation for the individuals whose lives have been ruined in this process.” \nThe tribunal ordered Mr Shiner to pay £250,000 in an interim costs order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:12:20.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
