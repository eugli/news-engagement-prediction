(Photo courtesy of daters)\nInterviews by Amanda McGrath\nPolicy analyst Adam Staveski, 22, and financial analyst Maddie Csere, also 22, are fresh-faced and fresh out of local colleges, enjoying their first year as D.C. young professionals. We sent them to Maple in Columbia Heights to see if a shared love of running, economics and a laid-back attitude was enough to spark a fresh romance.\nMaddie: I was freaking out all week — this is a little out of my comfort zone. I almost didn’t come. But within 30 seconds, I was like, This is going to be absolutely fine .\nAdam: She was exactly my type. She’s very pretty, she’s friendly and gregarious — our personalities seemed to click right off the bat.\nMaddie: I know exactly why they paired me with him: He’s tall, athletic, has a slimmer build, which is what I said my type was.\nAdam: We could pick up the conversation like we were old friends.\nMaddie: He was very kind and definitely excited to be there, which made me excited to be there.\nAdam: We both grew up in small-town environments [and] came to D.C. for college.\nMaddie: We both studied economics. He told me about his job, and it was really cool and interesting. I don’t get to talk to other econ people that often.\nAdam: My job is very niche — most people think it’s the most boring thing of all time. I was glad she didn’t think it was super lame.\nMaddie: I went to [George Washington University] and he went to American University; we talked about D.C. school rivalries.\nAdam: It seems like everyone hates Georgetown, but it’s like [American] is rivals with [GWU], jockeying for position as the “second-best school” in D.C.\nMaddie: I don’t know. I don’t really believe in the school rivalries.\nAdam: She said, “No, people at GW don’t care.” I was like, shoot, maybe American kids are way more petty. [Laughs.]\nMaddie: He’s a really good runner. I recently ran a marathon for the first time; he ran the Marine Corps in an insane time and is running [in] Boston next year.\nAdam: She asked for my time and I said I ran 2:43. She was astounded. I was like, Nice, she’s impressed!\nMaddie: We talked about meeting famous people. I was obsessed with One Direction at one point in my life and met Harry Styles after waiting outside the British Fashion Awards for four hours. It was ridiculous. [Adam] was on “The Daily Show” once; they came up to him on the street and interviewed him for a segment.\nAdam: We both found out — weird fact — we’re both missing our front teeth.\nMaddie: We both have fake teeth — I’m pretty sure that’s not something I put in my application.\nAdam: She’s very genuine. I’m like, Wow, you are a cool, amazing, interesting person that I’m excited to talk to.\nMaddie: He’s one of the most genuinely nice people I’ve ever met in my whole life. If you meet him, you immediately know he’s not a very judgmental person.\nAdam: There seemed to be depth to her. She’s not predictable. We delved briefly into politics, and rather than being a staunch partisan, she’s able to look at situations with a lot of nuance, more so than a lot of people in the D.C. area.\nMaddie: We align a bit [politically], but my family is a little divided, so I was talking about how growing up in rural Michigan gives me a different perspective.\nAdam: I would say the overall vibe was more friendly than flirtatious. It’s hard on a first date to really give out too strong of a signal without it being weird.\nMaddie: I got more of a friend vibe from our conversation. There wasn’t totally a spark there, [but also] I’m not quick to fall for people. I’m still processing things.\nAdam: Both of us were surprised by the time we left that we’d been there so long.\nMaddie: We sat for three hours, and I really didn’t think it had been that long. It was 10:30 at that point; I’m normally home by 8 on weeknights. We left and he walked me to the Metro, even though it was out of his way.\nAdam: I walked her back to the Metro and asked for her phone number.\nMaddie: I hugged him and then we left. He texted me that night to make sure I got home okay.\nAdam: I’d personally be interested in a second date. I’m on a quest to go to every Metro station on the map; she seemed interested in that, so maybe it could be an informal, casual way to see if there’s something there.\nMaddie: I could see us being pretty good friends in the future; he’s such a nice human, which is kind of rare to find at our age. I don’t think we clicked romantically, but I’m not sure — my thoughts aren’t very clear on this yet.\nRate the date Adam : A 4.5 [out of 5]. It was an extremely pleasant evening. I left feeling very happy.\nMaddie: A solid 3.5. I really, really liked talking to him. It didn’t feel like a date totally for me, but it was a great night.\nUpdate They’ve stayed in touch via text; a second date is possible, they say, but so far they haven’t set any plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:50:40.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
