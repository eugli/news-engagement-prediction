Greece is making progress toward reducing its massive budget problems and restoring economic growth, the IMF said Monday. It predicts Greece's economy will reach long-run growth of just under 1 percent a year, unimpressive but an improvement on years when the economy was shrinking. And Greece will meet the IMF's target by reporting primary annual budget surpluses — which do not include interest payments — equal to 1.5 percent of economic output. Since the financial crisis left it buried in debt and unable to issue bonds in financial markets, Greece has relied on international bailouts. Its Eurozone creditors have forced it to make painful budget cuts that caused a deep recession. Unemployment is 23 percent and the reforms have sparked protests in the street. But using taxpayers' money to Greece yet more debt relief will be an unpopular policy for many European countries. Greek pensioners march in the center of Athens on May 4, 2010 to protest against austerity measures the government was forced to implement after its financial bailout Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, is in the midst of a difficult election year and many of her people would see the move as giving money paid by hardworking Germans to undeserving Greeks. Most IMF directors said Greece doesn't need any more austerity. But they said the country should reduce pension payments and make more people pay taxes to raise money to help the poor and cut overall tax rates. Most IMF directors say the country will probably need debt relief to pay its bills over the long term. Greece is under pressure to conclude its latest bailout negotiations in time for a scheduled February 20 meeting of eurozone finance ministers. That would allow the country to join the European Central Bank's bond-buying program, which would boost market confidence and make it easier for Greece to return to the bond market later this year.
