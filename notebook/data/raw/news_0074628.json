As you can see in the clip above, when the camera panned over to their table at the moment their win was announced, the focus was understandably on the very excited members of the group.

We did that, we came here, we had a job to do and we did the job. We’re into the next round of the cup, that’s all that matters. (Photo: PA) (Photo: REUTERS) \n“It’s good to get back to winning ways against any team, even if they are a good few leagues below you and I’m glad we did that. We’ve got a little break now before our next game, we needed that win and we can focus again on the league.” \nOxlade-Chamberlain also revealed the Sutton tie was the most fun he has had all season and claimed players like Alexis Sanchez will never have experienced that sort of night before. \nThey now face another non-league opponent in the next round and Oxlade-Chamberlain insists they will not be pushovers after their win at Burnley. \nOxlade-Chamberlain added: “It wasn’t the normal experience but I grew up in League One, I’m used to these places and having that experience that was one of the most exciting times I’ve had this season. \n“Coming off the bus, both sets of supporters in close proximity and it was a really good experience, I really enjoyed it.
