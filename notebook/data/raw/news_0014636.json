Messi scores free kick, Fernando Torres winds back the clock, Bayern drop points February 5, 2017 1:55pm by AAP, AFP and AP Source: FOX SPORTS LIONEL Messi produced some more record-breaking magic to move within touching distance of Real Madrid, whose game was cancelled due to stadium damage. \nPlus some vintage Fernando Torres and Bayern Munich slip up. \nIt’s Euro Beat \nBARCA SINK BILBAO WITH RECORD MESSI GOAL \nLA Liga champions Barcelona stayed hot on the heels of leaders Real Madrid by coasting to a 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao as Lionel Messi became the club’s top scorer from free-kicks. \nPaco Alcacer scored his first league goal since joining from Valencia last year by turning in a pass from Neymar in the 18th minute while Messi whipped in an angled strike in the 40th, his 27th goal from a free-kick for Barca. Barca dominate Bilbao 1:29 \nAleix Vidal scored the most impressive goal of the game by finishing off an audacious solo run in the 67th minute. \nBarca stayed second in the standings, moving one point behind Real Madrid but have played two games fewer than the leaders. \n“We are happy with the result, and for seeing that our entire squad is competitive,” Enrique said. \nVINTAGE TORRES HELPS ATLETICO TO CRUCIAL WIN \nFernando Torres ended a wait of more than four months for a goal in the competition, scoring twice to ease Atletico to a 2-0 win over Leganes. \nTorres earned a penalty and then finished off Antoine Griezmann’s missed spot kick for this first goal. He later chipped in a second goal shortly after halftime. \n“It was important to win again,” Torres said. \n“Now we have to treat Tuesday’s match (against Barcelona in the cup) like a final.” \nIn other matches, Espanyol defeated Malaga 1-0 and Eibar beat Valencia 4-0. While heavy winds in northwestern Spain damaged Celta Vigo’s stadium and, due to safety concerns over potential falling debris, the league said Sunday’s match between Celta and Real Madrid couldn’t go ahead. \nBAYERN DROP POINTS, STILL INCREASE LEAD \nBayern Munich were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Schalke as the Bundesliga leader put up another unconvincing display while Leipzig lost ground in the title race. \nRobert Lewandowski fired Bayern into an early lead with his 15th goal of the season but Naldo equalized from a free kick minutes later and the home side missed a number of chances to claim the winner late on. \nDespite the draw, Bayern stretched its lead to four points after Leipzig lost 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund in the late game. Bayern dropped two points but it didn’t prove costly. Source: AP \nPhilipp Lahm came on for the final 15 minutes to make his 500th Bayern appearance. \nIn the other big game of the round, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s first-half header was enough for wasteful Dortmund to avenge its 1-0 defeat at Leipzig in the second round and go third. \nThe first half was a scrappy affair with frequent stoppages until Aubameyang’s header opened up the game in the 35th. Ousmane Dembele skipped past Marvin Compper and then Willi Orban before crossing for the Gabon striker’s league- leading 17th goal of the season. \nHertha moved up to fifth with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Ingolstadt as Japan midfielder Genki Haraguchi scored the winner after just a minute at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. \nCologne are sixth following their 1-0 win at Wolfsburg thanks to Anthony Modeste’s second-half penalty, having been fouled by Wolves goalkeeper Diego Benaglio in the area. \nBorussia Moenchengladbach picked up their second straight win with a 3-0 victory at home to Freiburg courtesy of goals from captain Lars Stindl, striker Raffael and winger Patrick Herrmann to go tenth. Napoli ran out 7-1 winners in Serie A. Source: AFP \nNAPOLI THRASH BOLOGNA IN SERIE A \nMarek Hamsik and Dries Mertens both scored hat-tricks as Napoli demolished Bologna 7-1 away after a wild first half which featured five goals, two send offs and a missed penalty. \nBologna’s Mattia Destro saw his spot kick saved by Pepe Reina when Napoli were only two goals ahead while Napoli’s Jose Callejon and Bologna’s Adam Masina were sent off within minutes of each other. \nThe win lifted Napoli, Serie A’s highest-scoring team with 55 goals, into second place with 48 points, one ahead of AS Roma who host Fiorentina on Tuesday. Leaders Juventus have 51 points and host Inter Milan on Sunday. Monaco's Colombian forward Radamel Falcao celebrates. Source: AFP \nMONACO REACH MILESTONE WITH NICE WIN \nMonaco have moved three points clear at the top of Ligue 1, reaching a milestone thanks to Radamel Falcao’s double in a 3-0 drubbing of Nice. \nThe principality side have netted 100 goals in all competitions this season, a good omen looking ahead to their Champions League last-16 first leg at Manchester City this month. \nLeonardo Jardim’s side, who have scored 68 league goals in 23 matches, have 52 points. \nValere Germain opened the scoring from Benjamin Mendy’s cross two minutes into the second half. \nNice’s hopes of an equaliser were thwarted six minutes later when Mario Balotelli, who had a below-par game, was ruled offside as they took a corner. Colombia international Falcao picked up a pass from Mendy to score his first goal in the 60th minute and took his league tally to 14 with nine minutes remaining when he beat Cardinale with a shot into the corner of the net. Nice’s Alassane Plea squandered a last-chance Dalbert Henrique cross in the game’s dying minutes. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
