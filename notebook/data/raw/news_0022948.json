The company’s follow-up, the as-yet-unannounced TabPro S2, looks like it’s sticking to the same formula while adding a bit of extra processing power, if filings from the FCC are to be believed. It appears some of the information on the device has been withheld from public filings, but here are the full specs, via TheLeaker.com : Operating system: Windows 10 Home or Pro Display: 12-inch Super AMOLED Quad HD, 2160 x 1440.resolution CPU: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 7th Gen, Kaby Lake GPU: Integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 4GB LPDDR3 Power: 5070 mAh battery with 25W Turbo Charger Camera: 13-megapixel rear camera with 4K video, full-HD 5-megapixel front camera Ports & Connectivity: SD card slot, two USB 3.0 Type-C ports, Bluetooth 4.1, 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n/AC Wi-Fi, optional LTE Extras: S-Pen and keyboard cover According to this leak, there will be four variants of the Tabpro S2 — depending on whether you want Windows 10 Home or Pro, and LTE connectivity or not. This schematic of the device also suggests it’ll be available on Verizon in the US: None of this is confirmed of course — not even the device’s actual existence . But the timing of this filing suggests we’ll be seeing more of the TabPro S 2 at MWC later this month. It should be some consolation for the absence of the Galaxy S8, which definitely won’t be appearing.
