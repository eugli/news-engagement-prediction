In this dialogue-free art preview, you get to see Luke Ross's art untouched - with plenty of action and storytelling. As Maul is a Sith of few words, it's easy to see how the visuals bear the brunt of the story anyway (not to discount writer Cullen Bunn). \nAs teased in the solicitations, we also get our first look at Cad Bane and Aurra Sing, two prequel-era bounty hunters who became fan favorites in their tenure on Star Wars: The Clone Wars . It's Cad Bane's first post- Clone Wars appearance, and the gunslinging blue-skinned cowboy is as deadly as ever. \nSeeing these strong personalities clash should be a very fun experience for readers. Sure, we know Cad Bane and Aurra Sing make it out alive since this takes place before even Star Wars: The Phantom Menace , but that doesn't mean the clash of prequel titans will be any less fun. \nStar Wars: Darth Maul #2 comes from writer Cullen Bunn, artist Luke Ross, and cover artists including Rafael Albuquerque and David Aja. The March 22, 2017 release's official solicitation text reads: \n\"A Jedi Padawan has been captured by sinister forcesâ€¦and Darth Maul is determined to find her?! This early tale of the galaxy's deadliest Zabrak continues!\" \nAs for Darth Maul in action, he'll return to Star Wars Rebels in the highly anticipated episode, \"Twin Suns,\" where he'll face off with the Jedi Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi for presumably the last time. Rebels is currently running about 2.5 years ahead of the events of Rogue One and A New Hope , so this fight certainly has a sense of finality to it. The well-chronicled grudge between the two, at that point, has been burning strong for nearly 30 in-universe years. \nCheck out the preview in the gallery below, pre-order the comic at your local comic shop or on Comixology.com , and tune in to Star Wars Rebels Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on Disney XD for more Maul. \nMore Darth Maul News: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:18:31.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
