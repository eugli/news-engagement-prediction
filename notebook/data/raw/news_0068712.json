But, Saurabh added 97 for the fifth wicket with Ferrario and then 74 runs for the sixth wicket with Akre to take the team within striking distance of the visitors’ first innings total of 375. \nHowever, India lost three quick wickets. First Saurabh Singh fell to Euan Woods and then Akre followed just after the hosts had crossed the 350-run mark. Suresh Lokeshwar was then dismissed to leave India at 363/8. \nWhile the first innings lead would only be of academic interest as there is only one day left, Anukul Roy and Rishab Bhagat ensured the hosts walked away with bragging rights, taking a 13-run lead before declaring. \nIn reply, England were 34/2 having lost both the openers to spinners Ferrario and Harsh Tyagi. \nUnless England fold badly and India get a chance to knock off quick runs, the match is meandering towards a draw. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:10.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
