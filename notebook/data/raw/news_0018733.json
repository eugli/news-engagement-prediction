It’s a political decision, and I look forward to doing it. We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake. And it’s a very, very serious situation. So, we look forward, as I just said, to seeing them in court.” He added that “we’re going to win the case.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n Breitbart TV , Immigration , 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , Donald Trump", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/IanHanchett", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Ftrump-9th-circuit-ruling-a-political-decision-were-going-to-win%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump%3A+9th+Circuit+Ruling+%E2%80%98A+Political+Decision%2C%E2%80%99+%E2%80%98We%E2%80%99re+Going+to+Win%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Ftrump-9th-circuit-ruling-a-political-decision-were-going-to-win%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump%3A+9th+Circuit+Ruling+%E2%80%98A+Political+Decision%2C%E2%80%99+%E2%80%98We%E2%80%99re+Going+to+Win%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Ftrump-9th-circuit-ruling-a-political-decision-were-going-to-win%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Trump%3A+9th+Circuit+Ruling+%E2%80%98A+Political+Decision%2C%E2%80%99+%E2%80%98We%E2%80%99re+Going+to+Win%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:37:06.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
