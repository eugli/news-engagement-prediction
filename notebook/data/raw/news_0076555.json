Some said it was because host Warren was given the wrong envelope by production team - naming Emma Stone as the best actress.

Either way, it is a huge embarrassment for all involved. \nOne viewer took to Twitter, asking: \"Damn I really really wish this happened election night. For real.\" \nPeople were so shocked - and were saddened Moonlight didn't get a full speech. \n\"That was horribly uncomfortable. Such a shame for La La Land. Such a shame for Moonlight . They deserved their big winning moment,\" one viewer wrote.
