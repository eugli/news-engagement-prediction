External Link: 360° video of Adelie penguin colony in Antarctica Mini solar-powered tracking technology \nThe latest technology from Poland weighs between five and seven grams and is so small it can be attached to the feathers or legs of petrels. \nOne of the trackers is powered by a tiny solar panel. \n\"The solar panel charges the battery of the tracker so it can hold the locational data it's collecting, then when it returns within range of the base station that data gets transferred to the base station,\" Dr Lashko said. \nThe other is a miniature new light sensor powered by a tiny battery. It stores information about the bird's movements right through winter. \n\"It's really amazing. It's enabling us to get information from the birds that we just couldn't get before,\" Dr Lashko said. \nTwo hundred and fifty breeding pairs of Cape petrels are nesting on Bluff Island, a rocky outcrop in Prydz Bay surrounded by icebergs in summer and locked in by sea ice in winter. \nIn summer Dr Lashko and Mr Lewis travel by boat to the island — earlier in the season it was still possible to walk or drive out across sea ice. \nThe scientists have set up a remote data retrieving station on its peak.

(ABC News: Fiona Breen) \nIt is a short climb up a rocky hill to the data point where Dr Lashko hooks up her laptop and uploads the information, collected from birds with trackers that are revisiting the island. \n\"When the birds with the trackers come back within about 500 metres of the base station, the data comes into the base station and that is what we are seeing,\" she said. \n\"For each individual bird that's returned we can see locational data and dive data, so the tracker knows when the bird gets wet and when it returns, it's really wonderful to see how many have returned.\" Photo: Dr Anna Lashko and Phoebe Lewis on Bluff Island downloading data about Cape petrels. (ABC News: Mark Horstman) \nThe smart technology is also able to switch the trackers off when the birds come into range of the island to save the battery. \nLead researcher Dr Louise Emmerson was in the Antarctic at Davis station in Spring last year. She is particularly excited about the developing technology of trackers. \n\"This new technology has really opened up our capacity to understand this, particularly for the flying seabirds which requires smaller and lighter devices, and we would prefer to minimise our handling of the birds,\" she said. \nResearchers have been tracking Adelie penguins for about 10 years — 26,000 breed on Gardner Island near Davis station. Females take long trip after laying eggs to restore energy \nThe penguin trackers the researchers use are matchbox size and weigh about 45 grams. \nThey are attached to the bird's back but scientists need to retrieve those trackers every few weeks and recharge the batteries. \n\"One of the things we've learnt from the trackers is that the female Adelie penguins, once they've laid the eggs, go off on quite a long trip,\" Dr Lashko said. \n\"They can travel up to 450 kilometres away from the colony while they're replenishing the energy they spent laying those eggs. \n\"Then two or three weeks later, they come back to the colony and swap over with their male partner.\" \nThe trackers with longer lasting batteries have given the team some great insights into the lives of Adelie penguins over winter — satellite trackers have clocked them travelling great distances for food. \n\"During winter, the Adelie penguins travel up to 3,500 kilometres away from their colonies, staying mainly at the ice edge and going no further than about 60 degrees south,\" Dr Emmerson said. \nRemote cameras developed by the Australian Antarctic Division are also giving scientists a unique insight into life. \nTime lapse footage shows the colony growing and contracting over 12 months. \n\"The network of cameras has provided windows to the world of breeding birds and the fate of their chicks in remote areas around Antarctica and at times of the year when accessing those sites is nearly impossible,\" Dr Emmerson said. Feeding game is a life and death battle \nOn our visit in February adult penguins were returning home to Gardner Island from much shorter trips, with food for their big fluffy brown chicks. \nThe chicks wait in so-called crèches with just a few adults looking after them. \nWhen the parents return to the island and walk the \"penguin highway\" from the water to the crèche, there is pressure to cough up, literally, a mass of regurgitated krill and other fish bits as soon as possible. \nWhat ensues is a hilarious game of chasings. \n\"You see the chicks chasing the parents looking for food, stumbling over the rocks and the parents running away,\" Ms Lewis said. \n\"I think it's a competition sometimes. They have siblings so whoever is fastest gets the most food, which is kind of hilarious to watch.\" \nMs Lewis, a biologist, loves to observe their feeding behaviours. \n\"It's also maybe a little bit of training over rough ground, just running and falling and finding their feet,\" she said. \nIt might be comical to watch, but this feeding game is a life and death battle. \n\"There can be very high mortality of the chicks between the time that they hatch until the time that they fledge from the breeding sites,\" Dr Emmerson said. \nTheir survival depends on how much food they get from the parents. \nEvery year as the latest technology gets smaller and smaller its place in the Antarctic grows and grows, and scientists in this harsh and difficult environment are thrilled with the results. \n\"The new technology has revolutionised our capacity to reach into the harsh and inhospitable Antarctic environment to understand how the birds navigate their landscape and identify their critical foraging areas,\" Dr Emmerson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:57:44.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
