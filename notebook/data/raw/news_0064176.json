Right here in the U.S.A. where, for the 63rd year in a row, more boys than girls were born. Exactly 94,232 more boys than girls were born in the U.S. during 2004, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that examines total sex ratios at birth for over six decades. CDC calculates the total sex ratio as the number of male births divided by female births times 1,000. \nOther findings of the report include: The more children a woman has the more likely she is going to give birth to an equal number of boys and girls. Since 1940, an average of 91,685 more male babies have been born each year than females, a total of 5,776,130 over that 63-year period. The highest sex birth ratio occurred in 1946 (1,059 male births per 1,000 females) while the lowest occurred in 1991 and again in 2001 (1,046 male births per 1,000 females). There were three major trends in sex birth ratios over this period: a significant decline between 1942 and 1959, a significant increase between 1959 and 1971 and another significant decline between 1971 and 2002.\nCombining all the years studied, older mothers (40 to 44 years of age and 45 years and up) have the lowest total sex birth ratios (1,038 and 1,039 respectively) and mothers 15 to 19 years of age had the highest sex birth ratio (1,054). For all available years combined, Chinese (1,074) and Filipino mothers (1,072) had the highest differences between the number of boys born versus girls, while non-Hispanic black (1,031) and American Indian mothers (1,031) had the lowest.\nThe report, \"Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States,\" was prepared by CDCÂ’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). \nEven with more boys than girls being born, women still outnumber men in the United States. In 2003, the Census Bureau estimated a total of 144,513,361 females of all ages, compared to 138,396,524 males.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:56.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
