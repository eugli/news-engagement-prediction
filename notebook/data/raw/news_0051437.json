During an interview with Tbo Touch on Touch Central , Nonhle reflected on retiring from the industry. Awks! Come Dine With Me SA pulled from SABC 3 \nThe former TV star said that when Bonang entered the industry, she actually felt \"relieved\". \n\"I was done with this 'it girl' thing when Bonang really stepped up, I was like WHOAH! She saved me, because honestly, I was at the pinnacle of the industry as a female, especially when I did my reality show. \nI was the go-to person and then I also fed the media so I was the media frenzy, I liked dating rappers, I was everything, the package, not knowing that I was losing my soul through it all because I became somebody that I wasn't really. So I was really happy when the IT girl titled was relinquished from me.\" Yvonne Chaka Chaka's son escapes attempted hijacking \nThe former TV star added that if she returned to the industry it would be different, because being an 'it girl' was no longer important to her. \n\"If I come back in the industry I want it to be authentic, I want it to be a reflection of the Nonhle that is born now, the mom that I am, the woman who cares about women, children because that's who I am and that's the space that I am in,\" she added. \nListen to the full interview here: \n<a href=\"https://iono.fm/e/388552\">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:49:36.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
