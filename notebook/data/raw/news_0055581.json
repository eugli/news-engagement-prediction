The JCCA told VICE News that in the same period in 2016 there was a single isolated incident (also a hoax), and in 2015 there were no reported incidents.\nThe FBI said it was “investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country.”\nThe latest incidents have prompted leading figures both within and outside the Jewish community to call on Trump to address the issue of anti-Semitism. Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said : “We look to our political leaders at all levels to speak out against such threats directed against Jewish institutions, to make it clear that such actions are unacceptable.”\nGlad to see this. All Jews need to urge @POTUS to step forward & share a plan. His words carry weight. His actions will speak even louder. https://t.co/uAgh1R1pA7\n— Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) February 21, 2017\nThe president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder, called for a “strong and decisive reaction” by politicians because “anti-Semitism is alive and kicking” in the U.S. today. “This is not merely a problem for the Jewish community; it’s a problem for America as a whole,” Lauder said.\nHillary Clinton joined the voices calling for Trump to speak out against the incidents, which she described as “so troubling.” And on Monday Trump’s daughter Ivanka attempted to address the issue in a tweet using the hashtag #JCC, but failed to specifically mention anti-Semitism. Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009 when she married Jared Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president.\nJCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS .\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017\nAmerica is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC\n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017\nOn Tuesday morning, before his speech at the National African American History Museum, Trump addressed the issue : “Anti-Semitism is horrible, and it’s going to stop and it has to stop.” He added that he denounced anti-Semitism and does so at every opportunity.\n“Anti-Semitism is horrible and it’s going to stop,” President Trump tells NBC News’ @craigmelvin https://t.co/kDXrgRz879\n— MSNBC (@MSNBC) February 21, 2017\nNot everyone was pleased with Trump’s response, however. Steve Goldstein, the executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, described Trump’s statements on Tuesday as “a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti-Semitism.”\nIn recent weeks, Trump has stumbled when offered the opportunity to speak out against anti-Semitism, responding angrily when asked to address the subject and even suggesting that the issue was a fabrication being pushed by his political opponents.\nDuring a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, when asked by an Israeli journalist if his administration “is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones,” a visibly annoyed Trump deflected, offering a bizarre response about the size of his electoral victory.\nThe next day, Trump was again asked to address the rise in anti-Semitism within the U.S. since his inauguration, with Jewish journalist Jake Turx directly asking him what the White House plans to do about the wave of bomb threats made to Jewish centers.\nAgain Trump avoided addressing the issue. Cutting the reporter off before he could finish his question, an annoyed Trump responded, “I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.” He added: “I hate the charge. I find it repulsive.”\nOver the weekend, Vice President Mike Pence visited the former Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany. Pence said : “We can never forget atrocities against Jews and others in the Holocaust.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump", "https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/833828489442783237", "https://t.co/uAgh1R1pA7", "https://www.facebook.com/AnneFrankCenterforMutualRespect/posts/10155151871429040", "https://twitter.com/TimOBrien/status/832584189060980736", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/donald-trump-news-conference-anti-semitism/index.html", "https://t.co/kDXrgRz879", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-american-jews-are-worried-its-time-to-address-the-issue-of-anti-semitism-2-2-2017", "https://twitter.com/craigmelvin", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JCC?src=hash", "http://www.wnem.com/story/34553541/update-11-more-bomb-threats-target-jewish-community-centers-ivanka-trump-responds", "https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/834050590640533505", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-anti-semitism_us_58ab3f7be4b0a855d1d8b074?e99285octpohzd7vi", "https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/834056135787294720", "https://twitter.com/VP/status/833334018313744386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Ftrump-finally-addresses-rising-anti-semitism-after-dozens-of-bomb-threats-to-jewish-community-centers", "https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/833853296184061952", "http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/miscellaneous/additional-bomb-threats-jccs-across-country.html#.WKtT9hRR4vk?referrer=https://t.co/O7n062h47a", "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/bomb-threats-target-jewish-centers-across-us/ar-AAn9tjK?li=BBnbcA1", "http://jcca.org/news-and-views/jccs-respond-new-wave-bomb-threats-quickly/", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/834027159148695552"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:03:09.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
