Beloved: The animal was described as a national treasure (AP) \n\"Here we're used to seeing the dead every day,\" said Martin Castillo, a street vendor in central San Salvador. \"They kill us like flies, but this tops it all. They killed an animal that only entertained us.\" \nZoo director Vladan Henriquez said at a news conference that the hippo was covered with bruises and puncture wounds after apparently being attacked with metal bars, knives and rocks. Call to support therapy dogs scheme for London veterans with PTSD \nThe attack occurred last week, but zoo keepers did not discover the hippo's injuries until Thursday because he did not leave his pool. \nJustice minister Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde said an investigation had been opened and police are trying to establish who broke into the animal’s enclosure. \nEl Salvador is one of the world's most violent countries, recording 5,278 homicides last year, or an average of 14 people killed per day. Most of the killings have been blamed on powerful street gangs.
