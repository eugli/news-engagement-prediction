The Football Association announced last May that quarter-final replays would be scrapped, reverting to a sudden-death format in a bid to ease English football's congested fixture list. That is a relief to Mourinho given progress to the Europa League and FA Cup finals would make this a 66-match campaign for United. The possibility of a 67th had loomed large on Sunday as United struggled to overcome fifth-round opponents Blackburn, with Rashford having cancelled out Danny Graham's stunning opener. In the end a replay was avoided as substitutes Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic combined, with the latter sweeping home a superb winner in front of the 7,283 visiting fans. 'I think that was the kind of missing bits that we needed in the game,' Rashford said of the duo's second-half introduction. Rashford wheels away in celebration after scoring United's equaliser at Ewood Park Jose Mourinho was satisfied with United's performance as they progressed in the Cup 'We had it throughout the game but not in big spurts, so I think we needed them two to come on. 'Everyone knows they are quality players and they did what their team needed to do. 'I mean, (Ibrahimovic) made it look easy but the finish, when you're in the situation, is difficult to take. 'You know, he is experienced and he has been in the position many, many times and he's finished it easily.' The fact Pogba and Ibrahimovic were called upon speaks volumes about the threat Blackburn posed at Ewood Park. Zlatan Ibrahimovic won the game for United, scoring 15 minutes from time Owen Coyle's side produced a performance that belies their position in the Sky Bet Championship relegation zone and goalscorer Graham wants to build on that in Friday's crunch clash at Burton. 'It was a great moment,' the striker told Rovers Player. 'Obviously to go 1-0 up against Man United, you think the shock could be on the cards. 'But they are a great team and they put us under a lot of pressure in the second half and it wasn't to be. 'But I think the boys can hold their head up high and we've set a standard now. We need to take that into Friday night's game.'
