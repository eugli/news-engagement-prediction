DEPORTES \nItaly's defensive would be along the 22m line at a ruck, but by not competing they were allowed to roam into English territory. \nAs such, 23 Englishmen and their Australian coach were dumbfounded at what was happening on Monday (NZT) in England, as Italy moved into what we imagine as \"offside\" positions in a legal manner. \nREAD MORE: \nDEPORTES \nItalian halfback Edoardo Gori left his English counterpart Danny Care bewildered by his legal positioning on defence. \nThis is a tactic that has been used well in sevens rugby for some time, and more recently by the Chiefs during the 2016 season. \nThe Chiefs didn't use the tactic to the level Italy did, but on occasion they would put the pressure on in the opposition 22m, making it tough for a first-five to clear the ball. \nHow the tactic works is simple. \nDuring a tackle, there is no offside line on the field of play. Players from each team are free to roam wherever they like. Ad Feedback \nBut when a tackle has occurred, a ruck is formed when a player from each team is in contact, over the ball. The ball must be on the ground. \nWhen those players make contact, an offside line is created at their hindmost feet, so either side of the newly formed ruck. Step across that line before the ball leaves the ruck, and a player is offside. \nBecause Italy never committed men to the tackle, in turn forming a ruck, they didn't have to pay attention to any offside laws. \nAs long as they stayed a fair distance from the tackled player, which referees say is about a metre, Italy were able to surround England and obstruct the normal flow of the game. \nThe All Blacks use their own version of this tactic. \nInstead of flooding the opposition territory and preventing passes going through to the back line, New Zealand are more subtle with their use of the rule. \nWatch any All Blacks match and about half of their tackles don't turn into rucks. As a result, they use that to generate more line speed, making several tackles behind the gain line. \nIt's one reason people always thought Richie McCaw was offside. He was, from time to time, but by not forming rucks he was free to jump the gun when the halfback went to pass the ball. \nItaly are an inferior team to England. Of that there is no doubt. But by using a clever tactic which prevented England from playing their natural game, they kept the score close and seriously disrupted the Six Nations champions. \nIt's a tactic which a team like the Sunwolves of Japan could do worse than to adopt in Super Rugby, given the gulf in quality between them and other sides. \nYou'd imagine New Zealand sides would be faster to adapt, however, than England were. \nIt calls for more pick-and-gos from the forwards, and allows an up-tempo style of play. A quality short kicking game would also cause problems. \nTry that tactic against the All Blacks, and Italy would have been run ragged through the middle of the field. \nEddie Jones can be upset and say the tactic is \"not rugby\", but it showed England aren't at the point where they can lift the pace of a game, or adapt well to outside the box thinking. \nIt's the first real sign this current England squad don't have the swagger the All Blacks do when times get tough. - Stuff Save | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Next International story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:10:25.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
