Because there’s so much artistry in the Harry Potter movies. I think that maybe because this movie is set in the 1920s, which kind of keys off a different visual sense, might be the obvious [reason it won], but I can’t believe it never won [before].” \nAnd with that, as calmly as she appeared on stage, she exited, still clutching her trophy to her chest.
