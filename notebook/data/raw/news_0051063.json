And it reached a particular pitch in the last few weeks.\nRead More Tory councillor suspended over 'racist' retweet comparing Diane Abbott to an ape wearing lipstick \"I thought to myself, had I known it would be like this 30 years on from being elected, I would have thought twice about running for Parliament at all.\"\nSome of the messages that have been sent to Ms Abbott were flashed up on a giant screen during the interview.\n(Photo: Sky News) (Photo: Sky News) They included: \"Get yourself spat at by someone with HIV and die a quick death.\"\nMs Abbott said: \"It kind of does get in your head. It kind of does demoralise you.\"\nRead More Tory David Davis in sexism row over texts about Labour's Diane Abbott Since the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right fanatic, she said, \"I've been trying to sort out the security on my home. My staff try not to let me walk round Hackney on my own. It's a horrible, horrible world out there.\"\nMs Abbott blamed social media for \"turbo-charging\" abuse by making it easier to create it.\n\"[People] kind of dehumanise you, so they can call you all these names. They can say you should be hanged or die in some horrible way,\" she said.\nShe said there was a case for a parliamentary inquiry into new rules to stop abusive comments on US websites like Facebook and Twitter.\nDiane Abbott on Sky News (Photo: Sky News) Despite free speech rights, she said, \"no one really has a right to peddle this racist and sexist abuse\".\nShe warned it seemed as though some trolls want to \"drive some of us out of politics\".\nBut she insisted black children should not be put off aiming for Westminster, saying: \"You can make a difference.\"\nLater in the interview Ms Abbott said Jeremy Corbyn should remain Labour leader - even if he loses both of this week's crunch by-elections in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland.\nShe said: \"These are difficult by-elections. They are going to be quite tight. We are hopeful of winning both of them but it's really important that every Labour supporter comes out to vote.\nShe said Jeremy Corbyn should remain leader even if Labour loses in Stoke, above (Photo: Getty) Corbyn ally Ms Abbott said: \"These are difficult by-elections\" (Photo: Getty) \"And if we lose one, if we lose both, I think the party will go forward. It has to go forward.\"\nAsked if there would be questions over Mr Corbyn's leadership she said: \"No. There are people who've been opposed to Jeremy from the very beginning. I'm not one of them, and I think we have to go forward.\"\nShe also defended her decision to miss a key Brexit vote due to illness - three hours after speaking in a parliamentary debate.\n\"What honestly happened was I was allowed to go home because I had a migraine,\" she said. \"George Osborne missed the vote because he was doing a highly-paid speech abroad.\"\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Diane Abbott Westminster Labour Party Racism Brexit Politics", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1809/4221396001_5328988381001_5328982429001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics"], "published": "2017-02-19T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:09:20.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
