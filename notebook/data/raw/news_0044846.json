resettlement.

SSI confirmed the organisation was supporting 3700 refugees in Fairfield.\nmedia_camera Peter Shergold, Frank Carbone and Fairfield councillor Dai Le at the council chambers. Picture: Timothy Clapin\nProfessor Shergold said Cr Carbone’s concerns were justified, but that the NSW Government’s resources across health, education and employment had a strong focus on Fairfield.\n“Is that as much as the mayor would like? Undoubtedly not. But he is at least able to see that the pressure that Fairfield feels under is being addressed, at least at the state level,” he said.\nIn the 2016-17 budget, the NSW Government allocated an additional $6.1 million to the South Western Local Health District. In education, $91.3 million was appointed to support increased enrolments of students from refugee backgrounds, while $4 million of additional funding was granted to Legal Aid NSW.\nThe Federal Government has allocated $638.1 million over four years towards the additional intake.\nmedia_camera Dai Le, Peter Shergold and Frank Carbone. Picture: Timothy Clapin\nProf Shergold said refugee resettlement needed not only short-term solutions, but a long-term plan.\n“The importance is that these services help people to become self-reliant,” he said. “That the kids get educated, that people learn English, that they get their overseas qualifications acknowledged and they’re able to get employment.\n“What we don’t want is refugees who find that they are still dependent on support services five years from now.”\nFowler federal Labor MP Chris Hayes also voiced concerns about the lack of a long-term plan for refugee resettlement in Fairfield.\n“People in my community obviously have a reputation of being very charitable in the way we work with refugees, but when we talk about taking such a large number, I think the government could have had a more foresighted plan,” he said.\nCarmen Lazar, manager of the Assyrian Resource Centre, said despite the increase in refugee arrivals, the “pressure has been a bundle of joy”.\n“The centre has a number of volunteers who dedicate their time to accommodate to their needs, however, the only form of pressure that is present is the lack of funding which can be used to initiate further service to support refugees,” she said.\nShe added that Fairfield was an ideal place for new arrivals to call home.\n“Fairfield is where their language is spoken, their churches are located and most importantly where their family surrounds them.”", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/ab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8e808c5822cbf5de71dc5828e6e7a955?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/fairfield-advance", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/ab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Ffairfield-advance%2Fnews-story%2Fab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/ab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea5239d5765b364553c213a9becf98e6?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0f51a5d82179a8f7200cfdc0f03e36ff?width=1024", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Fairfield%20appeals%20for%20refugee%20support&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Ffairfield-advance%2Fnews-story%2Fab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Ffairfield-advance%2Fnews-story%2Fab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Ffairfield-advance%2Fnews-story%2Fab5248e77c1af22065e3206999f60b2d", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-20T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:57:07.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
