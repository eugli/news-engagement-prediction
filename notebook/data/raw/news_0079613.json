Image copyright Reuters Image caption Here's what a regular flight looks like \nThe airline launched its first commercial flights only in December 2011 but, thanks to a rapidly growing middle class, has jumped to become the country's second-largest airline, almost head to head with flag carrier Vietnam Airlines. \nBoth carriers have about 40% of market share. But if Vietjet's past growth is anything to go by, it is set to claim the top spot in no time. \nWhile most analysts agree that the domestic market will continue to show strong growth, there is caution over whether Vietjet will be able to replicate that success abroad. \n\"There's no doubt that they are the dominant low-cost carrier in Vietnam,\" explains aviation analyst Greg Waldron of FlightGlobal. \"The question is whether they can really expand that model overseas.\" \n\"These business models are not like McDonald's, where you can just replicate the model elsewhere,\" he explains. \n\"With airlines, it's a lot more challenging: if they go internationally, this would add a huge amount of complexity to their business model. Long-haul flights would again be a completely different game.\" Image copyright Vietjetair Image caption And here's what they got fined for in 2012 \nAside from its impressive growth rates, the airline is also known for its somewhat controversial PR stunts. \nIn the past, the airline has made occasional headlines with PR stunts of having its stewardesses serving the aisles wearing little more than a bikini as uniform. \n\"They've been clever about their marketing,\" says Mr Waldron. \"This gave them huge publicity all over the world.\" \nThere's little doubt it garnered global coverage. In case it strikes you as somewhat inappropriate, however, Vietnamese authorities agree. \nIn at least one of the instances, Vietjet was fined for hiring models for an on-board bikini show.
