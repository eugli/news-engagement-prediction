ADVERTISEMENT \nThese films tell various stories that are thoroughly Filipino in theme and treatment, said Tieng and Mendoza. \nThere are three categories in this year’s fest: feature-length, shorts and documentaries. \nAmong the entries in the feature section are HF Yambao’s “Kristo,” Ricardo Carranza’s “Beyond the Block,” Jason Orfalas’ “Ladyfish,” and Joel Lamangan’s “Bhoy Instik.” \nVaried colorful characters take centerstage in this year’s features program: a street vendor/cockfight aficionado, hip-hop dancers, a transgender call-center agent and a gay thief and his young protégé. \nAmong the finalists in the short films section are: Matthew Victor Pastor’s “I Am Jupiter, I Am the Biggest Planet”; Emmanuel Escalona Jr.’s “Ang Langit, Burger at ang Universe”; Karl Glenn Barit’s “Aliens Ata”; Jose Maria Javier Manoos’ “Ang Hindi Ko Masambit,” and Paul Arrenze Dionela’s “Tulay Buhay.” \nThe entries in the documentary category are: Avelino Mark Balmes Jr.’s “Hango”; Jaynus Olaivar’s “Kupkop”; Noah del Rosario’s “The Recycled Spirits of Roel Cabato”; Jean Clare Dy and Manuel Domes’ “Pagrara Sang Patipuron (Weaving a Circle),” and “Krudo Boys” (which is a collaboration among six people: Mirielle de Lara, Angelica Domingo, Dannieleth Julapong, Maria Agnes Malvar, Bea San Juan, Nathaniel Santiago). Story-driven \nThese short films and docus, Mendoza and Tieng pointed out, would take viewers all over the country, showcasing the lives of ordinary and extraordinary Filipinos. \nFor example, “Hango” tells the story of fisherfolk from Bacoor, Cavite. \n“Krudo Boys” follows scavengers who risk life and limb to recover crude oil that leak from ships in Navotas. \nOn the other hand, “The Recycled Spirits of Roel Cabato” focuses on an Ilocano-Ifugao artist and environmentalist from Baguio City, while “Pagrara Sang Patipuron” centers on a group of Aeta women from Iloilo. \n“All these films are story-driven,” Tieng remarked. “We put a high premium on the script.” \nThe fest will be shown in select cinemas from March 9 to 14. Awards night is on March 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:27:46.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
