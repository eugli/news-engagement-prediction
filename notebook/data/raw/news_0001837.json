Old World Third St. Pizzeria San Giorgio, the newest restaurant concept from the owner of the Calderone Club, is gearing up to debut in the second week of February. After roughly one year of renovations and work, the new pizzeria, 838 N. Old World Third St., made its debut Tuesday with a ribbon cutting ceremony. The restaurant is located right next door to Calderone Club and specializes in Neapolitan-style pizza, along with other Italian dishes. Click through the attached slideshow to see what the new restaurant looks like. 12 photos Pizzeria San Giorgio is located at 838 N. Old World Third St. Calderone Club owner Gino Fazzari has spent the past year renovating the new dining spot, which is housed in the building formerly home to Thai Palace. The building had been vacant since that restaurant closed in 2013 and the interior has been completely built out to create an atmosphere that's both traditional and contemporary, Fazzari said. The approximately 3,000-square-foot restaurant boasts 84 seats and a 6,000-pound wood-fired pizza oven that was brought in from Naples. There's even a bar around the pizza oven where diners can sit and watch as their Neapolitan pizza is cooked in a little more than one minute. Fazzari said he's always had a passion and admiration for the art behind creating a Neapolitan-style pizza, which is why Pizzeria San Giorgio is undergoing the Vera Pizza Napoletana certification process. When that certification is complete, the restaurant will be the first pizzeria with that certification in the city and the fourth in Wisconsin, he said. The restaurant's name, San Giorgio, is Italian for Saint George. \"He's been in charge of this project from the beginning,\" Fazzari reflected. \"When we ran into a road block, I'd say a prayer to Saint George and, miraculously, we came out on the other side better than before.\" In addition to pizza, San Giorgio will also serve Italian sandwiches, salads and antipasti. San Giorgio will only make one pasta dish on special each day, so if a customer is looking for more extensive selection on that front, Fazzari said Calderone Club next door is probably the place to go. Pizzeria San Giorgio will open to the public in the second week of February. Its hours of operation will be 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday through Thursday; and Friday and Saturday, from noon to midnight. The restaurant won't immediately offer delivery or takeout since Neapolitan-style pizza doesn't travel well and is best when fresh, but Fazzari said he's looking into options for the future.
