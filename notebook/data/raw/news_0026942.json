Some may find it odd that he chose to vote at all, rather than remain above the fray, like the Queen. \nAfter all, even if he does treat this great office as though he were the chairman of a local council, he is nominally the First Commoner of the realm. \nBut while his opinions were never in doubt, it is not his place to express them. The problem is that, while once on the far-Right, Mr Bercow has shot across the political spectrum and he wants everyone to witness this personal journey, even if it means jeopardising the most important attribute of his job â€“ its impartiality. Watch | Bercow: I'm strongly opposed to Trump addressing Parliament 03:07 \nI n the Commons last week he took it upon himself to veto a speech to Parliament by the American President, Donald Trump, without consulting anyone else. \nNow we learn that a few days before that, Mr Bercow was regaling students at Reading University with his views on Brexit. \nIt is good to see the Speaker meeting young people to explain the workings of Parliament; but he once again opted to parade his own opinions on the most contentious of issues that needs to be resolved by the very House of Commons over which he presides. \nThis is a precarious time in the history of our country. The Brexit decision has split the nation and will require the most careful handling if we are to get through to the other side stronger and united. \nParliament is central to that task and will inevitably witness further strife. Yet the individual charged with calming things down has become a focus for antagonism. \nI t is hard to understand why Mr Bercow cannot see the damage he is doing to the ancient office he holds. His lack of self-awareness is on an epic scale. \nAs soon as he allies himself openly to one particular school of thought, he is instantly compromised. But he seems not to care, which is a flaw that surely disqualifies him from the post. \nThe Bill to trigger Article 50 has yet to pass through Parliament and MPs will spend years dealing with the legislative consequences of the decision to leave the EU. \nMr Bercow contends that he will be scrupulously impartial in his handling of these debates but who will believe him now? \nThe proof of his failure as Speaker is the very animosity that he inspires. He needs either to explain himself to the House and the country, or to consider his position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:17:25.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
