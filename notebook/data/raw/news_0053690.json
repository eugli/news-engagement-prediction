By Tim Grierson Feb 21, 2017 The bias isn't intentional but it's there: Nearly every category at the Oscars recognizes the achievements of actors or directors. Sure, there are Oscars for effects, production, and even makeup, but as fans of innovative new camera technology, ingenious set designs, bigger explosions, and just the right amount of CGI, we want more. And the men and women responsible for those moments deserve more. That's why, for the third year in a row, we've highlighted the greatest visual effects in film. We want to recognize those people whose work is often judged more by what isn't noticed than what is. Just as important, we want to encourage them to do more—because we're watching and appreciating every minute of it.

The shift was dreamed up after production designer Patrice Vermette and director Denis Villeneuve had to abandon an initial idea in which Louise and her team simply rose up to the top of the ship with a scissor lift. \"The scissor lift just wasn't tall enough,\" says Vermette. \"So, we said, 'Well, maybe there should be a gravity shift there.'\" Arrival 's creative team approached the complicated shot from two angles: as a philosophical comment and a logistical puzzle. \"The characters need to jump and walk up—it's a leap of faith,\" Vermette says. To make it work, visual-effects supervisor Louis Morin drew inspiration from Gravity, seamlessly integrating two sets to give the impression that the characters were physically hopping from Earth's gravity at the base of the ship to the vessel's, which stems from the walls, changing the viewer's perspective from horizontal to vertical. \"We first shot the actors faking the jumping element,\" Morin says. \"Then the camera would move to the second set, where we would have the people landing. The first camera was wild\"—that is, run by an operator—\"and the second camera was motion-controlled with a rig called the Technodolly. We stitched all those shots together, and then we reverse-engineered the camera, locking it to the faces of the actor, and the motion-control would do all the camera moves as if they were flying in the air.\" The result is a seamless transition and an elegant leap from Earth's gravity to the walls of the spacecraft. Most Accurate Spaceship: Arrival Even a fictional spaceship should be accurate. Although he began consulting on Arrival after the craft was designed, scientist Stephen Wolfram came up with a theory for how the ship would travel: It could \"spin to create gravitational waves,\" then \"swim through space propelled by those waves,\" he says. It helps to picture the spacecraft as a submarine: \"You can push it through the water. Or you can boil the water around it,\" he says, and make it easier for the submarine to move. \"If you can kind of boil space-time, you don't have something with the same structure you thought you were going to,\" Wolfram says.

Some of their bigger challenges: 1. Finding a plane You can buy old airplanes, Stern says. \"Used-up aircraft become some discounted amount of scrap aluminum. We bought two out-of-service A320s. They had to be brought from the airplane junkyard in Victorville, California, to Falls Lake at Universal Studios outside Los Angeles. They had to be moved at night under highway patrol escort, on a route that was calculated to avoid bridges.\" 2. Two locations The crew planned to film the crash and rescue in the Hudson River, but Mother Nature intervened. \"The current is quite intense and it goes both directions,\" Owens says. \"It runs up and down at five knots twice a day,\" Stern says. \"That's a tremendous amount of force.\" To avoid injury to the cast and crew—or drowning Tom Hanks—they shot some rescue scenes in the Hudson and then moved to an oversize water tank at Universal's lot. 3. Water The studio tank, which ran from six to thirty feet deep, wouldn't allow the fifty-ton plane to be as submerged as it needed to be. \"There were many shots where I CG-ed extra water,\" says Owens. \"In real life, the plane would pitch and rotate down the river, changing level as it goes, but we weren't able to do that because it was fix-mounted in the tank.\" 4. Bracing for impact Owens used real background shots to mimic the path of US Airways Flight 1549 into the Hudson, but when it came time to duplicate the actual crash, CG took over. \"Because of the complexity of the shot, all the water, all the background, and the plane were done completely with a computer,\" Owens says. Water simulations were run to mimic what the force of a commercial airplane hitting the Hudson would look like, with Owens balancing Eastwood's desire for realism with the demands to make the landing look as dynamic as possible. \"With effects shots,\" he says, \"it looks absolutely phony until it's perfect.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Creative Placeholder to Actually Make It Into the Movie The opening credits of Deadpool show the superhero in a hyper-realistic slow-motion CGI depiction of a combination car crash, gun battle, and aggressive use of a cigarette lighter (right). Throughout, sarcastic credits identify the cast as \"God's Perfect Idiot,\" \"A Hot Chick,\" \"A British Villain,\" and \"A CGI Character.\" Director Tim Miller explains how the scene was created: The Frozen Intro \"When CG isn't moving, you can really sculpt in a lot of detail that you may not be able to do with a character that has to behave and move through space. With an animated human, you have cloth on his body that moves with it properly. You have a face that has to have a really complex set of controls underneath. The hair has to be simulated. But if the characters are frozen in space, you don't have to do all that work. On the flip side, you don't have the benefit of motion to hide any irregularities or lack of detail. It took a team of ten to twelve people working on this for two to three months to get it done.\" The Credits \"The writers had done it that way before I even got involved in the project. We had started previz [a digital video tool that roughs out a scene] before we even had a budget or the movie was cast. Franck Balson, a director at my production company, Blur, put in placeholders—just a tongue-in-cheek thing to amuse him and me, and we all loved it.\" Most Inventive Camerawork: Hardcore Henry Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Writer-director Ilya Naishuller had experience with first-person filming before Hardcore Henry, having directed and starred in a similar music video in 2013. But that was less than five minutes—and the technology, or at least the rigging of it, was basic. \"I shot a lot of it with a GoPro in my mouth surrounded by tissues and hoping not to slobber too much.\" For Henry, a film shot entirely from the first-person POV, GoPro provided its best equipment at the time—GoPro HERO3s—with then-unreleased software that allowed Naishuller to control the aperture and outer focus. Instead of having actors hold the cameras in their mouths, Naishuller settled on a lightweight 3D-printed plastic helmet with magnetic stabilization (above). Two GoPros were mounted at mouth height. \"If you put the camera on top of your head like in extreme sports, it looks terrible. It's a very lanky, slender character.\" The challenge was training the actors to focus on the camera, rather than the eyes of the person in the rig. \"It's basic human instinct to look at the eyes when we talk,\" Naishuller says. \"So we bought these ridiculous, 1980s skiing glasses with yellow reflective lenses\" to obscure the actor's eyes, and added red arrows pointing to the cameras. Including Naishuller, thirteen different operators served as \"Henry.\" The crew went through about a dozen GoPro HERO3s. Most of those casualties were due to kicks to the head, which had to get very close to the cameras to look real. Sometimes they got too close, breaking the cameras' outputs. But not a single one was lost to drool. Least Fake Fake World: The Jungle Book For director Jon Favreau's adaptation of the Disney classic The Jungle Book, visual-effects supervisor Robert Legato says the crew had a mantra: \"Do not embellish nature. My primary interest was not making a fantastic new world, but making one that feels like it was conventionally photographed.\" That meant the crew created a \"virtual cinematography.\" In motion-capture, they shot only Mowgli and stuffed animal stand-ins (above). \"We shot and cut as if everything was in front of us,\" Legato says. \"It wasn't photo-real, but it has enough information to know where our camera is and what lens we were going to use. When we replicated it on stage, instead of being limited to a blue screen and looking at one angle, we have a 360-degree view of the world.\" The animals were based on real-world examples. \"We're not allowed to photograph them anymore because of animal rights. So we looked at nature documentaries and movies. Every one of our scenes had a real-life piece of reference. The animals move the way a real animal moves. The computer rigs that we created were based on their skeleton and their musculature.\" To up the realism, the creative team even embraced the imperfections that stem from old-fashioned live-action filming. \"We wanted it to feel like we went out and photographed each thing,\" Legato says. \"If someone got too close to the camera, it would shake. If you put a camera in a spot in the middle of a stampede, you're going to get mud all over it. The audience starts to absorb the story as we wish to tell it. They don't get mired in the technique of it.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Use of Las Vegas: Jason Bourne In five movies, the Jason Bourne franchise has included a lot of car chases (and jump cuts and insanely frenetic fight scenes), but the one down the Las Vegas Strip at the end of Jason Bourne is what director Paul Greengrass considers the best. When stunt coordinator Gary Powell first met with second-unit director Simon Crane to scout locations, one thing became clear. \"We were both adamant it had to be on the Strip,\" Powell says. \"It was pointless going to Las Vegas if you weren't going to be using the Strip—if you go around the back roads, you could have been anywhere else.\" The idea required the kind of permissions that Las Vegas rarely gives. \"We had to go through all the implications of shutting down the Strip: how much does it cost, what hotels are going to play ball with us. We lucked out that everyone was really accommodating. The speeds we were doing—the amount of cars we crashed—has never been done on that scale in Las Vegas,\" Powell says. The city agreed to close down its main thoroughfare from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. for only two weeks. \"We had something like two hundred extras and roughly fifty-five stunt drivers,\" Powell says of the actual Strip shoot. There were very few visual effects, so that the scene would look more real. When that SWAT van plows through cars, it's plowing through actual cars—but with a little bit of movie help: A ramp was added to the SWAT vehicle to throw the cars higher in the air, and the cars themselves were slightly doctored. \"We took out the engines to make sure when we hit them they were as light as possible,\" Powell says. \"It looks great, but they still look like cars.\" All they needed was a spectacular ending, which presented itself when they found out the Riviera Hotel was already set for demolition. If it's already going to be torn down, it is no big deal to drive a car through the front door.

Anything higher than 24 makes some people feel sick, but director Ang Lee wanted a smooth, immersive experience. So he shot Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk at 120. \"Lee really liked 3D,\" says his editor Tim Squyres. \"But 24 fps causes strobing [a jumpy image] and motion blur [a smeared image caused by movement]. In 2D we're used to it. It's what we consider the film look. In 3D, strobing is annoying.\" So Lee increased his frame rate and incorporated a two-camera 3D rig. \"Both cameras have synchronized shutters running at 120,\" Squyres says. This led to a few surprises. \"You can't really get away with makeup,\" says Squyres. Some viewers will initially be shocked by Billy Lynn 's startlingly live look but Lee thinks that his shooting style will soon be common. If you have a queasy stomach, you can always play it safe and wait thirty minutes after eating before entering the theater. Other than enhancing some background buildings and removing camera rigs and a car-tossing plow from the front of the SWAT van, nearly all of the chase scene was created using practical effects. Most Useful Corpse: Swiss Army Man Makeup-effects producer Jason Hamer created a life-size mold of Daniel Radcliffe to use as the corpse buddy to a character trapped in the wilderness in Swiss Army Man . Although the corpse can't move and only barely speaks, he serves many roles: companion, Jet Ski, water well, axe, gun, and highly inappropriate compass. Director Ang Lee (above, right) rigged up two cameras at a 90-degree angle to each other with a beam splitter between them to create a smooth 3D picture. The biggest challenge was getting the actors to focus on the splitter instead of one of the camera lenses.

Much of that expression was inspired by Liam Neeson, who voices the character. The tree even moves a little like Neeson. But primarily it's a tree, with all the walking challenges you might expect: \"We wanted him to have difficulty making even one step. Everything is completely rigid—but we had to study all the positions, all the joints, all the ways of modeling, to achieve the muscles.\" Which probably explains why most trees remain still. Most Ingenious Spaceship Interior: Passengers Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas has no idea how a spaceship would work. \"My background is in industrial design,\" he says. But he knows that things need to make sense—and that everything needs to have a purpose. So that's exactly what he ensured in designing the ship in Passengers. \"It's absolutely no good coming up with an attractive exterior if there's not some logical consideration as to how people are going to be inhabiting the interior,\" he says. Dyas explains a few of the ship's features: Hulls \"It's a tri-hull system, where each hull serves a different purpose, and they're all attached to a central pivot point. The three hulls rotate in a centrifugal arrangement. In science fiction, this theoretically creates gravity for you to stand up on the inside edge of the hulls. One hull is for storage, one is dedicated to the sleep chambers, and the third hull is retail.\" Wall Structure \"Enormous alloy ribs hold the ship together. The inspiration for them was the grilles of 1930s racing cars. The ribs were first created as a CAD drawing, then sent to the woodworking shop and cut as CNC profiles. Each one has a male and a female element that are snapped together to make the larger shapes.\" Scale \"With only two or three principal actors, we needed to convey a sense of isolation and loneliness—and horror, really. We could have done green screens, but that tends to be a little difficult for actors to feel that sense of loneliness. So the sets were absolutely enormous. Thirty or forty feet high and up to eight hundred feet long.\" Navigation \"If you're in the rotating spaceship and want to get from one hull to the other, you have to travel through the central core. In this pivot point you'd actually be at zero gravity, so we ended up designing an elevator that you climb into, where you have to buckle up a seat belt. When you pass through the central point, gravity eventually catches up with you again.\" Lighting \"The large mushroom structure above the sleep chambers housed UV lights. One of the things people don't think about when designing sci-fi sleep chambers is that the skin is a living, breathing organism. It has to receive UV light the same way a plant does. Otherwise we'd simply die.\" Pod Trees \"There are eight people in each of the pod trees. By grouping them, you can be economical about the power it takes to monitor their vitals. At the same time, and this is morbid, but if there's a malfunction, you don't want to lose all of your passengers. \" the low-tech awards least convincing transformations.
