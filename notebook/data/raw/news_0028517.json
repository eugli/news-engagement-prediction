Berkshire Hathaway 'A' shares crack $250,000 ceiling The Financial Times 2 hrs ago Stephen Foley in New York Click to expand Buffett buys Apple and airlines CNBC Wochit Business 0:32 UP NEXT The price of admission to the elite club of Berkshire Hathaway “A” shareholders has hit a quarter of a million dollars for the first time, taking the value of Warren Buffett ’s famed investment vehicle to a new record.\nBerkshire shares closed on Tuesday at $250,412, surpassing a December high and marking a 13 percent surge since the presidential election that Mr Buffett had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. Quotes in the article +0.81% \nThe nearly 1 percent rise during Tuesday’s trading session inflated the value of a single Berkshire share by $2,078, and the value of the company is now $412 billion. That means a single share is now about the same price as a four-bedroom house in the suburbs of Mr Buffett’s native Omaha, Nebraska. \nInvestors who can afford to buy get enhanced voting rights that are not available to holders of Berkshire’s more modestly priced — and more frequently traded — “B” shares, which closed at their own record of $166.95. \nMany of the “A” shareholders have held the stock for years, watching as it has expanded beyond its origins as a vehicle for Mr Buffett’s public market investments into a sprawling conglomerate whose businesses span insurance, utilities, manufacturing and railways. Keeping the stock expensive is a form of “ shareholder eugenics ,\" Mr Buffett has explained, describing shareholders as “partners” who he expects to buy in for the long term. \nBrian Meredith, an analyst at UBS, raised his price target for Berkshire shares above $250,000 last month, to reflect the surging stock market value of other rail and energy companies which investors use to compare Berkshire’s subsidiaries. \nHe is also predicting Berkshire’s next quarterly earnings, due at the end of this month, will show improved results at Geico, the car insurance arm, where Mr Buffett has blamed a surge in payouts on careless drivers texting while driving. \nOther analysts have also made bullish calls on the stock. Jim Shanahan of Edward Jones says his buy rating is underpinned by the cash pouring in from Berkshire’s subsidiaries. \nAt the current rate, Berkshire’s cash pile could top $100 billion by the second half of this year, he said, giving Mr Buffett “a lot of dry powder” to make large and potentially value-enhancing acquisitions. © Bloomberg Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., arrives on stage during an event with Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, not pictured, at the Sokol Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., on Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2015. Buffet said at the rally that he was supporting Clinton's bid for president because they share a commitment to help the less affluent. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg *** Local Caption *** Warren Buffett \nAs for the stock, Mr Shanahan is recommending “A” shares only to Edward Jones’ richest clients. “Many people do not have the capacity to put $250,000 into a single stock. It would be difficult for our clients to get the benefits of a diversified portfolio if they did that.” \nMr Buffett told an audience of Columbia University students earlier this month that he was bullish on the long-term future of the U.S. economy, despite his campaigning for Mrs Clinton. He revealed he had been buying stocks with Berkshire’s investment funds both before and after the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:06:28.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
