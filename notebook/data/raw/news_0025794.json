I will dedicate myself exclusively to our academy,” Toni Nadal told the Il Tennis Italiano website.\n“The relationship with my nephew is always optimal, in all these years we have never had periods of crisis.”\nToni Nadal has slowly been putting the pieces in place for his pullback, first with the hiring years ago of former player and family confidante Carlos Costa as Rafael Nadal’s personal manager.\nAt the end of last season, former mentor Carlos Moya was added to the travelling coaching team, lifting much of the responsibility from the elder Nadal.\n“The truth is that every year I decide less and less, to the point where I will not decide anything anymore,” Toni added. “I have travelled with Rafa for a lot of years, and now I want to go back to training young people and our academy is the ideal place.”\nToni has been a constant in Nadal’s player’s box.
