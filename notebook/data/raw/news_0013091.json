Do I tell her her grandpa is worth more than her grandma? That her dad is worth more than her mom?” her dad asks in a voiceover. “Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she meets? \n“Or maybe I’ll be able to tell her something different.” \nA call for equal pay for equal work closes out the commercial. \n“With ‘Daughter,’ Audi continues to push the envelope with compelling storytelling on a national platform. Pay equality is a big message for a big stage,” Loren Angelo, Audi of America vice president of marketing, said in a press release. Audi's Super Bowl commercial promoted equal pay for women. (Audi) \n“As a business built on bold innovation — from LED lighting to Audi quattro — progress is at the heart of what we do. We’re a brand that’s ahead of the curve and looking towards the future, just like our next generation of buyers.\" \nThe commercial, which was released early, also received praise online. \n“Aaaah this Audi USA commercial on equal pay is every single freaking excellent thing in the world,” tweeted actress Aisha Tyler. \n“LOVE this!” wrote actress Constance Zimmer.
