Inaugurated in 1912, the massive building could lodge up to 3,000 new arrivals , who received free board, job training and help finding employment. Argentina sees migration ban and border wall proposals in immigration row Read more \nAt the time, more than half the city’s population was foreign-born; the economy was booming, and immigration – mostly from Europe – was associated with modernity and progress. \nMuch has changed since then. Nowadays, less than 5% of Argentina’s population is foreign-born and the old hotel, after surviving an attempt to turn it into a shopping mall, now houses an immigration museum. \nAnd far from welcoming migrants, today’s government is instead preparing a special prison for them. \n“We can’t allow criminals to keep picking Argentina as a place to commit offenses,” Argentina’s centre-right pesident Mauricio Macri said in a news conference last week. \nMacri’s comments came after he signed a controversial and far-reaching executive order which allows for the deportation not only of convicted foreign criminals but also of foreign suspects who have not yet been convicted. The new prison will hold immigrants slated for deportation until they are expelled.Coming just after Donald Trump’s own sweeping executive order on immigration, the move prompted many to draw comparisons between Macri and the new US president – another former real-estate tycoon and one time business rival of the Macri family.

The executive order has drawn comparison between President Macri and Donald Trump.
