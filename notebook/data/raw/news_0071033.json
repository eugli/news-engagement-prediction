The insects were first trained to know the correct location of the ball on a platform. Subsequently, to obtain their reward, the bees had to move a displaced ball to the specified location. \nTo learn the technique, the bees were trained under one of three conditions: some observed a previously trained bee move the furthest ball to the centre to gain reward, others received a \"ghost\" demonstration, where a magnet hidden underneath the platform was used to move the ball, and a third group received no demonstration, where they found the ball already at the centre of the platform with reward. \nThe bees that observed the technique from a live or model demonstrator learned the task more efficiently than those observing a \"ghost\" demonstration or without demonstration. \nJoint lead author Dr Olli J. Loukola, said: \"The bees solved the task in a different way than what was demonstrated, suggesting that observer bees did not simply copy what they saw, but improved on it. This shows an impressive amount of cognitive flexibility, especially for an insect.\" The video will load shortly A bee is being trained to score a goal using a model demonstrator.

The \"demonstrator\" bees always moved the furthest ball to the centre, and always from the same spatial location, since they had been trained under conditions where the closer balls were immobile. Untrained bees were given three opportunities to watch a skilled bee perform the task in this manner. \nIn later tests, when these untrained bees were tested without the presence of a skilled demonstrator, bees moved the closest ball instead of the furthest ball, which they had seen the demonstrator moving. In another experiment, the bees also used a differently coloured ball than previously encountered. \nDr Loukola added: \"It may be that bumblebees, along with many other animals, have the cognitive capabilities to solve such complex tasks, but will only do so if environmental pressures are applied to necessitate such behaviours.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:32:14.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
