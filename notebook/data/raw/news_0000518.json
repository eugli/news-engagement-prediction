The couple were to pay nearly $7,000 a month on the mortgage.\nBaldwin stopped paying his mortgage in 2011, however, and at the time of the filing, he owed almost $800,000 on the loan, according to Deutsche Bank.\nLast year, the bank demanded the case move forward, even after Stephen blew off the lawsuit completely. The bank pleaded for the green light to begin the foreclosure process and to force the actor to pay his current debt owed on the mortgage, which had snowballed into a whopping $1.1 million - plus interest.\nBaldwin finally headed to court, hoping to have the entire foreclosure lawsuit thrown out and save the property from being sold at auction.\nThe actor argued that Deutsche Bank 'lacks standing to bring the action, as Plaintiff does not have clear chain of title for the mortgage and promissory note,' claiming the bank would not be able to produce the note for the mortgage.\nIn December, a judge ordered that Baldwin's home be auctioned off and mandated that the actor and his family vacate the property\nThe order states the home will be sold at public auction at the Rockland County Courthouse, with profits going towards the million-dollar debt that Baldwin owes the bank\nHe further claimed that he made payments to the bank, but wasn't properly credited. The actor believed they had wrongfully declared a default against him and accused them of not acting in good faith to negotiate a settlement.\nIn December, a judge ordered that Baldwin's home be auctioned off and mandated that the actor and his family vacate the property.\nThe order states the home will be sold at public auction at the Rockland County Courthouse, with profits going towards the million-dollar debt that Baldwin owes the bank.\nThe actor has had a string of financial troubles over the years, most notably being charged for failing to file his New York state tax returns for multiple years in 2012.\nHe eventually plead guilty in the case and agreed to pay $300,000 back in taxes and serve 5 years of probation, narrowly avoiding jail time.\nStephen's brother Alec Baldwin is also a fellow actor. The two have butt heads politically over the past year; Alec famously caricatured Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, while Stephen has been an outspoken proponent of the former business mogul since last summer.\nStephen's brother Alec Baldwin is also a fellow actor.
