He dismissed any concern over Britain’s opposition to West Bank settlements, something slated to be voiced by May during the meeting.“The purpose of these meetings are to explain Israel’s position,” Bitan told the Post . “It’s okay that the UK government is against it... the question is what they do about it,” he continued, stating that contrary to the Obama administration and the EU, he does not believe the British government will take any concrete steps against the settlements. “We only ask that they don’t disturb us – that they let us manage Israeli policy as we see fit.” Relevant to your professional network?
