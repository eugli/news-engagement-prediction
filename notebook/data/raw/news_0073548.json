He’s got a great talent in making himself unpopular… he’s semi-detached, if he is attached at all, and he snipes from the sidelines. \n“If he wants to be a Conservative, why doesn’t he become a Conservative? We are a libertarian party, we are a radical party, and he seems to be neither of those things.” \nThe Scottish MEP also slammed Mr Carswell for teaming up with prominent Tory politicians for trying to con the public into believing it was the Tories who brought about the EU referendum. GETTY David Coburn is the latest Ukip figure to express his anger at Douglas Carswell \nMr Coburn said: “He’s him in it for himself, people like Daniel Hannan and all that, it’s pure jealously. If Nigel Farage is Mr Brexit, they are Mr Nobody’s. They want to airbrush Nigel Farage out of history. \n“They want to make it look as if it was the Conservative party that got Brexit, whereas it wasn’t at all. If it wasn’t for Ukip, if it wasn’t for Nigel Farage, there would not be any Brexit at all. \n“I did more for Brexit than Douglas has ever done. If it had not been for my small band of ‘kippers, who were the only people in Scotland fighting for Brexit, we would have lost the Brexit thing altogether. All the pictures from Stoke Central by-election Thu, February 23, 2017 Voting has begun in the Stoke-On-Trent Central by-election which was called after sitting Labour MP Tristram Hunt resigned from his seat to be a museum director. The seat has always been a Labour stronghold but will see fierce competition from UKIP as they target people who voted for Brexit and the tradtional Labour working classes PA 1 of 13 Labour candidate Gareth Snell celebrates with his wife Sophia (right) after winning the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election \n“We did a lot more than Douglas Carswell has ever done.” \nWhen quizzed whether Mr Carswell could fit back into Ukip, Mr Coburn responded: “I think he’s been given enough chances to fall into line. \n“He’s not a team player. He was not a team player in the Conservative party and many people were happy to see the back of him.” \nMr Coburn added: “I think we need to have discussion among ourselves about what we are doing. The party is not, or never will be, a sub-Conservative party. That seems to be what Douglas Carswell wants. GETTY Paul Nuttall has received support from Coburn despite the result in Stoke \n“It’s not what the party are. It’s like what Nigel said; we are radical, or we are nothing.” \nMr Coburn urged Ukip supporters to rally around leader Paul Nutall, despite the disappointing loss in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election. \nThe Scotsman added: “The party is united behind Paul Nuttall. He’s a nice guy, he tries hard, and we want to unite behind him.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:04:30.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
