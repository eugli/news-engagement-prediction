Caught in mid-travel, the assortment of legal visa holders affected by the Muslim travel ban provided a snapshot of the United States’ sophisticated and often productive relationships with the seven singled-out countries.\nPresident Trump’s executive order blocked graduate students, professors, scientists, mothers and children, a wide departure from cartoonish view the president promotes of Muslim terrorists waltzing through the turnstiles of our international airports. Petulant, and obviously a sore loser, Trump tweeted yesterday that horrible events from “very many bad and dangerous people” could occur because of the judge’s ruling. It was among most unpresidential things he has said in his brief term, and easily among the silliest.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s where we are now: the visa revocations have been reportedly reversed by the State Department and a temporary restraining order issued by a Seattle judge Friday night now apparently guarantees that anyone who had a valid visa or green card to enter the US can do so. The Department of Justice appealed the order but early on Sunday a federal court denied the government request to reinstate Trump’s refugee and travel ban.\nThe intensity of the past week served as a civics refresher but also as a preview of what’s surely to come: Trump will continue to challenge the check and balances of power. The good guys won round one, but as this conflict displayed, the power of the presidency is difficult to combat. As the dust settles from the Muslim ban, here are some winners and losers:\nGet This Week in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday.

Xenophobia on the international stage and erratic, amateurish White House leadership are inspiring companies to consider moving jobs abroad for stability’s sake. The US reputation as a destination for the best and the brightest from all over the world risks being corroded by the hostility emanating from Trump.\nThe president and his men : Trump has worsened his legal defeat by belittling Judge James Robart, the Seattle jurist who blocked the president’s order, and, of course, appealing the ruling. Most constitutional experts would agree that the president will lose again. “The outcry and the potential illegality of the measure put the Trump administration in a position where they’re recoiling,” adds Leopold.\nImmigrants near and far : Visa holders whose travel was put on hold are now trickling in. But Trump sent a message to every immigrant, whether it’s a family stranded in Damascus or living in Worcester: All bets are off. It’s a new age of fear and uncertainty, whether you have your documents in order or not. “For Trump, this may have been about a campaign promise, but I’ll tell you what this was not about,” says Segal. “This was not about national security and this was not about protecting people from terrorism. There were no success stories coming out of these bans — just heartache.”\nMarcela García is a Globe editorial writer and can be reached at marcela.garcia@globe.com .
