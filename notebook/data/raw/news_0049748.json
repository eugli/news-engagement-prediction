I've learned that first-hand during my two-month long \" cash diet ,\" which allots me only $60 in spending money a week. \nThe past eight weeks, I've swapped pricey bars and restaurants for cash diet-friendly activities, many of which I've highlighted below. \nKeep in mind that this is far from a comprehensive list. If you put in a bit of effort, there are lots of other exciting ways to experience New York City on the cheap. show chapters Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 | 4:22 PM ET | 02:12 \nDo a Chelsea gallery crawl \nLots of New York City neighborhoods host art galleries, but the greatest concentration is in Chelsea, where there are hundreds to wander through between 10th and 11th Avenue and 18th and 28th street. \nPro tip: Plan your gallery crawl for a Thursday night for free wine . \nCross the Brooklyn Bridge \nThe views from the Brooklyn Bridge, which links the two boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, are unmatched. \nPlus, there's plenty to see and do on both shores. On the Manhattan side, you'll find yourself close to St. Paul's Chapel, City Hall and Wall Street. On the Brooklyn side, you're at DUMBO's spectacular Brooklyn Bridge Park, a renovated waterfront area with cafes, playgrounds, promenades and a one-of-a-kind view of the Manhattan skyline. stockelements | iStock / 360 | Getty Images \nStroll through the Brooklyn Botanic Garden \nThe garden has more than 200 cherry trees, a rose garden, a Japanese hill-and-pond garden and more. Admission typically costs $15, but is free on Saturday mornings (10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon) and Tuesdays. \nAdmission is also free during winter weekdays (December through February), but fewer plants are in bloom then. \nLearn more about the garden . \nWalk the High Line \nAnother great walking adventure is the High Line, an out-of-use railroad trestle converted into a 1.5-mile-long linear park above the hubbub of the city. \nYou can walk the High Line at your leisure, or you can take a free 75-minute tour on Tuesdays and Saturdays between May 3 and October 29.

If you have to wait, pass the time by walking along the waterfront close by or grab a beer in the Brewery. \nSamples aren't included in the tour â€” but if you pay $15 for the \"Small Batch\" tour, it comes with a guided tasting of four Brooklyn Brewery beers and a souvenir glass.
