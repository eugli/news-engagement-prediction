Gascoyne cattle stations enjoying a good start to 2017 \nUpstream from Carnarvon, Gascoyne cattle producers are also enjoying the sight of a flowing river. \n\"It's a very nice sight to wake up to and see that big water-trough [the river] filling up,\" said Waddy Robinson from Doorawarrah Station. \n\"Last year was a pretty poor result through this neck of the woods, we only had three-and-a-half inches of rain (88.9millimetres) and that was on top of a pretty similar amount the year before. \n\"So we've been hanging out for a bit this year and so far it's been pretty good, we're up to about 48 millimetres so far and the river is flowing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:58:09.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
