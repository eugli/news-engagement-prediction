By Carla Herreria \nGene Huber is so devoted to President Donald Trump , he salutes and talks to a cardboard cutout of Trump every day. \nHuber, 47, revealed that bizarre ritual during an interview with CNN , held after he was invited to join the president on stage during a campaign rally in Florida on Friday. \n“I’ve got a six-foot cardboard box of President Trump in my house and I salute that every single day,” Huber told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “I tell him, ‘Mr. President, I pray for your safety today.’” \nAnd if you doubt Huber at all, there’s proof. Huber tweeted a photo of his cardboard friend back in January. The Best Vistor I could ever have!President Trump came to Florida to see me! Wow, never will forget this!@realDonaldTrump @thebestcloser pic.twitter.com/galTF85biz — Gene Huber (@Squeakey6) January 9, 2017 \nHuber is a car salesman from West Palm Beach, Florida, according to Reuters. \nDuring Friday’s rally, Trump pointed to him in the audience, saying he saw Huber earlier on the news talking about his love for the president. Then he invited him on stage to speak to the crowd. \n“’You’re great,’ is what he told me,” Huber told CNN when asked what Trump whispered to him on stage. \nHuber explained that he had been waiting for the president since 4 a.m. that day, which, consequently, led to him being interviewed by news reporters before the rally. \n“I told the reporter that I love President Trump and President Trump heard me say that and he told me that on stage,” Huber told CNN. “And he said that he loves me.” \nSome claim that Trump’s team staged Huber at the rally to get more press, pointing to a Facebook post Huber sent days earlier, with a Trump Winery location tag . Gene Huber was staged. Def not a random. Here's his FB page: https://t.co/7GG6OGMiYG Posted from Trump Winery two days ago. pic.twitter.com/SqIQWTMFAz \nHuber’s interview with CNN was mostly friendly, considering that his idol continues to call CNN, among other news organizations, fake news . \nBut the car salesman wasn’t going to let CNN get off easy. \nAs the interview ended, Huber asked if he could say one last thing and Brown agreed. \nHe said: “Let’s just be a little, little nicer to our president.” Joe Raedle via Getty Images Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?
