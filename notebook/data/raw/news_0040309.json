They are John Robert Senior, Michel Gagnon, Robert Tomlin and Candace Johnson.\n Ken Marley represents Robert and Gagnon.\n Lawyer Frank Retar represents Tomlin and Johnson. He declined to comment for CTV News Thursday outside of court.\n Their case is now set for a preliminary \"discovery\" hearing, set for July 18.\n Marley expects a trial will be held late this year or early in 2018.\nMeanwhile, more than 21 \"pit-bull like\" dogs are still in the care of the OSPCA. Marley says a meeting will be held later today to determine \"the mechanics\" of how that hearing will be conducted.\nThe Crown attorney declined to comment.\nRelated Stories No decision on fate of 21 dogs in alleged dog fighting ring Fourth person charged in connection with Tilbury dog fighting ring: police", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:02:18.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
