More than 1,400 people have now joined a Facebook page called the Bovis Homes Victims Group to air complaints. Irate customers are also planning a protest at the company’s annual meeting in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in May. SIX MONTHS ON, OUR £385K HOUSE IS STILL A MESS Sarah Ramsay recently bought as property in Hemel Hempstead made by housebuilder Bovis, but the build quality was terrible. Pictured with her son, Dylan Mother-of-one Sarah Ramsay and her partner Lewis Mortimer bought a three-bedroom home to move into last summer. But when the couple arrived builders were still working on the £385,000 terraced house in Apsley, Hertfordshire. The toilet didn’t work, the garden was unturfed and a major leak had flooded the kitchen. They gave Bovis Homes a two-week deadline to complete the work while they went on holiday but they returned to badly patched holes in the ceiling, unsealed windows and poorly fitted kitchen cabinets. Six months on, their home is still unfinished – and they have only received £500 in compensation. Miss Ramsay, 32, who has an eight-year-old son named Dylan, believes the money is not enough to make up for the disaster. She complained that the builders’ shoddy work means the saga will continue. Miss Ramsay said: ‘I just want it to end. Builders have been in and out of the house three times a week but they seem to have just messed things up even more.’ The recruitment manager added: ‘They can’t paint a wall correctly. And our second site manager has resigned. It’s a shambles. If I had the option to give my house back I would.’ Bovis, which sold 3,977 new homes last year, has said £7million has been put aside to ‘cover the cost of the required remedial work and appropriate compensation for affected customers’. The money will mostly be spent on fixing the problems. Earl Sibley, who became stand-in boss after David Ritchie quit abruptly last month, admitted that ‘the recent experiences of a number of customers fell below the high standards they rightly expected’. The scandal saw Mr Ritchie quit as chief executive after eight years in charge. Mr Sibley said: ‘I have been out and met a number of our less happy customers, sat on their sofas and apologised for what they have been through. When Sarah moved in the builders were still working on the property. Pictured: a hole in the wall of a cupboard in the kitchen and sawdust left on the floor The mum-of-one found this mess left on top of the downstairs toilet in her Bovis home There was a bad finish throughout the property, such as here on the banister The toilet didn’t work, the garden was unturfed and a major leak had flooded the kitchen ‘We have started changing things but it will take some time.We appreciate that buying a home is one of the most significant decisions that people make in their lives and we want anyone who buys a Bovis Home to be delighted with it.’ Mr Sibley, the firm’s former finance director, said: ‘Customer service standards fell significantly during 2016 and homes were completed, in particular at the year end, which fell materially short of the high standard expected.’ The trouble has inflicted damage on the group’s finances and has left shareholders nursing heavy losses. Bovis revealed yesterday that its profits fell 3 per cent last year to £154.7million – well below its expectations of up to £170million. Its shares fell 10 per cent, down 86p to 755p, wiping £115million off the firm’s value. The construction group said it would build 10 to 15 per cent fewer homes this year than last year to ‘reset the business’. Tory MP Oliver Colvile, chairman of an all-party parliamentary group on new builds, said developments are often ‘not very good’. He added: ‘There is a genuine need for more housing but we need to ensure they are going to be good quality houses rather than the sometimes frankly rubbish.’ Bovis revealed yesterday that its profits fell 3 per cent last year to £154.7million – well below its expectations of up to £170million Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:54:42.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
