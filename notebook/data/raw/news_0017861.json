Lynch and Mayhew were teammates with the Buccaneers in the mid-1990s. \nLynch has no previous front-office experience. Mayhew was G.M. of the Lions from 2008-15. \nAfter being fired during the 2015 season, Mayhew was hired last winter by the Giants to be their director of football operations/special projects. Mayhew attended law school at Georgetown after his playing career and was first hired by the Lions in 2001.
