Flipboard Sony \nWith the original Ghostbusters being a solid gold classic and last year's reboot basically turning out better than most expected, Ghostbusters II is to many fans the red-headed stepchild of the franchise. \nReleased to mixed reviews and a somewhat disappointing box office (that's what happens when you release a week before Batman!), the movie has endured an extremely divisive reaction among fans over the last three decades. \nIt is not a perfect film, and it's not even a great film, but it is a good deal better than many are prepared to give it credit for, bringing some welcome changes to the first film's formula even if it's fundamentally working from the same template. \nReally give the movie a chance and there's a lot to enjoy... 10. The Hilarious New York Satire Columbia Pictures \nAt its heart, Ghostbusters II is a love letter to New York City, and a tongue-in-cheek ode to its citizens' reputation for being hostile to outsiders and basically anyone they don't already know. \nHell, the opening scene has Dana (Sigourney Weaver) navigating a New York street as several groups of people argue around her, and of course, the mood slime is only able to flourish underneath the city because they're so aggressive and standoffish with one another. \nPeter Venkman (Bill Murray) even calls New Yorkers \"miserable a**holes\" when pleading to the Mayor (David Margulies) for assistance, causing him to reply with the immortal one-liner, \"Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's god-given right.\" \nProbably the funniest thing of all, though, is the Ghostbusters convincing the citizens to sing \"Auld Lang Syne\" to help weaken the villainous Vigo (Wilhelm von Homburg).
