( Peter Jon Shuler/KQED ) Storm Tears Through California, Half of State Under Flood, Snow Advisories By Kristen J. Bender Become a KQED sponsor \nFire crews rescued five people who were stranded in flooding at a homeless encampment along a San Jose creek on Tuesday after a series of robust storms drenched Northern California. \nIn the San Joaquin Valley, farmers used their tractors and other equipment to help shore up an endangered levee along the San Joaquin River. \nThe dramatic actions were prompted by the latest in a series of “atmospheric rivers” of moisture that have saturated the once-drought-stricken region in recent weeks. San Jose Fire Dept. on Twitter \n@SJFD handling major flooding avoid the area Senter and Phelan \nThe downpours swelled waterways to flood levels and left about half the state under flood, wind and snow advisories. \nThe storm system began to weaken Tuesday after dumping more than a half-inch of rain in the San Joaquin Valley, over an inch in San Francisco, and more than 5 inches in the mountains above Big Sur in the past 24 hours, the National Weather Service reported. \nDry weather was expected to return Wednesday. \nIn San Jose, the fire department was called to Coyote Creek amid reports of as many as 40 people being stranded at the homeless encampment. \nSan Jose broke a daily rainfall record yesterday(Feb 20). 1.87″ of rain fell, breaking the previous record of 0.98″ set in 1914! #cawx #ksjc \nThat number turned out to be inaccurate and everyone was located, fire Capt. Mitch Matlow said. \nThe conditions of the five people rescued were not immediately available. Road washed away on Mount Hamilton in Santa Clara County on Feb. 20, 2017.

Numerous mudslides have blocked the road for days at a time in recent weeks. \nThe water level kept falling at Oroville Dam , where a damaged spillway had raised major flood concerns and prompted the evacuation of 188,000 people a week ago.
