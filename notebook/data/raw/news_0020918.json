The Jaguars began to see more of their shots fall in the second as they forced turnovers during a 17-7 run. \nSt. Joseph went into halftime with 24-13 lead. \nPadua exchanged baskets with the Jaguars in the third quarter, trailing 38-28. But in the fourth, the Bruins cut the Jaguars lead down to five with the help of senior guards Alianna Conroy, Elena Rauha and a key 3-pointer by Ali Medaglia. \nWith 3:52 left and a 43-38 lead, St. Joseph Academy found the needed poise and was rewarded as Vichill knocked down the key 3-pointer. The Jaguars made free throws the rest of the way. \n“Their fight is outstanding,” Padua coach Dan Brown said about his girls. “Every game we’ve played this year they never given up. That’s a tenacity that will help us to a league and district title, hopefully.” \nConroy led all scorers with 19 points, including two 3-pointers. Rauhe finished with 12 points. \nSophomore forward Molly Neitzel’s 13 points paced St. Joseph, followed by junior Bre Coleman (12) and Vichill (12). \nWhat’s next: \nSt. Joseph will host East Tech on Friday with a 5:30 start time. Padua will play for a share of the North Coast League Blue Division title when the Bruins host No. 11 Archbishop Hoban.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:13:53.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
