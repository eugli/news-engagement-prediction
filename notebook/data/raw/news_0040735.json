Alary didn't have a scratch on him after what looked a terrible fall at Exeter on Sunday. \n\"I don't think he's a three-miler and we'll probably run him over two or two and a half. He might be one for the Ryanair but it wouldn't be ideal going there with a 'P' and 'F' from his last two runs.\" \nRoyal Vacation could carry the Bishop colours in the Ryanair, though last month's impressive Cheltenham novice handicap chase winner has the RSA Chase entry as well. \nFlyer among Ascot rivals \nShantou Flyer is set to take on Cue Card at Ascot on Saturday before bypassing Cheltenham for Aintree. \nTrainer Rebecca Curtis said: \"He'll probably run on Saturday. It's a Grade 1 and his absolute minimum trip, but if you look at ratings he's not too far off most of them apart from Cue Card. \n\"It's good prize-money –£150,000 – so we'll run him there and then keep him fresh for Aintree.\" \nCheltenham is completely sold out in all three enclosures for Gold Cup day, two weeks ahead of last year, although limited hospitality packages do remain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:04:09.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
