(CBC)\nGeorge MacLean, the UNB vice-president of academics, describes the statement from Universities Canada as unprecedented.\n\"It's a non-partisan organization and a statement like this can be seen as entering into the political arena,\" MacLean said Wednesday.\n\"But I belive that Universities Canada felt that it was necessary, not for political reasons, but because we have not hypothetical, but real effects on our students our staff and our faculty.\"\nThere are 116 students on both UNB campuses enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs whose home country is one of the seven affected by the travel ban.\nThe potential effects are wide-ranging, said MacLean, whose speciality as a researcher is in the field of foreign policy and international politics.\n\"I've been racking my brain to try to come up with an example of where one of our close allies — the United States or another country — has imposed a wide-ranging ban such as this one with such a confusing premise. It's extremely difficult to wrap our minds around the implications here.\"\n\"What we're trying to do at this stage is to account for all of those and provide the support and resources we can at the outset,\" such as emergency financial aid for anyone who gets stuck at the border, assistance from international student advisers, and counselling.\n'We cherish the opportunity to host students, faculty and staff from around the world, who use their new knowledge and unique talents to positively impact our community.\" - Eddy Campbell, UNB president Any UNB group trips to the U.S. are proceeding as scheduled, said MacLean, but based on information from the U.S. consulate, students from the seven countries in question may not be admitted to the U.S., even if they have dual citizenship, a green card or visas.\nSo UNB is urging those students to \"seriously consider whether it's in their best interest to attempt to enter the United States because they may be denied.\"\nMeanwhile, UNB president Eddy Campbell issued a letter to \"members of the UNB community, expressing his \"full support\" of the concerns raised by Universities Canada.\n\"UNB welcomes the benefits of diversity and has a long history of collaboration with international partners through welcoming international students, international development efforts, and research with an international focus,\" Campbell wrote.\n\"We cherish the opportunity to host students, faculty and staff from around the world, who use their new knowledge and unique talents to positively impact our community.\"\nWith files from Information Morning Fredericton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:42:55.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
