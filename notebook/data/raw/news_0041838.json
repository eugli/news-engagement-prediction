Pete Dugan said. \nRothschild was walking toward the Prius at about 11 a.m. when a man approached him, pointing a gun at him, Dugan said. \nThe man demanded the keys to the car and fled after Rothschild handed them over. Witnesses reported that before carjacking the mayor, the man attempted to take another car in the area. Shortly before taking Rothschild's car, the man also approached a mail carrier in the area and pointed an object at him, Dugan said. The carrier was not sure the object pointed was a gun. \nDugan said it doesn't appear Rothschild was specifically targeted. \nPolice are investigating the carjacking.
