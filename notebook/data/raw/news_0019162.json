Bruce Rauner.\n\"Governor Rauner, just like President Trump , has decided to attack those who need the most help,\" begins the letter from Democratic politician and CPS CEO Forrest Claypool. \"Most recently, Governor Rauner broke his word by blocking Chicago from receiving $215 million for our schools. ... We are writing to let you know about two of the biggest cuts that Governor Rauner has forced us to make right now.\"\nOne CPS parent who contacted WGN wrote: \"This is so inappropriate. How can he send political propaganda home?\" The letter, paid for by taxpayers, does not mention democrats who have been in control of the city and state legislature for decades.\nThat Claypool's letter doesn't acknowledge any role by Democrats is telling. They do run the city and its schools, and they have run the state for most of this century, and they arguably own all of the pension crises that are now unfolding. But even so, the merits of that argument are only tangentially relevant. This letter represents a use of taxpayer money for partisan politics that's so flagrantly illegal it's laugh-out-loud funny. Officials in Chicago have been fried for a lot less obvious violations â€” hopefully someone fries for this one.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:20:27.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
