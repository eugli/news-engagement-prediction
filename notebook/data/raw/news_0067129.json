There is a move to set up a new agency for probing it,” Mr. Singh said. \nThe Minister warned that all those possessing black money would be taken to task. \nBe it Mayawati or Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra, no one will be spared if found guilty, he said. \nThe Income Tax Department had identified 1.8 million people whose cash deposits after demonetisation did not match their taxpayer profiles and asked them to answer queries about the source of income for these cash deposits. \nThe exercise was a part of the department’s efforts to reconcile demonetisation related data at its disposal and look for instances of tax evasion. \nIn the initial phase, the department was scrutinising cash deposits above ₹5 lakh and suspicious deposits between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:26:46.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
