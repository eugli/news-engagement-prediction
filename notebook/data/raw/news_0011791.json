Robart, 69, was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004, following a distinguished 30-year career in private practice that included his selection to the American College of Trial Lawyers, an honor bestowed on less than 1 percent of lawyers. \nJudge James L. Robart, 69, was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004, following a distinguished 30-year career in private practice\nThe judge made the most high-profile ruling of his tenure Friday when he temporarily invalidated Trump's ban on travel to the US from seven primarily Muslim nations. \nWashington state sued to block the order - with support from Minnesota and major corporations including Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia - arguing that it's unconstitutional and would harm its residents, and Robart held that the state was likely correct. \nThe ruling did not sit well with the president. \n'The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,' Trump tweeted. \nThe judge (left) made the most high-profile ruling of his tenure Friday when he temporarily invalidated President Donald Trump's (right) ban on travel to the US from seven primarily Muslim nations\nThat decision led Trump to tweet on Saturday: 'The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!'\nIt's a comment unlikely to sway Robart, said those who know him. \n'Jim will give a wry smile, maybe adjust his bowtie a little bit and go back to doing his business,' said former Seattle US attorney John McKay, who worked with Robart for a decade at the law firm of Lane Powell Spears Lubersky. \n'He's a very careful judge, and he's conservative in the sense he looks at the law and tries to determine what that is, not what he wants,' McKay said. \n'He's conservative in his review of the law, but courageous in his application of it.' \nAnother former Seattle US attorney, Jenny Durkan, called Robart exacting: 'We won some in front of him and we lost some in front of him, but we knew anytime we walked into his courtroom we'd better be prepared.' \nThat was evident Friday when Robart grilled a Justice Department lawyer, asking if there had been any terrorist attacks by people from the seven counties since 9/11. Michelle Bennett said she didn't know. \nProtesters in New York attend an LGBT solidarity rally in New York to demonstrate against Trump on Saturday\n'The answer is none,' Robart said. \n'You're here arguing we have to protect from these individuals from these countries, and there's no support for that.' \nRobart, a graduate of Georgetown Law School, is an expert in patent and intellectual property law, and he issued a landmark decision - later upheld by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals - in a lawsuit between Microsoft and Motorola that provided guidance in how to calculate reasonable rates for use of another company's patents. \nHe's considered a tough sentencing judge in criminal matters, especially in cases involving white-collar defendants, and he has overseen reforms at the Seattle Police Department since 2012, when it agreed to make changes in response to Justice Department findings that its officers were too quick to use force, especially in low-level situations. \nRobart was holding a hearing in that case in summer 2015 - a time fraught with tension over violence by and against police officers around the country - when he surprised the courtroom by adopting the mantra of protesters. \nNOTABLE HIGHLIGHTS FROM JUDGE ROBART'S CAREER Judge James Robart was picked by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in 2003.\nHe was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2004.\nDuring his confirmation, Robart drew high praise from Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who cited his 'exceptional qualifications' and his work representing southeast Asian refugees. \nBefore he was named to a federal judgeship, Robart graduated from Whitman College in 1969 and then from Georgetown Law School in 1973.\nHe then joined the Seattle law firm Lane Powell Moss & Miller, where he worked for over 30 years.\nLast August, he shocked officials in his courtroom in Seattle when he declared from the bench that 'black lives matter.'\nRobart was presiding over a dispute between a Seattle police union and the city, which wanted the police department to adhere to reforms over policing, according to The Seattle Times . \n'Police shootings resulting in deaths involved 41 percent black people, despite being only 20 percent of the population living in those cities,' he said. \n'Forty-one percent of the casualties, 20 percent people of the population — black lives matter.' \n'The importance of this issue to me is best demonstrated by the news,' he said, shaking his head and sighing heavily. \n'According to FBI statistics, police shootings resulting in death involve 41 percent black people, despite being only 20 percent of the population living in those cities. Forty-one percent of the casualties, 20 percent of the population: Black lives matter.' \nWatch federal judge James Robart's #BlackLivesMatter declaration, plus his challenge to Seattle's police union. pic.twitter.com/UDgQl2XCiu \n— Ansel Herz (@Ansel) August 23, 2016 Robart donated to the state Republican party and to GOP candidates before becoming a judge, but was picked for the bench with the help of a bipartisan selection panel. \nHe helped lead his law firm's efforts to provide free legal services to those who couldn't afford them, and he served as president of Seattle Children's Home, which offers mental health services and special education for at-risk children. \nAnd as US Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., noted during his confirmation hearing, he and his wife had fostered six children themselves. \nRobart drew high praise from Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who cited his 'exceptional qualifications' and his work representing southeast Asian refugees. \n'Working with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law,' Robart said then. \n'If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by the Senate, I will take that experience to the courtroom with me, recognize that you need to treat everyone with dignity and with respect, and to engage them so that when they leave the courtroom they feel like they had a fair trial and that they were treated as a participant in the system.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:48:03.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
