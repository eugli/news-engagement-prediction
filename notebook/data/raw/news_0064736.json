Hannah Alexander Hannah Alexander found a dead mouse in her bag of Iceland shopping \nBut when the bulk order was delivered, five-year-old son Malachi made the shocking discovery. \nSpeaking to The Sun Online, the mum-of-two said: “We’d unpacked most of the bag when my little boy put his hand in and said ‘mum, there’s a mouse in there’. \n“I thought he was joking. \n“It’s surreal. It was wedged between my bananas and cheese. I couldn’t believe there was a mouse in my house.” \nSingle-mum Hannah, who also has a 15-year-old daughter Madison, claims that she was in the same north London store eight months ago when she saw another mouse running up and down an aisle and filmed it on her mobile phone.

My shopping was contaminated so how many other people’s was too? Hannah Alexander 2 She had ordered the food online but when it arrived her son found it wedged in next to the cheese \n“It was quite a long time before they came to pick it up. I kept having visions of the mouse thawing out and running around the room.” \nA spokeswoman for Iceland said: “We take all complaints extremely seriously. We can confirm that Ms Alexander has been in touch with the store regarding a mouse in her home delivery shopping and our Customer Care team is contacting her about this matter. \n“We are conducting a full investigation and have arranged for Ms Alexander to receive a full refund as a gesture of goodwill.” \nWe pay for your stories!
