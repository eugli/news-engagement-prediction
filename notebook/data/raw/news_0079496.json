By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Sunday, February 26, 2017 - 11:00 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Harbhajan Singh's comments comments of labeling the current Australian team as the worst ever came back to haunt him after Steve Smith's men secured an influential 333-run victory over Virat Kohli and Co. in Pune on Saturday. \nAhead of the series kick-off, Bhajji had predicted India to secure a 3-0 series win , that too if the Aussies play well, else a 4-0 whitewash. \n\"If Australia play well, India will win 3-0. That is if Australia play well,\" he told The New Daily. \"Otherwise, 4-0.\" \nHe also said apart from David Warner and Smith, the other Australian batters won`t be able to play the game as they play in Australian conditions. \nCalling this Australian side as the worst ever he has seen, the Turbanator added, \"I have played against some of the best Australian sides. In my opinion, looking at the composition, this is the weakest Australian side to tour India. I don't think this team has the wherewithal to cope with a quality Indian side in the Indian conditions. \n​ \"That Australian team in the past had so much will and belief. I don`t think this team has the belief to win in these conditions,\" he said. \nBut after the tourists ended India's 19-match unbeaten streak, Bhajji tweeted, Take a bow @stevesmith49 that's an outstanding inn on that pitch actually no pitch..where it looks difficult to play every ball..IndvsAus \n— Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) February 25, 2017 \n\"Take a bow @stevesmith49 that's an outstanding inn on that pitch actually no pitch..where it looks difficult to play every ball..IndvsAus,\" Harbhajan was full of praise for Steve Smith.
