Key points: Legislation combining childcare changes to be introduced to Parliament next month Greens and Labor oppose the proposal, calling it \"blackmail\" Nick Xenophon's party holds key Senate seats that may decide the vote \nThe Government wants to boost childcare payments to most families but has consistently argued the extra funding must be paid for by cuts to family tax benefits. \nWhen Parliament resumes this month, the Government will formalise that by combining the two elements into one piece of legislation. \nThe Prime Minister has urged the Senate to support the bill. \n\"We keenly understand how many families are just managing right now,\" Mr Turnbull told the National Press Club. \n\"So this year we'll be asking the Senate to support our childcare reforms, they will deliver the highest rate of subsidy to those who most need it. \n\"A family on $60,000 a year will pay around $15 a day per child for care.\" \nBut the Greens and Labor have already rejected the proposal. \nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said it was another attack on families who are already doing it tough. \n\"To link the much-needed injection of money into child care to cuts to family tax benefit â€¦ is really holding the Parliament and the Senate to ransom,\" she said. \n\"Malcolm Turnbull is trying to blackmail the Parliament here. He is saying to the Senate, 'I'll give you some extra money for child care if you let me cut family tax benefits'.\" \nLabor's Early Childhood spokeswoman Kate Ellis echoed the criticism. \n\"We don't believe that the only way you can reform Australia's childcare system is by robbing the money out of some families' pockets to put it in the pockets of others,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:36:14.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
