Today, a listing for another phone, codenamed Sony Pikachu, has appeared on graphics benchmarking utility GFXBench's website, and it appears to be one of the company's upcoming midrangers. The device has been rumored for some tome now, appearing under several names, including G3112 and Hinoki. The Pikachu moniker is a new one, but its reported specs fit previous leaks, giving this listing some credibility. The phone is said to have a 5 inch, 720p display, 3 GB of RAM, and runs on the octa-core MediaTek Helio P20 SoC, putting it firmly in the mid range. The back camera is listed as 21 MP, which sounds pretty good, though real-life image quality remains to be seen. Other phones to be shown at the company's Mobile World Congress show include another mid-to-high-end device, codenamed BlancBright, along with two other midrangers and possibly the successor to the Xperia Z5 Premium , though that last one may have been delayed.
