The app uses Samsung’s Knox security features to lock the files within, only making them accessible through a passcode or biometric security. The feature originally launched on the Galaxy Note 7, and has since made its way to the international Galaxy A series, but today’s launch marks the return of Secure Folder’s availability in the US.\nThe only caveat is that you’ll need to be running Android 7.0 Nougat to use Secure Folder, which may or may not be available depending on your carrier of choice. Assuming you’ve got that set, Secure Folder is available now to download from Galaxy Apps.", "external_links": ["https://news.samsung.com/global/for-your-eyes-only-secure-folder-now-available-for-galaxy-s7-galaxy-s7-edge", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/71Zk2b7IaLo?wmode=transparent&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1"], "published": "2017-02-24T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:24:43.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
