The win pairs well with UCLA’s non-conference conquest at Kentucky from earlier in the season. This means -- barring a near-impossible implosion -- the Bruins will be, at worst, a No. 3 seed on Selection Sunday. \nIf UCLA runs the table? Then why not keep the No. 1 seed in discussion. Lonzo Ball and Co. improved to 26-3 with the win, and here’s another aftershock: Oregon might win the Pac-12 because of this. Arizona was 15-1 in the league heading into Saturday, but Oregon got out of a road game against Stanford with a two-point margin. \nSo now Oregon and Arizona are tied with two losses (UCLA has three), and Oregon owns the tiebreaker because the teams only met once (it was at Oregon) and the Ducks won handily. \nArizona’s chance at overtime fell short when Kadeem Allen’s 3 went long in the final seconds. \nThis story will update shortly.
