WAYS TO SAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR INCREASED PRICES   Wed, 22/02/2017 - 10:50am \nDear A.S.S. Editor \nIndranee Rajah said Singaporeans have to bite the bullet with all the increase in prices, and with the Budget essentially helping us by paying off what they actually increased just before Budget announcements. The govt will say the increases are minimal, and is a must if we are to ensure Singapore will function well. But is it really minimal? Advertisement \nThe electricity tariff have risen in recent months by an average of 5.7%. Based on this, the bill for families living in four room HDB flats will increase by about $4.30. Add 12 months to this calculations, and you get $51.60. That is just the increase in tariffs, not the whole cost. What about water bill? 30% increase by July, so an average monthly water bill of $150 will cost $195 in July. An increase of $45. Multiply that for the next 6 months till end of the year, and the increase will be $270. \nAnd finally, if, like most of us, stay in a PAP Town Council wards, S&CC will increase from June, and the increase will range from $0.50 to $9 per month. If we take the average, $4.50, this will mean an increase of $31.50 till end of the year. So, from now till end of the year, the increases total up to $51.60 + $270 + $31.50 = $353.10, which brings it to roughly about $30 extra to pay to the Govt every month. \nThere you go! $30 every month only. So, to bite the bullet, maybe skip your lunches, you can save the $30 and actually even have spare change! And, you can start on your diet also. Win-win situation, right? \nAbby A \nA.S.S.
