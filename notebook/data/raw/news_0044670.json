(Photo: EPA) 10 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIf a recent influx of immigrants to Sweden has triggered a crime wave there, it's news to officials of the Scandinavian country. But that hasn't stopped President Trump from making — and repeating — the claim. \nSwedish government data show overall crime rates down slightly in 2015 and 2016, after the nation of 10 million admitted 163,000 asylum seekers, more than any other European country as a share of its population. \nTrump first took aim at Sweden during a rally in Florida on Saturday, when he said the country \"took in large numbers\" of immigrants and was \"having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nThe White House said his comments were based on a Fox News report on Stockholm Syndrome , a 10-minute film by Ami Horowitz that depicts Sweden as a place where rape and violence have exploded since the arrival of all the immigrants in 2015. In an interview, Horowitz said, \"The government has gone out of its way to try to cover up some of these problems.\" \nSwedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and other government officials raised a fuss about the claim, but Trump hasn't backed down. \"Give the public a break,\" he tweeted Monday. \"The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!\" \nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority and Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå), a federal research center at the Ministry of Justice told USA TODAY there is no crime data to back up Trump's allegations. Alleged gang rape shown on Facebook shocks Sweden \nRecent data published by Brå found that from 2015 to 2016, overall crime rates decreased slightly. There was a 13% increase of reported rapes in 2016 over 2015, but the number was lower than in 2014 and about the same as in 2011. \nHorowitz disputed that, telling Fox on Monday that \"between 2012 and 2016 the murder rate is up almost 70%\" and \"rape between 2007 and 2015 is up a similar number, almost 70%. These are their (Brå) statistics, not my statistics.\" \nHorowitz told USA TODAY that he admires the Swedes for their \"generous, open-door policy toward refugees. I think it's wonderful. It's a true humanitarian gesture. But you have to be real about what the social costs are to your country and they just refuse to acknowledge it.\" \nThe Swedish agency countered that Horowitz used misleading or incorrect figures to make his argument. Brå said he singled out 2012, when the murder rate hit a 14-year low, as a point of comparison. In fact, the agency said that the murder rate in Sweden has been about the same for the last 15 years, about 90 annually. Reported rapes, Brå said, increased 24.6% between 2007 and 2015. \nWhile official crime data may not back up Trump's and Horowitz' claims, public perceptions and anecdotal reports provide some support. A Pew Research study from earlier this year found that 46% of Swedes believe refugees are more to blame for crime than other groups. \nIn addition, Peter Springare, a Swedish policeman recently posted complaints on Facebook that migrants were overwhelming Sweden's social welfare state. He also alleged that during a five-day period this month, he worked on five rapes, three assaults, an attempted murder, blackmail and violence against police — and all the suspects were foreign-born. \n\"Countries which represent all of the week's crimes: Iraq, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown country, unknown country, Sweden,\" Springare said in the Feb. 3 post. He now is the subject of an internal police investigation into discrimination. \nJerzy Sarnecki, a criminologist at the University of Stockholm, said foreign-born residents are twice as likely to be registered for a crime as native Swedes. He added that other factors beyond place of birth are at play, such as education level and poverty, and that similar trends occur in European countries that have not taken in a lot of immigrants in recent years. \n\"In criminology, we never look at one- or two-year periods to make conclusions. You have to look at 10 years, 20 years, 30 years,\" he said.
