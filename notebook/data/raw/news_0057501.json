Fiscal depute Vicki Bell said he even told the Dundee Registrar he was having problems setting up the 'home birthing pool' in his living room. But in May 2015 in Aberdeen he registered two children's names and the following day at the same office he attempted to buy a copy of a marriage certificate for his brother Lockhart Brown, claiming his name was Luke Brown. The registrar recognised him and heard him provide this different name. Miss Bell said: 'Four of the names used as claimants were traced and they advised they didn't make the claims. 'They had all, however, applied for the same job for front of house staff at a four star hotel in Glasgow advertised on Gumtree on March 2015. McWhirter, who lived at this property in Edinburgh, was only caught when he was recognised by staff at the registry office in Aberdeen 'The ad required a CV and a national insurance number. 'It transpired their details had been used to fraudulently claimed tax credits. 'It was then discovered that 14 claims for tax credits had been made by persons residing in Perth Road, Dundee, and in Campbeltown at flats related to the accused's company. 'In total the accused registered 22 false births for 26 children. 'During one he referred to problems with a home birthing pool and said his wife was a paediatric doctor. 'When he attended at Edinburgh registrars in June 2015 to register a birth he was seen using a silver or grey BMW car with a private plate. 'The motor car referred to led police to an address in Perth Road, Dundee, where the former co-accused opened the door. 'He provided full admissions stating he was in severe financial difficulty and needed money. McWhirter, pictured, got identity details from others by encouraging them to send in applications for fake jobs, before using the information to register the fake home births 'He stated he considered the registration system in Scotland to be archaic and easy to create false registrations. 'His purpose had been to claim benefits pertaining to the child. 'During the search a large quantity of bank cards, computer equipment and approximately 50 birth certificates from the Republic of Ireland and documentation relating to claiming benefits were seized.' McWhirter pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge of fraud committed between June 1, 2014 and October 22, 2015 at addresses across Scotland. Miss Adya originally appeared in court alongside McWhirter last year but had the charges against her dropped. McWhirter's solicitor John McLeod told the court his client was pleading guilty to the offence and was under no illusion that imprisonment was likely to be 'at the top of the list'. Sheriff Carmichael granted bail and called for social work background reports. Sentence was deferred until March 21.
