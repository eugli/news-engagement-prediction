King, who supported Trump during the election, said people from the intelligence agencies going to the media about members of the Trump campaign being involved in potentially illegal activity could harm Americans. \"We're at great risks if we have these kinds of moles with this low level of integrity that are leaking information out to move their political agenda,\" he said. \"It's unpatriotic and it's an act that undermines our American security.\" King accused those leaking information as being motivated by a lack of support for Trump opposed to concerns that those associated with the President jeopardized national security. \"There are opinions in the intelligence community that are the direct enemies of Donald Trump that don't want him to succeed,\" he said. \"I think what is most important here is the leaks coming out of the intelligence community that appear to be designed to politically assassinate members of the Trump Administration and at least weaken the Trump Administration.\" Retired Lt.
