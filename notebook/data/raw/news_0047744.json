Elor Azaria was embraced by his mother before receiving his sentence. Credit: APTN \nAn Israeli soldier who was caught on video shooting dead a wounded Palestinian attacker has been sentenced to 18 months in jail. \nThe jail term, which nominally ends one of the most divisive cases in Israel's history, was half that requested by prosecutors for the manslaughter that Sergeant Elor Azaria was found guilty of last month at a military court. \nProsecutors had asked for three to five years, well below the top punishment of 20 years, noting the victim had only minutes earlier carried out an attack. The Israeli soldier's sentence comes after one of the most divisive cases in Israel's history. Credit: APTN \nSgt Azaria, then 19, killed the incapacitated Abdul Fatah al-Sharif, 21, after a knife attack in the occupied West Bank last March. \nHe shot him in the head as he lay on the ground after the attack in the old city of Hebron in which an Israeli soldier was stabbed and another Palestinian attacker killed. \nThe defendant said he thought al-Sharif might be wearing an explosive vest, but prosecutors said he was motivated by revenge. Warning: This video contains images that some may find distressing Play video \nFootage of the shooting was widely shared on social media and led to the Israeli army being accused by Palestinian officials of extra-judicial killing. \nThe killed attacker's father, Yusri al-Sharif, told ITV News Correspondent Geraint Vincent in April last year that his son's death was criminal. Play video \nIsraeli Defence Force officials previously criticised Azaria's conduct, though large segments of the Israeli public, along with some members of the ruling coalition government, rallied behind him. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called for the soldier to be cleared, writing on Facebook: \"I support giving Elor Azaria a pardon.\" \nAzaria's lawyers had said after the verdict last month they intended to appeal his conviction. \nIt was not immediately clear if they would still pursue it after a sentence described by Israeli media commentators as lenient. \nThe court said Azaria had not expressed regret for his crime but it noted that his army record was unblemished up until the shooting and said his arrest had caused his family deep distress.
