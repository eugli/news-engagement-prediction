All I have to show for 20 years of work is a medal. What does that mean?'. \n\"Over time, I guess it got a bit deeper than that, 'Whose lives am I enriching by doing what I'm doing? What am I offering here as a person? Who's benefiting from me being here?'. \n\"When it got to that level, I knew I needed to get help. From that point, it just unravelled a bit.\" \nAfter a series of shoulder injuries, Jamieson missed out on a medal at the 2013 World Championships. \nOvertraining in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games led to his heart being restarted and he was beaten by compatriot Ross Murdoch in his favoured event in Glasgow. \nHe failed to qualify for the World Championships in 2015 and missed out on selection for the 2016 Rio Olympics. \n\"My body just can't take the intensity any more,\" Jamieson told BBC Sport in April.
