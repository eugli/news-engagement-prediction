FOX was wise in scheduling the back-to-back “Simpsons”/”Family Guy” hours. I was going to give CBS a shout out for pulling “Doubt” from the schedule after two episodes, but I have to give you my take on the finish to the Oscars last night. I use the word “finish” because that ending came right out of the professional wrestling playbook. It was a “Dusty finish.” If you read this column I’m sure you’ve figured out that I am a big fan of professional wrestling since it usually appears on my “schedule” at the bottom. I won’t go into all the reasons why, but as the Masked Wife and I watched the f-up that ended the show I immediately said to myself (and tweeted out) Holy s**t that was a Dusty finish. First of all, the Dusty finish was the creation of Dusty Rhodes, who sadly left us recently. Dusty is on my pro wrestling Mount Rushmore. He was a bleached-blond, overweight wrestler who, along with Ric Flair, was king of the wrestling promo. Dusty could talk — just go to YouTube. Dusty was also a booker, which meant he controlled the storytelling for whatever territory he was wrestling in. So here it is: In a championship match where the heel (bad guy) has the belt, the babyface (good guy) will win the match and the crowd will go wild celebrating the victory. Suddenly the referee or some official from the territory will come to the ring and take the belt away from the babyface victor, claiming the win was tainted in some way. This will generally set up a rematch that will guarantee another big crowd. Remember when Steve Harvey flubbed the Miss Universe winner? The following year he returned as host and the ratings went up. I’m certain the Oscars will figure out a way to exploit that Dusty finish next year. Oh, and the more deserving picture won. The weekend’s schedule:–“Legion” (FX screener, episode 4) One of the more bizarre hours on TV you will ever see.–“Riverdale” (CW, L+SD)–“Modern Family” (ABC, L+1)–“Diners, Drive-ins & Dives” (Food Network, L+2)–“New Japan Pro Wrestling” (AXS, L+2)–“Legion” (FX screener, episode 5) Noah Hawley is developing a case of aaronsorkinitis.– Oscars (ABC, live) One of the few advantages of living on the west coast.
