Photograph: Maja Hitij/Bongarts/Getty Images   22.13   22.20 GMT \nAtlético Madrid won 4-2 at Bayer Leverkusen in a topsy-turvy game to take a firm grip on their Champions League round-of-16 tie. \nTwo lethal counterattacks in the opening 25 minutes put the 2014 and 2016 finalists in control, with Saúl Ñíguez and Antoine Griezmann on target, and give them the edge for a quarter-final spot for the ninth time. Bayer Leverkusen v Atlético Madrid: Champions League last 16, first leg – as it happened Read more \nLeverkusen, who struggled to contain the hard-charging Spaniards for more than an hour, cut the deficit before Atlético’s Kévin Gameiro scored with a spot‑kick and Stefan Savic’s own goal set up a nervous finale. \nFernando Torres ended any speculation with his goal in the 87th minute as the Germans endured their first home defeat in Europe after a 10-match unbeaten run. \nThey are at risk of missing out on the last eight for the fifth time with Atlético taking revenge for a 1-0 defeat at the same stage last season. \nThe Bundesliga club, finalists in 2002 before the introduction of the round of 16, have never gone past this stage on four previous attempts. \nThey were supposed to be dangerous on the break but it was Atlético who came close early on with the goalkeeper Bernd Leno stopping a Griezmann effort and Wendell seeing his subsequent clearance bounce off his keeper’s crossbar. \nÑíguez did better in the 17th minute, charging down the right and curling his shot past Leno after it took a slight deflection off Aleksandar Dragovic.

But their hopes were short-lived as Dragovic capped his nightmarish performance by giving away a penalty after bringing down Gameiro. \nSavic’s own goal put Leverkusen back in the game but despite constant pressure they failed to carve out an equaliser before substitute Torres finished them off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:26:53.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
