(Photo: Screengrab) Hyderabad: While Virat Kohli and his record-breaking double hundred has managed to steal all the limelight on the first two days of the one-off India versus Bangladesh Test, a rather controversial decision on day three had grabbed quite a few eyeballs.\nRight after the lunch-break, Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim survived a close run-out call. Shakib Al Hasanâ€™s drove down to mid-off and bolted for a quick single. Ravindra Jadeja, the fielder at mid-off, threw it straight to keeper Wriddhiman Saha who collected the ball cleanly before whipping off the bails.\nRahim dived into the crease and it looked liked he had made it quite comfortably in real time. However, leg umpire Joel Wilson decided to go upstairs to the third umpire and the replays showed that his bat was not touching the ground despite being way inside the crease.\nSlow motion replays showed that the shoulder of the bat was on the line when the bails came off. The third umpire Chris Gaffaney however decided to rule in favour of the batsman surprising the Indian cricketers, fans and also the on-air commentators.\nRahim has made good on his survival and is batting on 81 having put together a couple of good partnerships with Shakib Al Hasan and Mehedi Hasan.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIndianCricketTeam%2Fposts%2F1375752735779749&width=500"], "published": "2017-02-12T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:23:21.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
