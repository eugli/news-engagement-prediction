The new measure could free dozens of officials jailed for abuse of power and halt current corruption-related investigations, including the trial of Social Democratic Party leader Liviu Dragnea . Grindeanu is also a member of Dragnea’s party, known as the PSD.

The PSD says the decree is necessary to reduce overcrowding in prisons. \nThousands of Romanians disagree. On Wednesday, at least 150,000 protestors filled Bucharest’s Victory Square, chanting “Resign!” and “Thieves!” Police fired tear gas and arrested about 20 demonstrators. Some people threw bottles and firecrackers, and five people were hospitalized for injuries.

Romania joined the European Union just a decade ago. \n“The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” he said. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images Romanian riot police stand guard as people demonstrate against decriminalizing corruption in Bucharest, Romania, on Feb. 1, 2017. \nIn an unprecedented joint statement, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States also expressed their “ profound concern ” and called on the Romanian government to repeal its decree. \n“This act, in contravention to the collective wisdom of the entire judicial and rule of law community ... can only undermine Romania’s standing in the international community and risks damaging partnerships that are based on common values, inherent in the guiding principles of the EU and NATO,” the statement warned. “We hope the Government of Romania will reverse this unhelpful course.” Inquam Photos/Reuters Romanian police charge at protesters in Bucharest, Romania, on Feb. 1, 2017.
