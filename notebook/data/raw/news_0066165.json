(Sam Greenwood/Getty Images) THE OVERVIEW \nJustin Thomas figures he has a 20-minute commute this week from his home in Jupiter, Florida to PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens. \n“25 minutes if there’s traffic,” he noted. \nThomas is one of several players at this week’s The Honda Classic who’ll be able to return home each night instead of heading for their hotel rooms or rental houses. The area has become a hotbed for TOUR pros looking for first-rate facilities, consistently good weather, and a chance to practice against each other in order to fine-tune their games. \nThomas was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, but after turning pro, he felt the urge to move to a warmer climate for more practice days. Texas was too far away. After his first visit to South Florida to check out the area, he made the decision to move. \n“I wanted to go where a lot of people were, just in terms of having a lot of people to play with, a lot of people to practice with and travel with,” Thomas said. “… Feels like about everyone and their brother is down here.” \nAnother player “down here” is Daniel Berger, who two years ago lost in a playoff at PGA National to Padraig Harrington. Berger is a local, having grown up in South Florida (Brooks Koepka is also from the area). While he played the Champion course at PGA National quite a bit during his amateur days, Berger doesn’t get a chance to play it much now outside of this week. \nWhile he thinks he has a small advantage over the rest of the field, Berger thinks form – not course knowledge -- is the most important factor to success \n“I think most guys would take current play over if they like the course or not,” Berger said. “I think if you’re playing good, you’re going to play well on any course.” \nEven so, there’s a certain comfort level in being able to play a tournament near your home. Perhaps too comfortable at times. \n“I got in my car in shorts today and got halfway to the course, and I forgot that it was The Honda Classic week,” Berger said. “I mean, I remembered it was The Honda Classic week, but I was home for two weeks and I never wear pants. So I was just thinking it was like a regular day at the golf course.” THREE PLAYERS TO PONDER \nAdam Scott Won here last year despite a quadruple bogey in the third round. Will try to avoid pressing his luck this year. Rickie Fowler Making just his fourth TOUR start of the season, Fowler – another Jupiter resident -- was the 36-hole leader at PGA National last year. Danny Willett The reigning Masters champ is making his first start in the U.S. since last season’s PGA Championship. THE FLYOVER \nA closer look at one of golf’s most famous – and toughest -- three-hole stretches, the Bear Trap . The 179-yard par-3 15th played to a stroke average of 3.200 last year; the 434-yard par-4 16th was at 4.182 and the 190-yard par-3 17th was at 3.096. Cumulatively, that’s nearly a half-stroke over par. Flyovers PGA National - 15th, 16th and 17th holes THE LANDING ZONE \nThe Bear Trap gets the notoriety, but the most difficult hole at PGA National last season was the hole right in front, the 465-yard par-4 14th. It played to a stroke average of 0.490, with more double bogeys (31) and birdies (25) recorded at the hole. Here is where all tee shots landed last year. WEATHER CHECK \nAfter two weeks of battling weather conditions in California, the forecast for this week’s Honda Classic should give players a break – and should prevent the kind of wide variance between the morning and afternoon draws that existed last week at the Genesis Open. \nTEMPS: Should be in the low 70s each day. \nRAIN: Just a 20 percent chance in the first two rounds. Sunday’s final round looks to be the clearest day. \nWINDS: Might be felt on Sunday when the winds pick up to 15 mph, but should have little impact in the first three rounds. \nFor the latest weather news from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, check out PGATOUR.COM’s Weather Hub . SOUND CHECK \n“I think I start thinking about it the night before for sure. You're never quite comfortable on this golf course until you're through the Bear Trap” – Padraig Harrington ODDS AND ENDS \n1. POULTER’S STATUS. This week, Englishman Ian Poulter is making his fourth start of the season – and first in the 2017 calendar year. Poulter, playing on a major medical exemption, has 10 events this year to earn 218 FedExCup points or $347,634 to keep him exempt for the rest of the season. Right now, he has 64 points and $127,333. “Obviously I need to make a push and lock things up and then continue the back half of this year as we have done in the past,” Poulter said. \n2. HARRINGTON’S INJURY. A trapped nerve in his neck has slowed down Padraig Harrington’s clubhead speed by roughly 5 mph, and that’s impacting his distance off the tee. At last week’s Genesis Open, he averaged 265.8 yards, while winner Dustin Johnson averaged 315.3 to lead the field in that category. “40 or 30 might be acceptable, but 50 is a lot to give up,” said Harrington, the two-time Honda Classic champ who is contemplating surgery that may keep him out 12 weeks. \n3. PIETERS’ ILLNESS. Belgian Thomas Pieters is making his second consecutive TOUR start, having finished tied for second last week at Riviera despite battling a flu. He said this week he’s only at about 60 percent, and is still working through ear and throat infections. “You don’t want to shake my hand,” he said. \n4. QUAD WINNERS. Just four players since 1983 have won a TOUR event despite suffering a quadruple bogey: Adam Scott at last year’s Honda Classic; Phil Mickelson at the 2009 TOUR Championship; David Toms at the 2003 Wells Fargo Championship and David Graham at the 1983 Shell Houston Open.
