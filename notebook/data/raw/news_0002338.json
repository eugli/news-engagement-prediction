'We are concerned about one incident of alleged product tampering involving our hollow milk chocolate Easter bunny foil figure, which has been found to contain a small battery inside. 'This follows an incident at Christmas when two similar products were targeted and contaminated. The same chain ordered a recall of hollow chocolate Santa figures just before Christmas following two similar incidents 'As a precaution, we have begun a UK-wide product recall and have withdrawn the product from sale. 'Customers with one of these products should not eat it but take the product back to store for a full refund.' Similar attempts to contaminate food in the past have been linked to criminals trying to extort money from brands or supermarkets. One other possibility is an attempt at revenge by a disgruntled employee or customer. London's Great Ormond Street Hospital has seen a big increase in cases linked to children swallowing batteries in the past year. It is now seeing one child a week. Surgeon Kate Cross said: 'Button batteries should be treated like poison and kept out of reach of children.' Miss Cross, consultant neonatal and paediatric surgeon, said: 'If the battery gets enveloped in the mucosa of the oesophagus it creates an electrical circuit and the battery starts to function, releasing an alkali which is like caustic soda, which can erode through the wall to the windpipe. 'If the battery is facing a different way it can burn into the aorta, a major blood vessel, and there have been cases in Britain where the child has bled to death.' Last October, an inquest heard two year old Francesca Asan, from Basingstoke, died after swallowing a button battery. It appears that the battery had been lodged in her throat for a week where it corroded and caused a 'catastrophic' bleed. SUPERMARKET SABOTAGE The suspected tampering of Co-op chocolates is not the first attempt to sabotage supermarket food. Former tax inspector Philip McHugh waged a £1million blackmail and bomb hoax plot against Tesco in 2007 in which he threatened to poison products with caustic soda. The chain was forced to evacuate 14 stores in one day following his threats, costing the chain £1.4million in lost business. McHugh was jailed for six years in 2008. In 2005, shards of glass and sewing needles were found in loaves of Kingsmill bread from a Kent bakery, sparking a police inquiry. The potentially deadly objects were traced back to an Allied Bakeries factory in Orpington after complaints by five customers. And painkillers were found in Tesco’s own-brand chocolate ice cream cones in November 2013 leading to a mass recall and an ‘urgent investigation’. Pills were found in chocolate and nut cones distributed by R&R Ice Cream, which also supplies Nestlé, Ribena and Thorntons. The little girl's father took her to the doctor twice because she was unwell however the GP thought it was a bug or food poisoning. In April 2015, a three-year-old girl from Northern Ireland was left with permanent damage to her throat after she swallowed a watch battery. The battery became stuck in her food pipe and she began being sick and refusing food. It was not until five days later that an X-ray showed she had swallowed a battery, by which time it had burned a hole through her oesophagus and windpipe. She subsequently spent nine months at Great Ormond Street receiving specialist treatment and still needs to visit every few weeks.
