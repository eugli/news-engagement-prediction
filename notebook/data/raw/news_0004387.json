They just think, 'suddenly my playmate's gone'.\" \nDr Cormack said it was important families made time to play with their pets every day, even when everyone is busy. \n\"Continue to interact; don't say, 'OK, school's started, there's so many things happening, you can't play with them.' \n\"You can. Sneak a walk in before school; do a walk after school.\" \nDr Cormack said making time to walk the dog or play with the cat was not just good for the animal. \n\"It's a lovely time for [the kids] to turn off from school,\" she said. \n\"It's a time for them to break away and think of nothing else other than the interaction, so it can be a really good de-stress.\" Keep your pet occupied \nA bored, stressed or lonely pet can often become a destructive pet, Dr Cormack warned. \n\"A cat that [when you come home] says, 'Hey, I just shredded everything because I missed you' — is it revenge or is it actually stress? \n\"Poor cats get blamed for so many things and I'm saying no, they're innocent, they're distressed.\" \nDr Cormack said one way to keep pets occupied when families leave in the morning was to make feeding time more of a challenge. \nDepending on the pet, you could hide some of their food in the garden, or use boxes or toys in the house to hide treats, giving the animal something to do when everyone walks out the front door.

(ABC Southern Qld: Peter Gunders) \nFor some dogs, a good way to keep them occupied was to give them a sandpit to dig in. \n\"That way you're also trying to direct that digging into an area where it's controllable,\" Dr Cormack said. \nIf dogs are left inside on their own, Dr Cormack said it was vital to put things like leftovers from breakfast and the washing away. \n\"If your pet has access to inside, they may get to it,\" she said. \n\"You don't want to come home saying, 'Where's that other sock?' and I don't want to see that sock caught in that animal's intestine.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:57:18.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
