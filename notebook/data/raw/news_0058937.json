She was alerted that her comment on homosexuality was removed because \"it doesn't follow the Facebook Community Standards.\" \n\"Someone had commented underneath one of my videos and were commenting under the thread and said something about how Old Testament law prohibits the eating of pork â€” one of the homosexuals' favorite arguments to make. I responded with just scriptural commentary and that is considered 'hate speech' by Facebook,\" Johnston explained. \"It was just very intellectual and it was just a commentary on what the Bible says. There was no name calling or anything like that.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:38:25.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
