(File | PTI) \nCHENNAI: Indian badminton pairs have been thriving of late. While they have not been as consistent as singles exponents in the past, the signs of a healthy upswing are all there. With the inaugural Asia Mixed Team Championship on the horizon, the onus will be on doubles stars to push the Indian challenge. When the teams were named initially, PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal were part of it. However, the accomplished duo has pulled out to leave a massive hole in the side. Youngsters like Tanvi Lad and Rituparna Das, who has beaten Sindhu in the past, will get a welcome chance to prove their mettle. In men’s singles, HS Prannoy and in-form Sameer Verma will be seen in action. Among the doubles stars are Syed Modi champs Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy, Olympians B Sumeeth Reddy and Manu Attri as well as the experienced Ashwini Ponnappa and Sikki, who will look to build on their promising partnership. “We asked them (Saina and Sindhu), but they wanted to take rest ahead of bigger tournaments. This will be a good exposure trip for the younger girls, who are also coming up really well,” Akhilesh Das Gupta, BAI president, said. One of the seniormost members of the team, HS Prannoy is looking forward to the challenge, scheduled to be held in Vietnam from February 14 to 19. “It’s going to be tough for us given that Saina and Sindhu are not there to give that lift in the women’s singles. “If Sameer and myself can step up in the men’s singles along with the doubles players in the fray, we should be in a good position.” India have been drawn alongside Korea (seeded 2) and Singapore in Group D. “Korea should be a tough test. They have excellent players in all departments, especially in doubles,” the World No 24 assessed. Luck has evaded Prannoy in recent times. But he is determined to rediscover his form. “The opportunity to play for the country is always great. I’m looking to notch up good wins and get that confidence back ahead of future tournaments like All England.” Buoyant after winning the Syed Modi GP Gold, Sameer is keen to maintain his rich vein of form. “It will be highly challenging but we do have a good team. I have been doing fairly well. In the past, I have struggled to get results but I did manage to pick up those odd big wins which helped me believe I can compete at the highest level,” Sameer said. Sumeeth is motivated after seeing a rise in the number of promising shuttlers in the doubles pool. “In the past, it would be just a few players. Manu and myself would face four/five shuttlers during training because there were no pairs to match our level of play. But now, there are more. It is a very healthy environment and we learn from each other.” With a hectic calendar, time is a luxury. Sumeeth admitted that they haven’t had much time to prepare as a unit but that has not stopped them from dreaming big. A total of 13 teams will contend for the continental prize. anmol@newindianexpress.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:32:30.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
