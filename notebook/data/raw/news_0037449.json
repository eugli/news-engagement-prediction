REUTERS/Daniel Becerril \nHAVANA Cuba said on Friday the United States had deported 117 migrants back to the island nation since ending its policy granting automatic residency to almost every Cuban who reached U.S. soil as part of the normalization of relations. \nThose deported included two people who were returned on Friday on the first flight chartered specifically for the deportation of Cuban migrants since the policy shift, Cuba's ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma wrote. The earlier deportees were taken back on commercial planes or boat. \nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama repealed the special immigration policy for Cubans days before turning the White House over to Donald Trump. \nCuban authorities had long sought its end, arguing that the promise of U.S. residency was fuelling people-trafficking and encouraging dangerous journeys. \nThe move however dashed the hopes of many who had been hoping to fulfill their American Dream and left hundreds of Cubans seeking a new life stranded halfway on their journey. \nSince the policy shift, more than 680 Cuban \"irregular migrants\" have been deported in total from various countries, Granma wrote, including more than 400 from Mexico, 117 from the Bahamas and 39 from the Cayman Islands. \n(Reporting by Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta; Editing by Michael Perry) Next In World News Pakistan says kills 100 'terrorists' after suicide shrine attack \nSEHWAN SHARIF, Pakistan Pakistani security forces killed dozens of suspected militants on Friday, a day after Islamic State claimed a suicide bombing that killed more than 80 worshippers at a Sufi shrine, the biggest in a spate of attacks this week across the country.
