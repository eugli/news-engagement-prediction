A new location on the Lower East Side of Manhattan will open this week.

The bread is the edible container, like a pita pocket. “It’s a way to get people to appreciate the traditional food of Rome,” Mr. Callegari said. At his new Lower East Side location, opening on Wednesday, you get a substantial amount of food for $6.
