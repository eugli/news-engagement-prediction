It started off innocuously enough, with Q-Tip dedicating the group's performance to \"all of those people around the world who are pushing people who are in power to represent them.\" But as soon as Busta Rhymes bounded onstage, this happened: \nI’m not feeling the political climate right now. I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all the the evil that you’ve been perpetuating throughout the United States. I want to thank President Agent Orange for the unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban, cause we come together. We the people! \nThis, of course, transitioned into a performance of \"We the People,\" , a protest anthem off of the Tribe's latest album that includes lyrics like \"All you Mexicans, you must go.\" The group's members took the stage by breaking through a concrete-looking \"wall\" that appeared on-set, which might as well have been accompanied by a giant \"METAPHOR\" chyron scrolling across the bottom of your screen. As women wearing hijabs walked up from the audience to stand alongside the performers, Q-Tip finished by raising a fist and repeatedly shouting \"Resist!\" \nhttps://twitter.com/GQMagazine/status/830987973416075264 \nBusta's \"President Agent Orange\" dig isn't (only) a shot at Trump's hue; Agent Orange , of course, was the herbicide that the American military used to destroy jungles and agricultural land during the Vietnam War, causing millions of military and civilian injuries, illnesses, and birth defects. Again, the metaphor—linking Trump with a horrible poison that America liberally deployed without regard for the long-term consequences—was hard to miss. \nhttps://twitter.com/Kingwole/status/830990200859815937 \nLady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime performance last weekend was great—not just because \"Edge of Glory\" is an all-time banger, but also because she found a way to impart her message of inclusiveness without making the moment about her . However, Gaga's performance was also the first high-profile opportunity for an entertainer to deliver any type of political message since the Trump administration began, and a misstep or overreach on such a gigantic stage could have proved costly. All told, it made sense for her to soft-shoe a little. \nThe marginally smaller stage afforded by the Grammy Awards, though, provided some room for experimentation and creativity, and the subtlety-free model provided by ATCQ and friends will likely guide politically-inclined entertainers going forward. This isn't 2013, when the careers of the Dixie Chicks were effectively ethered after they had the audacity to offer even the mildest criticism of President Bush. Plus, let's face it, the Venn diagram of ATCQ fans and people who get mad about anti-Trump statements probably has a very thin intersection zone anyway. \nAnd besides, millions of anti-Trump protestors are turning out on a seemingly weekly basis, while the President's approval ratings are at an all-time low for this point in a White House tenure. In this environment, speaking out against President Agent Orange might already prove to be an enriching path forward, both commercially and artistically.
