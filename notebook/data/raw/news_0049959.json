Elizabeth Restrepo was surprised to find South Carthage officer Frank Geisenhoffer, who made lewd comments to her in 2016, was still on the job in February of 2017. (WTVF) \n“I didn’t know what to say,” Restrepo told the investigative team. “I didn’t know what to do. I honestly, I think my mind went blank, like wow, did that really just happen?” \nThen, she said Geisenhoffer asked her to make a video of her own for him. \n“He said, ‘If you ever were to do that, give me a video, I’ll pay you for it. I will owe you big!” \nSo, Restrepo began recording their exchanges — she wanted proof, she said, so no one would take the cop’s word over her own. \nGeisenhoffer also made comments about the clerk’s physical appearance and even requested photos of Restrepo’s sister. \n“Dude, yesterday was my birthday so I was hoping you’d send me a picture of something,” he says in the recording. \nHe continues, “I saw a picture on Facebook of whatever she is to you. You was gonna get me a picture of her t---ies.” \nRestrepo said the officer made similar requests over and over, all of which she initially laughed off. She admitted she never directly shut down Geisenhoffer’s advances, mostly because she was worried about his status as a cop. Officer Frank Geisenhoffer brushed off reporters questions about the recordings that capture him repeatedly requesting inappropriate photos from a local store clerk. (WTVF) \n“Everything about Frank is scary, but it’s even more scary because he has a badge,” she told Channel 5. \nAt one point, Geisenhoffer even reached out and touched her hair while requesting yet another promiscuous photo, Restrepo claimed. \n“I could smell his breath,” Restrepo told the new station. “I didn’t know what to do, but to stand there and let him do it and record him.” \nIn the final recording, Geisenhoffer admits to showing Restrepo his masturbation video. \n“Dude, I can get myself off. You know. In fact, you’ve seen me get myself off — and I erased that too, by the way,” he says. \nRestrepo then took the recordings to the South Carthage police and filed a complaint. \nGeisenhoffer, in a written statement, admitted to nearly everything, News 5 reported, though he did claim Restrepo lead him on and sent him lewd pictures first — something Restrepo has denied. \nAfter hearing both sides of the story, the South Carthage chief suspended the officer for two weeks without pay and then put him on probation. \nWhen asked how he was able to defend his remarks by News 5 this week, Geisenhoffer responded with “No statements.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:14:18.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
