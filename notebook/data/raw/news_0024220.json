of the All-Star break, there's plenty of drama in Cleveland, New York, and especially Oklahoma City, where Kevin Durant makes his return as a member of the Warriors on Saturday. \nWhile that homecoming (of sorts) is the biggest story in the Association, we're also taking a look at LeBron's Cavs, who are a bigger threat to the Warriors' supremacy than you think. 30 Brooklyn Nets (previous ranking: 30) \nJust when you think the on-court product couldn't get any worse for Brooklyn, the Nets added these ridiculously awful jersey patches with their first official sponsor. \nThen again, maybe this is all a massive ploy to take our attention off of the actual basketball. We see you, Nets. 29 Phoenix Suns (29) \nDevin Booker's trash-talk after a little bit of a kerfuffle against the Memphis Grizzlies was pretty great — but it would have been even better if the Suns actually won the game. 28 Los Angeles Lakers (28) \nLuke Walton clearly has some Zen Master in him, as the Lakers coach recently tested how much his team trusts each other during a practice gamble. \nOf course, in typical purple-and-gold fashion, the players passed the test , then managed to fail the execution anyway. 27 Philadelphia 76ers (20) \nThe Sixers' recent losing streak has us depressed, because we really wanted Philly to make the postseason in Joel Embiid's rookie season, but it's probably for the best. If and when the 76ers add one more top-tier talent in the draft, they'll be ready to build a dynasty. Seriously. Getty Images Mitchell Leff 26 Orlando Magic (27) \nRockets forward Ryan Anderson recently said he wanted to return to Orlando this offseason . You'd assume that stings a little bit for Magic fans, but in reality, there's no guarantee Anderson would be lighting it up in Orlando the way he is for Houston this season. 25 New York Knicks (23) \nI mean, what is there to say about the Knicks at this point — other than \"Poor Kristaps Porzingis\"? NBAE NBAE/Getty Images 24 Minnesota Timberwolves (26) \nLance Stephenson is back in the NBA courtesy of Minnesota, and he might be able to give the Wolves a boost with his playmaking. Really, though, the Wolves live and die with their defense these days — and a recent down-swing on that end of the court has Tom Thibodeau's team struggling once again. 23 New Orleans Pelicans (24) \nIt seems as if those rumors of a Jahlil Okafor trade to the Pelicans have passed, which is a very good thing for New Orleans. Okafor and Anthony Davis would be an offensively skilled frontcourt pairing with zero chance of stopping the opponent from getting to the rim on every single possession. Mark L. Baer USA TODAY Sports 22 Milwaukee Bucks (18) \nWe were all set to declare the Bucks a real threat in the Eastern Conference before Jabari Parker's unfortunate knee injury. Now, all we can do is hope that Parker recovers fully and as quickly as possible. Stacy Revere Getty Images 21 Sacramento Kings (25) \nAfter throwing down one of the most ridiculous dunks of the season in a big win over the Celtics (without DeMarcus Cousins), Willie Cauley-Stein perfectly summed up this Kings team : “When we’re all locked in and we’re all playing for each other and playing at the best of everybody’s ability, it’s proven we can run with anybody and lose to anybody.” \nIndeed, WCS. Indeed. 20 Dallas Mavericks (21) \nYogi Ferrell is all the rage in Dallas, but we're honestly counting the days until Mark Cuban takes part in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. Here's hoping Dirk Nowitzki comes out of the stands to reject his boss at some point during the festivities — you know, just for fun. USA TODAY Sports Kevin Jairaj 19 Miami Heat (22) \nLook, you can recognize how awesome the Heat's win streak is and how it might be a bad thing in the long-term, since 2017 is their best shot at a top draft pick. With that said, we're loving Miami's recent playoff push, and a report they're interested in Serge Ibaka is further proof Erik Spoelstra & Co. plan to keep the pedal to the metal. 18 Portland Trail Blazers (15) \nWe never thought we'd say this in 2016-17, but Evan Turner's recent injury is a big blow to the Blazers. ET had found his rhythm in Portland since the first of the year; more importantly, the Blazers don't have a ton of depth. His absence could mean the difference between a playoff berth and a bad lottery pick. 17 Chicago Bulls (19) \nLooking back on this offseason, it makes perfect sense that Derrick Rose ended up in New York — because the Bulls are slowly but surely becoming the midwest version of the Knicks. 16 Charlotte Hornets (14) \nThe Hornets were one of our favorite teams in the first half of the season, which makes their recent slide all the more depressing. On the bright side, Charlotte's struggles perfectly coincidenced with Cody Zeller's injury absence. Maybe his return can get the Hornets back on track headed into the All-Star break. AP 15 Denver Nuggets (16) \nThe Nuggets are expected to be active at the trade deadline , with both skilled big men and veteran wings available in Denver. The assumption is the Nuggets will look to stockpile picks and young assets, but could they try to secure their status as a Western Conference playoff contender instead? NBAE NBAE/Getty Images 14 Detroit Pistons (17) \nSure, it was just a game against the Lakers, but the Pistons showed a flash of the team they can be against Los Angeles this week. Andre Drummond led the way, Stan Van Gundy praised Reggie Jackson for his two-way effort, and Stanley Johnson decided to stick around after the win to get more practice in. \nThat has to be SVG's dream come true for this squad. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP 13 Atlanta Hawks (12) \nThe book is out on the Hawks, and it's not good. They will roll over if you punch them in the mouth early. 12 Indiana Pacers (13) \nIf you're bemoaning the fact that this NBA season is inevitably going to boil down to the Cavaliers and Warriors, you're really not paying attention to the Eastern Conference. Take the Pacers, who looked like also-rans through the first half of the year and are now threatening to claim home-court advantage in the postseason. \nThis regular season has been amazing, and it's slowly slipping away. Take the time to appreciate squads like Indiana while you have the chance, and stop worrying about the looming Finals. Brian Spurlock USA TODAY Sports 11 Los Angeles Clippers (11) \nWith Chris Paul out, the onus is on Blake Griffin to guide this team through the regular season. Lately, he's looked like his old All-NBA self, but Doc Rivers isn't satisfied. The Clippers coach wants Griffin to shoot even more 3s in Paul's absence. \nIt's not often a coach has to ask a player to shoot more, but here we are in Los Angeles. Dan Hamilton USA TODAY Sports 10 Oklahoma City Thunder (8) \nHonestly, there's nothing valuable to say here on Friday this week. Russell Westbrook is still averaging a triple-double, hooray! \nThe real story, though, is Kevin Durant coming back to OKC. Some fans will boo. Most (probably) will cheer. And we'll all have way too much to say about it on Sunday. \nCAN'T WAIT. 9 Toronto Raptors (10) \nThe Raptors have one hope of making any noise the rest of the year: They need to trade for Orlando's Serge Ibaka. And what do you know, Toronto reportedly has interest in the resurgent big man. \nAs long as the Magic's asking price is reasonable, this would be a fantastic deal for both sides. Please, basketball gods, make it happen. 8 Memphis Grizzlies (9) \nThe Grizzlies looked vulnerable in a big loss to the Thunder ... then turned around and ripped off three big wins in a row. How does Memphis recover from those losses? It helps that the core has been together for so long they're practically family — and like a family, sometimes you have to yell at each other to get through the dark times. Nelson Chenault USA TODAY Sports 7 Washington Wizards (7) \nJohn Wall is practically something out of a video game, so it makes sense that the Wizards are trying to take the next step as an organization by introducing virtual reality into players' training programs . \nThe franchise isn't sure it'll work, but we applaud their experimentation. There's plenty of downtime during an NBA season. Why not try something new? 6 Boston Celtics (5) \nWe stand by that statement for now, but here's the kicker: We really want to be wrong, and we'll love every night that Boston's young players shove that statement right back in our faces. Getty Images Mike Stobe 5 Utah Jazz (6) \nRudy Gobert swears he's over his 2017 All-Star snub,and we're not here to call the Jazz center a liar. \nWe'd just like to point out that Gordon Hayward made it clear Gobert wants to prove he's already the best big man in the NBA. So if Gobert is over the snub, it's because he has bigger fish to fry. 4 Cleveland Cavaliers (3) \nColin Cowherd summed up why people need to pump the brakes with their overreactions every time the Cavaliers drop a game: Cleveland doesn't care about the regular season. The next two months are simply about making sure Kyle Korver feels comfortable alongside LeBron James & Co. — and making sure no one else gets hurt. (Miss you, J.R.) \nIn fact, in Colin's eyes, the Cavs are still the favorites to win the title. Sergio Estrada USA TODAY Sports 3 Houston Rockets (2) \nJames Harden deserves all the accolades in the world, and he's still our frontrunner to win the MVP. \nHas anyone else noticed his 3-point shooting has fallen off a bit this year, though? We're not worried, given how big of an offensive burden the Beard carries for Houston. A slight dip in efficiency is expected. Perhaps it's even just a random blip. \nBut it's something to keep an eye on. Bill Streicher 2 San Antonio Spurs (4) \nFor all his skill on both ends of the floor, Kawhi Leonard is still finding his voice as a leader. We won't hold that against the Klaw, since he had Tim Duncan doing the talking for so long — and because we expect Leonard to learn how to lead very, very soon. 1 Golden State Warriors (1) \nThe Warriors should be thanking the Thunder — and not just for Kevin Durant. \nStephen Curry has found his MVP-caliber form lately by playing more like \"the old Steph,\" the version of Curry who will pull up from 30 feet with 20 seconds on the shot clock just because he can or dribble through all five defenders to test the opponent. Durant, in turn, had to figure out how to play his game while his point guard hijacked the offense... \n... which is exactly what KD did for years with Russell Westbrook, of course. Only this time, his new point guard's aggressiveness actually helps his team win games. Curry can shoot the hell out of the ball, while Westbrook's early-shot-clock 3-pointers bail out the opposing defense. \nCombined with a flowing offense that doesn't rely on players to make things happen in isolation, KD has to be in heaven.
