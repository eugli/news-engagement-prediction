This is the 13th year that they have been dating each other. She cast a spell on my brother so that he would not be able to quit the relationship. No single child between them and they were not married. \n“Sometime last year, she stabbed him in the head and eye. It took months before the wounds healed. She has achieved her aim. We are from Bayelsa State. Our father is late, but we still have an ageing mother. She has not been informed about his death. I want the police to ensure that she joins my brother in heaven. That is all I want.” \nA resident, who gave his name as Alade, said the police from the Ajeromi division visited the scene and later arrested Mary. \nAlade described Kingsley as friendly and peaceful, adding that the suspect usually harassed him because she knew he would not fight back. \n“His death is painful to all of us. She must be brought to justice,” Alade said. \nOne of the deceased’s friends, Gloria Agbubo, wrote on her Facebook page in pidgin English that Mary was jealous that Kingsley was going after another lady in the community. \nShe said, “Kingsley was killed by his lover. The man was dating another girl.” \nA shoe maker opposite the beer parlour, said Mary and Kingsley were in good terms when he left shop on Thursday. \n“It was on Friday morning that a friend called and told me that Mary had killed him. I was surprised,” he added. \nThe Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said a postmortem would be carried out on the corpse of the victim. \n“The case has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, for further investigation,” she added. \nCopyright PUNCH.
