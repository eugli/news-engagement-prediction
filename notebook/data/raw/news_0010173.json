You don’t become a bad side overnight.

The Reds have not kept a Premier League clean sheet since December 19 (Photo: Andrew Powell) Klopp has seen his side fall out of the Champions League places (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \n\"We can’t keep a clean sheet but we’ve got to try and instil that because you’re going to struggle to win games when you keep conceding goals,\" he continued. \n\"They’ve got to roll their sleeves up and they can’t feel sorry for themselves. \n\"These players are on ridiculous amounts of money and for all the joy they gave us up to Christmas the last month has been unbearable to be a Liverpool fan.\" \nNext up for the Reds is a home clash against title contenders Tottenham on Saturday, before a trip to struggling champions Leicester and a home clash against Arsenal. \nThe Reds are sitting in fifth place in the table, just a point behind Arsenal in the fourth and final Champions League spot. poll loading Will Liverpool still finish in the top 4? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:44:45.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
