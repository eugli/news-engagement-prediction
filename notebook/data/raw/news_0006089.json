Of course there's also the celebrity-peppered front rows too. Among the revelers at last night's Hugo Boss after party were two incredibly well-dressed gents, Zachary Quinto and Edgar Ramirez (who was almost voted Most Stylish Man of 2016 ), both of whom demonstrated that ditching the collared shirt when wearing a suit isn't just a summertime thing — it can be done year-round. \nBoth dudes are undoubtably stylish — hell we literally wrote about Quinto's killer shades yesterday — so it was interesting to see them both land on the same idea at the same time. But here's the thing, they didn't look like twins, each spun it off in their own direction, and both with A+ results. \nRamirez stuck to the more conventional route with a navy, two-button suit worn with a black crewneck sweater underneath, which is both seasonally appropriate and relaxed. No need to be stuffy just because it's Fashion Week, after all. Quinto paired his light gray, checkered double-breasted suit with a black tee, adding more contrast and taking the stuffiness out of the otherwise formal DB look. \nThis isn't a new trend — it's been on the runways since at least 2014 — but we've seen it mostly done in warmer weather, or out on the street. But now, we're starting to see it make its way to red carpets and now, on the backs of real live celebs at Fashion Week, meaning that if you're not already doing it, it's time to consider it. You almost certainly have a navy suit and dark crewneck sweater on hand, so you've got one outfit down, and maybe you're even a little more daring with a DB sitting in your closet waiting for a way to be reborn and wor in a new way — well, here's your chance. Let Quinto and Ramirez remind you that you don't have always pull out the whole shirt-and-tie for a night out — sometimes it's best to take things easy.
