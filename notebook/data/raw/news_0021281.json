Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as America’s attorney general, ending a bitter debate in which Democrats pilloried Sessions as racist.\n“He is not a racist ,” countered Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who is African-American. “Jeff Sessions has earned my support. And I will hold him accountable if and when we disagree.”\n“I just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative Americans,” Scott said.\n  Pence, In Historic First, Casts Deciding Vote To Confirm DeVos As Education Secretary Democrats Launch Talk-A-Thon In Hopes of Blocking DeVos’ Confirmation Pence Reveals A Special Moment At The Super Bowl With One Of His Role Models Sen.

That to me is not a disqualifier, any more than being liberal is a disqualifier,” Graham said.\n \nThe vote was 52-47. Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate. Sessions abstained.\nThe vote was strictly along party lines with the exception of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who, as promised, voted for Sessions.\n“It’s no secret that our Democrat colleagues don’t like the new president and are doing what they can to undermine the new administration,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who objected to criticism that Sessions would put his preferences above the law.\n“This is especially troubling after he specifically committed to us during his confirmation hearing that, if he’s confirmed, he will follow the law, regardless of whether he supported the statute as a policy matter,” Grassley said.\n  After Miraculous Super Bowl Win, Patriots Player Says He’ll Skip White House Visit Republican Congressman Pushes To Abolish Department Of Education Pelosi, Waters Use ‘Alternative Facts’ In Their Cases Against Trump Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that in light of Trump’s executive order on immigration and his objections to court rulings that have blocked the order, the next attorney general should be more likely to work against Trump than with him.\n“What we’ve seen is a president who belittles judges when they don’t agree with him,” said Schumer. “What we’ve seen is a president who is willing to shake the roots of the Constitution and a fundamental premise — no religious test — that’s embodied in our Constitution within his first few weeks in office.”\n“We certainly need an attorney general who will stand up to that president. … But [Sessions] is not, if you can say one thing about him, he’s not independent of Donald Trump,” Schumer said.\nCharges of racism flew the moment Sessions was nominated due to his 1986 rejection for a federal judgeship after claims were made that he had made inappropriate racial remarks.\n“It’s been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.”\nAs Alabama’s attorney general in the 1990s, Sessions pushed to desegregate public schools and prosecuted the former head of the Ku Klux Klan, ensuring he received the death penalty in a case involving the abduction and murder of a black teenager.\nOnce Sessions is sworn in, the Republican majority in the Senate will shrink from 52 to 51 until Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, appoints a successor to Sessions.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:22:40.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
