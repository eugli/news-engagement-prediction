Ynet News | Published: 02.02.17 , 21:13 \nThree months before the French presidential elections, in which the polls predict that Marine Le Pen is set to reach a glorious achievement by making it to the second and final round, Le Pen is setting the mark on the style of her administration. \nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n\nIn an interview with CNN , Le Pen praised Donald Trump's immigration ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries that also completely prevents the entrance of Syrian refugees, and spoke out against the criticism Trump has been facing. \n\n\"I think that most of the reactions are in bad faith,\" said Le Pen to CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \nMarine Le Pen (Photo: mct) \"It is a temporary measure. It targets six or seven countries, countries that of course are responsible for terrorist threats, so I think Donald Trump and his intelligence services wanted to set up criteria and conditions to avoid having potential terrorists enter the United States, where they might commit attacks, the same way that France was the victim of attacks,\" she said. \n\nShe also pointed out that these are states that do not recognize Israel, and which Israelis cannot access. \n\n(Photo: mct) \nWhen asked whether such a similar ban would work in France, she said they would have to be \"very vigilant\" since \"France no longer has any borders because of the EU.\" \n\nWith regard to the US-Mexico border, she said, \"He (Trump) was elected and he said that he was going to do this. And now the world seems to be scandalized because he's implementing what he promised he would do during his campaign.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:53:27.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
