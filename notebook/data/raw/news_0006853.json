It includes $3.2 million to hire teachers and other experts focussed on helping students improve their reading and writing.\nMcKenzie said it is too early to expect it to bear fruit.\n\"In two or three years, yes we'll be hopefully seeing the gains that we anticipated,\" she said.\nToo many assessments McKenzie also gave teachers full marks for convincing the province it was loading them down with too many student assessments, work that often provided the department, boards or individual schools with roughly the same information.\n\"I think teachers were right. I think that we rolled out a lot in P-3. And across the board in terms of collection of information and we could have done it better,\" she said.\n\"We were learning as we were going and we had an opportunity through the negotiations in the collective agreement to talk about some of their frustrations.\"\nThe government reached a tentative contract with the Nova Scotia Teachers Union earlier this month. The union, however, has accused Premier Stephen McNeil of reneging on one section and teachers are back to work-to-rule job action.\nA ratification vote is set for Feb. 8.\n'You don't take 9 vials'\nMcKenzie used a medical analogy to drive home her point about too many assessments.\n\"When you go to the doctor to get blood work, you don't take nine vials. You take one vial and test it nine times,\" she said.\n\"What we needed to do was be able to use the information we were gathering in nine different ways as opposed to going out and gathering it nine different times.\"\nLast November, Education Minister Karen Casey suspended further provincial assessments while her department evaluated their usefulness. That work is ongoing, according to the deputy minister.\nA look at student assessments and how they're used\n\"Do we need to improve that? Absolutely. Do we need assessment data in order to inform good practice? We also need that.\"\nMcKenzie admitted that with no tests there will be a gap in data.\n\"The current suspension of assessments will cause a little bit of a blip but I think that we'll come out and be in a better place as a result of what we've had to take a look at.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:11:43.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
