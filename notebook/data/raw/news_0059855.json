Leaving relevant facts out is dishonest, just as is inventing a tale out of whole cloth. \nAnd today, when CNN invited Bill Stein, the Federation for Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-immigrant hate group whose founder wrote in 1993 “I’ve come to the point of view that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that,” they failed to disclose what the Southern Poverty Law Center calls its veneer of “ugliness.” \nWatch courtesy of CNN’s New Day: . @FAIRImmigration 's Dan Stein: \"If you're here illegally…be thinking about going out and buying some luggage\" https://t.co/Jw8buHCQNz \n— New Day (@NewDay) February 22, 2017 \nALISYN CAMEROTA : What is your biggest concern about the new guidelines as Mr. Trump has laid them out? ANDRE SEGURA : Where do we start? This is bringing to life President Trump’s worst and most divisive campaign rhetoric. Like I’ve said before on this program, we have to take the president at his word, and he’s going to bring these things to life. 10,000 new ICE agents throughout the interior. I think people have a misconception that this is not going to affect them in their daily lives. But when you have more ICE agents throughout the country, when you have more state and local officers doing immigration enforcement, you’re going to see an uptick in racial profiling. Communities are going to become less safe. CAMEROTA : Dan, what do you like about it? DAN STEIN : Look, people come here illegally, that doesn’t mean they just have the right to stay. You take a look at all of these orders, if you’re here illegally, you need to be thinking about going out and buying some luggage. Because as Spicer made it clear, Trump administration says if you’re here illegally you remain deportable with the exception of the so-called DACA group, and that’s a dramatic change. Look, nobody ever decided in this country that immigration was unlimited, that you can break the immigration law and then demand to stay. That you could jump in front of the line, in front of millions of people who respect our laws all over the world and just come in and say, “OK, I’m here, I don’t have to go.” If we — if you enforce these laws, we can reclaim our schools, our hospitals, and our communities once again for the American people. \nDan Stein talks about the effort to “reclaim our schools for the American” you have to keep in mind FAIR’s anti-immigrant stance. As the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) explains , \nFAIR’s founder, John Tanton, has expressed his wish that America remain a majority-white population: a goal to be achieved, presumably, by limiting the number of nonwhites who enter the country. One of the group’s main goals is upending the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a decades-long, racist quota system that limited immigration mostly to northern Europeans. FAIR President Dan Stein has called the Act a “mistake.” \nReclaiming our schools for the American people is a politically correct way of saying “making our schools white again.” This is the open and avowed purpose of FAIR. \nThis is the sort of relevant information viewers need to have available to understand what is being talked about. Donald Trump’s approach to immigrants is mirrored in FAIR’s activism. It is deplorable, and so is CNN’s failure to disclose the full truth about its guest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:37:04.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
