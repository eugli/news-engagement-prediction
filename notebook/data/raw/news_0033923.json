Not every work of art contains every one of these elements, but at least two are always present. \nFor example, a sculptor, by default, has to have both form and space in a sculpture, because these elements are three-dimensional. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know They can also be made to appear in two-dimensional works through the use of perspective and shading. \nArt would be sunk without line , sometimes known as \"a moving point.\" While line isn't something found in nature, it is absolutely essential as a concept to depicting objects and symbols, and defining shapes . \nTexture is another element, like form or space, that can be real (run your fingers over an Oriental rug, or hold an unglazed pot), created (think of van Gogh's lumpy, impasto-ed canvases) or implied (through clever use of shading). \nNow, I will try not to leap up and down and pinwheel my arms in large, excited arcs over color , but, really -- it's often the whole point for us visual types. Show me a red spectrum, regardless of value (lightness or darkness), and my brain yells \"Hallelujah!\" Then, of course, there are all of those lovely, soothing blues... oh! And green -- he color of nature and the renewal of life. There have got to be at least 84,000 tints and tones of green. And, yellow! My goodness, I do love a sunny yellow. Not a sickly-looking \"Whoa! Hey, you should get your liver function tested, buddy\" shade of yellow, mind you, but...what? Sorry. What was the other part of the question? Why Are the Elements of Art Important? \nThe elements of art are important for several reasons. First, and most importantly, a person can't create art without utilizing at least a few of them. No elements, no art -- end of story. And we wouldn't even be talking about any of this, would we? \nSecondly, knowing what the elements of art are enables us to (1) describe what an artist has done, (2) analyze what is going on in a particular piece and (3) communicate our thoughts and findings using a common language. \nMusicians can talk about the key of \"A,\" and they all know it means \"a pitch relating to 440 oscillations per second of vibration.\" Mathematicians may use the very basic word \"algorithm\" and feel confident that most people know they mean \"a step-by-step procedure for carrying out computation.\" Botanists world-wide will employ the name \"rosa rugosa,\" rather than the much longer \"that old-fashioned shrub rose - you know, the one that leaves hips in the fall - with the five-petaled flowers that can be yellow, white, red or pink.\" These are all specific examples of a common language coming in handy for intelligent (and shortened) discourse. \nSo it is with the elements of art. Once you know what the elements are, you can trot them out, time after time, and never put a wrong foot forward in the Art World. \nDoes your instructor want you to write a few words and/or pages on a painting of your choice? Choose wisely, and then wax euphoric on form, lines and color. \nHave you found an unidentified work in your great-aunt's attic/toolshed/outhouse? It is helpful, when describing the piece to someone who may be able to supply you with further information, to throw in some of the piece's elements of art along with: \"It's an etching. It's on paper.\" \nStumped for conversation at a gallery show?
