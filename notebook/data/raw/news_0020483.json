In the interview, Offset said people supported Makonnen “because the world is fucked up.” Takeoff added, “This world is not right,” and Quavo suggested that Makonnen’s homosexuality “undermines his credibility.” Migos have now apologized in the statement below. “We are all fans of Makonnen’s music and we wish he didn't feel like he ever had to hide himself,” they said. “We feel the world is fucked up that people have to hide and we're asked to comment on someone’s sexuality.” They concluded, “We love all people, gay or straight and we apologize if we offended anyone.” \nWhen contacted by Pitchfork, representatives for Migos offered no further comment. iLoveMakonnen’s representatives also declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:54:42.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
