My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh \n— Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017 \nIn that report, filmmaker Ami Horowitz discussed the surge in crime, including rape, since Sweden began accepting large quantities of refugees. \nHorowitz accused Swedish officials of being in denial about the problems. \nCarlson joined \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss the fallout, first noting that all U.S. presidents should be \"precise\" with their words so people know exactly what point they're trying to make. \nBut he said the media is ignoring the real story, which is the \"massive social cost\" and political backlash in European nations as a result of accepting large numbers of refugees. \nCarlson said nations like Sweden and France have tried \"really hard\" and spent a lot of money on integration efforts and it \"hasn't worked very well.\" \n\"Good for Trump and good for anyone else who raises at least that question. Let's have an honest conversation about how you bring tons of people in and make them fully vested in your society. If they can't do it, how are we gonna do it?\" he asked. \nWatch the discussion above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:38:38.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
