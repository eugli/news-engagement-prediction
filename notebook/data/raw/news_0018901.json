Captured by photographer, Ivette Ivans, the 32-year-old mum of two can be seen feeding her daughter on the sofa of their London home while dressed in a floaty white dress. Sharing the image to her own Instagram, the daughter of Formula 1 mogul Bernie Ecclestone, offered praise to the photographer for capturing the touching image. “Thank you @ivetteivens for capturing this beautiful moment this is by far my favourite photograph but mainly thank you for spreading this message,” she wrote. “Breastfeeding is a powerful demonstration of love and nurturing yet it has become so normal to hide. I want to take that normal and toss it.” And Tamara’s followers were quick to offer praise to the mum for the inspirational snap and accompanying message about breastfeeding. “You are awesome! Thanks for normalising this for the rest of us ‘extended’ BFers!” one fan commented. “Beautiful picture of a beautiful moment, you keep normalising it!” added another. “Fabulous. It’s so great to see influential people like yourself normalising and enjoying extended breastfeeding. I b/f my daughter until she was 2 and a half. It was the best thing ever!” added another mum. But not everyone was in favour of the shot, with some believing that, at two, Sophia was too old to be breastfed. “For babies yes it’s beautiful but for two years old it’s disgusting,” one follower wrote. “If a toddler is at the point where they eat regular food and chew with their teeth than there’s no reason to continue breastfeeding at almost 3 years old. IN MY OPINION it’s kinda creepy she’s sitting next to her drinking like that,” added another. Tamara has previously hit back at the criticism she gets about sharing shots of her breastfeeding her daughter, explaining that she finds the uproar “bizarre.” “I think all mothers should support each other and stick together instead of picking flaws,” she told Femail of the frequent trolling she receives. “It’s tricky as parenting is one of those things everyone seems to have an opinion on and a lot of the time it’s unwanted and can be so cruel.” “I am doing my best as a mum by following my heart and intuition. I feel mums should really listen to their intuition; no one knows their baby better.” The socialite recently revealed that she plans to continue breastfeeding her daughter, Sophia, until the tot decides she wants to stop. “Yes, Sophia is two-and-a-half and yes, a lot of people wouldn’t breastfeed now. But it’s so comforting for her and she loves it,” she told Fabulous magazine. “It’s whenever she is done, but this beast is never going to be done!” she joked. “The paediatricians say it’s uncommon to go past four years old.” But Tamara isn’t ruling out breastfeeding past that milestone. “We’ll cross that bridge if it comes to it, but for now she’s my baby,” she explained. “You’re doing something that is so amazing for your child, but it can cause such hostility and anger. It makes me wonder what’s wrong with the world. Breastfeeding is such a natural thing.” What do you think of Tamara’s latest brelfie?
