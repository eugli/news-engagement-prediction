Nick Mortimer/GNS Science Research Institute/Handout via REUTERS 2/2 \nSYDNEY A continent two-thirds the size of Australia has been found beneath the south-west Pacific Ocean, scientists reported in the journal of the Geological Society of America. \nThe land mass of 4.5 million square kilometres (1.74 million square miles) is 94 percent underwater and only its highest points - New Zealand and New Caldeonia - poke above the surface. \n\"It's rather frustrating for us geologists with the oceans being there,\" said Nick Mortimer, a geologist at GNS Science in Dunedin, New Zealand. \n\"If we could pull the plug on the oceans it would be clear to everyone we have mountain chains and a big high-standing continent above the ocean crust.\" \nMortimer was lead author of the paper titled \"Zealandia: Earth's hidden continent\" which says the new discoveries prove what had long been suspected. \n\"Since about the 1920s, from time to time in geology papers people used the word 'continental' to describe various parts of New Zealand and the Catham Islands and New Caledionia,\" Mortimer said. \n\"The difference now is that we feel we've gathered enough information to change 'continental' to the noun, 'continent'.\" \nMortimer said geologists early in the previous century had found granite from sub-antarctic islands near New Zealand and metaphormic rocks on New Caledonia that were indicative of continental geology. \nIf the recent discovery is accepted by the scientific community, cartographers will probably have to add an eighth continent to future maps and atlases. \n\"The paper we've written unashamedly sticks to empirical observations and descriptions,\" Mortimer said. \"The litmus test will really be if 'Zealandia' appears in maps and atlases in five or 10 year's time.\"\"Zealandia\" is believed to have broken away from Australia about 80 million years ago and sank beneath the sea as part of the break up of the super-continent known as Gondwanaland. \n(Reporting by Peter Gosnell; Editing by Eric Meijer) Next In World News Islamic State readies for close combat in alleyways of west Mosul \nBAGHDAD Islamic State militants are developing a network of passageways and tunnels in the narrow alleys of west Mosul that will enable them to hide and fight among the civilian population when Iraqi forces launch an attack that is expected any day now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:51:15.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
