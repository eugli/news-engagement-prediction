Seymour attended the draw on behalf of her husband, who was at work.\nIn her affidavit, Seymour admitted she asked about five cheques and was told by the dealers' accountant there would be only one winner, but there was nothing barring that winner from sharing their prize if they wished to do so.\nShe said she reluctantly agreed with Gould's idea of splitting the prize.\n'Are you nuts?' \"I said, 'I guess so' because I didn't want to split, but I didn't want to be confrontational and disagree with her,\" Seymour said in her affidavit.\nThe statement said Seymour suffers from anxiety and tries to avoid conflict.\n\"I did not want to split it if I won, absolutely,\" she said in the statement. \"I did not have the courage to say that to Ms. Gould's proposal.\"\nHer husband, Darin Seymour, said in his affidavit he bought a vehicle from MacDonald Group with his own money and in his name. He said his wife told him about the verbal agreement when he came home from work.\n\"She told me she said OK to the other contestants. I said, 'Are you nuts? I never agreed to that and you were only there in the first place because of me,'\" he said in the document.\nKim Seymour said the only agreement she signed was a document presented by MacDonald Group indicating she was there representing her husband.\nThe couple said in court documents they do not feel the verbal agreement made at the dealership was binding.\nA decision in the case is expected next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:28:50.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
