The sky is cloudless cobalt, the East river lies tranquil below. Here is the perfect gum (or so the slogan boasts) in an ideal vision where everything is reduced to pristine rectangles, from the rising skyscrapers to the gum to the abstract reflections. Pop fused with minimalism three decades in advance: what a staggering start to this show.\nCharles G Shaw , otherwise known as one of the Park Avenue cubists, is not a name on everyone’s lips. Indeed most of America After the Fall: Painting in the 1930s comes as a revelation, not least because so few works have travelled outside the US before. This is our first chance to see Grant Wood’s nightmarishly ebullient car crash, in which a scarlet truck roars over the hill towards an impending pile-up, or his great American Gothic , the long-faced couple standing sentinel before their famous wooden home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Death on the Ridge Road, 1935 by Grant Wood. Photograph: Collection of Williams College Museum of Art, Williamstown, Massachusetts \nAnd who has come across Alexandre Hogue’s Mother Earth Laid Bare , in which the raped landscape lies dead in the dust, all her green garments torn away; or O Louis Guglielmi’s presentiment of Brooklyn Bridge as a shattered wreckage? A woman sits dazed on one of its mangled struts, an unexploded bomb in her back. It is 1938: Roosevelt is prophesying war.\nThis show runs from the Great Depression to the onset of the second world war. Prolonged drought and relentless wind scourged the prairies, leaving them barren. Poverty-stricken farmers fled the Dust Bowl – more than a million people displaced in Oklahoma alone. Cities expanded to take in provincial migrants and refugees from communist, fascist and Nazi Europe. It was a terrible decade for America, and yet evidently great for its painting.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest America after the Fall exhibition video \nIn the truest sense, these works are signs of the times. They hold an entire American decade intact with their images of factories, docks, gas pumps and turbines, of new skyscrapers heroically silhouetted against midwestern skies, and cities on hills radiant with limelight. Sailors take shore leave with Lucky Strikes and lascivious leers; stenographers crowd around the new beauty salons; black roustabouts lug coal on the waterfront under the white boss’s pitiless eye.\nEach work feels equally succinct. Easel paintings, on a small and human scale\n\nIn Philip Evergood’s Dance Marathon , the living dead finalists are only just holding each other up as a skeleton dangles the prize money from its bony fingers. The New Yorkers in Reginald Marsh’s In Fourteenth Street pour out of the subway looking for love, and quite possibly Antoine’s permanent waves at $1.75. In Marsh’s Twenty Cent Movie , girls in flimsies wait for their dates beneath posters for Dangerous Curves – “A drama of human emotions STRIPPED BARE”. Billboards teem in the sulphurous light.\nThis is committed realism by comparison with Edward Hopper’s mysterious New York Movie : the usherette alone in her half-lit margin by the exit while the crowds watch some murky black-and-white film (Frank Capra’s Lost Horizon , according to the show’s vigilant curators). Shadows move across the screen and through her heart, as it seems, this lone figure lost in the city.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest William H Johnson’s Street Life, Harlem, 1939. Photograph: © 2017. Photo Smithsonian American Art Museum/Art Resource/Scala, Florence \nThis is as much a show of history painting as Revolution: Russian Art 1917-1932 , its timely companion at the Royal Academy. But it also presents, as never before, the terrific variety of America’s 30s avant garde. In one gallery alone you can jump from Hopper to O’Keeffe to the quasi-abstract precisionists , early Jackson Pollock, political Philip Guston and the thick impasto of William H Johnson’s post-cubist couple beneath a chunky Harlem moon.\nSeveral of these painters had been to Europe. Stuart Davis’s New York: Paris No 3 is a gorgeous work, brilliantly designed in all its syncopated flatness. But despite the title, it brings little back from France. In Davis’s transglobal streetscape, Paris is nothing but an old hotel advertising “Vins” compared to the America of gleaming gas stations, signposts, mailboxes, high-rises, soaring jets and sheer graphic zip. America is magnificently new.\nThis picture was made in 1931, the year The Star-Spangled Banner became America’s national anthem and Charles Demuth borrowed its lyrics for … And the Home of the Brave . This view of a modern factory makes a formidably suave geometry of the cooling tower, telegraph poles, windows and lights, all summarised as an array of incisive planes and curves. Streamlined, hard-edged and elegant, it’s a hymn to the industrial age.\nHanging next to it is Charles Sheeler’s legendary American Landscape , in which the Ford Motor factory appears luminous and frozen as a Seurat (minus the pointillism). Sheeler is just as exacting as Demuth, but there is a hint of spiritual desolation in his magnificently silent scene, devoid of all human presence bar a scurrying dot. After the crash of 1929, Henry Ford fired thousands of workers and installed machine guns against protesters at the factory gates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest American Landscape, 1930 by Charles Sheeler: ‘magnificently silent’. Photograph: © Museum of Modern Art, New York / Scala, Florence \nSuperbly curated by the Art Institute of Chicago, this is a show of ever-changing visions, temperaments, ideas and styles. It is also perfectly choreographed so that the poor black cotton pickers of Thomas Hart Benton appear in direct contrast to Grant Wood’s cheerful white sharecroppers, say, and the gothic windows in Paul Sample’s Church Supper speak straight to the window in Wood’s American Gothic .\nIt is only when you see Wood’s masterpiece surrounded by contemporary images of abandoned farms and rural devastation that its down-home, backward-looking quaintness truly registers. And what a beautiful painting it is: linear as a Botticelli and so radiantly clear.\nIn a show full of passionately polemical paintings – Alice Neel ’s heroic portrait of the union organiser Pat Whalen, fists bearing down on the newspaper headlines; Mussolini as a green-faced jack-in-a-box; Guston’s horrifying Guernica tondo – Wood’s lyrical ruralism still holds its own. The king and queen of the midwest, their home a clapboard castle, his pitchfork a sceptre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Linear as a Botticelli’: Grant Wood’s American Gothic, 1930. Photograph: The Art Institute of Chicago \nAmerica After the Fall is nothing less than a condensed museum of art, not to be missed by anyone with the slightest interest in painting. And each work feels equally succinct. Easel paintings, on a small and human scale, they nonetheless contain the essence of 30s America, from the Thanksgiving turkey to the Ku Klux Klan to Jean Harlow at the movies.\nMost emblematic of all, perhaps, is Edward Hopper’s Gas , in which a solitary figure mans a filling station in the middle of nowhere. He’s putting the pump back, he’s staring into the dial, he’s falling apart: who knows? The garage stands empty, its light sinister as the dusk descending over the woods, presaging a thousand movies. The rural past meets the industrial future in this vision of a lone American lost out there in the spreading vastness.\n• America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s is at the Royal Academy, London until 4 June \nArt The Observer Exhibitions Painting Royal Academy of Arts reviews   Share   Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:37:52.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
