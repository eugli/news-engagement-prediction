He is pacing around in it, his breathing ragged, moving from left to right and back again through the headphones clamped over my ears. I am pinned between two other audience members, hemmed in so tight I can feel the rise and fall of their breathing and their bodies shuddering with nervous laughter – but I can’t see them. In fact, I can’t see anything in the darkness of the room.\nThe Pitchfork Disney review – exhilarating chocoholic apocalypse Read more\nMacMillan voices all of the characters in three very different monologues in Philip Ridley ’s newest theatrical experiment. Each story, stuffed with bleak humour and self-reflexivity, is a variation on a theme of contemporary anxieties: a young man tries to demonstrate his masculinity through an initiation rite into a mysterious gang; a haughty servant, channelling Kazuo Ishiguro’s stiff butler Mr Stevens in The Remains of the Day, seems completely desensitised to violence; a farmer and his magical pet are trapped in a darkly funny tug of war between freedom and fame.\nAt a time when immersive or site-specific theatre has become shorthand for theatre that satiates the senses or permits audiences to roam freely through vivid, atmospheric spaces, Killer makes a deliberate turn in the opposite direction. The performance unfurls in darkness and shadow, and the audience is tightly herded through a series of narrow spaces in the womb of Shoreditch Town Hall. Jamie Lloyd ’s direction stimulates not the eyes but the ears.\nKiller is staged alongside Ridley’s earliest work for the theatre, The Pitchfork Disney, which premiered in 1991 – one of a crop of confrontational British plays that would eventually be categorised as in-yer-face theatre . But Ridley’s tool of choice in Killer isn’t the blunt horror of gratuitous visual violence.\nHe discards the jump-scare for simmering unease and the tightening noose of claustrophobia and nyctophobia, revelling in a captive audience and their wandering minds. He’s helped by the delicious live sound design by Ben and Max Ringham and George Dennis. They magnify every crunch, splatter and throb underscoring Ridley’s characteristic gruesome imagery – a man’s caved-in chest is lightly described as “a cherry crumble without the crumble”; animals are dismembered in grim anatomical detail – as well as his bag of subverted horror tropes, which parody The Purge ’s descent into anarchy and the unending dread of It Follows .\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Killer … Jamie Lloyd’s direction stimulates not the eyes but the ears. Photograph: Matt Humphrey\nBut it is MacMillan’s dizzying vocal acrobatics – wry, pained, prudish, silly, terrified – that propel Killer beyond the realm of the radio play and make these characters come to life, even if a couple of them feel more like half-formed experiments forced into existence from the depths of Ridley’s mind. But does it matter? These misshapen creatures lumber after us, out of the theatre and into the night, full of Frankenstein’s despair, stitched together from our buried fears and irrational anxieties. Ridley reminds us that it isn’t the monsters at the door we should fear, but the ones we keep inside.\n• At Shoreditch Town Hall , London, until 8 April.
