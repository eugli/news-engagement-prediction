By Cindy Kuzma Monday, February 13, 2017, 9:06 am Victor Sailer/PhotoRun \nNoah Droddy’s long hair and dude shades rocketed him to online stardom during the 2016 Olympic Track Trials, but his performance didn’t match the hype: He placed last in the 10,000 meters, three minutes behind winner Galen Rupp . Yet three months after that “bad day,” Droddy, 26, took second in October’s USATF 10 Mile Championships. His time (47:28) put him three seconds behind Sam Chelanga , who holds the NCAA 10,000-meter record of 27:08.49. “It proves that I belong in a conversation with those guys,” Droddy says. \nHe didn’t photo-bomb the running scene out of nowhere: He competed for Division III DePauw University, where he earned All-American honors in cross country his junior and senior years. After graduating in 2013, he returned home to Indianapolis, where he worked two jobs while training solo.

Droddy was a perfect fit. \nThe Roots Running protocol—based on the theories of legendary coach Joe Vigil—is tough, with up to five quality workouts per week. But it works for Droddy: Since joining, he has run a 13:49 for 5,000 meters and dropped his half marathon two minutes to 1:04:08. “In my training life I’m relatively young; I just hit 80 miles per week,” he says. “Let’s say we build up to 100 miles over the next three years. I think I can keep getting better.” Key Workout \nWhat: An up-tempo long run \nWhy: To add extra stress to the legs and mimic the physical and mental fatigue of a longer race \nWhen: Every Sunday during a training cycle, after a hard workout on Saturday \nHow: Depending on the distance he’s training for, Droddy runs 13 to 20 miles at a tough pace just slightly slower than a tempo effort (for Droddy, about 5:40 to 5:45 per mile). “You’re immediately thrown into that middle section of the race, where you’re already hurting,” he says. Tips From the Top \nMaintain perspective. Don’t let bad races rattle you—or great ones turn you complacent. “Staying humble through the process is important for long-term success,” Droddy says. \nFind your tribe. Droddy credits much of his success to his training group. “Having a support system that believes in you and knows when to push you is huge,” he says. \nRecharge. Droddy believes “robot runners” who never stray from strict diets and schedules burn out. He relaxes with hiking, nonrunning friends, and a brewski (or two).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:32:41.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
