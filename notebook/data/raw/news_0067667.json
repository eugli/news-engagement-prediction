(photo credit:REUTERS) \nThe Islamic State group on Wednesday morning released images of Katusha rockets purporting to provide evidence to its claim that it was indeed responsible for the rocket fire that targeted southern Israel on Tuesday. The images show a militant linked to the ISIS affiliate in Egypt, known as the Sinai Province, as he prepares two rockets prior to launching them from the restive Sinai Peninsula.

The village is located south of the town Rafah in northern Sinai, near the Egypt-Israel border.The IDF has not commented on the claim, but the Israel is reported to have carried out drone strikes “with Egypt’s knowledge and blessing” against militants in the restive peninsula. ISIS video threatens Israel in January 2016 Israel,which has a 240-kilometer border with the Sinai, has not officially retaliated against the rockets. Jerusalem and Cairo have been closely cooperating in the Sinai Peninsula in the fight against ISIS militants since Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi's rise to power. Liberman seemingly confirmed the strike against the car, telling Army Radio that “like always, the special forces of Lichtenstein probably took out a few terrorists from Daesh in Sinai,”the Arabic name for the Islamic State.“We do not let anything go without a response,” he added.Earlier this month the group claimed responsibility for a rocket barrage fired from the Sinai towards Israel's Red Sea resort of city of Eilat. The Iron Dome missile system intercepted three projectiles while a fourth landed in open territory. There were no casualties but at least four people were treated for anxiety.The group said the attack was launched \"in order to teach the Jews and the crusaders a proxy war will not avail them of anything,” and threatened future “calamitous” attacks. No photos of those rockets were released. Relevant to your professional network?
