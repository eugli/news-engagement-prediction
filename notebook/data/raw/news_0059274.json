Picture: Hollie Adams/The Australian \nSpeaking at the launch of a book of essays on ‘Making Australia Right’ edited by author Jim Allan, Mr Abbott opened with the remark that “many of the people who normally support Coalition governments aren’t happy.” media_camera Former prime minister Tony Abbott has warned the Coalition needs to shape up. \n“A sense of disappointment and disillusionment pervades these essays: disappointment with the Abbott government and perhaps even despair about the Turnbull government,” he said. \n“These criticisms aren’t always fair. Still, unless we heed the message from people who think that we have let them down, a book like this can become the thinking persons’ justification for voting One Nation.” \nInside former PM Tony Abbott’s ‘chaotic’, ‘misguided’ military deployments \nEffectively describing the Turnbull Government as a “bad situation”, Mr Abbott said work needs to be done “fast” to win back voters deserting the Coalition. \n“It wont be easy but it must be possible or our country is doomed to a Shorten Government that will make a bad situation immeasurably worse,” he said. \n“In or out of government, political parties need a purpose. Our politics can’t be just a contest of toxic egos or someone’s vanity project.” \nMr Abbott said nearly 40 per cent of Australians “couldn’t bring themselves to vote” for either the Coalition or Labor at the last election and “it’s easy enough to see why.” media_camera “The next election is winnable”.

Let’s make the next election about government versus gridlock,” he said. \nListing the factors driving voter dissatisfaction, Mr Abbott said Australia had some of the world’s highest energy prices, labour costs, regulatory burdens, house prices close to Hong Kong’s and an education standards worse than Kazakhstan. media_camera Australia faces house prices close to Hong Kong’s (pictured) and an education standards worse than Kazakhstan. \nHe admitted there were challenges with the Opposition, a “populist Senate” that made governing almost impossible, a “media that often mistakes insider gossip for serious journalism” and a public that demands to “enjoy things today but to put off paying for them.” \n“Still, the government’s job is to face up to these challenges and to overcome them,” he said. \nSpeaking about what a “sensible centre-right” Government should be doing, Mr Abbott said the party needed a conservative version of the left’s ‘long march through the institutions.’ \n“We do need to make it respectable again to be liberal on economic questions and conservative on social ones,” he said. \nCriticising Turnbull Government policy, Mr Abbott said he was in favour of renewables, provided they were economic and did not jeopardise security of supply. media_camera Mr Abbott has called on the Liberals to return to the centre right. Picture: AAP \nHe suggested a new approach to energy policy, drawing on an essay in the book on the subject that “exposes the disastrous muddle successive governments have created.” \n“We are sleepwalking towards what the head of BlueScope said this week was an energy policy ‘catastrophe’,” he said. \n“But it’s not Labor’s even more disastrous 50 per cent renewable target that’s caused the problem — it’s the existing renewable target which the government has no plans to change.” \nHe said under the Government’s plans, the wind generation would double in the next three years, costing consumers $10 billion. \n“We subsidise wind to make coal uneconomic so now we are proposing to subside coal to keep the lights on. Go figure. Wouldn’t’ it be better to abolish subsidies for new renewable generation and let ordinary market forces do the rest? \n“Of course that would trigger the mother-of-all-brawls in the senate, but what better way to let voters know that the Coalition wants your power bill down, while Labor wants it up? \nMr Abbott said the likelihood of defeat in the senate “never stopped the Howard government trying to change the unfair dismissal laws.” \n“Over forty times we tried and failed and each attempt meant that we burnished our small business credentials and Labor damaged theirs,” he said.
