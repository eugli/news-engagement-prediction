Scott Maxwell Taking Names \nTrying to pick the worst bill the Florida Legislature ever passed is like trying to find the stinkiest cow patty on a 1,000-acre farm. \nStill, a top contender has to be the so-called “Docs vs. Glocks” bill that attempted to tell doctors what they can talk about in the privacy of their exam rooms. \nLast week, a federal appeals court gutted this unconstitutional bill that Gov. Rick Scott , Attorney General Pam Bondi and legislators spent six years trying to defend. \nBasically, the court said that, no matter how badly the NRA wants to concoct conspiracies about doctors teaming up with government to take your guns, government can’t tell doctors what they can talk about with their patients. \nWhy? Because this isn’t Cuba. In America, we have free speech. \nYet as ridiculous as this bill was, the original version — filed by Sanford Republican Rep. Jason Brodeur in 2011 — was even worse. It called for imprisoning doctors who discussed guns with their patients. \nYes, prison. \nIt didn’t matter if the doctor was a psychiatrist, and the patient had just said he was feeling particularly homicidal. Brodeur wanted to jail doctors who asked questions that violated patients’ “privacy.” \nBrodeur also wanted to fine doctors up to $5 million — an amount larger than some Lotto jackpots. (Murder, by the way, carries a fine of $15,000 in Florida.) \nIt was like someone gave Brodeur a bad idea, a box of crayons and a blacked-out copy of the Constitution and asked him to draft a bill. \nNormally, I can see both sides of controversial issues. But the only other side to this one was ignorance. It was clearly unconstitutional. The Legislature’s own analysts warned as much. \nBut Scott and Republican legislators had the NRA to appease and a fake crisis to confront, pointing to 2010 incident in Ocala where the parents of a newborn stormed out of an appointment with their pediatrician. \nThe doctor had asked the couple the kind of basic safety questions they often ask new parents: Do you have a pool at home? If so, is it fenced? Do you have dangerous chemicals? If so, are they out of reach? Do you have a gun — and if so, it safely stored? \nIt was that last question that prompted hissy fits. The NRA demanded a new law — because that’s apparently what you do when someone says something you don’t like … you try to get government to jail them. \nNRA lobbyist Marion Hammer said the real problem was that the doctor allegedly refused to treat the patients after they refused to answer his questions. (Not for owning a gun, mind you. But for refusing to answer questions about safety.) Hammer argued it would be like a doctor conditioning his or her treatment based on how his or her patients voted. \nLike, say, a doctor who put a sign on his door that said: \"If you voted for Obama ... seek urologic care elsewhere.\" \nExcept, guess what? That happened. In Lake County a few years back. And sure, it generated controversy. But nobody tried to lock that doc up or pass new legislation. Why? Because not every little stink requires a new law. \nIf you don’t like something your doctor says, get a new doctor! \nOh, and complaints about doctors violating a patients’ “privacy” sound ridiculous when you consider the other things that doctors … um … probe. \nLegislators ultimately watered down the Brodeur’s bill before passing it. They reduced the fine from $5 million to $10,000 and replaced the threat of prison with a threat of discipline from the state medical board. \nBut the federal appeals court — in a 10-1 bipartisan beat down — said the heart of the law was still invalid. The court did agree that doctors can’t refuse treatment to patients simply because they own guns. But that was never the issue. Heck, some of the doctors fighting this ban said they own guns, too. They just wanted the right to freely discuss safety. \nThis should be the end of things. Unfortunately in Florida, politicians don’t always let things like common sense and court rulings get in their way. \nThe pediatricians who challenged this law deserve credit for sticking with it, caring about public safety and respecting the Constitution. \nIf only our politicians did the same.
