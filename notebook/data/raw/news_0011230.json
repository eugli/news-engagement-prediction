I'm so mad,' wrote one customer on Twitter alongside a photo of swatches of the two.\n'Kylie Cosmetics has been repackaging their general line lipsticks and making them limited edition. Example: spice and blitzen,' tweeted another frustrated fan this week, who also pointed out the price disparity between the two.\nThe Spice lip kit, which includes a lip liner, costs $29, while Blitzen was only available as part of a four-piece set (sans liner) that sold for $45.\nSlightly different or exactly the same? Customers claim that Blitzen (left), a limited-edition holiday launch, and Spice (right), an older collection mainstay, are identical shades\nKylie has yet to comment on the situation, but the controversy doesn't seem to have affected the excitement surrounding the opening of the Kylie Cosmetics New York City pop-up shop.\nAn Instagram photo posted today of the store's exterior has racked up more than 100,000 likes in less than an hour.\nThe shop, located on 27 Mercer Street, officially opens on Monday, February 13 at 10AM.", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQQ2QlujgN6/?taken-by=kyliecosmetics", "https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/collections/matte-lip-kits/products/spice-lip-kit", "http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/celeb-beauty/news/a44902/kylie-cosmetics-spice-blitzen-lip-shades-the-same/?src=socialflowFB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:56:03.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
