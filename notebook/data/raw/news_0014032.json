The nappy-wearing robot appears to breathe, moves its arms and legs, and opens and closes its eyes.

Her face evokes the golden mask of Tutankhamun, discovered five years before her creation, yet she also inspired future robots, including C3PO from the Star Wars series.

After a glitzy career as a performer, he became the mascot for an Essex car dealership and then languished outside at the Southend Historic Aircraft Museum. He was eventually salvaged and restored.

While some boast guns, lasers and even rocket launchers, others incorporate more mundane technologies, including television screens and motor car engines.

One of the most terrifying robot villains to date, it has contributed to preconceptions of what robots might become.

The robots can move just like humans, but in time experience familiar problems, such as worn out joints.

All eyes and lips, the robot dispensed directions, information and plenty of attitude when its sarcasm setting was turned up.

It can navigate independently in new environments using sound, laser, infrared and incline sensors. It is one of a growing range of service robots that may one day work alongside humans in places ranging from hospitals to shopping centres.

The £50,000 metal man can tell jokes and perform songs and plays in one of thirty languages. The robot uses its expressive eyes and body language to engage with its audience.

Over the past 10 years, the robot has worked out how to sit up, crawl, reach for objects and use them.
