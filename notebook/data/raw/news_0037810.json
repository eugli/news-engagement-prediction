Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, who was considering vetoing the bill over cost concerns, decided not to act on Wednesday night.\nThe bill now goes to Congress, as all local legislation does in the nation’s capital. Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week took steps to undo a new city law allowing assisted suicide, and have indicated they may try to roll back the city’s gun control laws and block it from using local tax dollars to fund abortions for poor women. But observers said it seemed less likely that Republicans would attempt to block the family leave law, since there is greater bipartisan support for the idea - although business leaders opposed a new payroll tax needed to cover the benefits in the District.\nUnder the legislation, passed by the D.C. Council in December, the District would guarantee more paid family leave for private-sector workers than any of the states. It wouldrival New York’s plan to begin phasing in more than two months of paid leave after the birth of a child.\nThe D.C. bill guarantees up to eight weeks of paid time off to new parents, six weeks to workers caring for ailing family members and two weeks of personal sick time. Workers could begin claiming the benefit in 2020.\nBowser, a Democrat, had split from many in her party — including former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who praised the D.C. bill — by raising concerns about cost.\nThe Washington Post\nThe first-term mayor signed legislation last year to raise the District’s hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Bowser said she also supported the idea of family leave, but was swayed by arguments that the city needed to move more slowly to understand the combined impacts of family leave and higher wages, especially on small businesses.\nBowser also said the bill would send too much tax revenue out of the District, to those who work in the city but live in Maryland and Virginia.\nBut in the end, Bowser appeared hesitant to test the power of her veto, as it remained unclear whether she could muster five votes needed to sustain it on the 13-member council.\nThe D.C. Council has shifted to the left over a series of recent elections, mirroring the progressive mind set of the city’s increasingly younger and more affluent residents.\nIn a letter to the D.C. Council, Bowser nonetheless blasted the legislation, saying she still has “grave concerns” about its cost.\nThe mayor said that while she would not veto it, she would not sign the legislation, letting it take effect without her endorsement.\nBowser also suggested continued resistance to the plan, saying she may not fund its implementation in her next budget, leaving that task to the council.\n“While the legislation will advance without my signature, my Administration will look to our partners on the Council to provide ways to overcome the very significant deficiencies,” Bowser wrote. “The Council must fund and refine the legislation before any significant outlays of resources can be made.”\nCouncil Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said he was thrilled that the legislation would become law and said he would entertain alternative funding schemes for the estimated $250 million annual cost of providing the benefits.\nCouncil members Elissa Silverman and David Grosso, at-large independents who co-introduced the legislation, both celebrated.\n“I’m happy for the many people who shared very personal stories with me — often heartbreaking stories — about choosing between caring for a loved one or keeping a paycheck,” Silverman said. “This program will help them weather the critical life events when they need help the most.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:57:18.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
