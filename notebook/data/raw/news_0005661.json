(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nAT&T says Indianapolis will be one of two test markets for its 5G wireless network, which could offer peak speeds of 400 megabits per second. \nThe technology is expected to launch in \"the coming months\" in Indianapolis and Austin, Texas, a news release said. AT&T will offer dedicated indoor and outdoor 5G locations. It will test signal coverage and evaluate the performance. \n“Indiana has always been a national leader in embracing innovation and technology advancements,\" said Bill Soards, president of AT&T Indiana, in an emailed statement. \"I'm thrilled AT&T has recognized that and plans one of our first 5G Evolution Markets in Indianapolis this year,” \nAT&T gave no further details. \nThe announcement came Wednesday during an innovation event in San Francisco as part of the company's \"5G Evolution\" plan, the news release said. The telecommunications giant said the plan could ultimately lead to a network capable of supporting self-driving cars, mobile augmented reality and virtual reality. \nDownload speeds for 4G LTE can approach 100 megabits per second. \nVerizon and AT&T have both said they'll enter into the 5G world in 2017. \n\"Don't expect to walk into a store and buy the 5G phone of your choosing once the service is ready,\" though, tech website endgadget says . There is no 5G standard yet. And new cellular wireless technology tends to launch with few hardware choices. \nCall Amy Bartner at (317) 444-6752 and follow her on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:45:27.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
