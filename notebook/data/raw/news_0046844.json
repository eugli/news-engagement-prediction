California Highway Patrol - Truckee 1 of 2 i \nBy Dale Kasler, Ryan Sabalow and Peter Hecht \nCalifornia got just what it needed Tuesday – a break in the relentless shower of rainstorms – but thousands of residents were dealing with street flooding and evacuations, and the risk of high waters persisted up and down the Central Valley. \nIn Sacramento County, after Deer Creek overflowed its banks, flooding streets in Rio Linda early Tuesday, county emergency officials set up an evacuation center at the Cal Expo fairgrounds. Portions of Rio Linda Boulevard were closed due to flooding, and commuters also encountered water flowing across Watt Avenue at Base Line Road, Auburn-Folsom Road at King Road and elsewhere, according to the California Highway Patrol. \nThe National Weather Service reported that Monday’s storm system brought 1.69 inches of rain to Sacramento, breaking a century-old record for Feb. 20. \nMore broadly in California, the state’s major rivers, while swollen, appeared manageable Tuesday, and the crisis at Oroville Dam appeared stable, despite a slight uptick in overnight water levels. Nonetheless, experts cautioned that considerable threats loom throughout the state, particularly in areas south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. \nA levee breach in a rural area near Manteca , which forced the evacuation of about 500 residents, was reported patched Tuesday. New Don Pedro Dam in Tuolumne County opened its spillway gates Monday for the first time since the great flood of January 1997, and although the water releases weren’t as high as originally expected, they will put stress on downstream levees leading into the Modesto area. \n“Just the continued pressure on those levees is of some concern,” said Alan Haynes of the federal government’s California Nevada River Forecast Center. \nReleases from the Don Pedro spillway were reduced slightly overnight, but flows in the Tuolumne River channel downstream are above flood stage, and are poised to spill into farmland, parkland and trailer parks that line the channel. The flows are expected to hit the Modesto area around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, and could some flooding. \nThe Turlock Irrigation District, which manages the dam, will continue releases from the spillway for at least the next four days, said Calvin Curtin, a district spokesman. \n“Beyond that, it will really depend upon flow conditions, the amount of inflow we’re getting into the back of the reservoir, and the projected weather conditions,” he said. “The weather is going to drive our operations.” \nHaynes said there’s often a lag of a day or so between big storms, or significant reservoir releases, and the impact downstream. Despite the dry spell, he said, “We still have to be vigiliant.” Vernalis, at a crucial chokepoint in the Delta outside of Stockton, was considered at the “danger stage” because of high water on the San Joaquin River. \nJay Lund, the head of UC Davis’ Center for Watershed Studies, said Californians can expect to stay on guard for flooding for several more weeks. “We’ll certainly have a few days to dump out as much as they can from these full-to-the-top reservoirs, and get ready for the next one,” Lund said. “I think it’s going to go that way until April.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:42:06.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
