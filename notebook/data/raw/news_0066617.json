The Crown is seeking a life sentence in that case.\nThe victims, a 16-year-old girl and 23-year-old woman at the time of the attacks, cannot be named because of a publication ban.\nThe first attack was on the 16-year-old. She was attacked, sexually assaulted and left for dead in the freezing Assiniboine River.\nHours later the 23-year-old woman was repeatedly attacked, sexually assaulted and confined behind the Sherbrook Pool before being allowed to leave.\nComack told court these were random attacks, which involved a hammer and a bat.\n\"The facts themselves are utterly horrific,\" Comack told court. \"The things that happened to [the victims] should only be born in the minds of the most twisted entertainment writers.\"\nThe teen offender's defence lawyer Steven Keesic is seeking a sentence of seven years.\nKeesic also asked the judge to consider a concurrent sentence.\n\"A 20 year sentence is far too crushing for this individual,\" said Keesic. \"It's far too long for a youthful offender like this.\"\nKeesic told court his client has had no prior involvement with the criminal justice system.\nKeesic also explained how his client suffers from significant cognitive delays and was exposed to domestic violence and substance abuse as a child.\n“This is someone who’s gone through a host of issues in terms of his childhood,” Keesic told court.\nWhen asked by the judge if he wanted to address the court the man stood up and apologized to his victims.\n“First of all I’d like to say I’m sorry,” the man told court. “I have really bad dreams about what I did.”\nThe man explained he too was a victim of sexual abuse when he was a child so he understands what the victims are going through.\n“They’re going to have to live with this for the rest of their lives. So do I. It’s going to be more hard on them than it is on me.”\nThe man then sat down in the prisoner’s dock, sobbing with his head hanging low out of the gallery’s view.\nComack told court the fact the teen pleaded guilty, has no prior record and was diagnosed with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder was taken into account.\nHowever, Comack told court the teen's ARND diagnosis is not related to the crime because his “impulse control was not severely impaired.”\n“It’s the Crown’s position his moral blameworthiness should remain significant,” Comack told court.\nThe judge in the case has reserved his decision in the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:59:53.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
