She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. \" Warren was shut down after she spoke out against Trump's nominee for Attorney General, Jeff Sessions , who, as of Wednesday night, has officially been confirmed as the Attorney General of the United States. \nWithin no time, \"nevertheless, she persisted\" merchandise starting hitting Etsy's virtual shelves, because much like when Donald Trump referred to Hillary Clinton as a \" nasty woman ,\" women were quick to take ownership of something that was meant to be negative. \"Nevertheless, she persisted\" is the perfect rallying cry for women in the US (and the world) who feel belittled by the current administration. Because we won't give up. We will persist in this fight for equality. \n\"Nevertheless, she persisted\" merch is the new \"nasty woman\" merch, and in record time, Etsy shop owners managed to create plenty of items with the quote, including t-shirts, tote bags, necklaces, pins â€” you name it. These producers are really on top of things, because I'm not even sure I heard this quote by the time many of them had already created a whole \"nevertheless, she persisted\" line. Senator McConnell said \"Nevertheless she persisted\" less than 24 hours ago. YOU BETTER BELIEVE ALL OF ETSY GOT TO WORK.
