Photo by Ace Morandante/Presidential Photo \nMANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday night considered the option of immediately terminating government's ceasefire with the communist New People's Army (NPA) in the face of rebel attacks, Rappler learned on Friday morning, February 3. \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said lifting the 5-month-old ceasefire with the guerrillas \"is one of the options the President was toying with last night in the face of offensives launched by the CPP/NPA.\" Duterte was in Davao Thursday night. \nAsked if the President has issued any official order on it, Lorenzana said his department was still \"awaiting word from the Palace.\" \nA Malacañang official however confirmed that the President indeed decided on the lifting of the ceasefire Thursday night, February 2, and has in fact issued the order to Armed Forces chief of staff General Eduardo Año. \nThe order was for the military to \"lift the ceasefire immediately,\" the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said. \nThe AFP has not replied to our questions, but it is holding a press conference at noon Friday. \nRappler earlier obtained a text message sent to military commanders Thursday night about the plan of the President to lift the ceasefire. \"PRRD (President Rodrigo Roa Duterte) will lift the ceasefire tonite. CSAFP (Chief of staff, AFP) instruction is to consolidate all BTA/forces and go on offensive ASAP.\" BTA refers to Bayanihan Team Activities that are conducted by soldiers in communities for their \"people-centered\" projects but which the NPA describes as counter-insurgency operations. \nThe planned termination comes after the NPA lifted its own ceasefire on February 1. \nArmed clashes between the military and the NPA have occurred in the past two weeks, with the 2 armed groups accusing each other of committing ceasefire abuses and claiming they were only forced to fight back. \nDuterte is scheduled on Friday afternoon to visit the wake in Davao City of one of the soldiers killed in a clash with NPA rebels.
