That's not wrong, that's not immoral, that's not indecent.\" \nThe Alabama lawmaker, whose nomination was among Mr Trump's most controversial, resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues confirmed him. \nHe will now take charge of the justice department and its 113,000 employees, including 93 US attorneys.
