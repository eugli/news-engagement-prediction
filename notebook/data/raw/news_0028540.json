The founder of the one-man Freedom party, or PVV, prefers to control the narrative through Twitter. The “Dutch Trump” knows that the media will pick up news from his timeline.\nRead more Geert Wilders rises in Dutch polls after hate crime conviction But with five weeks to go until the elections, Mr Wilders is stepping up his campaign. A new video shows he aims to emulate the changes brought by Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory. His slogan: “The Netherlands is ours again.” His one-page, 11-point programme aims to “de-Islamise” the Netherlands and shut the borders to immigrants.\nDuring Sunday’s interview, he expanded on how he would achieve some of his goals, some of which contradict the Dutch constitutional right to freedom of religion. Asked how a ban on the Quran would work in practice, Mr Wilders compared it to the Dutch ban on Adolf Hitler’s biography Mein Kampf.\nHe said he would “of course” not confiscate Qurans from people’s homes. Previously he has stated that mere ownership of the book, which he calls more antisemitic than Hitler's tract, should be a crime. He seems to have mellowed that stance but stood by his position that it should be banned from bookstores and only be available to scholars.\nHe also reiterated his position that mosques should close, saying he would take away their licences rather than closing them by force. \nOne of the reasons for watering down his positions could be that Mr Wilders was clear that he intends to govern. He dismissed vows by other political parties that they would not rule with his party. If his party is the biggest, they would simply have no choice, he claimed. \"I am sure that if the voter makes the PVV truly big, they will have to.”\nAnd Mr Wilders repeated his position that he expects people to rise up if his party is not given the chance to govern. “You can’t just ignore the will of 2.5 million people,” he said. \nRead more Geert Wilders: The far-right Dutch politician who could be the next PM Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders guilty in hate speech trial Geert Wilders hails Donald Trump's victory as 'Patriotic Spring' Dutch anti-Islam politician's hate speech trial begins in his absence UN’s human rights chief compares Trump, Farage and Wilders to Isis One supporter who is happy to take to the streets if that happens is Dave Wetsteijn, a 40-year-old welder from Rotterdam. “For sure I want him to be Prime Minister,” he told The Independent , adding “we cannot just be ignored.”\nMr Wetsteijn said he lost his job in the port city when his boss hired cheaper Polish labour instead. He is drawn by Mr Wilders’ message of putting Dutch people first.\nMr Wilders’ pledge that no money would be sent abroad for development is also music to his ears. “I am living off unemployment benefits, the government should be supporting the local population, rather than focusing on foreigners,” he said.\nPolls predict Mr Wilders will be the biggest winner after the Dutch elections on 15 March, with close to one in five Dutch voters opting for his PVV. But that will give him only roughly 30 out of 150 seats in parliament, forcing him to rely on other parties to form a coalition.\nAlmost all of the 28 parties that are running have already ruled out the option of working with the PVV. That includes Prime Minster Mark Rutte’s Liberal VVD Party, which is closest to Mr Wilders, both in terms of platform and polling numbers. \nSunday’s interview caused Rutte to resort to Mr Wilders’ preferred medium of communication for the first time in six years. From his personal Twitter account he reiterated his earlier pledge that there was “zero per cent” chance that the VVD would join a coalition with the right wing outcast.\nSome PVV voters are counting on other parties sticking to their promises. Gerrit van Hes, a wheelchair salesman from the city of Dordrecht, says the reason he is voting for the PVV is to send a wake-up call to the politicians in The Hague.\n“It’s a protest vote,” he freely admitted. He hopes a large turnout for the PVV will force other political parties to adopt Mr Wilders’ views on immigration and the EU. But he does not want Wilders to govern. “Having Wilders as Prime Minister would not be good for our country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:05:52.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
