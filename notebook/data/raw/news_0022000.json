Zion-Benton's Rod Henry-Hayes prepares to slam a dunk during Friday's game with Waukegan. (Mark Kodiak Ukena / Lake County News-Sun) Privacy Policy \nPlayers and coaches from the Waukegan boys basketball team came over and hugged members of Malik Brown's family at half court. \nThe school had just completed a ceremony in honor of Brown, who died in a car crash last weekend. \nThere were songs and then a moment of silence for Brown, 17, who was a member of the Bulldogs' sophomore team. \nAnd there also was the game against Zion-Benton. And what a game it was. \nDamarquis Henry made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 51.8 seconds remaining Friday and the Zee-Bees held on for a 73-70 North Suburban victory at Waukegan. \nHenry's 3-pointer gave the Zee-Bees (18-8, 8-3) a 71-70 lead. Jaalen Ray made two free throws with 6.5 seconds left to wrap up the win. \nHenry scored 21 points and Ray had 16. Rod Henry-Hayes led the Zee-Bees with 23 points before fouling out. \nDeShawn Davidson and Bryant Brown both scored 22 points for Waukegan (14-8, 6-4). \nDavidson helped Waukegan to a fast start. He scored seven of the Bulldogs' first 11 points. He stole the ball and then scored a layup to give Waukegan an 11-4 lead with 4:53 remaining in the first quarter. \nDavidson made a jumper with 21 seconds left in the first quarter to extend Waukegan's lead to 22-9. \nIt looked like a blowout was in the works. But then the Zee-Bees started to rally. Zion-Benton used a 13-2 spurt to get within 24-22 in the second quarter. \nHenry-Hayes led the way during the comeback, scoring nine of the Zee-Bees' 13 points in the stretch. \nDavison made a jumper for Waukegan, but Henry answered with a banked 3-pointer to make it 26-25 with 5:21 left in the first half. That's as close as Zion-Benton would get for the rest of the half. \nDavidson scored seven points during an 8-2 streak as Waukegan stretched its lead to 34-27. \nThe Bulldogs closed the half with another 8-2 streak and led 42-33 at halftime. \nCarson Newsome made a 3-pointer to give Waukegan a 49-39 lead in the third quarter. Zion-Benton got within six, but baskets by Bryant Brown and Ja'Dyn Brown extended Waukegan's lead to 55-45 with 2:20 remaining in the third quarter. \nZion-Benton cut its deficit to 55-50 with two free throws by Henry-Hayes with 55.1 seconds left in the quarter. Waukegan led 57-50 heading into the fourth. \nZion-Benton fought all the way back to tie the game at 60. Ray scored while getting fouled and then made the free throw to tie the game with 6:36 remaining. \nIt remained tight to the end, with Henry coming through late to lead the Zee-Bees to the win. \nTwitter @lamondpope", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:42:43.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
