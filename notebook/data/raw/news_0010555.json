KNEE INJURY \nIt seems to be a double standard as well, as those calling Joe a menace are the same ones that criticised Rollins for injuring Finn Balor, Sting and John Cena, but that’s a different story.

Article continues below Watch: The moment Zlatan Ibrahimovic ended Christian Fuchs' career \nHis actions caused WWE to hold an emergency creative meeting, which could have changed the matches for Triple H, John Cena, and more. \nRegardless of that, PWInsider have reported that there is actually no heat on Joe whatsoever, even if WWE do end up shuffling their plans. \nThey’re claiming that it was just a freak accident, and it could have happened to anyone. NO HEAT ON JOE \nThey wrote: “I think it will be looked at as a case of bad luck and sad irony. \n“If WWE blamed Joe for the Tyson Kidd injury, they would have never allowed Joe to use the Muscle Buster again, and he has regularly in NXT. \n“The Rollins injury was obviously just a freak thing, it’s just that Joe happened to be the person he was in the ring with. If there was any heat on him, they certainly wouldn’t be having Joe boast and take credit for the injury.” \nThat seems to be the biggest indication that it’s not as serious as it was first feared, as WWE wouldn’t have allowed Joe to boast about it on social media if he ruined the WrestleMania plans. \nIt’s a good job WWE aren’t taking any action, especially as it was the day of his debut but sadly, the injury overshadowed it. \nShould there be heat on Samoa Joe for Seth Rollins’ injury?
