While Airbnb has started collecting Colorado taxes for hosts , Denver doesn’t anticipate adopting a rule to allow collection by the site until this summer, a factor that could be prompting some hosts to wait to get licensed. \nTechnically, short-term rentals of less than 30 days weren’t allowed under city ordinance before the new regulations were approved. But the practice had flourished in the city before regulators caught up, so officials still are working to get the majority of hosts to comply. \nSo far, Rowland said, the city has issued 947 short-term rental licenses — more than double the 420 that had been issued by late December. \nBut a key restriction in Denver’s ordinance is forcing many hosts who rent out second homes or investment properties to make a choice: change how they operate, or flout the law. Denver’s rules allow short-term rentals only for primary residences and separate dwelling units on the same property, such as a carriage house. \nFor months, city licensing inspectors had sent compliance notices — including to some of the recipients of the new violations, Rowland said — and they have rolled out a social-media campaign called “Stay Legit Denver.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:05:16.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
