BCT Architects The first building in the redevelopment of the 25-acre Pemco Corp. site across from Johns Hopkins Bayview in East Baltimore was unveiled Thursday and its design will pay homage to the industrial history of the site. A 34,000-square-foot LA Fitness gym is expected to open in the first phase of the $80 million to $100 million redevelopment in mid-2018, said Russ Robertson, a representative for developer MCB Real Estate. A rendering of the planned LA Fitness near Johns Hopkins Bayview on the former Pemco site. BCT Architects The gym's design is part of a new corporate prototype for LA Fitness. The design features a large workout room, 12-foot windows, a swimming pool and a parking lot facing Eastern Avenue that could hold up to 200 spaces. The city's Urban Design and Architecture Review Panel on Thursday received the design from Studio 222 Architects of Chicago with enthusiasm. \"I am excited about the project,\" said UDARP member Gary Bowden. \"I urge you to retain some of the history of the site â€” those elements saved make all the difference in the world.\" Robertson pledged to do so, saying some of the industrial characteristics of the Pemco property like a steel tower visible from Eastern Avenue would be retained and incorporated into designs still evolving. \"The symbol of this site and its history\" will be preserved, he pledged. The Pemco company once manufactured porcelain and enamel surfaces for bathtubs and sinks. It also was the manufacturing plant for the large, spiked roof of Howard Johnson hotels, a landmark in many U.S. cities before the chain shut down. The plant has been dormant for decades and today is a rusty, decrepit eyesore. It is located at 5610 Eastern Ave. MCB has been working on development plans for years. Robertson said that environmental remediation at the site and demolition are set to begin in the coming months. \"It's a complicated site, not easy,\" he said of the property because of its need for post-industrial cleanup. BCT Architects of Baltimore is the master architect of the project. Other components of the development include two hotels, 200 residential units and about 100,000 square feet of retail.
