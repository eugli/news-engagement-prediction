The new policy aims to map out strategies to expand, diversify and strengthen the product base and market size while increasing the competitiveness of exporters by facilitating world-class export infrastructure and institutional support. Speaking to TOI, state industries minister Rajpal Singh Shekhawat said, \"Rajasthan has huge untapped exports potential. The overarching objective of the Export Promotion Policy is to double the shipments from Rs 36,000 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 72,000 crore by 2022. We expect the policy to be announced in coming months.\" Shekhawat said one of the most impactful ways of boosting exports is diversification of both products and markets, and the thrust areas will also cover value-addition, encouraging adoption of latest technologies, skills development and finding ways to make finance available to exporters. Rajasthan is traditionally strong in handicrafts, gems and jewellery, stones, agro and food products, and textile products but its share in the national exports basket is just 2% despite being the largest state in geographical terms. \"The policy aims to assess productive capacity in key sectors, and identify constraints such as skills gaps, technology, equipment, and finance to increase production and exports while formulating sector level strategies for the key identified areas of intervention,\" said Ajitabh Sharma, Commissioner, Industries. Sharma said the policy will have strategies that would help the state's exporters tap the national and global value chain. Recently, Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank) entered into a MoU with the state government for financing, facilitating and promoting exports. One of the focus areas under the agreement was the preparation of state export strategy paper that would provide a holistic framework for enhancing trade competitiveness, promoting innovation, bolstering availability of finance, and strengthening the institutional capacity for exports. As part of the plan, Exim Bank mandated ICRA Management Consulting Services Ltd (IMaCS) to prepare a strategy paper to lay down targets and prepare a roadmap, the draft of which is now in the public domain for suggestions and improvements. While industry bodies are optimistic that the export policy will kick-start a new phase of expansion and growth, some of them suggested that promotion councils will also go a long way in giving fillip to the sector. For example, CII-Rajasthan has already made a case for State Export Promotion Council for handicrafts on the lines of Export Promotion Council of Handicrafts (EPCH). \"It won't create much burden on the state government. Rather, it will bring funds from the Centre for export promotion, buyer-seller meets, trade shows, missions, etc. Uttar Pradesh has set up similar Export Promotion Bureau and the industries there are in an advantageous position as many incentives are being given to them which are being passed from the Centre to the bureau but not to industries directly,\" CII-Rajasthan had earlier said in its pre-budget recommendations to the state government.
