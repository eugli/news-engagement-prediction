More than three dozen firefighters and nine trucks were on the scene to tackle the blaze. \nOfficials say they had a difficult time controlling the fire because the three-storey building is currently under construction, with no separation between the floors. High winds also hampered efforts to douse the flames.\nEmergency officals tell CTV news that the building is vacant and that no one was inside at the time. As a precaution, they did evacuate the neighbouring business attached to the building.\nOuellette Avenue was closed in both directions between Pitt and University.\nPhotos Thick, black smoke was spotted coming from the former Pour House Pub in downtown Windsor on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017.
