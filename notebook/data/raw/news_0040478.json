Trends Russia-NATO relations \n“I’m glad that NATO is still interested in talking to us... and look forward to discussing some practical things,” the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the start of the meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. \nIn a brief courtesy exchange that followed, NATO’s chief noted that the alliance “strongly favors” a dialogue with Russia, to which Lavrov replied slightly laughing: “I know, I know, from the position of force.” \n“From a predictable and a… predictable position,” a seemingly confused Stoltenberg insisted, also with a smile, before the meeting between the Russian and the NATO delegations got under way behind closed doors. \nFollowing the talks, Stoltenberg was quick to point out to reporters that the decision to unilaterally suspend cooperation with Russia in April 2014 “ still stands.” A post shared by МИД России / Russia's MFA (@mfarussia) on Feb 17, 2017 at 1:35pm PST \n“But we have underlined that the suspension of practical cooperation does not mean that we suspend political dialogue,” Stoltenberg noted, according to TASS, adding that “it’s useful to have dialogue also on issues where we have different views, like for instance Ukraine.” Read more Putin: NATO keeps trying to draw Russia into confrontation, meddle in internal affairs \nThe head of NATO said they discussed a wide range of issues, including Libya and Syria. \n“So there is room for dialogue and for engagement with Russia even though we continue to suspend our practical cooperation,” he said. \nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said after the meeting that the parties had discussed the “current state and prospects of relations between Russia and NATO,” touching on a number of issues on the “international and European agenda.” \nRelations between Russia and NATO ceased after Crimea voted to join Russia following a government coup in Ukraine in 2014. \nMoscow has long been accusing NATO of threatening its borders with crawling expansion and a significant air and military buildup.
