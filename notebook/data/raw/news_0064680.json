The one minute video attempts to present the other side of the Queen of the Eastern Seaboard. It starts by posing the question: \"A tour to Pattaya - is this what they mean by sex capital and sin city?\" A series of slides on their Facebook page shows islands with \"water as clear as the Andaman sea\", astonishing attractions like \"a Buddhist image cut by laser into the hillside as well as a wonderful garden on 1,700 rai (Nong Nooch) and a floating market. \n\n\nThe video claims that culture from all over Thailand can be seen in one place. There are traditional dances and shadow puppets. \n\nPattaya has it all - Walking Street is mentioned just in passing with the tagline \"party time and shopping\". \n\nThe video was shared many times and inspired a fair amount of comment in agreement with the sentiments of Thai Rath. \n\nMost comments centered around the fact that it was true that the resort had more than just sin and sex. \n\nBesides, said many posters, what city in the world doesn't have its seedy side? \n\nBut poster Weerawit Yaovaja said: Don't be na√Øve - you only have to Google 'Pattaya sex show\" or go on YouTube to know what Pattaya is all about. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:11:09.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
