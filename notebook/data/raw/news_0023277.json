With only four months remaining on his current deal, the forward is currently free to speak to any interested clubs.\nHis preference is to remain in situ at Ibrox, where he recently took up a development squad coaching post, and he has gone as far as holding face-to-face talks with the club’s hierarchy over a new contract.\nBut Miller, arguably the standout performer in the Rangers team this season, has been left in the dark as to whether the extension manager Mark Warburton is keen to offer him will be forthcoming or not from the board.\nKenny Miller, scoring against Motherwell last month, has been in fine form for Rangers\nMiller signed off from international duty after scoring in a 3-2 friendly loss at Wembley in 2013\nAs the Ibrox club stall and Miller approaches what could be the final months of his third spell at the club, Terry Butcher admits he can foresee the striker pulling on a different strip in the very near future. But the change of kit the former Rangers and England captain has in mind for Miller is the dark blue of Scotland.\nNational team manager Gordon Strachan welcomed back Celtic captain Scott Brown from international retirement for the World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley in November, which Scotland started brightly before losing 3-0.\nNow Butcher feels that Miller’s fine performances for Rangers this season should also make him a prime candidate for a shock recall at the ripe old age of 37.\nOn March 22, Strachan’s side face Canada in a friendly at Easter Road before a make-or-break qualifier four days later against Slovenia at Hampden. Butcher believes Miller’s form marks him out as the man who can sharpen toothless Scotland’s attack and rescue the nation’s flickering hopes of reaching Russia 2018.\n‘Kenny Miller is the one who has kept Rangers going this season,’ said Butcher.\n‘Sometimes you think he has run his course and then he pops up with a great goal. He is one of those people who leads by example and puts everything into what he does.\n‘For a 37-year-old, he really puts himself about and he hurts his body. You can see the pain there in what he does, but he loves to do it.\nMiller has been one of the few bright spots in a season of woe for Rangers\n‘There are maybe other players who might think they deserve to be picked for Scotland in front of Kenny Miller. But these days there seem to be older players enjoying Indian summers and doing very well towards the end of their careers. Gordon Strachan might be looking more long-term than short-term, but, when it comes down to World Cup qualification, you need to get short-term results.\n‘And I don’t see any reason why, on a short-term basis, Kenny couldn’t make an appearance. That might well be the boost the country needs.\n‘Kenny wouldn’t just be there to make up the numbers. There is no substitute for experience and he’s been the best Rangers striker this season without a shadow of a doubt.’\nMiller’s last appearance for his country came in a friendly at Wembley in August 2013 when he scored a terrific goal in Scotland’s 3-2 defeat. He retired immediately afterwards having scored 18 times in 69 appearances for his country.\nButcher recalls being impressed by Miller’s contributions on and off the field when he was assistant to Scotland manager George Burley from 2008 to 2009.\nWith Miller having scored big international goals against Italy and Germany, in addition to England, the only game Butcher hopes he isn’t given the nod for is the qualifier against Gareth Southgate’s Three Lions at Hampden this summer.\n‘I just hope he is on his holidays by June 10,’ he smiled.\n‘If I was Gareth and Kenny was to play a part against England at Hampden, you’d be thinking it would just be Sod’s Law for him to pop up with a goal.\nTerry Butcher insists the return of Miller would give England boss Gareth Southgate problems\n‘That would be my fear, certainly. I’ve worked with Kenny with Scotland before and he is a good influence off the park, too.\n‘He is quite quiet, but what he says matters.\n‘I’ve known him to get up and say one or two things within the Scotland squad and his opinion was always very strong, but it was also correct.\n‘He wasn’t the most experienced player in the squad at the time he stood up, but he did it because he felt something needed to be said.\n‘I respected him for that.’", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKt6UXz4ljg?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-08T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:31:14.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
