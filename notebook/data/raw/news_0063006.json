The worst of the attacks was at a Sufi shrine in southern Sindh province that killed 90 people. \nThursday’s bombing was the second attack in Lahore in two weeks. A suicide bombing on Feb. 13 killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 80 at a protest near the provincial assembly. \nGovernment and military officials have vowed extensive operations to hunt down militants across the country and Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan has been shut down due to security concerns. \nAfter the shrine bombing, Pakistani security forces said they had killed more than 100 suspected militants in targeted campaigns across the country. \n(Writing by Saad Sayeed; Editing by Nick Macfie) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:48:38.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
