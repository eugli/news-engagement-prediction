The mobile dental office, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and a professional staff, then parks outside of the business. \nHe says employees can go outside and have their teeth worked on in a fraction of the time it would take for a traditional appointment. \nDr. Fooshee said many busy professionals don’t have time to go to the dentist, but ignoring dental need leads to serious issues. \n“The people that put stuff off tend to come in with broken teeth, crowns fallen off and actually being in pain,” said Dr. Fooshee. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
