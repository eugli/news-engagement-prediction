Just how bad is United's upcoming run of games? As the race for trophies and the top four heats up, Sportsmail compares the fixture lists of the Premier League's top six over the next six weeks. United will certainly be busy over the next few weeks 11:27 RECAP: Here's how United reached this stage on Wednesday night \nSaint-Etienne 0-1 Manchester United (0-4 aggregate) \nChris Wheeler: Life without Wayne Rooney continues to bring progress for Manchester United. Five games played since their captain last appeared. Five wins, 11 goals scored, one conceded. \nThe only blemish as Jose Mourinho’s side eased into the last 16 of the Europa League at a boisterous Stade Geoffroy-Guichard were the injuries to goalscorer Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick that are likely to rule them out of the EFL Cup final against Southampton on Sunday. \n‘I think no chance,’ said Mourinho, who also saw Eric Bailly sent off after picking up two yellow cards in the space of three minutes in the second half. Henrikh Mkhitaryan celebrates his goal for United in Saint-Etienne 11:19 When will the last-16 ties take place? \nThis year's last 16 first-legs will be played on Thursday March 9 with the return legs a week later on March 16. \nThis has already caused concern for Jose Mourinho, with United set to play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup quarter-final on Monday March 13. \nThe tie was pushed back in order to be shown live on BBC television. \nHe said: 'I feel really surprised that the decision was made before our draw in Europe because at this moment nobody knows where we play, or where the first and second matches are. \n'Imagine we play Chelsea on Monday and go to the second match in Europe in Russia, Turkey or Greece? I think once more the interests are going in front of the clubs and English football's interests, and nobody cares about it. \n'I cannot play against Chelsea with the second team, I cannot play Chelsea with the Under-21s like Manchester City did last year. I cannot do that. We are Manchester United. \n'I don't do that as Manchester United manager. I don't do that to the FA Cup because the FA Cup is not guilty of these decisions. The FA Cup is beautiful, the competition is historical. I have to treat Manchester United supporters and the FA Cup in the right way. \n'I cannot go there with the Under-21s. Probably they would deserve it, but I don't do that.' Jose Mourinho has expressed his frustration at the fixture schedule next month 11:17 The scene is set at UEFA HQ All 16 teams ready for the #UELdraw — UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) February 24, 2017 11:16 Who can United draw? \nAt this stage of the competition, United can draw any of the 15 other remaining sides. There is no seeding any more. \nWith Tottenham being knocked out by Gent last night, United are the sole Premier League representatives left. \nThere are the 15 teams they could face: Ajax, Anderlecht, APOEL, Besiktas, Borussia Monchengladbach, Celta Vigo, Copenhagen, Genk, Gent, Krasnodar, Lyon, Olympiakos, Roma, Rostov, Schalke. 11:14 Where next for Manchester United? \nThey made light work of Saint-Etienne in the last-32, cruising through 4-0 on aggregate despite playing some of the second leg with 10 men. \nThis lunchtime, Manchester United will discover their next opponents in the UEFA Europa League as they bid to win the only European trophy they've never won. \nJose Mourinho will be keen to avoid a long trek at the last-16 stage, having already spoken out about the tight scheduling around their FA Cup quarter-final tie at Chelsea just three days before the second leg of this tie. \nSo the likes of Rostov, Krasnodar and Besiktas are definitely to be avoided. \nThe draw in Nyon, Switzerland starts at 12pm and we'll have full live coverage.
