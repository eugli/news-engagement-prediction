Get yourself up to speed with the league before it gets underway with a bang. When does it start? \nTonight ! Footy season has come early, but this isn't any pre-season scratch match nonsense. Carlton is playing Collingwood at Princes Park , and if that's not enough to get your footy juices flowing, then you are damn hard to please. \nThis is hell for leather for footy with premiership points on the line. In February! How good? Which clubs are in it? \nThere was an extensive application process, in which 13 of the AFL's 18 clubs applied for a license. But in the end, only eight teams were picked for the maiden voyage of the league. Photo: The Giants? In the comp. The Swans? Not in the comp. (AAP: Dean Lewins) \nThe lucky winners were Carlton, Collingwood, Western Bulldogs, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle, GWS and Adelaide. \nFans of the five other teams to apply — Geelong, Richmond, West Coast, St Kilda and North Melbourne — shouldn't despair though, as they have already been granted provisional licenses, and could appear in an expanded comp as early as next year. What do I do if my team isn't in it this year? \nGet yourself a new AFLW team! Nobody will question your loyalty if you adopt a squad specifically for this new comp, in fact, it should be encouraged. Photo: This is what they are playing for. (AAP: Joe Castro) \nObviously West Coast supporters might struggle to get behind Freo, for example, but maybe you want to get aboard the Doggies bandwagon? Always wanted to know what it was like to be a Collingwood supporter? Feel like the Giants are on the rise? Here's your chance to get involved. Which players should I be watching out for? \nYou've probably already heard of most of the big guns — Melbourne superstar Daisy Pearce is the best player in the land, Collingwood's Moana Hope is a top pick to lead the goalkicking and Tayla Harris has become famous for her technically superb kicking technique. Photo: The skippers, Susan Alberti and the cup. (AAP: Joe Castro) \nBut you'll also want to keep an eye on Dogs skipper Katie Brennan , Freo's Kara Donellan (whose nickname, ominously, is 'Juddy'), and veteran of eight VWFL flags Lauren Arnell , now captain of Carlton. \nThe best way to find out is to watch the games though, you'll have a new favourite player in no time. How does the comp work? \nSimple. Each team plays seven home and away games (one against every opponent), and the top two teams at the end of it all face off in the grand final. From February 3 to March 25, AFLW games are mostly free and played in five states and territories. Are there any different rules? \nNot really, but the games will be 16-a-side rather than the 18 used in the men's comp. Also the footy itself is a fraction smaller than the fellas kick about. \nAs an aside, the league has thrown out the interchange cap for the tournament, though that's due to the AFL's heat policy, not something specific to AFLW. Can I listen to it on the ABC? \nYou sure can! \nNewsRadio will carry one game per round throughout the eight-week season, starting with tonight's opener between Collingwood and Carlton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:30:52.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
