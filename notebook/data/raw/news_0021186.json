John Cornyn sided Wednesday with Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who cut off a speech the night before by liberal Massachusetts firebrand Elizabeth Warren opposing the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. \n\"This is not supposed to be a mud wrestling ring or a food fight,\" Cornyn said. \nIt started Tuesday when Warren took to the Senate floor to read statements from the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Coretta Scott King, the widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., criticizing Sessions' record on civil rights. \nMcConnell accused Warren of impugning Sessions on the Senate floor, a violation of Senate rules designed to maintain decorum. In particular, Republicans took umbrage at the use of Kennedy's words from 1986 describing Sessions as a \"disgrace.\" \nThe dust-up turned a late night speech to a nearly deserted Senate chamber into a national news story, elevating Warren into a Democratic hero. McConnell's complaint that Warren had been warned and that \"she persisted,\" became a rallying cry for her supporters, including Hillary Clinton. \nOn Wednesday, some of the same passages were read on the Senate floor by other Democratic senators without objection. \nBut Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said the party-line vote to rebuke Warren was appropriate. \"Senator Warren tried to hide behind other people's words,\" he said, \"by basically reading their words and suggesting it was them speaking and not her.\" \nHe characterized Warren's speech as \"a sign of the times where we have kind of a race to the bottom.\" Too often in the Senate, he added, lawmakers \"fail to treat each other with the civility and decorum that I think goes along with the privilege of serving in the Senate.\" \nCornyn demurred when he was asked about a 2015 floor speech in which Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz attacked McConnell's integrity, saying he was \"willing to say things that he knows are false.\" \n\"No one raised a point of order at that time,\" Cornyn noted, \"and I think that's the best answer to that... As I said, we can all do better.\" Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
