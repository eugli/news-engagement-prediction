There was this electric buzz going around, knowing it was the last time we’d be out in the woods, or in the town, or wherever. There were definitely a lot of tears, I’ll say that.” \n(Random bonus fact: Roerig says, rather proudly, that he did not have to rock a wig in this week’s flashback episode . “It may look like a wig,” he admits, “but it’s my own hair!”) PHOTOS Vampire Diaries First Look: Kai’s Back! Will He Undo Elena’s Curse? \nAs for what’s still to come for Matt in the final four episodes, Roerig alludes to his character’s ongoing dream of being a “hero” to his friends, adding that Matt is now “an integral key to saving everyone in Mystic Falls.” \nAnd don’t worry him getting too close to the action, either. “Matt’s a Band-Aid,” Roerig reminds us. “He’s always going to be OK. I don’t know, and I don’t know why, but I trust him.” What are your hopes for the final four episodes? Drop ’em in a comment below. If you like TVLine, you'll LOVE our weekly newsletter.
