It was as if he set out to prove to Sean Spicer that he could do a worse job than him. Fair to say that anyone outside of North America saw that and thought 'Saturday Night Live' now airs on Thursday mornings. #TrumpPresser — Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 16, 2017 \nTrump started with a 30 minute self-indulgent fantasy monologue that even the best fiction and comedy writers would struggle to pen. Up until an hour ago, the scariest thing I'd ever watched was Psycho. #TrumpPresser — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 16, 2017 #TrumpPresser latest. The House of Cards writers have all just resigned saying “What’s the point?”. — David Schneider (@davidschneider) February 16, 2017 \nMe, me, me! \"I'm a good person. ... I get good ratings.\" This isn't how an adult evaluates their nature. This is not normal. #Trumppressconference — Elizabeth Isabella (@ecisabell) February 16, 2017 \nTrump then wanted to talk drugs... Donald Trump, \"Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.\"How can you SAY this and NOT tell us where you get yours! #Tease #Bargain — Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 16, 2017 \nBragged about his “fine-tuned machine”... TRUMP: This admnistration is running like a finely-tuned machine. pic.twitter.com/AMW6HrcnXb — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) February 16, 2017 \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" - Trump, just days after his National Security Advisor is forced to resign. — Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 16, 2017 Real journalists don't ask \"nice questions.\" #TrumpPressConference — Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) February 16, 2017 Donald Trump, \"This is a fine-tuned machine!\"Kellyanne Conway - replaced — Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 16, 2017 Trump calling his administration a “fine tuned machine” is like calling a rotary phone a “fine tuned iPhone”. — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 16, 2017 \nHe moved on to Uranium . Uranium! \nFYI: “ Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable (with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes, uranium-233 to uranium-238, varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years).” Donald Trump \"You know what Uranium does? Lots of things, nuclear and like lots of things.\"If you voted for Trump, please don't reproduce. — Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 16, 2017 \nAnd if you want to see that dandy, here it is thanks to Tony Posnanski. Donald Trump explaining to the American people what Uranium is shows the stupidity of our leader. pic.twitter.com/PhkMFQSdja — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 16, 2017 \nAnd then to Chicago... \"There's two Chicagos. One is luxurious and safe. The other is worse than the middle east.\" -TrumpHe means white and black, people — Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 16, 2017 \nOh yeah, we were supposed to hear about the new Labor Secretary... Jake Tapper: Trump \"spent more time talking about [CNN's] Jim Acosta than [labor secretary nominee] Alexander Acosta.\" pic.twitter.com/gGZMpRfqQK — Fusion (@Fusion) February 16, 2017 \nReporters repeatedly pressed Donald Trump on what he plans to do to combat the rise in antisemitism. Reporter asked about anti-semitism in America. Trump yelled at him to sit down. Did everything but call him Jew Boy #TrumpPressConference — Bryan Behar (@bryanbehar) February 16, 2017 \nDonald Trump then told us... DONALD TRUMP JUST SAID HE IS THE LEAST RACIST PERSON IN THIS WORLD.WHAT! — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 16, 2017 Trump described himself as \"least anti-Semitic person in the world!\" And parenthetically added \"that includes Hitler\" #TrumpPressConference — Bryan Behar (@bryanbehar) February 16, 2017 Donald Trump \"I'm the least anti Semitic and least racist person you've seen in your life.\"Didn't rent to minorities — Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 16, 2017 \nMy head is spinning after watching that f***ing gong show. I’m going to go walk the dog for a bit and get some fresh air. Maybe I’ll just walk him to the pub. I could use a pint or three, we all could. \nThanks for reading. Be sure to follow me on Twitter AND I’m new to facebook, so please add me there as well. \nYour friend, \nCheck out my stand-up album, ‘Hamster Pimp’ on iTunes, Apple Music and Spotify. \nNew theater tour dates added with Jim Jefferies for February, March and May 2017.
