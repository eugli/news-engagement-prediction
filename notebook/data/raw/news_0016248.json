Wait and see!' Hours later, the chief designer of the Versace Group shared a photo from her VIP spot in the stand, declaring: 'I am ready for the kickoff!' The designer insisted her friend's performance was going to be 'fierce' Hours later, the chief designer of the Versace Group shared a photo from her VIP spot in the stand, declaring: 'I am ready for the kickoff!' Donatella even managed to nip backstage to see pal Gaga, 30, right before her half-time gig - and the photo of the platinum-blonde pair racked up 74,000 likes in a matter of hours. Lady Gaga tore the roof off of NRG Stadium with what's already being hailed as one of the greatest Super Bowl halftime shows in history and delivered not the anti-Donald Trump protest some feared, but a subtle message of inclusion and unity. Music speaks for itself: Her hit 'Born This Way' became a gay rights anthem but in the context of Sunday's show fit into the idea of accepting differences, a thread through much of the game's commercial messaging The singer, known for her audacious outfits, asked: 'How are you doing tonight, Texas? How are you doing tonight, America?' 'We're here to make you feel good,' she said. From the outset, Gaga served notice this was no ordinary halftime show -- she began her performance from the lip of the stadium roof, an army of 300 drones forming a twinkling American flag in the sky. Hell of a halftime show! Lady Gaga sang America The Beautiful from atop the stadium in Houston at the star of her Super Bowl 51 performance She then swung down from the roof to a stage suspended on cables and embarked on a meticulously choreographed 13-minute set of her greatest hits Then she took flight (literally) at the end of the pre-recorded sequence. The singer, clad in a sparkling silver bodysuit and knee high boots, appeared to leap from the edge the retractable roof onto the stage with the help of some sturdy wires -- and the performance was nonstop from there. Meanwhile, on the field, the New England Patriots made the greatest ever comeback in Super Bowl history to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime.
