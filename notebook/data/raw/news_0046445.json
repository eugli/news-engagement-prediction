She reportedly congratulated him over the phone and also held discussions with cabinet members in Chennai, sources said. The Supreme Court had upheld her conviction in a disproportionate assets case. \n\nSasikala and her niece J Ilavarasi are lodged in the women's barrack on the first floor of the building. Since there's no TV in her cell at present, she requested jail authorities to let her go to another room. \n\n\"On Thursday night, Sasikala had requested senior jail officials to allow her to watch TV in another room so that she could watch the proceedings...After Palaniswamy passed the test, Sasikala appeared happy. She walked back her to room, freshened up and came down to admission room where the legal team was waiting for her,\" sources said. \n\nAccording to sources, Sasikala spoke at length to the cabinet members, gave them instructions, and returned to her room around 7pm. \n\nIt may be recalled that Sasikala's legal team is making efforts to get her an A Class status at the prison. Pointing out that she is a diabetic, her lawyer SND Kulasekaran had said: \"She also suffers from other age-related illnesses. She deserves A Class facilities in the prison. We will approach the authorities concerned to ensure she gets the privileges.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:27:06.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
