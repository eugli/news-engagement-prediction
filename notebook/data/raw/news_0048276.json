For the new Ferrari 812 - the replacement for the F12 - becomes the most powerful V12 Ferrari ever built, thanks to headline power outputs of 789bhp and a whopping 718Nm of torque. This, naturally, is delivered without the assistance of turbos or superchargers, making this naturally-aspirated V12 something to savour.
