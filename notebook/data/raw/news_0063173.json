Investments in DeviantArt's platform will raise headcount and decrease 2017 free cash flow by $8 million to $63-$64 million.\nThis is the first overseas acquisition for Wix, which saw revenue grow 48 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $84.2 million as it beat expectations.\nThe company has over 100 million registered users. As of Dec. 31, Wix had $172 million in cash.\nLast week Wix President Nir Zohar told Reuters that the company is pursuing a strategy of courting paid subscribers by developing products for niche users such as photographers and musicians.\nDeviantArt will maintain its own brand as Wix helps it grow as a platform for artists to showcase their work, the companies said in a statement.\nAs part of the deal, DeviantArt co-founder and Chief Executive Angelo Sotira will join the Wix management team.\n(Reporting by Yuval Ben-David; Editing by Tova Cohen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:22:52.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
