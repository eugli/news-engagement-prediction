Picture: Lorraine Hanna \n“Last October I didn’t get any bookings for about 3 weeks. It’s unpredictable to say the least.” \nHer usual clientele consists of businessmen aged 40 and over, and she usually has the most fun with “fat men”. \n“Most white-collar type professions, more caucasian, Indian and Asian than other races, and mostly in the 40-60 age group,” she says. \n“I’m happy with this, because these guys are well mannered and really generous.” \nShe also claims to have had sex with more than 1100 men — and the oldest client she ever had was a Holocaust survivor. media_camera The sex worker revealed all on Reddit. \nShe revealed she is not a “knockout model” but channels the “girl-next-door type of look”. \nFamous clients have included “NRL and union players,” as well as members of biker gangs — although she has kept specific names under wraps. \nShe also states she’s open to many bizarre fantasies but will not do water or mud sports, long bookings out of the city, or incest role play. \n“I don’t have it in me to act it out. I have a few brothers,” she explains. “I remember watching Gladiator with one of them. That was awkward for us.” \nShe also has a strict no-Irish policy. \n“I have a no-Irish policy, for all the reasons you’d imagine,” she says, without elaborating further. \nHer mother, best friends and ex-boyfriends know about her job as an escort — but she is afraid of her father and brothers finding out. \n“I broke down and confessed everything to my parents about having been a sex worker for years about 2 years ago while I was on hiatus,” she wrote. \n“Only my mum knows I’ve returned. She doesn’t want me to tell [my dad] because otherwise she’d ‘never hear the end of it’. \n“But I think deep down he knows.” \nShe plans to “retire in June” when she is set to move overseas and study for a Masters.
