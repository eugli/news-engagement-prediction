VICE News went to see some of the first people to become U.S. citizens under President Trump, and spoke to them about becoming citizens.\n“My name is Merle Pereira. I’m originally from India, and I want to be an American citizen because I’ve been here for over 15 years, and I’m just really thankful I finally get to be official. I hope America realizes that it’s based on diversity.”\nMany of the new American citizens addressed the president during our interviews. Here’s what one of those new citizens said:\n“My name is Najib Adi, and I’m originally from Syria. I want to become an American citizen, and excited to be an American citizen, because everybody wants to experience the American dream I guess. I have a very good message for President Trump: Syrian immigrants are hard working, dedicated, loving immigrants, and they make great citizens, from Steve Jobs all the way down.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Meet", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fmeet-some-of-the-first-people-to-become-american-citizens-under-president-trump"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:07:58.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
