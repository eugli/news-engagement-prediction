We can find help to catch them for you to be sent to the veterinarian for the surgery,\" said canine welfare group Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) adoption coordinator Christine Lai.    \nAccording to Lai, there is a steady increase in street dogs because each female comes on heat and litters at least twice a year.    \nPuppies which are lucky are rescued off the streets while the unlucky ones become members of the next generation of street dog communities or end up as roadkill.    \n\"MDDB is literally picking-up puppies off the streets on a daily basis and putting them up for adoption every Sunday,\" said Lai.    \nThis week's adoption drive is being held Sunday at Citta Mall, Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya.    \nThe adoption drive from 11am to 6pm is being held at the main entrance.    \nLai said there are about 15 puppies in need of homes that will be brought to the adoption drive.    \nShe hoped that those looking for pets will adopt rescued puppies instead of heading to pet shops and buying one.    \nLai said it would be ideal if communities in housing areas helped take care of street dogs.    \n\"These dogs can be neutered and vaccinated. Residents can pool resources and buy the kibbles to feed them.    \n\"The dogs then become community dogs,\" she added.    \nShe added the current method of catching by the authorities had failed to lower the number of street dogs.    \n\"It is also very inhumane and very expensive. The money used can be put to better use such as battling the Aedes disease or eradicating leptospirosis,\" said Lai.    \nShe said those interested in the neuter and return programme for their neighbourhoods can write to malaysiandogsdeservebetter1@gmail.com    \nThose wanting to adopt a puppy can call: 012-2414749.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:25:28.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
