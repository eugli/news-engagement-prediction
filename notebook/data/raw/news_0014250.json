(Reuters) \nDr Vermonte said the policies would aid extremists. \n\"It may give fertile ground to the conservative narrative that the US is against Islam — that the American people don't like Muslims,\" he said. \n\"It will make it harder for Muslims dealing with the conservative discourse and even terrorism. People seem to share the view that the US is against Islam.\" \nOn the streets of Jakarta, young students at one university campus said they were concerned about Mr Trump's immigration policies. \n\"I think it is such a loss, America is a superpower. Why would they be racist to Muslims? They can be more open, it's a new world,\" said one student. \n\"Donald Trump is a very firm president, disciplined, and committed,\" said another. \n\"But I think he should also be firmly keeping the tolerance in America. The American people don't consist of Americans alone, but people from many countries, like Indonesia.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:17:43.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
