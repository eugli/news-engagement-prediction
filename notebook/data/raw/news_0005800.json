The rapper went on to joke about going toe-to-toe with Zanotti after the proposed fight between Chris Brown and Soulja Boy . \n“This is wonderful. #GiuseppeZanotti seems to think it’s ok to name his sneakers after me but his PR says they won’t take our call. Lol,” Nicki Minaj tweeted before continuing in subsequent posts. “I met #GiuseppeZanotti years ago. At which time, he told me I inspired him to design a sneaker in my honor. Wore them on the cover of Cosmo Recently when he gave other artists capsule collections, my agency reached out and was told they’re not taking our call. Just go on google, you’ll see all the different pairs he’s named after me. Lil black girl can inspire u but ain’t worth a collection my nig? #RunMeMyCHECK #GiuseppeWhatsGood I got time today. barbz trend this cuz he gon learn today. The racism & disrespect won’t b tolerated. Take the poll. Should Giuseppe Don’t care about the money. It’s just the disrespect. You’re not taking MY call? Lol.
