During their discussion, he touched on his latest Childish Gambino album ( “Awaken, My Love!” ), his award - winning TV show “ Atlanta ” (which he confirmed will return in 2018), upcoming roles (as Lando Calrissian and a mysterious Spider-Man character ), his Migos shout-out at the Golden Globes, and more. Glover also addressed the rumors about a possible Chance the Rapper collaboration. “I mean, we definitely met up before, you know. I don’t know if I’ll see him again now that he’s won a Grammy ,” he said. He continued: \nWe’ll see what happens, but yeah, we actually, like, sat down in the studio and worked hard for a little bit, you know. We’re both busy, but, like, I think, I mean, when he has, like, a moment when we’ve been sitting down and just working together, I think it’s just, like, about catching a vibe. Like, I really like that project that he did with, you know, the EP that he just put out [ Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama ]. I guess, like, it was around Christmas. I think that came from just sitting in the studio—from, like, I just wanna hang out with them. I don’t work with people over email anymore. I think it just doesn’t make good work, but it’s just that we have to find the time to, like, sit down together. \nListen to the full interview below; the Chance discussion begins at 15:31.
