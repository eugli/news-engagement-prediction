Austin also made the list, with an estimated 100,000 immigrants living there illegally. \nRULE ON THE RULING : Trump travel ban suffers a judicial setback \nWhile there is no legal definition of what constitutes a sanctuary city, the concept has been in the news lately with President Donald Trump signing an executive order on Jan. 25 promising to \"ensure that jurisdictions that do not comply with federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law.\" \nThe mayors of some large sanctuary cities , including New York, Chicago, Boston and Seattle, have said they will not comply with the order. \nThe arrests of hundreds of immigrants last week marked the first large-scale raid under the Trump administration â€” but the crackdown was, by all indications, just the start of much more to come. The expansive executive order signed by Donald Trump last month allows a significantly broader population of immigrants to be picked up for deportation. Media: Brandpoint \nMayor Sylvester Turner has said Houston will continue to be a welcoming city .
