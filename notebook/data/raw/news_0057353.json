(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\nFaced with the prospect of spring flooding, some protesters are considering moving to higher ground, though not necessarily off the federal land. Some may move to the Standing Rock Reservation, where the Cheyenne River Sioux is leasing land to provide camping space even though Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault has urged protesters to leave.\n'Enough now': Standing Rock tribe formally asks protesters to leave camps \"We have the same goals,\" Cheyenne River Chairman Harold Frazier said of himself and Archambault. \"We don't agree on whether or not the water protectors should be on the ground.\"\nEvacuating main camp On Monday, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum talked with Archambault on the telephone about efforts to clean up and vacate the protest camp, Burgum's office said. Burgum and Archambault both stressed the importance of keeping lines of communication open, including a one-page flyer that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs will distribute in the camp, reminding protesters that the main camp will be evacuated at 2 p.m. Wednesday and re-entry will not be allowed, Burgum's office said.\nNew Standing Rock camp evicted by law enforcement Archambault said Monday he continues to ask that there be no forced removal of remaining campers. He said the state has notified the tribe that law enforcement will enter the camp Wednesday and \"will peacefully ask those to vacate.\"\n\"We ask that everyone keep public safety their top priority at this time,\" Archambault said in an email to The Associated Press.\n​Cleanup continues More than 230 truckloads of debris have been hauled out as of Monday, according to the governor's office.

Ryan Hignight.\nOne concern is that floodwaters could wash tons of trash and debris at the encampment into the nearby rivers.\n\"One of the biggest environmental threats to the Missouri is the camp itself,\" Burgum said.\nMany in camp think authorities are exaggerating the flood threat and trying to turn public sentiment against them.\n\"They're talking like it will be a flood that will wipe out all of existence,\" said Luke Black Elk, a Cheyenne River Sioux from South Dakota. Some flooding is likely, he said, but \"most of it won't be that bad.\"\nRemains peaceful The camp has been the site of numerous and sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters who call themselves \"water protectors,\" with more than 700 arrests.
