According to an officer’s affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun, Sponsler prefaced the kinky cartwheel by talking about her previous drug use and how she “thought 14-year-old boys were like men.” \nSponsler informed the class that she was not wearing underwear before launching into the cartwheel, a female teen told police. \nThe performance was captured on a student’s mobile phone. The officer who later swore out the affidavit viewed that video. He noted that Sponsler was wearing a long dress but that her buttocks and sex organs were visible when she did her cartwheel. \nVarious juvenile witnesses also told investigators that Sponsler was clearly not wearing underwear during the incident, according to the Associated Press.

Jail records show she is being held on a complaint of indecent exposure. \nHer previous criminal record includes pleading guilty to marijuana possession, public intoxication and possession of drug paraphernalia in 2008 and pleading guilty to possession of methamphetamine and marijuana in the presence of a child and possession of drug paraphernalia in 2011, according to The Smoking Gun.
