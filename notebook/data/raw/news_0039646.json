Besides being one of the most popular couples on Indian television, Rithvik and Asha also have an immense social media following. And hence the couple decided to open up a portion of their Valentines celebration by going live (on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) over their dinner date and interact with their fans.\n  A post shared by rithvik D (@rithvik_d) onFeb 14, 2017 at 10:19am PST\nRithvik shares, \"Social media has helped bridge the gap between us actors and our fans. And we are blessed to get so so so much love, good wishes and support from people across the world. Hence this year I decided that the surprise wouldn't only be for Asha but also for all those who love seeing the two of us together. I wanted our supporters to have direct access to us and hence we went live over our dinner.\"\n\nAsk him about why he chose to go live instead of just post a video afterwards and he says, \"We are living in a day an age of instant and the feeling of actually being with someone you love at that moment is completely different. I don't think its too much information because we have the ability to choose how much and where to draw the line. And at the end of the day, it's a beautiful moment which becomes even more special when shared. It was our fans who wanted us to be together way before we had even realised that we had any feelings for each other, it was our fans who made us win Nach Baliye and so this valentines we decided to share our love with those who have made us who we are.\"\nRithvik and Asha spent about fifteen to twenty minutes going live during their dinner date on Valentines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:43:14.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
