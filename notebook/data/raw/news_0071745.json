And, maybe most importantly, we are nice.” \nT+L readers agree, and think that Indianapolis is one of America’s most underrated cities. \nIn the annual America's Favorite Places survey, readers of all stripes evaluate hundreds of cities and towns across a range of categories, from the friendliness of the locals to the quality of the pizza. Unlike Travel + Leisure 's World's Best Awards , which encourages readers to weigh in on travel experiences across the globe, the America's Favorite Places survey is a way for locals to share what their hometowns do best. \nOther destinations that readers think deserve a better reputation include a petite Northeast city with a revitalized arts scene, a Southwest town with stellar access to hiking and skiing, and a town in California with restaurants that are well worth their high prices. \nDid your hometown make the cut? From big cities on the East Coast to small, southern hubs, don’t overlook these U.S. cities.
