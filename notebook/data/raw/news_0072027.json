Key points: Mr Abbott says Liberal Party needs to become more conservative or risk being deserted for One Nation Julie Bishop defends Government, says she hasn't seen Mr Abbott's manifesto Christopher Pyne says Coalition is on the right track \nThe former leader has lashed out at the Government, arguing conservative voters will flock to One Nation as the Coalition becomes \"Labor lite\" . \nHe has put forward his plan to avoid electoral defeat, including halting all new spending, cutting immigration, ending renewable energy subsidies, scrapping the Human Rights Commission and reforming the Senate. \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said she had not yet seen Mr Abbott's electoral manifesto. \n\"A former leader of the party would have ideas, and most certainly we encourage our backbenchers as well as our ministers to always come up with policy initiatives that will benefit the Australian people,\" Ms Bishop told reporters in London. \n\"I believe that the Turnbull Government has been pursuing policies in the interests of the Australian people, we are pursuing policies that will grow our economy, create more jobs.\" 'Focusing on bread and butter issues' \nDefence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne went further, dismissing Mr Abbott's policy suggestion. \n\"We won't be going down the track of putting a freeze on immigration, for example, which Tony Abbott wants to do because it would be catastrophic in places like Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania, most places outside the capital cities,\" Mr Pyne said. \n\"We won't be slashing spending. Tony Abbott tried that in 2014 in the budget during his leadership, but of course a whole lot of zombie legislation sat in the Senate unable to be passed.\" \nMr Pyne denied the Coalition was on the same trajectory as Labor during the Rudd/Gillard years of leadership turmoil. \n\"The last time Tony Abbott was leader, one of the last polls had him at 30 per cent to Bill Shorten's 48 per cent, as preferred Prime Minister,\" he said. \n\"So we are on the right track with Malcolm Turnbull and with the Government's policies. \n\"More important we're focusing on the bread and butter issues that the Australian public are interested in.\" \nCoalition frontbencher Josh Frydenberg echoed his statements, citing Abbott government legislation such as the ABCC that was passed under Mr Turnbull's leadership. \n\"Since the last election, we've got 48 pieces of legislation through the Parliament and some of that legislation is something that Tony Abbott tried to do which this Government has now delivered,\" he said. \n\"Tony Abbott, as a former prime minister, a Member of Parliament, is absolutely entitled to share his views but the Government has a very clear plan of what's important going forward.\" First posted February 24, 2017 08:07:26 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:43:14.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
