We did a stint last year at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury, and we’re touring it around the UK – it’s my favourite musical, so I’m chuffed to be doing it. ‘I think Casualty was hoping it would fall through so I could stay on a bit longer – but I’ve promised I’ll be back as soon as the tour is over!’ Phew! As much as Sam likes to ruffle feathers, we can’t get enough of Tom in Casualty. If he didn’t return, we’d likely be the ones calling a strike… ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:35:09.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
