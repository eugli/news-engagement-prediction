So as part of a project, they teamed up with a business graduate and three doctors at one of Bengaluru’s best-known tertiary care hospitals. Their objective: to find an unmet need in critical care that they can come up with a solution to. \n\n\n\nThey spent two-and-a-half months at the hospital keeping a close eye on the goings-on at the intensive care unit. It was then a 30-year-old was wheeled in with a head injury from a motorcycle accident. The injury was not life-threatening but he was still put on ventilator support to avoid respiratory complications. Jangir and his team were told he would be moved out of the ICU in 3-4 days, but it was not to be. The patient had contracted ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), an infection of the lungs resulting from the bacteria in the fluids that collect in the lungs of a patient who has been on a ventilator for more than 48 hours. \n\nRead Also: ​ As these Unicorns turn 10, what next for the startup-verse? \n\n\n\nAs is the fate of half of those who get VAP in India, this patient did not make it, breathing his last a week after being taken into the ICU. While it may not at first seem ideal that Jangir and Deval found their Eureka moment in the morbidity of one’s death, what they would come up with could prevent the deaths of many more. (VAP, according to Jangir, claims 2.5 lakh lives in India every year.) \n\n\n\n\n\nWith grants of Rs 90 lakh from the department of biotechnology of the Indian government, they developed VAPCare , a device which removes saliva and also pushes anti-microbial liquid into oral cavities just in case some of the saliva trickles into the lungs. With VAPCare, which Jangir says is a “first-in-the-world device”, what is usually done by a nurse is now automated and done more efficiently. \n\nAlso Read: E-tailers have been in deep water even before startup-storm \n\nMedtech Innovations \n“It’s an intelligent secretion and oral management device,” says Jangir. Coeo has filed patents for VAPCare in 12 countries, including India; the company is now building an order pipeline for the device. Another device Coeo has developed is more specific to the conditions of a developing economy like India. \n\n\n\nA neonatal transport continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, SaanS can be used with electric power or, in its absence, with something as simple as a mechanical pump. “The device is still being tested but it will be priced at one-third of the existing CPAP devices used in NICUs (neonatal intensive care units),” notes the 27-year old. \n\n\n\nEntrepreneurs like Jangir and Deval are finally finding their feet in medical technology, particularly devices, which have a long gestation unlike health apps and platforms, thanks to the time spent on research and development, and pilot projects. Investors are still warming to the sector, with the last five years seeing only 16 venture capital investments totalling $68 million, according to data compiled by Venture Intelligence . \n\n\n\nThe recent order of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), cutting prices of coronary stents by up to 85%, has kicked up a huge debate about the high prices of some medical equipment and profiteering by their manufacturers and hospitals. This decision may not directly affect aspiring med-tech entrepreneurs since the market for stents is already crowded with market leaders like Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic, and several Indian companies, but it points to the huge opportunity that exists for Indian companies that can make devices suited to the challenges of the Indian healthcare system, rather than those transplanted from a research lab in the US or Germany, and at the same time, price them a lot cheaper than their global competitors’ alternatives. The Indian medical device market, which was at $3.8 billion in 2014, is expected to grow to $8.6 billion by 2020. \n\nBarath Shankar Subramanian of Accel, a venture capital firm, says given that 70% of India’s medical device requirements are imported, the opportunity is huge, although “we do find it challenging to find talent — especially innovation focused talent. But these are all getting better over time.” \n\nAt Cheaper Rates \nPrashant Jha, fellowship director at the School of International Biodesign, which focuses on low-cost medtech innovations, believes the NPPA decision is good news for Indian innovators. “You get more value for the money you spend on R&D in India than in Palo Alto so you can sell at the regulated price, which an MNC can’t,” says Jha. \n\n\n\nThe school, funded by the Indian government, is a collaboration between Stanford University, the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, among others. Jha says among the prerequisites for the fellowship at the school are that the product should be globally patentable and should cost a tenth of the cheapest MNC product. A cheaper price tag is only one of the USPs of Sattva MedTech’s portable foetal monitoring device. \n\nSattva, also founded in 2014, had its genesis in co-founder Vibhav Joshi’s interactions with his mother, a gynaecologist in Pune. She told him about the problems she faced with the monitor used to measure foetal heart rate. “It is very ambiguous and involves a lot of subjectivity because you are also picking up sounds from the mother’s heart in addition to the baby’s heart,” says Joshi. There are 3 lakh perinatal deaths (both stillborn babies and neonatal deaths) annually in India, according to Sattva. \n\nJoshi and cofounder Sumedh Kaulgud came up with an alternative ECG based foetal distress monitor which is more accurate because it works on electrical signals rather than sound. Fetal Lite is undergoing pilot demos and will soon be commercialised. Joshi says Fetal Lite will be priced in the Rs 70,000-1.5 lakh range, which is what a traditional foetal monitor costs. The monitors sold by the likes of General Electric and Philips are priced at around Rs 4 lakh. \n\n\n\n“We are solving a problem as opposed to just selling a product. Price becomes relevant only when the product is commoditised,” says Siraj Dhanani, cofounder and chief executive of InnAccel, an accelerator turned-medtech company, which has backed both Coeo and Sattva. One of InnAccel’s two products is a balloon sinus dilation device used to open up sinus pathways in those suffering from sinusitis. The product, SinuCare, will be available for a third of the price of its global competitors. \n\nRanjith Menon, executive director of IDG Ventures, a VC firm, says the fundamental difference between western markets and India is that the high cost of procedures in the former is borne by insurance companies, while in India, where less than a fifth of the population has health insurance, the patient mostly pays for it. “So you need to ensure the cost of the procedure is low.” \n\nSimple Tools \nWhile the general preference among medtech startups is to price their products substantially lower than the market leaders, there are some who think differently. “Affordability is about value rather than price,” says Abhinav Ramani, programme manager, Consure Medical. The company has priced the three variants of its product, which helps manage fecal incontinence, at Rs 8,000-18,000, which Ramani says is competitive to its rivals'. Consure is backed by the likes of Accel, India Venture Partners and India Innovation Fund. \n\n\n\nK Chandrasekhar, co-founder and CEO of Forus Health, which has installed 1,400 of its retinal imaging devices in 26 countries, says it is important for a young company to position its devices in such a way they are not termed cheap, but as products which offer good value. Set up in 2010, Forus has raised $13 million from investors like IDG Ventures and Accel. \n\nAnand Sivaraman, cofounder of Remidio Innovative Solutions, founded around the same time as Forus and also involved in retinal imaging, does not believe that a product can be made more accessible just by cutting its price. “We create access by focusing on simplicity and moving the device closer to the patient.” Remidio’s flagship device uses a smartphone to take an image of the eye. “These are devices which were used only in the tertiary care centres but can now be used by those who are not optometrists or ophthalmologists. \n\nR Venkatesh, chief medical officer at Aravind Eye Hospital in Puducherry, which has been using Remidio’s device for five years, concurs with Sivaraman. “You can even train a layman to use it in a week. He just needs a bit of orientation in optics.” Venkatesh adds that Remidio’s device is not inferior to its more expensive alternatives and in fact performs most of their functions though it comes at only an eighth to a tenth of its competitors’ prices. \n\nChandrasekhar believes patients’ behaviour also needs to be taken into account while designing a device because an equipment far removed from the patient’s expectations could result in the patient not taking its results seriously. “The transition (in design) needs to be steady.” \n\n\n\nPricing and design apart, startups are counting on the presence of a doctor on the founding team to give them some much needed edge when they pitch to potential clients. “Having a doctor helps you in understanding medical needs and in proving your product,” says Niranjan Subbarao, co-founder of Cyclops MedTech, which makes an eye-tracking device to diagnose vertigo and other balance disorders. The other two founders are both doctors. Cyclops, which has raised around $2,00,000, launched its device two weeks ago. \n\nAnother company with a doctor at the helm is ten3T Healthcare, which has developed a triangular patch that can be stuck on a patient’s chest for medical-grade data on pulse, respiration and blood oxygen, and also for a spot ECG. The patient can even be sent home with the patch and the data monitored real time. “A fair chunk of patients who are in the ICU don’t need to be there,” says CEO Sudhir Borgonha. \n\nAttracting Funds \nWhile most medical device startups choose to market the devices they developed, some are happy to be known for their intellectual property. Pune-based Embryyo Technologies, established in 2014 by two mechanical engineering graduates from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, is one of those. “We want to be known as a medtech inventions company and we could license our technology to a medical device company,\"says cofounder Nishant Kumar, 30. \n\nAmong Embryyo’s six products, which are in different stages of development, are an electronic pill box to help doctors monitor drug adherence among tuberculosis patients and an infant brain growth monitoring device. Embryyo has so far raised $4,00,000 in grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and agencies of the Indian government, among others. Medical device startups, thanks to the very nature of their business, will not see investors flocking to them, as has happened in e-commerce and the sharing economy. \n\nBut as more and more unique and affordable technologies are developed to cater to the medical needs of a woefully underserved country like India, the ecosystem is bound to attract reasonable amounts of money. Moreover, a device that works here could be taken to other countries with problems similar to India’s.
