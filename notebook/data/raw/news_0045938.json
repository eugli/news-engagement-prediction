Editor Advertisement \nNews reports in the Straits Times today indicate a woman in her 30s being attacked by a swarm of bees in a park at Ang Mo Kio, located directly opposite the AMK Library. The attack took place for about 10 minutes, with bystanders unable to help. It took an SCDF officer in protective gear to rescue the woman, who by then had her arms and legs swollen and red, and body convulsing. \nSCDF confirmed the woman was taken to the hospital conscious. Wonder what triggered the attack on the woman by the swarm of bees. Were they provoked? The main thing was, why was there a swarm of bees in the area in the first place? This is a well used park, with many people going through it for exercise, or to get to the McDonald's restaurant located nearby. AVA, NParks, and all the other authorities responsible for keeping our parks safe, time to move on from giving excuses about culling of chickens and checking of trees done to world standards. \nThis is a real problem. Get these bees away from areas of high people traffic. Don't want a tragedy to happen first before affirmative action is taken. \nLam T \nA.S.S.
