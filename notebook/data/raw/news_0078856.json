But state officials said there's no evidence of that happening. (Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, February 28, 2017, 12:45 AM \nPresident Trump dug himself a hole Monday when he told a roomful of officials that New York’s Lincoln and Midtown Tunnels are among the most dangerous in the nation. \nSpeaking to a roomful of governors at the White House, Trump said America’s highways, bridges and tunnels are in bad shape — and cited the “loose material” he sees in New York’s underground roadways as an example. \n“Take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, you’re driving and you see all this loose material, and it’s heavy, it was made many years ago, it’s heavy. Today it’s light. It used to be better. The problem is you have to hold it (up),” Trump said. \nHe also suggested that drivers are being hit by falling tiles in the tunnels — although New York officials said there’s no evidence such accidents are happening. \nTrump to pledge ‘renewal of American spirit’ in first address \n“I mean, we have tunnels in New York where the tiles are on the ceiling and you see many tiles missing and you wonder, you’re driving 40, 50 miles per hour through a tunnel,” the President said at the White House event. \n“Say, man, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they’re driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel and a tile falls off. And there are so many missing tiles. And such loose concrete. So we have to fix our infrastructure,” he said. \nTrump’s going to share his vision for building back America’s infrastructure to Congress Tuesday night. \nIt’s going to include more spending and using money that America has previously wasted on wars, he said. \nStephen Colbert spoofs New York Times ad for ‘Late Show’ promo \n“We spend $6 trillion in the Middle East and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads,” Trump said. “I have a friend who is in the trucking business. He said, ‘My trucks are destroyed going from New York to Los Angeles.’ \nTrump said he asked his friend when it had been like that before and the friend said it had never been that bad in 40 years. \n“We’re going to start spending on infrastructure, big. And not like we have a choice,” Trump told the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:16:13.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
