Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA magician cheated death after surviving a 25ft fall to the floor and hitting his head after a 'drunken' stunt went wrong. \nArron Jones was stunned to see a fellow conjurer shimmy up a pillar and start 'monkey-barring' along the roof during the Blackpool Magic Convention at the town's Winter Gardens last weekend. \nIn Arron's shocking footage the man can be seen swinging from rafter to rafter. \nPanicked shouts can be heard from the crowd below as the man's stunt goes horribly wrong. The man is hanging on to the rafters (Photo: Mercury Press & Media) \nHe lost his grip and can be seen plummeting at least 25ft to the tiled floor below, hitting the ground with an almighty thud, landing flat on his back and banging his head.

He suddenly loses his grip (Photo: Mercury Press & Media) \n\"All of a sudden I saw this guy start to shimmy up on of the pillars to the roof. I was just stood there thinking 'what is this idiot doing?' \n\"I heard he had been drinking but I don't know why he decided to go up there. The bouncers came out and were shouting at him to get down but he just told them 'no' and carried on going.

The atmosphere in the hall completely changed. No one knew what to do or why he was doing it. \n\"When he got to the top there was no point telling him to stop. He either had to keep going or come back. And lands on the floor with a thud (Photo: Mercury Press & Media) \n\"He was trying to turn around when he lost his grip and fell. It was terrifying - let's put it this way, the loudest scream you hear on the video was mine. \n\"I had such a visceral reaction, just sound came out. It's something I never thought I would see and as he hit the ground there was a loud thud. \n\"The first thing I did was check if he was breathing. We all thought he was dead, that we had just watched him kill himself.

I think he got away with just a broken arm and hip.\" \nAfter the harrowing incident, which took place at about 12.30am on Sunday, an ambulance was called and the man was rushed to the Royal Preston Hospital, where he remains. He fell about 25ft (Photo: Mercury Press & Media) \nAnd magician David Penn, who also witnessed the fall, said the man's 'reckless' actions could have been a game of one-upmanship fuelled by alcohol. \nDad-of-two David, of Northampton, said: \"At the convention you get magicians coming to show their latest tricks and you get some people that want to outdo each other.

It was like he thought he was trying to fly or he thought he was some kind of superhero. \n\"He must have at least had luck on his side to survive. When he fell, I turned away, I couldn't watch - and I just heard this crack as he hit the ground. (Photo: Mercury Press & Media) \n\"He remained motionless for quite some time and I was absolutely terrified he was dead. It's at least a 30ft drop and the floor is those old fashioned, hard marble tiles. I had a nightmare about it that night. \n\"Not only did he do something completely reckless but he put the safety of others at risk too. If he'd fallen on anyone he would have done some serious damage.\" \nArron and David said they believe the man has now been given a lifetime ban from the magic convention, which is the largest of its kind in the world.

The entire 2017 convention will be discussed at the next convention team meeting.\" \nA spokeswoman for North West Ambulance Service said: \"We got a call at 26 minutes past midnight on Sunday. \n\"A male in his twenties was not conscious. He had climbed up two floors and had been monkey barring across the roof. \n\"He had fallen about 25ft onto a tiled floor. He had head and arm injuries and was taken as a major trauma case to the Royal Preston hospital.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:59:15.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
