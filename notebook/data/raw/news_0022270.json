Through the highly controversial transition to the Trump administration, Melania's inaugural style was a surprising delight to the American fashion industry. In the 24-hour period surrounding Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President, the new First Lady donned four different New York–based brands from relatively unknown designers . The display was what Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic for the New York Times , said looked “meaningfully like an ‘America first’ wardrobe.” For a moment, it seemed like Mrs. Trump might be taking a page from her predecessor and using her platform to make a political statement.

Over the weekend, Melania emerged from her home in New York to join President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort for a slew of presidential events. Over the course of the weekend, Melania wore a crimson mini cape dress by Givenchy in honor of National Wear Red Day and a hot pink Christian Dior dress for a Red Cross Ball—both notably by European designers. \nMelania Trump at the Red Cross Gala Getty Images Normally, this wouldn’t raise any red flags. The First Lady has looked elegant and—let’s be honest—pretty chic. And let’s all remember that wearing foreign brands was a choice pioneered by Michelle Obama, who has largely been praised for promoting cross-cultural relations through a sartorial conversation. But considering the fact that President Trump built his entire campaign on the premise of “America first,” it seems a little odd for the First Family’s wardrobe to say differently, no? According to a report from the New York Times , when asked about the discrepancy, a senior advisor for the First Lady stated, “Mrs. Trump is a proud and longtime supporter of American fashion. She appreciates fashion as art. As a former model, she has always been a patron of the world’s most distinguished designers both here and abroad. Mrs. Trump buys from an international mix of brands because that is what reflects her uniquely American life experience and style. She is more excited than ever to make a platform for American designers as she did on one of the most important weeks in history, the Inauguration, showcasing the extraordinary talents of American designers.” Nonetheless, it is important to note despite a somewhat cold shoulder from the fashion industry , the First Lady has no shortage of American designers willing to dress her. Tommy Hilfiger , Badgley Mischka , Carolina Herrera, and Diane von Furstenberg have all stated they’d be happy to work with her to champion American fashion. It remains to be seen whether the First Lady will start championing her husband's “Buy American” campaign through her fashion choices.
