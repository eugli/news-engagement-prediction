Don't waste your money even on a rent... Not Everyone's Cup of Tea by ProudMeerkat If you like plot driven films, steer clear! American Honey is all about the ride, not the destination. Unless you've already seen it and enjoyed it, I would recommend a rent. This is not a film for everyone.That being said, the performances, cinematography,and story were very engaging Movie is worth watching by Phoeni Movie is worth watching but the desription given says its kids pursuing the american dream. When did the american dream ever have anything to do with cheating people, manipulation, and taking advantage of \"friends\" while breaking the law? Weâ€™ve come from \"\"Stand by Me\" and \"The Outsiders,\" all the way to \"Jerry Springer\" as a drama movie pretty fast. Time to move to New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:43:12.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
