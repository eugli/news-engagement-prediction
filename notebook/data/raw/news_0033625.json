Tracey Talbot of Environment Canada says during the snowiest 24-hour period of that storm (measured from 2 a.m. to 2 a.m.), 66 centimetres fell at the Halifax airport.\nFor this week's blizzard, the Halifax airport recorded 50 centimetres between 2 a.m. Monday and 2 a.m. Tuesday.\nHere's how the snow fell during the entire storm across the province, according to Environment Canada's summary report:\nGreenwood 61 cm Kejimkujik 59 cm Tidnish: 56 cm New Ross: 55 cm Wolfville: 54 cm Fall River: 53 cm Sackville: 53 cm Sydney Airport: 51 cm Western Head: 49 cm Scots Bay: 47 cm Cape George: 45 cm Pockwock Lake: 44 cm Halifax City: 44 cm Parrsboro: 42 cm Kentville: 39 cm Fenwick: 34 cm The peak winds are some of the strongest I can remember with a winter storm in recent history.\nStrong winds hit most of the area, with some of the strongest occurring up and down the Atlantic coastline of Nova Scotia. They came from an east and northeast direction, putting them onshore for many areas.\nThat enhanced the storm surge, with coastal flooding noted in a number of areas including Shelburne, Liverpool, and Cape Sable Island.\nA four-unit townhouse under construction in a new subdivision on Carrie Best Court, near Rockingham, was blown down in high winds on Monday. The project manager says no one was at the site when the structure fell down.
