The other 40 per cent comes from the provincial lump sum, plus yearly grants worth around $3 million it has to apply for.\n'The need continues to grow' \"That will now be part of our regular annual funding, which allows us to plan and that's the really significant shift for us,\" said McNeil\nCanuck Place cares for children facing complex health issues or needing end-of-life care. It also has supportive programs for families of the children.\nMcNeil says the new money will be used to add support workers in communities, before adding new beds to facilities it has in Vancouver and Abbotsford.\nCanuck Place celebrates 20 years of caring for kids In 2016, the organization saw an 11 per cent increase to participation in its program. On average, it cares for 670 children and their families a year.\n\"The need continues to grow,\" said McNeil.\nThe province says the money helps meet its goal of doubling the numbers of hospice and palliative care beds by 2020.\nMeanwhile, McNeil says Canuck Place will continue to solicit donations despite the big bump up in funding.\nThe funding announcement comes close to others from B.C. Liberals about money for education , highways , search and rescue volunteers , zero-emission vehicles  and gaming grants .\nThey all come in advance of the 2017 budget, which will be unveiled Tuesday .\nProvincial education funding announcement earns every public student in B.C. $50 Federal, provincial governments announce $469M Highway 1 upgrade B.C. government offers 'token' tax credit for search and rescue, fire volunteers B.C. signs health care deal with federal government, also gets money for opioid crisis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:37:48.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
