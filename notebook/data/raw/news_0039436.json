'You were yourself at the time a troubled boy, immature, and I accept to some degree that this was sexual experimentation. 'But you knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong and that it was particularly wicked to invite a young girl to do it.' Prosecutor Anjali Gohil had told the judge that Driver began by kissing the girl on the lips and putting his tongue in her mouth. He then escalated his offending until he committed oral rape on her and also tried to force full sex on her. Judge Jamie Tabor told Driver at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) that he knew what he was doing was wrong and that it was 'particularly wicked to invite a young girl to do it'. 'When she refused to do what he wanted he would lock her in an understairs cupboard. She was scared of this because it was dark and full of spiders. She would be so scared that she would agree to do what he asked.' In a victim impact statement the girl said that what happened to her made her feel her life was 'rubbish'. 'I only realised it was really, really wrong when I started reading things in my mum's womens' magazines and other peoples' experiences. I felt sick about it. It was disgusting, it was nasty. 'I started smoking weed when I was about 12. It helped to calm me down and make me feel better. 'In October 2015 I was depressed and ended up taking an overdose and almost died. I did it because I wanted to die and I hated life.' It was in December that year that she told her mother what Driver had been doing to her. Gareth James, defending, asked the court to give Driver full credit for pleading guilty to the charges at the first opportunity. His sexual offending had been sporadic over a period of about 18 months at a time in his life when he did not appreciate the consequences of what he was doing, added Mr James. A great deal had changed in his life since then and he was now a father of two young children and he realised his behaviour had been abhorrent, he said. 'He realises full well that he cannot undo the harm he has done.'
