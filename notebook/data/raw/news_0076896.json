'We're having to fight for our humanity all over again' \nMr Ali and his mother said it was the first time they had been asked if they were Muslims when re-entering the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:16:14.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
