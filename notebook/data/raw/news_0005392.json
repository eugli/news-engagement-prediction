Reports Australia has been granted special treatment is contradicted by this statement, which suggests no dual nationals would be denied entry. On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull said Australians would be able to travel to the U.S. following a phone call with Australia's ambassador to the U.S. in Washington, Joe Hockey. Mr Turnbull is pictured with Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop on Tuesday President Trump is pictured after signing the executive order last Friday 'Australian passport holders will be able to travel to the United States in the same way they were able to prior to the executive order,' the Prime Minister told Sky News. The assurance to Australians considering travelling to the US matches those given to the United Kingdom and Canada. '(Mr Hockey) has had assurances, confirmation, from the White House that Australian passport holders - regardless of their place of birth or whether they are dual nationals or whether they hold another passport - will remain welcome to come and go to the United States in the usual way,' Mr Turnbull said on Tuesday. He did not outright say Australia had been given preferential treatment. At the time, the confirmation may have been considered an exemption because dual nationals were earlier said to be affected. Protesters are pictured at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) on January 28 to rally against the executive order 'Australian passport holders will be able to travel to the United States in the same way they were able to prior to the executive order,' the Prime Minister told Sky News on Tuesday (Mr Turnbull pictured at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday) Permanent U.S. residents have also been granted entry despite originally being covered by the ban. Mr Turnbull defended his decision not to publicly criticise the Trump ban, which temporarily halts the entire US refugee program and bans all entries from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. 'When I have frank advice to give to an American president, I give it privately, as good friends should, as wise prime ministers do, when they want to ensure they are best able to protect Australians and Australians' national interest,' he said on Tuesday. 'Others can engage in commentary. My job is to stand up for Australia, Australian interests, and deliver, and that's what we've done today.' Mr Turnbull's confirmation means Melbourne schoolboy Pouya Ghadirian - a dual Australian-Iranian citizen - should be able to attend a space camp in the US Pouya, 15, was refused an entry visa by US consular officials on Monday following Mr Trump's order Opposition Leader Bill Shorten took a swipe at Mr Turnbull's silence. While the US should be able to go about its business without interference from Australia, there were some issues where silence would be interpreted as agreement, he said. 'There isn't much point in having the top job if you're not going to back in what you believe,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Canberra. 'I don't believe that Australia should sign up to being a satellite and silent on Australian values, full stop.' Mr Turnbull's confirmation means Melbourne schoolboy Pouya Ghadirian - a dual Australian-Iranian citizen - should be able to attend a space camp in the US. Pouya, 15, was refused an entry visa by US consular officials on Monday following Mr Trump's order. He's now expected to join his classmates on a school trip to visit Orlando, Washington, and the US Space and Rocket Center in Alabama. Meanwhile, former US ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich condemned the new administration on Facebook, labelling the visa ban illegal and cruel. 'I take no pleasure in condemning our nation's actions,' he wrote. 'But the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.'
