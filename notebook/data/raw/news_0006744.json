Deriding the votes as “a radical reduction … to majority rule”, it complains that direct votes circumvent “the structures and safeguards of democracy”.\nAsserting that “democracy is more than just elections”, Freedom House outlines “a truly democratic system” as one which has “a free press, independent courts, legal protections for minorities, a robust opposition, and unfettered civil society groups.”\nDuring the 2014 European Parliament election campaign, civil society groups received $6 million (£4.77 million) in funding from Hungarian financier Soros’s Open Society Foundations.\nThe democratic election of populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe is also identified in the paper as a threat to democracy.\nThe election of, and subsequent governing by Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland, and Fidesz in Hungary, are branded a “menace” in the report, and cited as examples of “counter-democratic transitions”.\nAlong with attacking the two countries’ governments for having “repudiated liberal values”, Freedom House claims that in “providing economic benefits to its core constituents” — referring to how the party has generous welfare policies — PiS is “using the economic power of the state for party political ends”.\nCo-author of the report, Arch Quote: : “We see leaders and nations pursuing their own narrow interests without meaningful constraints or regard for the shared benefits of global peace and freedom.”\nThese trends are “starting to undo the international order of the past quarter-century” and have undermined respect for fundamental freedoms and democracy, he said.\nOpen Society Foundations frequently partners with Freedom House, and the Hungarian billionaire’s grant-making network was revealed to be a financial backer of the American NGO in documents published by DCLeaks.\n Freedom House , George Soros , Law and Justice , Open Society Foundations , PiS , Populism", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/poland-right-law-justice-party-europe", "https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fright-wing-europe-threat-democracy%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Soros-Linked+NGO%3A+Support+for+Right+Wing+Parties+in+Europe+%E2%80%98Threatens+Democracy%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fright-wing-europe-threat-democracy%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Soros-Linked+NGO%3A+Support+for+Right+Wing+Parties+in+Europe+%E2%80%98Threatens+Democracy%E2%80%99", "https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiZ5pDP0-zRAhVHWRoKHe_QD2AQFggfMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoros.dcleaks.com%2Fdownload%2F%3Ff%3D%2Ffinal%2520dec%2520board%2520book%2520electronic.pdf%26t%3Dus&usg=AFQjCNEAkSP_r5zemOi0LJga4Vg0yX9Pgw&sig2=EJNgsGqOld4aBVN4uOCwaA", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fright-wing-europe-threat-democracy%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Soros-Linked+NGO%3A+Support+for+Right+Wing+Parties+in+Europe+%E2%80%98Threatens+Democracy%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwid44Ca0-zRAhWGF8AKHSs1Bk4QFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdcleaks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2Fsoros%2Fworkplans%2Fmedia-program-workplan-field-pluralism-the-public-sphere-freedom-of-expression.docx&usg=AFQjCNHJ6fSQUAjXkAxQZLjmRqU7oLqJsg&sig2=K3yAGeIdajMs0AIBRfdLuA"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:15:55.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
