I would like to thank the Sultan of Selangor for granting him a pardon and thank you to everyone who has been fighting to save his life,” she told a press conference at the Amnesty International Malaysia headquarters on Monday. \nIn September 2003, Shahrul Izani, then 19, was arrested during a routine roadblock after being found in possession of 622gm of cannabis. \nIn December 2009, he was convicted by the Shah Alam High Court for drug trafficking, an offence that carries the mandatory death penalty. \nAmnesty International Malaysia took up Shahrul’s case in appealing to the Selangor Pardons Board, urging it to commute the death sentence. \nMore than 10,000 signatures from all over the world were collected in an appeals campaign that began in 2015. \nAmnesty International Malaysia executive director Shamini Darshni said that while this battle was won as a life had been saved, the use of the death penalty continues. \n“The secrecy surrounding executions in Malaysia (further) tarnishes our eroding human rights record at the global level. \n“Now that the Sultan of Selangor has granted Shahrul’s clemency application, we hope that the Federal Government will exercise its political will and abolish the mandatory death penalty as a first step towards total abolition,” she said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:10:50.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
