Image: planet By Miriam Kramer 2017-02-16 21:31:26 -0500 \nA new video shows a flock of 88 tiny satellites stretching their wings in space for the first time on Tuesday. \nThey were part of a launch that put a record-breaking 104 satellites into orbit at once. \nThe 88 Dove satellites were manufactured by private Earth-imaging company Planet, which used a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Indian Space Research Organization to get the job done. SEE ALSO: This rocket just launched a record-number of satellites to space \nThe rocket's onboard camera captured a beautiful video of at least some of the Doves deploying after launch. This is what it looks like when 88 #cubesats deploy from the side of a rocket into space.

Happy to report that all of the 88 Doves are happy, healthy, and rotating in real-time! pic.twitter.com/4xe8vWZnJr \nThat capability will let Planet's customers use the data to see the world changing — due to deforestation, agriculture or other large-scale impacts — in close to real time. \nThe launch of the PSLV rocket. \nImage: ISRO \n\"If everyday you're getting an alert where trees are going down where they aren't allowed to be harvested or cut down, then you can actually go and send someone and do something about it,\" Mike Safyan, Planet's director of launch and regulatory affairs, said in an interview before launch. \nThe new flock of Doves should be fully up and running in about three months.
