(ABC News: Jonathan Hair) \nNot-for-profit group Dance Health Alliance has just started running the classes on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, aiming to stimulate brains and get joints moving. \nDance teacher Gwen Korebrits has been helping to run the classes in New South Wales, where they have been held for several years. \n\"The main aim is absolutely to get people moving, to really stimulate them physically,\" she said. \n\"All the movements start off slow and small — there is no right or wrong in the class. We always make that very apparent and there is no technique that is necessary.\" \nThe instructors also work with people with disabilities, and illnesses such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Photo: Classes are also aimed at people with diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia and MS. (ABC News: Jonathan Hair) \n\"It's lovely to see people become present again,\" Ms Korebrits said. \n\"People with Alzheimer's and dementia [who] may not have been present for a while, actually immediately after [the dance] class come into the here and now.\" \nGerda Streiner lives at the nursing home where the first Queensland class took place. \nShe took part in the session, sitting next to her daughter Edith Streiner, who was visiting from NSW. \nShe said she loved dancing when she was younger. \n\"I missed it since my husband passed away — I was a loner and I didn't have any movement anymore,\" Mrs Streiner said. \n\"[I had] nothing which I really looked forward to and now today, it was good.\" \nHer daughter said she noticed a difference in her mother after the class. \n\"My mum was a lot looser in her body motions,\" Ms Streiner said. \n\"She says she doesn't move that way much anymore — she was a good dancer once, very good.\" \nThe group is hoping to run classes in Brisbane soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:52:14.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
