A recent rash of shootings in Chicago inspired the Philadelphia rapper to post an image of a young girl who was murdered and called on the Black Lives Matter movement to turn their focus to gun violence. \nMill, who has often rapped about using guns on his songs (and who has also spoken openly about how he wants to stop ), shifted his typical bravado and used his platform to mention the death of 11-year-old Takiya Holmes, who was hit by a stray bullet in Chicago and succumbed to her injuries on Feb. 14. \n“I think it’s about time for “black lives matter” focus on Chicago” it’s a lot of kids dying out there and we putting all our focus on cops! RIP BABY GIRL, ONE OF 3 little kids killed this week! CNN not covering this news!” read the caption to Mill’s post featuring an image of a smiling Holmes. \nHolmes was one of several who was shot in Chicago this week. A 2-year-old boy and his uncle were among the deadly incidents reported during a particularly violent span of deaths since last Tuesday. \nBlack Lives Matter was sparked in the wave of the killing of Trayvon Martin and typically aims its focus on police violence against the Black community. Mill recently teased a new track, “ Roses ,” that referenced the slain teen, which might be signaling a change in content direction for him.
