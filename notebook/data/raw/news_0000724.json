We are all still waiting and it has been the case for the last few seasons. \nEarlier in the campaign, Theo Walcott and several of the others were doing interviews, saying “this is the strongest Arsenal team for years” when they were winning, but you look at them now and think we’ve heard this all before. \nMost of the key players have faded away and aren’t performing consistently enough. \nEven Wenger must concede they need a miracle to win the Premier League now. They have to beat Chelsea on Saturday to have any chance, but the players must be at an all-time low after losing to Watford, who had one win in nine games before Tuesday. \nThey were the one mid-table team I thought could still get sucked into a relegation battle, so to go to Emirates Stadium and win is a massive blow to Arsenal. Their defending for both goals against Watford was shocking and it just makes me think even more that Arsenal’s back four is not up the level needed to win the title. \nThey also lack physicality in central midfield, even when Granit Xhaka is there and not too busy getting himself sent off. \nAaron Ramsey’s injury means Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain might play alongside Francis Coquelin in the middle of the park at Stamford Bridge. Good luck! They are going to need it because it is a mismatch against Nemanja Matic and N’Golo Kante. \nIt is time for Oxlade-Chamberlain to become the player we all thought he would be two or three years ago. You are also looking at Walcott to hit top gear again. I’m a big fan of his but he needs to start having a regular impact on games again — something you could say about a few of them. \nArsene talks about them being unlucky or that some of them are tired and the players believe it too easily. Chelsea have benefited from not having European football but January was not a tough month for Arsenal with very few midweek games, so why should they not be 100 per cent at it? \nThe title race is obviously in Chelsea’s hands. A few weeks ago I kept thinking Arsenal and Tottenham could push them, but what a great midweek it has been for Chelsea. Premier League round up: Man City secure big win and crucial three points \nThey have players who have been there and done it. Last year is a distant memory and Antonio Conte has got the best out of an excellent squad. \nChelsea are stronger physically and mentally and have the psychological edge, having won six of their last seven home games against Arsenal. \nDiego Costa will be looking to smash them up at the back. He’ll relish sticking the boot in to a centre-back pairing which, although I like Laurent Koscielny, often looks like it can get bullied. \nYou have to fancy them to beat Arsenal. If Arsenal lose on Saturday, they are out of the title race and suddenly looking over their shoulders worrying about a top-four finish. Time for that mental strength they talk about to come to the fore.
