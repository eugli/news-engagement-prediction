Inserting himself into the mess the party’s leader, Paul Nuttall, has made for himself by making exaggerated claims to have lost close friends in the lethal 1989 crush, Banks sent out a series of dismissive tweets.\nThe deaths of 96 people attending a football match – the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, which were determined by an inquest jury last year to have been unlawful killing due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command – was just “an accident”, according to Banks.\nWhy Stoke is make or break time for Ukip | Alexandra Phillips Read more \nHe acknowledged that the alleged South Yorkshire police cover up that followed, as it sought to avoid responsibility for police failures and instead project blame onto the victims themselves, was “wrong”. But then Banks agreed that “obviously” there had been “pushing & shoving thuggery” at Hillsborough in common with Heysel, the 1985 disaster in Belgium at which 39 supporters of Juventus died, where hooliganism by a minority of Liverpool supporters was a contributing cause.\nThis equation with Heysel has been one of the easiest and most pernicious smears, enabling the original police lies of “thuggery” to take hold and cause the bereaved Hillsborough families to endure a traumatic, exhausting 27-year campaign for the truth to be established . Finally last April, after two years of evidence, the longest case heard in British legal history, at which police witnesses and lawyers attacked supporters again and sought to make a link with Heysel, the inquest jury determined there was no behaviour on the part of Liverpool supporters that contributed to the dangerous situation at Hillsborough.\nBanks showed no evidence he had read or followed the inquest's determinations, then went further still\n\nBanks, whose late-night tweets prodding, provoking and – from the funder of virulent political campaigns himself – opining that Hillsborough has unjustifiably become politicised, showed no evidence that he had read or followed the inquest’s determinations. He then went further still. Responding to a challenge from Brian Reade, the Mirror journalist and Liverpool supporter who was at Hillsborough and kept a candle of truth flickering through the years when the lies were widely publicly believed, Banks accused him of “milking the tragedy” and said: “I’m sick to death of hearing about it.”\nThe Hillsborough inquests, supported by Operation Resolve, a huge and this time proper police investigation into the course of events, presented the bereaved families with more accurate, detailed, horrific evidence about how their loved ones were killed than they had access to before. The people who died suffered traumatic asphyxia, their hearts and brains slowly extinguished because in the terrible crush they could not expand their chests to breathe. They were 89 men and seven women: sons and daughters, fathers and one mother, Inger Shah, from varied backgrounds and from all over the country.\nTheir loved ones, sitting in court, heard survivors recall the terror and horror of being trapped between the iron railings of the squalid Leppings Lane terrace: the vomiting, faces turning blue, screams for help ignored by police, the cracking of ribs, evacuation of bowels and bladders, the public deaths. In almost unbearably moving personal statements, the families spoke about their love for those who died so needlessly, and the grief and devastation it has caused them in the many years since.\nThey could not allow the police lies and evasions of the truth, which secured an accidental death verdict at the first and now thoroughly discredited 1990-91 inquest, to go unchallenged. But they had to fight against ignorance and suppression for 20 years before the then Labour ministers, Andy Burnham and Maria Eagle, began a proper new justice process in 2009, which Theresa May, as a Conservative home secretary from 2010, fully supported and funded.\nYet Banks is now suddenly drawn to proclaim his own certainties on Hillsborough, actually using the words: “I am sick to death of hearing about it.”\nOn just one of the many levels that this is so very distasteful is the gloomy realisation that even conclusive findings from the longest, intensely adversarial and forensic legal inquest ever – followed by huge media coverage of its verdicts – has not stopped the continued dissemination of falsehoods. Banks’s insensitivity, self-absorption and lack of empathy are now, lamentably, endemic features of Twitter as it turns from cool-seeming social media platform to an unsupervised playground for name-calling and bullying.\nWorst, though, is the reason this sad trolling is worthy of responding to at all. Banks, who made his money selling insurance and sees himself, like Nigel Farage, as an ex-public school iconoclast of the “liberal establishment”, is no longer just some rightwing outlier. David Cameron’s referendum furnished him with a platform for spending £7.5m promoting Farage’s anti-immigrant leave campaign, and elevated him to a shaper of national consciousness. Banks’ worldview is no longer fringe; it is becoming our country’s dominant perspective, and May, so sound and sensible in recognising the truth about Hillsborough, is taking the country his way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:59:04.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
