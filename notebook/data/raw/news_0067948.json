Labour's victory in Stoke is a decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division. But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland — Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) February 24, 2017 \nHe said: “Labour’s victory in Stoke is a decisive rejection of Ukip’s politics of division and dishonesty. \n“But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland. In both campaigns, Labour listened to thousands of voters on the doorstep. \n“Both constituencies, like so many in Britain, have been let down by the political establishment. \n“To win power to rebuild and transform Britain, Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus.” \nThe Conservatives increased their vote share by more than 8% in Copeland, while Labour’s was down by nearly 5%. \nHarrison said her victory showed “the people are ready for change”. \nShe told Sky News: “I think we ran an extremely positive campaign and it was a campaign that represented the needs of this area. \n“And I know this area because I have lived here all of my life. \n“I think that, and the combination of Jeremy Corbyn’s views on nuclear in an area which is so dependent on Sellafield and on Moorside, contributed to my win tonight.” \nIn her victory speech, Ms Harrison said the result was a “truly historic event”. \nShe said: “It’s been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t represent them. \n“They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum and which will build a country which represents everyone. \n“That’s why they voted for me tonight.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:23:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
