Are energy price caps a good idea? Credit: PA \nThis morning, British Gas reported a sharp fall both in profits and the number of complaints. The company extended its price freeze to August. \nCentrica's CEO told ITV News that this is proof that the market is \"working for customers\". \nIt's time to stop \"banging on about switching\" said Iain Conn. Apparently, customers \"know how easy it is\". \nGovernment intervention is \"unnecessary\", a cap on energy prices would have \"unintended consequences\". \nConventional wisdom has it that anyone on a Standard Variable Tariff is paying more for their gas and electricity than they should be. The boss of Centrica disagrees that the energy market is not working Credit: PA \nBritish Gas has five million customers on a standard tariff. The company's own figures show they could save £210 a year if they switched to the cheapest energy deal on the market. \nIain Conn argues that they stay not because they are confused or apathetic but because they are happy where they are. \n\"Frankly the standard tariff gets a bad rep,\" he told me. \n\"A lot of customers value these tariffs, they don't want to be always switching.\" \nNevertheless, in Westminster, the noises point to government intervention. \nIain Conn warned a price cap, however temporary, would lead to the cheapest fixed deals disappearing and would push some suppliers out of business, reducing choice. \nHe told ITV News: \nIf the government introduces a price cap, there’s significant chance of unintended consequences. \nFor example, one thing that has been talked about is... if you're on a fixed deal, at the end of it, why don't we limit the amount that the price can go up? \nThe problem with that is, I think it's going to put all of fixed price deals up and that's an unintended consequence. Likewise, if the government starts price regulating, it will probably reduce the number of competitors in the market, which will reduce choice for consumers. \nAnd finally, if governments start price regulating again, when do they stop? – Iain Conn, Centrica \nYou may recall that in September 2013 Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, announced a plan to freeze gas and electricity bills. Ed Miliband announced plans for an energy price freeze at the Labour Party Conference in 2013 Credit: PA \nThe idea was strongly criticised. The then-chairman of Centrica warned of “economic ruin”, the industry warned of blackouts and the conservative party dismissed it as \"a con\". \nNow, the con may be on. The government is considering a range of remedies and won't rule a price cap out. \nAs for Ed Miliband, his view is unchanged. \nIn a statement, he told ITV News: \"The energy market was broken in 2013 and it is broken now. Imposing a temporary price cap and resetting the market made sense then and would make sense now.\" Last updated Thu 23 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:54:00.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
