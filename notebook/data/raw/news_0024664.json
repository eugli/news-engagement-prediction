Her message to the voters is to put their trust in her. She will definitely continue my late father’s (Tan Sri Adenan Satem) legacy in this area and continue fighting for the people of Sarawak,” he told reporters. \nJamilah is unable to go on a by-election campaign trail as she is still observing the iddah (mourning period), as required in Islam, following her husband’s demise due to heart complications on Jan 11. \nAzizul, who appeared pumped up for the task of representing his mother in the campaign, said she had been reminding him to take care of his meals and to keep to the programme that been planned for him. \nHe said family members would also be campaigning for Jamilah and they had already received the programme schedule drawn up by the Barisan election machinery. \n“The programme includes visits to villages and longhouses in the Tanjong Datu constituency. \n“We (family members) have a group chat among ourselves to be kept updated,” he said. \nAzizul said his mother was also being assisted in the campaign through social media. \nHe said his family members, friends and Sarawak Barisan component members, including state Cabinet ministers, were constantly updating information on their social websites. — Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:15:30.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
