The brothers were hospitalized in what was described as a state of shock following the incident on Tuesday night in Bondy. A document published on Thursday by the National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism (BNVCA), which was based on a police complaint by the alleged victims, did not specify their medical condition, the report said. The kippah-wearing brothers, whose father is a Jewish leader in Bondy, were forced off the main road by another vehicle on to a side street, according to the report. While the vehicle was in motion, the driver and a passenger shouted anti-Semitic slogans at the brothers that included “dirty Jews, you’re going to die,” the father told BNVCA based on the complaint filed by his sons. The vehicle forced the brothers to stop their car, and they were surrounded by several men whom they described as having a Middle Eastern appearance. The men came out of a hookah café on to the side street, according to the case report. The alleged attackers surrounded the brothers, then kicked and punched them repeatedly while threatening that they would be murdered if they moved. One of the alleged attackers then reportedly sawed off the finger of one of the brothers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:42:27.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
