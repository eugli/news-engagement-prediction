These are the only two cases in Guangdong province, China. So far, there have been no reports if similar changes have occurred elsewhere,\" Lindmeier said. \n\"It is a reminder that we have to keep looking closely,\" he told Reuters. \nAnimal health experts say bird flu infection rates on Chinese poultry farms may be far higher than previously thought, because the strain of the deadly virus in humans is hard to detect in chickens and geese. \nIn all, since the \"fifth wave\" of the virus, first identified in 2013, began in October 2016, 425 human cases have been recorded in China, including 73 deaths officially reported by authorities, according to WHO figures. \n\"Most of these cases had known exposure to poultry or its environment, that is the main important link to this influenza type,\" Lindmeier told a news briefing. \nIn all since 2013, there have been 1,200 laboratory-confirmed cases in China, including more than one-third since October, he said. \n(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Mark Trevelyan) - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:52:55.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
