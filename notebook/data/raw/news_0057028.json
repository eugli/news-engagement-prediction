OK, I've never, ever had that thought before, but now there's a site that does just that, and it will probably make you wonder how you survived without such a glorious tool in your life until now. \nPushbullet co-founder Christopher Hesse created an image-to-image translation demonstration that generates a corresponding photograph from any image you feed it. In this case, though, Hesse trained his system on roughly 2,000 stock images of cats. When you sketch out a cat on his site here , it'll produce an image of a cat that best matches your sketch. \nHowever, if your cat sketching skills are as \"good\" as ours, the results can be hilarious, or mildly terrifying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:05:09.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
