Mr Evans said: 'When they refused and walked on, one of them shouted: 'Hey you w s. You c***s get back here! McGreal [then] jumped on Mr Scott's back. 'Mr McGreal had his arms around Mr Scott's throat. He threw punches at him. Mr Scott was unsuccessful at shaking him off. 'Both Pumputis and McGreal were extremely drunk and adopting a confrontational manner. The followed the men on to the Anlaby Road flyover a bridge with a 30ft drop down on to the Hull to London railway line. 'Only a single railing prevents a fall over the side. While stood there both men were threatened to be thrown to their death. 'Mr Pumputis made the remark 'I am going to get deported anyway so I don't care what I do. One of you is going over that bridge.' Mr Evans said the reference to deportation was attributed to Pumputis as he was a Lithuanian national and the bridge he was referring was the Hull to London railway line. He said: 'By now Mr Scott was really concerned. Mr McGreal put his hand in his pocket so Mr Scott thought he had a weapon and McGreal said: 'I am going to kill you about 10 times.' 'The threats continued with McGreal saying: 'I am going to have this cigarette, call it £20 and you can go on your way! Mr Scott implied he did not have any money to which McGreal replied: 'Well if there isn't £20 by the time I have finished this cigarette I am going to throw you over the bridge.' Arnoldas Pumputis laughed and waved on the steps of Hull Crown Court as he walked free 'He then leaned back on the bridge and began lighting the cigarette. 'That was all too much for the two men,' said Mr Evans. 'They saw their chance and ran as fast as they could from the direction they had come. Both men gave chase. At the foot of the flyover, Pumputis and McGreal said: 'Just forget it' and they stopped the chase.' Mr Evans said both men were investigated but McGreal was released with no further action to be taken, while Pumputis had pleaded guilty to assault with attempt to rob. Defence barrister Nigel Clive said Pumputis had been very drunk. He said Mr Scott was concerned McGreal was the one who was going to stab him or throw them over the bridge but it was Pumputis who appeared to hold him back. 'While he quite rightly needs to be punished, he is a hard-working young man with no previous conviction. A conviction like this weighs far more heavily on a young man who wants to progress through society.' Recorder Timothy Roberts, QC, said he had to sentence on the basis Pumputis accepted a role in a joint offence and the other man had not been prosecuted. 'This was shameful but the offence falls in range of a suspended sentence,' said Mr Roberts. 'I accept the submissions- given the wider circumstance explained to me by Mr Evans.' He sentenced him to nine months suspended for 18 months and ordered he should complete 100 hours unpaid work.
