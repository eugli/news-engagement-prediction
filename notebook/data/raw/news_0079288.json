Yeah. Here’s the new 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross . Oh, God, this is it.

Power is delegated via a CVT gearbox. An optional 2.2-liter turbodiesel is also available with an eight-speed automatic.

Those two concepts seem at odds with each other. \nThe Evo X was the last great car that Mitsubishi made and it’s gone now. Without it, the Mitsubishi lineup is woefully bereft of anything that could be considered sporty or fun. Sorry, Eclipse Cross.

I understand that these types of cars exist in part so that the company can keep making enthusiast cars for nerds like us. But, here we have a new crossover, which will hopefully sell in droves so that Mitsubishi can focus on better things. \nThe question now is, what other things?
