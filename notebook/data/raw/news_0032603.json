\nStarc said that decision lies firmly with captain Steve Smith. \n“It was probably a bit different to how we’re used back home and it will depend on how the ball is reacting and whether it’s swinging conventionally or reverse,” he said. \n“I’m sure there’ll be times when we’re called on to bowl a few extra overs in a spell but probably a lot of short spells as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:54:14.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
