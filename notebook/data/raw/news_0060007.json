MUST READ Delhi's Hauz Khas rape accused stayed in park for two days after crime, arrested in same clothes \nDevi had kicked Raja out of her house when he showed no signs of improvement and warned him not to return till he had mended his ways. \nThe frail woman lives with her husband and four younger children in her humble house in Dhobi Mohalla of South Delhi’s Arjun Nagar. \nConcerned about her other children, Devi - who works as a maid - wants them to continue their schooling to avoid falling in bad company. \n“I don’t know when will Raja be released from jail. But if I am alive when he comes out, I will ensure he does not influence my younger children,” Devi was quoted as saying. \nThe old lady, however, acknowledged that her son who had tattooed his nickname ‘Jundal’ on his arm, was into drugs and committed small time thefts. \nHowever, locals claim that Raja was a constant troublemaker and carried a knife with him always. \nInterestingly, he was never arrested till he raped the 24-year-old Northeastern woman.
