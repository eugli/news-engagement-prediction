The emotes themselves don't take months. It's more on the order of days/weeks. It's more of a prioritization issue. We have multiple new heroes being worked on right now plus numerous events and event-related content. We're always asking ourselves 'what would make the biggest impact for the most people' when we prioritize. Right now, we feel like introducing a new hero to the line up would be more impactful to the game. Hope that makes sense.\" \nThere's more than a few a few Jack Bauer jokes, as well as one poster pointing out that the Greek alphabet has 24 letters. That's linked to the idea that Greek actor Alex Malao would be playing the next hero after he listed Overwatch on his CV. \nHowever, he's since responded to YouTuber TheKingFenrir to deny that, saying he was playing a character speaking Greek (presumably for the Ilios map). \nThe main take away here though is \"no Doomfist\", not year at least. If Terry Crews goes near a voice recording studio likely know about it before he reaches the mic, given fans fervour for him to play the part. \nSeen something newsworthy?
