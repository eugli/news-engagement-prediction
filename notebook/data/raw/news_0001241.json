(Photo: Frederick M. Brown, Getty Images)\nTamron Hall has exited NBC News after the network disclosed plans to cancel her 9 a.m. ET/PT hour of the Today Show to make room for Megyn Kelly.\nHall, a 10-year veteran of the network who has appeared on Today since 2014, has already left without a goodbye: Her last day anchoring on Today and MSNBC was Tuesday, and her contract expires in February.\nIn a statement, the network called her \"an exceptional journalist,\" and said it entered talks to renew her contract. \"We hoped that she would decide to stay. We are disappointed that she has chosen to leave, but we wish her all the best.\"\nUSA TODAY\nMegyn Kelly's NBC show will follow 'Today' this fall\nBut her departure may have been foreshadowed by the decision to give Kelly, hired from Fox News in January, a morning hour this fall. That meant the certain demise of the hourlong block Hall hosted with Al Roker, who will remain co-host until Kelly's show arrives.\nIn her own statement released by NBC, Hall said “the last ten years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I’m grateful. I’m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you.”\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jZxaks", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/01/27/megyn-kelly-nbc-news-today-show/97141790/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/24/1393250706000-Tamron-Hall.jpg", "http://usat.ly/2jZxaks", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/24//1393250706000-Tamron-Hall.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94504ad1a900553194fbd1a91bd8a9981bb3489c/c=0-0-2000-2669&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/24//1393250706000-Tamron-Hall.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24133e0a529d09e97bf382cf2b861ce2d43d2c77/c=494-0-4027-3533/local/-/media/2016/12/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636181037860444027-b01-kelly1-1115.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-02T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:16:29.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
