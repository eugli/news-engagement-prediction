'Considered a hero' \nPolly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: \"Mayweather has never shown remorse for his serious and sustained attacks against women and has even made excuses for his crimes. \n\"This is not acceptable. He is still considered a hero, and his UK tour will undoubtedly be very lucrative. \n\"What message does this send out about violence against women? \n\"If we do not hold perpetrators to account - especially high-profiles ones like Mayweather - we will never drive the culture change we need to keep women and girls safe.\" Image copyright David Becker/Getty Images Image caption Floyd Mayweather spent time in a Las Vegas jail following a conviction for domestic violence \nMayweather will meet fans and speak for 45 minutes to audiences at Leicester's Athena, Indigo at the O2 in London and at The Auditorium in Liverpool. \nThe boxer embarked on a larger \"European Victory Tour\" around venues in the UK last year. \nMayweather won world titles at five weights and retired with an unblemished record. \nIn December 2011, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison for attacking his ex-girlfriend Josie Harris. \nHe also pleaded guilty to two counts of domestic violence in 2002 and was given a suspended sentence for assaulting two women in a Las Vegas nightclub in 2004.
