Kailangan lang niya ng nebulizer (she just needs a nebulizer) so we’re getting it for her,” Diño captioned her Instagram picture. In another post, Diño documented the process of how Whang-od, now 100 years old, inscribed a scorpion tattoo on her arm, a process she described as “excruciating.” A post shared by Liza Diño-Seguerra (@lizadino) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:27am PST A post shared by Liza Diño-Seguerra (@lizadino) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:53am PST “It was like a badge of honor to see Apo Whang-Od’s art etched on my skin,” Diño explained. “Proud to say that my first tattoo was inked by no less than our own local pride, the oldest and most revered tattoo artist of Kalinga, Apo Whang-Od.” A post shared by Liza Diño-Seguerra (@lizadino) on Feb 18, 2017 at 4:21am PST \nWhang-od’s artistic creations were featured in the exhibit “Tattoo: Ritual, Identity, Obsession, Art” at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada last year.
