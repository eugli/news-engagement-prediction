The audio reveals CNN employees discussing haphazard reporting of poll numbers, insulting Fox News, and claiming the \"primary role of a journalist\" is to \"aid the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\" \nThe anonymous source, \"Miss X,\" worked in an Atlanta location for CNN. Veritas posted the following conversations about polls numbers on Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor. \nMiss X: \"This wasn't released until two weeks after. So can we say a newly released poll?\" \nJoe Sterling: \"No, you can't say that. You can't say that at all. This isn't a newly released.\" \nMiss X: \"But it says newly released on Friday.\" \nJoe Sterling: \"I know, how did we write about this? Did we write a wire about this? \"I don't think we stand to change how people think of her [Sotomayor]. Geez, I mean if someone picked this up it's not going to change â€“ it's not going to change anybody's opinion.\" \nSee more of the audio from Project Veritas below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:24:55.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
