The green signal for setting up two new degree colleges comes less than a month after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had said that the TRS government would sanction a couple of colleges at the graduation level for Old City. MIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi had raised the issue of Old City requiring more institutions at the higher education level and wanted that part of the city to be transformed into a hub for educational institutions at all levels. Following this, higher education special chief secretary Ranjeev R Acharya last week issued orders for the setting up of the two degree colleges. Both of them will come up at the existing campuses of Government Junior Colleges at Falaknuma and Chanchalguda respectively. The state government also approved the allocation of Rs 10 crore for the above proposal, which would be provided in the budget to be presented next month. The orders regarding the sanction of posts will be issued separately.The Commissioner of Collegiate Education, Telangana, has been asked to ensure that the academic activity in both the colleges starts from the ensuing academic year.
