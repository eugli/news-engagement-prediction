Arsenal were, yet again, pathetic in a big game and the fans are tired of seeing their troops fall short for what seems like an eternity. \nOf course, the last time they won the Premier League was with the 'Invincibles' back in 2004, but that 13-year gap feels like a lifetime now as the Gunners continue to make the same mistakes time and time again. Article continues below \nWenger's resistance to spending big, the running joke about Arsenal's fourth place occupancy and their inability to challenge in the Champions League - despite always qualifying for it - have left the red half of north London frustrated and divided. \nIt's worth noting that Wenger has heightened the expectations that the fans now exude during his 20 years with the club. The success during his first decade was phenomenal, and, despite criticism about the club's methods to do so, he should be applauded for driving the club to a new, impressive stadium during his tenure.

I think that’s it. \n“He actually mentioned while we were talking last night that it’s coming to the end - I’ve never heard him say that. \n“I feel if someone’s going to ask me ‘do you think he’ll go at the end of the season?’ I would say I think he will.” \nIs this just what Arsenal fans were hoping to hear?
