billion prawn farm on Legune Station near Kununurra in northern Australia. \nProject Sea Dragon managing director Chris Mitchell said a decision was due in March, but there were still lots of elements to the project that needed to be finalised. \nHe said upgrading the road to Legune Station, which would require new bridges over Sandy Creek and Keep River, was on track to being fully funded. \nHe said recent road funding from the Western Australian Government ($16.3 million) and $40 million from the Federal Government was a great result for the project. \n\"This is a very big jigsaw puzzle and there are bits falling into place,\" he said. \n\"[The WA road funding] was anticipated, and we're very pleased for that and it gives an indication of the commitment of governments for this project. \n\"But of course governments are waiting on a final investment decision as well [before all road funding is fully allocated].\" Still a long road ahead \nMr Mitchell said issues around land tenure, environmental and Indigenous approvals were still being worked on. \n\"We are targeting March [to make the final investment decision],\" he told ABC Rural. \n\"We would have liked it done earlier, but the environmental impact assessments have taken a little bit longer than we would have liked. \n\"There's a lot of elements to get together and a lot of what is happening is contingent upon government decision-making as well. \n\"[Come March] the company might say yes [we're going ahead], or we might say we want to go ahead, but we're unable to go ahead immediately because we don't have the permissions.\" \nMr Mitchell said the $US1.45 billion project was attracting \"considerable interest\" from investors across Asia, Europe and the United States, and the company was also in discussions to qualify for funding through the Commonwealth's $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF) . \nMeanwhile, Legune Station is going through one of its wettest starts to a year on record , and its major water source, Forsyth Dam, has overflowed. \nIf the project goes ahead it will be one of the biggest prawn farms in the world, generating an unprecedented number of jobs in the East Kimberley region. \nThe long-term plan is to have 10,000 hectares of ponds capable of producing 100,000 tonnes of black tiger prawns each year. \nPrawns from Legune would be trucked to the processing plant at Kununurra , then on to the Wyndham port for export.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:46:12.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
