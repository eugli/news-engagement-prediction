The justice minister, Michael Keenan, said the man would be charged with serious terrorism offences.\n“This morning, the Australian Federal Police arrested a 42-year-old man in the New South Wales town of Young in relation to terrorism offences.” Turnbull said. “Police will allege that the man arrested has sought to advise Isil on how to develop high-tech weapons capability.\nAustralia taking cyber fight to Isis, Malcolm Turnbull to confirm Read more \n“Here, the police will allege that this individual, in a regional centre, acted with intent to provide Isil with the capability, with the technical capability, and high-tech capability, to detect and develop missiles.”\nHe reiterated that “the support and the cooperation of Australian Muslim communities – the vast majority of whom are law-abiding, patriotic Australians – is absolutely vital in our common struggle against extremism and terrorism.”\nThe AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, said the arrest was made as part of an 18-month investigation. He said the man would be charged with “a number of offences, which include two serious foreign incursion offences under the Commonwealth criminal code which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment”.\nHe said the man was allegedly involved in “researching and designing laser warning devices to help warn against incoming guiding munitions used by coalition forces in Syria and Iraq” and helping Isis develop its own long-range guided missile capabilities.\nColvin said the man, who was Australian born and an Australian citizen, had technical training as an electrician and the research he was doing was “credible”.\n“In terms of the advice he was providing, we will allege it was fairly sophisticated and well-planned.”\nColvin said it would be alleged the 42-year-old had networks and contacts with Isis, but not necessarily in conflict zones. It would be alleged the man had acted alone.\nThe man did not apply for bail when he appeared in Young local court later on Tuesday, and was remanded in custody.\nTurnbull said the incident was “yet another reminder of the enduring threat we face from Islamist terrorism”, but the public should not be cowed.\n“They want to divide us, they want us to turn on each other – we will not let them succeed,” he said.\n\nAustralian security and counter-terrorism Islamic State Malcolm Turnbull news  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:38:52.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
