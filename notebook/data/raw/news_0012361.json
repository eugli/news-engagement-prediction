Robart's restraining order is granted on a national level and will take effect immediately, according to multiple reports. \nThe former George W. Bush-appointed judge's order will likely lead to a circuit split due to an opposite ruling by a Boston judge on Friday, forcing the matter to be decided by the Supreme Court . \nFerguson's 19-page complaint stated Trump's order violated aspects of religious freedom and equal protect, as outlined in the Constitution. Minnesota joined Washington's suit earlier this week. A handful of states have also announced separate legal action in response to Trump's banning non-U.S. citizens from Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.
