Teel, who previously held the title of president, will remain as owner and CEO of the company, but he will spend more time in the community promoting healthy food choices, Raley's said in a news release Thursday. Keith Knopf Ivie and Associates Teel said in a prepared statement that he expects to focus \"more on where we are going in the future and how we can realize our vision and purpose.\" \"I am committed to continuing to build on our strong culture, and to support the passion our people have to infuse life with health and happiness by changing the way our customers eat, one plate at a time,\" he added. Knopf joined the company in 2015, shortly after Teel, the grandson of the grocer's founder, acquired majority ownership of Raley's. The company owns and operates 121 stores under four brands: Raley's, Bel Air Markets, Nob Hill Foods and Food Source. It also has 13 Aisle 1 Fuel Stations. Raley's is the Sacramento area's fourth-largest private company , with $3.1 billion in annual revenue, and the region's fifth-largest private-sector employer , with about 5,600 workers. Also on Thursday, Raley's announced that Mark Foley , senior vice president of human resources and labor relations has been promoted to chief people officer.
