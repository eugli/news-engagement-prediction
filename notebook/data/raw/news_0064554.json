So the room for manoeuvre is rather limited,\" she added.\nThe GDP figures showed that the German economy grew by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2016, primarily because of strong domestic demand.\nAs well as higher consumer spending, there was an increase in federal, state and local government expenditure.\nGermany's economic strength has traditionally been bolstered by exports.\nIn the final quarter of last year, however \"the development of foreign trade had a downward effect on growth\", the Statistical Office said.\nWhile exports of goods and services rose by 3.3% from a year earlier, imports increased by 4.5%.\nToo strong Thursday's figures follow European Commission criticism of Germany's relative economic strength within the eurozone.\nOn Wednesday the Commission said Germany's current account surplus - which measures the balance of goods, services and investments into and out of the country - was too big.\nIt said that cutting that surplus would help the whole of the eurozone.\nIt also said Germans were saving too much and not investing enough in both the private and public sector.\nThe Commission acknowledged that steps had been taken to reverse that situation, but more could be done.\nTo address the economic \"imbalances\" the Commission said: \"Further policy action should aim at further strengthening investment, including by reforming the services sector and improving the efficiency of the tax system, as well as stimulating labour market activity of second earners, low-income earners and older workers to boost households' incomes and counter the effects of ageing.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2027/production/_94813280_jobsfairformigrants.jpg", "http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-308_en.htm?locale=en", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/916F/production/_94813273_germanshoppersgetty.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:22:47.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
