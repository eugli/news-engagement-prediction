Definitely not my definition of 'proactive'. I feel sorry for those who weren't awake and will wake up to this news in the morning!,' one woman wrote on the airline's Facebook post.\n'Surely you would have known about this earlier! The 'proactive' action would have been to alert affected customers earlier to enable them to sort out their options!\n'It's funny, you were able to email me at 11.40am on the 2nd with an 'important message from Tiger Air' to inform me that there would be no entertainment on the flight, it took another 12 hours to actually tell us there wouldn't be a flight.'\nThe budget airline's services between the countries have been suspended since January 11 - after 'changes in Bali airport's administration'.\nThe budget airline's services between the countries have been suspended since January 11 - after 'changes in Bali airport's administration'\nThe airline has offered all customers a full refund and assured them they would be 're-accommodated by Tigerair onto service back to Australia by Virgin Australia'.\n'Tigerair Australia sincerely apologises to affected customers for the inconvenience that this situation has caused and continues to work hard to minimise the inconvenience for all affected customers,' the post read.\nPassengers booked in to fly on Saturday are still in the dark as to whether their services will be disrupted.\nTigerair has suggested people refrain from messaging or ringing them about the cancellations and wait for 'proactive communications'.\n'Tigerair's call centre and social team are currently experiencing a higher volume of calls and private messages than normal, so wait times will be longer than usual,' they said.\nPassengers appeared frustrated at the late notice given by the airline.\n'Good job Tiger. You most likely knew this would happen yet wait to alert customers at midnight. Most customers affected by this are probably asleep and will wake up excited for their holiday only to see the bad news.\n'Nice job giving customers the choice between spending thousands more on new last minute flights or losing thousands on already paid for accommodation.
