False Missile Warning Rattles Air Force Crew One of those times when you accidentally broadcast the wrong message. US Air Force The warning, with emoji added in Facebook post. \nIt was just another typical day for U.S. Air Force personnel working at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany last week — until all psychic hell broke loose. \nThe work-a-day routine was shattered with a simple red message on Valentine’s Day that suddenly popped up on the base’s computers: “MISSILE INBOUND. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY!” It was labeled “Severity: High,” the Air Force Times reported. \nTurns out it was all a mistake. \nThe message was accidentally sent out to all computers on an emergency alert system for the 52nd Fighter Wing section of the NATO base. Someone was working on a design for the message and intended to send it to one person to check — but broadcast it instead, according to an official. \n“One of the command post controllers was building a template for this specific thing that was posted, and he inadvertently sent it to everybody ,” Major Byron McGarry told Stars and Stripes. \nIt took eight minutes before a new message appeared to inform personnel to “disregard” the missile alert. As someone who posted a screenshot of that message on Instagram said: “Uhhh.” \nIt wasn’t clear how many people were affected by the alert. \nNo one’s talking about how everyone conducted themselves, though someone mentioned on Facebook that a buddy ripped his pants running. Some had the presence of mind to get screen grabs of the messages. Those responsible for the blooper have been counseled, said McGarry, who called it a teaching opportunity. Stars and Stripes Yeah. \nMcGarry told the Air Force Times that no alarms or sirens sounded , so apparently the fake message didn’t trigger a full base response. \n“Our command post has robust standard operating procedures that govern distribution of actual emergency messages to the wing,” said McGarry. New “checklist items” will be added to “mitigate accidental distribution of test messages in the future,” he added. \nLots of relieved, stunned, funny comments peppered a Facebook page of a former airman who posted a screenshot of the missile warning with a shocked emoji that he added.
