Barack Obama filled out his brackets — men’s and women’s — for ESPN all eight years he was in office. \nThe network released a statement on Trump’s decision: \nWe expressed our interest to the White House in continuing the presidential bracket. They have respectfully declined. \nWhite House spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Washington Post , which broke the story, “We look forward to working with ESPN on another opportunity in the near future.” \nObama invited ESPN’s Andy Katz to the White House in order to film a segment making his picks for the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments. But while Obama was a vocal basketball fan and pickup player, Trump has not shown that same level of interest.
