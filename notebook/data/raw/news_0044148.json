From the Associated Press : \n“I am glad I didn’t stop,” said Bailey, 35, who thanked his wife for enabling him to continue. “She supported me in that decision. \n“We had our daughter, Ophelia, this summer, which made things much more interesting as a family. So we had to be creative in how I train and what I did this year. But it all worked out and I am so thankful for them, and everyone who has helped me so far.” \nNow, we’ll see Bailey in his fourth Olympics in 2018. More Olympics!
