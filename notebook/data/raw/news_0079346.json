Zimbabwe's population growth rate was last measured at just 1.1% in 2012, the state-owned Chronicle newspaper reported Saturday. \nReaction to the senators' call (which came from both sides of the political divide) was swift and mostly angry. \n\"How do you propose those big families would be supported... from what jobs? In which economy?\" wrote 'mpengo' on the paper's website. \n\"We are being led by mad men,\" commented @keddah83. \nBut @_Dingz said: \"Their argument makes sense just poorly executed, we are underpopulated & that is fact. But we also can't afford many kids too; catch22.\" \nCritics and the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) blame the uncertainties caused by President Robert Mugabe's controversial policies on land, company ownership and currency for scaring away foreign investors.
