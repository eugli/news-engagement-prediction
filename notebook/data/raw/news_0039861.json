Who could forget Lincoln's tirade at Gettysburg, or FDR's fireside meltdowns, and of course, Ronald Reagan's famously saying, 'Mr Gorbachev, if you don't tear down this f—ing wall I'm gonna lose my shit!'\" \n\"Trump offered this pretty racist response,\" Meyers added when a black reporter asked the president about a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. \"It's racist to assume all black people know each other,\" said Meyers. \"You don't know all orange people. Hey Donald, can you set up a meeting with Snookie and the Lorax?\" \nTrevor Noah took a similar approach. \"We had a really nice show planned for you,\" Noah began. \"Then in the middle of the day, Hurricane Trump happened. Again.\" \nShowing clips of Trump defending himself against the press who say he \"rants and raves,\" Noah said, in his best inebriated Trump impression, \"I'm not drunk, you're all drunk. You're all drunk. This is my motherf—ing house ... Holy shit!\" Tonight at 11/10c, Hurricane Trump destroys the perfectly fine show we had planned for you tonight. pic.twitter.com/3GEjzhhIPK — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) February 17, 2017 \nOn The Late Show , Stephen Colbert tried to explain the press conference, but words initially failed him. \"He started off by defending the rough start his administration's had by immediately attacking America's true enemy: Anybody but him.\" \nWhen Trump said he \"inherited a mess,\" Colbert countered: \"No, you inherited a fortune, we elected a mess.\" Tonight!
