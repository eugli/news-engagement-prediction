Two days after the White House released a list of what it called 78 “underreported terror attacks” — an effort to back up President Donald Trump’s comment that the media has been ignoring terrorism across the globe — a prominent Jewish leader who defended Trump’s campaign told POLITICO in an interview that he was dismayed by what he took to be a glaring omission.\n“I am deeply perplexed as to how the administration put out a statement on terror attacks that haven't been reported without Israel being on that list,” Mort Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America, said in an interview on Thursday. “It's painful and perplexing — especially on top of the Holocaust gaffe.”\nZOA is funded in a large part by Adelson, who has a close relationship with Trump and is reportedly dining at the White House with the president on Thursday. Klein last year defended former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon against charges of anti-Semitism. He is also supportive of Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman.\nSpicer loses his cool with the press By Nolan D. McCaskill and Matthew Nussbaum\nBut Klein said he wants answers from his friends in the White House. “Although it’s painful, what's important are the policies toward Israel,” Klein said. “It's not important in the scheme of things, but I would like someone to explain it to me because I don't get it. No country has had more terror attacks than Israel. Obviously many of them are not covered because it’s almost impossible to cover them all.”\nThe hastily prepared list — White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that it was assembled after Trump's comment on Monday — included well-covered attacks like the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, last year, which killed 49 people. It also excluded major massacres abroad, like the 145 civilians who were killed in Kobani, Syria, in 2015.\nKlein has taken pains to defend Trump in the past. But his criticism of the administration marks the second time in two weeks that he has broken ranks to voice concern about how the White House is talking about Israel and the Jewish people.\nAfter the Trump administration released a statement commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day that made no mention of Jews, Klein, the son of Holocaust survivors, said in a statement that he felt “chagrin and deep pain at President Trump” for “omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.”\nKellyanne Conway under fire for promoting Ivanka's brand By Nolan D. McCaskill , Louis Nelson and Isaac Arnsdorf\nSince then, the administration has doubled and tripled down on the statement. Spicer accused reporters who asked about the omission of \"nitpicking,\" and earlier this week, White House aide Sebastian Gorka said in a television interview that criticism of the statement was “asinine” and “absurd.”\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about Klein’s comments or why Israel was not included in the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:39:58.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
