The Falcons fell victim to a trend that saw the Warriors and Indians also give away championships. LeBron James, Tom Brady, Kris Bryant  57  57 p.m. ET \nComing back from 25 points behind in the Super Bowl just doesn’t happen. Never happens. It’s unfathomable, unimaginable. It’s as inconceivable as … coming back from down three games to one in the NBA Finals. \nOr coming back from being down 3-1 in the World Series. \nSomehow, in the last eight months, between June 2016 and February 2017, the championships in America’s three biggest pro sports were decided when teams dug out of near-unprecedented holes to achieve the impossible. \nWhat the Patriots did to the Falcons in Super Bowl 51 on Sunday night in Houston, as astonishing as it was, merely mimicked what the Cavaliers did to the defending-champion Warriors in the NBA Finals last June, and what the Cubs did to the Indians in the World Series in November. \nMORE: How Pats pulled off epic comeback \nAll saved the most dramatic for last, too. In subduing the Falcons 34-28 in overtime, the Patriots had tough acts to follow — Kyrie Irving’s three-pointer with 53 seconds left in Game 7, and the Cubs hanging on in the 10th inning in their Game 7 (their first title in 108 years, it’s worth mentioning again). \nTom Brady and the Patriots may have topped them. Like the Cubs, they had to go extra time to clinch it. But by the time they marched downfield with the overtime kickoff to James White’s winning touchdown, it all seemed like a foregone conclusion. \nThe dirty work had already been done by Brady, recovering and reversing himself from a nightmare of a first half, overcoming deficits of 21-0 in the first half and 28-3 in the third quarter, to tie the game at 28 in the final minute. \nThe Patriots shared this with the Cavaliers, too — shutting down the reigning Most Valuable Player along the way. Stephen Curry couldn’t complete the back-to-back NBA titles to go with the back-to-back MVPs, largely because the Cavs had a past battle-tested MVP of their own in LeBron James. \nBrady was LeBron to Matt Ryan, the Falcons’ Curry. (In the Cubs’ favor: they had the National League MVP on their side, Kris Bryant.) \nTo go a step further, for a rare moment Brady looked rattled and borderline out of his own usually-steady head at one point, after he threw the first pick-six of his playoff career, in the second quarter, to give the Falcons the 21-0 lead. \nWATCH: Gisele freaks out when Patriots win \nSimilarly, James had gotten into the bizarre exchange with the Warriors’ Draymond Green in Game 4 of the Finals, in which Green got suspended for a game for kicking in James’ direction … but which brought the fallibility of the superstar and his team in question. \nRyan won the MVP the night before the Super Bowl and was unstoppable in the first half, but he was on the wrong end of too many plays down the stretch — a fumble when the lead was 28-12, a sack when the Falcons were deep in Patriots territory in position to put the game away, a sputtering, failed drive at the end of regulation. \nIn the end, all Ryan had was a view from the sidelines when the Patriots never let him on the field in overtime. \nThe Patriots, then, now have the two biggest comebacks in Super Bowl history — they trailed Super Bowl 49 to the Seahawks 24-14 in the fourth quarter, but this second-half deficit to the Falcons blew that one away. \nThe Cavaliers were the first NBA team to come back from 3-1 in the Finals, something social media likely will never let the Warriors forget. The Cubs became just the sixth team to overcome the 3-1 World Series deficit. \nSo no, three such comebacks happening in essentially one major-league sports season has never happened. The odds would be astronomical, and would get steeper, of course, as each sport reached its championship round. \nApparently all bets were off, though, once Brady got involved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:09:45.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
