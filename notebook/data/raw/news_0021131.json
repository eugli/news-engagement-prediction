Article continues below Chelsea's XI on FIFA 10 vs FIFA 17: Ratings show there's only one winner \nThat’s because The Inquisitr is reporting that he’s planning a massive surprise for WrestleMania 33. \nAs expected, the news has led many fans to believe that we could be seeing a debut or even the return of a current, heavily-painted superstar. \nSadly, as much as fans would like to see it, Shinsuke Nakamura and Finn Balor reportedly aren’t the surprises Vince has planned, even if the latter can recover in time from his injury. \nInstead, Hulk Hogan could be returning on the night. WRESTLEMANIA SURPRISE \nWhen the topic was brought up by Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, even he suggested that the surprise Vince could be lining up is the return of Hulk Hogan, posting on Twitter that we should expect it sooner rather than later. \nA return has been rumoured for some months now, as WWE have slowly started to insert mentions of Hogan both verbally and in advertisements on the WWE Network. \nAlthough, not everyone will be happy as some haven't forgiven him for racist comments he made in a private conversation; the very reason he was released by the company in the first place. \nThe way things seem to be going, though, don’t expect a fully blown announcement beforehand, and if it is the surprise Vince is aiming for, you can be sure the Orlando crowd will erupt in cheers when his iconic music is played. \nWould you be pleased to see Hogan back in the WWE at WrestleMania?
