Nissan is definitely aware of that fact, having hitched its Rogue compact crossover's marketing wagon to the moneymaking movie to great effect . And so it comes as little surprise that Nissan's Chicago Auto Show experience is heavily Star Wars-themed, punctuated by the X-Wing-inspired Rogue you see in the image gallery above.\nIn addition to the droid-equipped Rogue-Wing, there's a massive inflatable Death Star hanging from the rafters; scale-replica models of the Y-Wing Starfighter, TIE Striker, AT-ACT and X-Wing Starfighter; and Stormtroopers. Yes, actual Stormtroopers, or at least actors dressed up like them. Nissan promises photo ops for showgoers in Chicago during the weekends of Feb. 11-12 and Feb. 18-19. No word on if they're all clones.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook & Twitter\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MSNAut", "http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/02/07/nissan-reveals-star-wars-rogue-one-partnership-boosted-search-its-rogue-suv-300", "https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos", "http://www.autoblog.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:42:23.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
