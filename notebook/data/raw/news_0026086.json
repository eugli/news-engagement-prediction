His studies include coursework at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. \nOn Taco Brat's website, Curran said he has strong roots in the city. \n\"Opening Taco Brat in my own neighborhood — just four blocks from my first apartment out of high school and a beach cruiser ride from my home — is my most gratifying venture,\" he said. \"With my passion for hand-cranked sausages and handmade tacos, I'm thrilled to bring Taco Brat to this exciting, eclectic and vibrant community.\" \n* \nNewport Beach Coco's being replaced by Italian restaurant \nThe Coco's restaurant at 900 Bristol St. North in Newport Beach has closed and is being replaced by Il Barone, an Italian restaurant that currently is located nearby at 4251 Martingale Way. \nIl Barone is a popular \"power lunch\" spot for area executives, according to the Orange County Register . \nThe owner of the Coco's building approached Il Barone's owners, Franco and Donatella Barone, who were looking for a new space. \nThe Barones are beginning renovations this month on the 5,000-square-foot building, which is nearly double the size of their current restaurant, slated to close in May, the Register reported. \n* \nNew bank comes to Costa Mesa \nBlue Gate Bank, an independent bank aimed at businesses and customers with high net worth, has opened at 611 Anton Blvd. in Costa Mesa. \nIt is the first new bank to open in Orange County since 2009, the company said, and only the eighth new bank to get regulators' approval in the United States since 2008. \nIt offers checking, business and real estate loans and certificates of deposit. \nBlue Gate has 12 employees in Orange County. \n* \nBruster's ice cream shop opens in Huntington Beach \nBruster's Real Ice Cream has opened a location in Huntington Beach, its third in California as it embarks on a campaign to add locations in the West and Southwest. \n\"The markets we are targeting are growing and have high population densities, as well as high household incomes, making them perfect for our concept,\" Jim Sahene, chief executive of the Pennsylvania-based chain, said in a statement. \"Unlike in the North and Midwest, people in the West and Southwest go out for ice cream all year long.\" \nThe Huntington Beach shop at 7451 Warner Ave. is operated by franchisee Larry Johnson, who also owns Bruster's locations in Cypress and Cerritos. \n* \nAllen Tire Co. opens in Fountain Valley \nThe site of a closed Pep Boys in Fountain Valley has become an Allen Tire Co. location. \nThe store is at 10960 Talbert Ave. \nPep Boys said its store closed because it was too close to other locations in Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach, so the company decided not to renew its lease . \n* \nNewport coffee shop to hold tasting of 4 brews \nKean Coffee in Newport Beach will host a tasting at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 23 of four coffees harvested from farms certified by the Rainforest Alliance, an organization that works with coffee farmers to improve their communities. \nFarms that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance meet specific environmental and economic criteria. \nThe guided tasting will include a discussion with a coffee roaster. \nParticipants will receive a 25% discount on one 12-ounce bag of coffee from the four tastings.
