Consumers are still excited about the thought of an Apple Car, but Apple will probably use its cash for investments in content and other “services.” By Feb. 10, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Medium Large Apple is sitting on a large pile of cash, but don't expect the company to make a groundbreaking move with it. Illustration: Getty Images \nApple has $246 billion in cash sitting around, and investors have lots of ideas about how the company should spend it. Most of them, for now, seem unlikely. \nA Baird survey of U.S. consumers found that 22% would most like Apple to develop a car within the next five years. This was the top response, followed by a preference for an Apple streaming service that’s like Netflix . \nInvestors have also speculated about the possibility that Apple would use its cash stash to make a big acquisition. Netflix, Tesla , and Disney are discussed from time to time, but Baird analyst William Power says these are unlikely. \nUnfortunately for Apple dreamers, the company will probably opt to invest money in less flashy areas, like its “Services” business . This includes the App store and Apple Music, but could come to include video content , too. \n“Though acquisitions might help here, we believe investing organically in content , innovative features, and new services should continue to improve the company’s long-term positioning,” Power wrote in a research note Friday. \nInvestors tend to like when companies branch into services more, because that puts less pressure on annual hardware sales . And that’s key for Apple now that customers are upgrading their iPhones less often or increasingly opting for cheaper, older models when they get a new phone. \nAnother investor-friendly use for the cash that Apple may choose: buying back more stock. Power notes that 94% of Apple’s cash is overseas, so a policy that makes it cheaper for companies to bring that money stateside “could result in a large increase in share buybacks.” A buyback increases earnings per share, since it means that there are fewer shares outstanding. \nBig Picture : Apple has $246 billion in cash on its balance sheet, but don’t expect the company to make a huge move with it.
