Co-presenter Faye Dunaway glanced at the card and announced the winner as \"La La Land.\" A flurry of confusion unfolded onstage as the cast and crew of \"La La Land\" -- in the middle of their acceptance speeches -- realized the real winner was \"Moonlight.\" Twitter users posted their interpretation of what happened. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/p0Lb5DbzG0 \n— Nathan Ourn™🔱🇰🇭 (@Nxthann_) February 27, 2017 Hey \"La La Land\" remember when you gave us that fake happy ending and then took it away\n\nHow's it feel\n— Daniel \"Kibblesmith\" (@kibblesmith) February 27, 2017 \"We rob #Oscars \" pic.twitter.com/7G5Yx53u9Z \n— Will McKinley (@willmckinley) February 27, 2017 \"This is very unfortunate what happened,\" host Jimmy Kimmel quipped. \"Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this.\" Read More He was referring to the famous incident in which host Steve Harvey announced the wrong Miss Universe winner in 2015.
