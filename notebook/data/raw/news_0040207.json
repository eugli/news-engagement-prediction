I thought I was crazy. I thought I was giving everyone around me, especially this person, a load of grief because I couldn’t control myself. \nOnce I left home and lived on my own for a while, before going away to University, I realised this insecurity and lack of self-worth didn’t stem from me actually being crazy – I was just fine. \nI’d been gaslighted. \nWhat is this disturbing trend that’s starting to be discussed more and more? It was a buzzword of 2016, and it’s still taking off now – because many can recognise the signs in their own relationships, whether that’s a parent, colleague or friend. \nHere’s what you need to look out for if you suspect you’re a victim of gaslighting. You feel like you’re going crazy (Picture: Getty) \nA gaslighter will constantly make you doubt your sanity. They will twist your words and actions so it looks like you’re unreasonable, or displaying irrational behaviour. \nIf you often feel confused, and think you’re losing your mind, this is another sign you’re being gaslighted. You don’t have faith in yourself \nIf you’ve started believing the gaslighter’s version of reality, and doubting yourself, this shows you’ve allowed them to grind down your judgement and feed you what they want you to believe. \nYou may find the gaslighter raising their eyebrows when you say things. Spinning stories in such a way that you hesitate, and wonder if your own version is really true. \nThese are all tell-tale signs. You believe you’re over-emotional, or too sensitive (Picture: Getty) \nIf the gaslighter wants to make you feel your emotional responses aren’t valid, they will accuse you of acting overly emotional or being too sensitive. \nOnce the victim has repeatedly been told this, they will often end up believing it’s the truth. You’re always apologising \nEver felt like you’re walking on eggshells? Like you’re constantly doing something wrong? Do you end up saying you’re sorry all the time, because you’re screwing up so much? You could be getting gaslighted into feeling this way. Arguments go round…and round…and round (Picture: Getty) \nWhen you fight with this person, they will end up saying things that make your head spin. \nTheir way of distorting reality will become so constant that you’ll believe them when they say it’s all your fault. You feel hopeless and depressed \nYou were once happy and secure in the relationship you had with this person – but now you just feel sad and empty. \nIf your sadness is combined with the other gaslighting red flags, it may be time to consider that this tactic is being used.
