Below, you'll find our February 2017 recommendations. For more comprehensive coverage of the best titles available on Netflix and elsewhere, check out Vulture’s What to Stream Now hub , which is updated throughout the month. \nThe Act of Acting: Clouds of Sils Maria \nLet us no longer entertain the embarrassingly outdated notion that Kristen Stewart is a bad actress. In advance of her new partnership with filmmaker Olivier Assayas, Personal Shopper , entering U.S. theaters on March 10, watch their first pairing in this exquisite 2014 drama about an aging actress (the wonderful Juliette Binoche) preparing to restage the play that once made her famous, with Stewart, finely nuanced and heartbreaking, playing her loyal assistant. As they vacation through the Swiss mountainscape of the title, these two performers are locked in a ballet out of step with the changing modern world, until they are forced to acknowledge that fame, beauty, and life are fragile, fleeting things. Available February 12. \nThe Great Beyond: Sausage Party \nIf you ever chuckle while sliding a hot dog into a bun during a BBQ, this utterly filthy animated movie from producers and co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg is for you. Getting away with far deeper levels of crudity ( crudité? ) than they would ever manage in their live-action efforts, Rogen and Goldberg serve up gag-a-minute food puns and a strangely earnest dissection of organized religion in their Pixar-spoofing cartoon about supermarket items who have yet to discover what humans do with them once they’re plucked off the shelf. Hold the salt; Sausage Party has enough bath salts as it is. Available February 23. \nSimple Biology: Girls Lost \nWhile we were waiting for Hollywood to tell a decent story about gender identity, Sweden went ahead and laid down the marker themselves. Girls Lost is a trippy, touching sci-fi fable about three preteen girls who discover a flower that switches their biological sex overnight — and realize, once out in the world, that some of them might prefer life as a boy. The nature-inspired imagery is luscious, the performances (each lead is played by two actors, one of each gender) are a marvel, and for as high-concept as this logline might be, the confused emotions of adolescence on display are genuine and heartbreaking. Available February 6. \nNoteworthy selections in bold.  \nTELEVISION\nFebruary 1 \nLes Beaux Malaises : Seasons 1–4 \nMasha's Spooky Stories : Season 1 \nThe Furchester Hotel : Season 1–2\nFebruary 2 \nAmerican Crime Story: The People v.
