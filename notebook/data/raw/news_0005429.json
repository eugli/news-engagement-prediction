ROSS GIBLIN / FAIRFAX NZ \nFeed the seagulls, but don't swim at Lyall Bay this weekend due to a (heavily-diluted) code brown situation, the council warns. \n\"We're not going to be physically stopping people getting into the water but the advice is, stay out.\" \nThe overflow of heavily-diluted wastewater lasted less than five minutes but swimmers and surfers should avoid the water in the area until Sunday, the council said. Warning signs have been posted at Lyall Bay. \nPeople were also advised not to swim in Wellington Harbour until Sunday as pollution levels in the harbour will be higher due to contaminants washed down drains by the heavy rain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:05:20.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
