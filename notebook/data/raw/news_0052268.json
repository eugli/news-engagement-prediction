Duffy, co-organizer of the festival and director of Yale Bands. “Students and community members will have the chance to work with and hear the women and men who are defining the sound of contemporary jazz.” \nMarsalis is the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. He is the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Music and nine Grammy Awards in both jazz and classical music. \nThe Maria Schneider Orchestra has received five Grammy Awards in both the jazz and classical music categories, and Schneider has received commissions from groups as varied as Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. \nWoodwind virtuoso Anat Cohen is critics’ perennial pick of “Clarinetist of the Year.” \n“Jazz: A Celebration of America’s Sound” is the third in a series of events intended to demonstrate the potent mix of programming that is expected to fill the Schwarzman Center when it re-opens in 2020 after an extensive renovation. The first two events were “Food Conversations,” a dining and discussion event featuring four world-renowned chefs, and “Blackstar Rising & The Purple Reign,” a four-day event celebrating the legacies of David Bowie and Prince.
