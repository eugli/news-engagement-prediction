Here's a look at our favorites. \nIt used to be that watching something get destroyed required news crews, PBS documentaries, or well-placed cameras far from a building collapse . Then we entered a new world where everyone had a camera in their pocket, and was at the ready to snap a \"Fail\" video. Because nothing beats watching a guy on a skateboard slide down a railing and land so improperly and painfully that he'll be unable to have children. \nThose are all well and good, but what about annihilation for science? Obliteration for LEARNING? \nYouTube has that in spades. There are a number of channels making it their business to bust up everyday items, as well as things you'd never even consider (like non-Newtonian fluids ). Using heat, pressure, blades, projectiles, elastics, and more, amateur scientists and a few pros have made it their business to show the world what happens to things at that thing's end. Think of it as Mythbusters without a budget. The best of them have been making videos long enough to have production values worthy of their own cable show. But even the lamest, with zero equipment and experience at making video, share something with all the rest: enthusiasm for learning how and why things get wrecked. \nSometimes, however, it's not about learning. Sometimes it's just fun to see things get demolished. The element of occasional danger to the video-making science-person involved doesn't hurt the dramatic effect, either. So whether you want to learn or just giggle uncontrollably at destructive antics, read on.
