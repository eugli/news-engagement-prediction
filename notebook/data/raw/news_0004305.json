Schwarzenegger clapped back, politely telling the then-president-elect to get back to work.\nTrump renewed the feud during Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast , asking those gathered to appeal to their chosen deity on behalf of his replacement and the reality competition show.\nUSA TODAY\nSchwarzenegger tells Trump to get back to work after 'Apprentice' tweet\n\"We had tremendous success on The Apprentice and when I ran for president, I had to leave the show,\" he told the audience. \"That's when I knew for sure that I was doing it. They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It's been a total disaster. And (executive producer) Mark (Burnett) will never, ever bet against Trump again. So I want to just pray for Arnold if we can.\"\nAnd just like in the first round, Schwarzenegger had a sharp rejoinder.\n\"Hey, Donald, I have a great idea,\" the former California governor suggested in a video posted to Twitter. \"Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert at ratings, and I take over your job and people can finally sleep comfortably again?\"\nThe National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE\nâ€” Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307913417001_5307893481001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307914207001_5307893481001.mp4", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1dbd3f622cee0a71b1fb91244f8aa323c1691f2f/c=0-0-2800-2800/local/-/media/2017/01/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636192928568315926-apprentice-1x1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307913417001_5307893481001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/people/2017/02/02/trump-asks-prayers-schwarzenegger-", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2k439Ae&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/827169996866347008", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/123f95c65a1f3f62cc66057271d1da59d472df97/c=22-111-2784-2187&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216285448653787-trump-schwarzenegger-1x1.jpg", "https://t.co/KYUqEZbJIE", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307913416001_5307893481001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216285448653787-trump-schwarzenegger-1x1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307913417001_5307893481001-vs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2k439Ae&text=Schwarzenegger%20makes%20counter-offer%20after%20Trump%27s%20National%20Prayer%20Breakfast%20joke&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2253.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/01/06/trump-rips-arnold-schwarzeneggers-apprentice-ratings/96237162/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216285448653787-trump-schwarzenegger-1x1.jpg", "http://usat.ly/2k3Sy8v", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3126/29906170001_5307913416001_5307893481001-th.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:48:27.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
