She has not had a seizure in about two years, her dad Jody Tipton told ABC News. \n\"But, she take 10 pills a day to control the seizures,\" he said. \"We've heard stories of people growing out of them, so we are hoping that she'll grow out of them, but that's a wait-and-see thing.\" \n\"She's taking drama this year,\" Tipton added of Skylar's interests. \"The sports we kind of worry about. She's gotten too hot before and it's triggered a seizure. [She has] all A's now and a 94 [grade] in World History. She's an A-student.\" \nSkylar's mom, Rachel Tipton, follows the Facebook page of the Epilepsy Foundation of Georgia (EFGA). Rachel discovered the organization was giving away Super Bowl tickets to a person who had epilepsy or a seizure disorder. \nThe teen took an interest, but because she's a minor, her dad was required to enter the contest on her behalf. \n\nOn behalf of my daughter Skylar, she would love to tell her story to raise awareness, see TX, & SBLI w/her dad. @EpilepsyGA #GoFalcons pic.twitter.com/oSKXKKhQc4 \nâ€” Jody Tipton (@icecreamman16) January 13, 2017 \nSkylar qualified for the second round--a social media contest--where EFGA posted the stories of five finalists on Facebook and Instagram.

EFGA is excited for this experience for Skylar and her father, we know it is something they will never forget. We would also like to thank all the finalists in the contest for their amazing efforts to increase awareness.\" \nAfter the Super Bowl, Skylar, a freshman at Flowery Branch High, hopes her school will plan a \"purple day\" to bring attention to epilepsy.\n  \" \nTeen With Epilepsy Wins Super Bowl Tickets After Sharing Story on Social Media   \" \nIran 'on Notice' Says White House National Security Adviser \" \nSenate Confirms Rex Tillerson as Sec'y of State High Drama on Capitol Hill in Trump Nominee Hearings \" \nTrump's Pick to Head VA Rejects Radical Change to Fix Agency \" \nWife of Pulse Nightclub Gunman to Remain in Custody \" \nBlood-Spattered Quebec Mosque Opens Doors After Shooting \" \nTrump Nominates Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court \" \nFree TSA PreCheck Is Coming to an End \" \nChicago Police Now Using High-Tech Effort to Fight Crime \" \nRoger Goodell 'Comfortable' With 'Deflategate' Outcome Before Super Bowl LI \" \nHow Tom Brady Stays Super Bowl Ready \" \nBeyonce Expecting Twins With Jay Z \" \nBeyonce's Thoughts on Motherhood Since Welcoming Blue Ivy \" \nGrammys Executive Producer Responds to Boycott Rumors \" \nGroup Calls for Cease-Fire Amid Upsurge in Ukraine Fighting \" \nHow a Supreme Court Nominee Gets Confirmed \" \nFormer Giants Kicker Josh Brown Speaks Out After Abuse Allegations \" \nBethenny Frankel's Ex Arrested for Allegedly Stalking Her \" \nLong Layover?
