When she took the stage to accept her award, Adele had to take a moment to acknowledge the night’s rightful winner. “I’m very humbled and very grateful and gracious, but the artist of my life is Beyoncé. The Lemonade album, for me, is so monumental.” Adele swept the night, winning in every category she was nominated for against Bey: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance (plus Best Pop Vocal Album, a category Bey wasn’t nominated in). But Lemonade was a gift for her as a woman and mother, and she noted its particular importance to black women. “You are our light,” she said. “The way you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering. You make them stand up for themselves. I love you. I always have and I always will.”\nTags: top story adele beyonce music grammys 2017 Adele Used Her Grammy Acceptance Speech To Thank Beyoncé Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Adele Used Her Grammy Acceptance Speeches To Praise Beyoncé and Lemonade Here Are Your 2017 Grammy Winners Frank Ocean Fires Back at the ‘Faulty’ Grammys for Their ‘Cultural Bias’ Most Viewed Stories Jake Tapper Has a One-Word Response to SNL’s Unhinged Fatal Attraction Sketch Everyone Performing at the 2017 Grammys Rosie O’Donnell Won’t Be Playing Steve Bannon on SNL The Meanest Lines From the Fifty Shades Darker Reviews What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Kellyanne Conway Isn’t Going to Be Ignored in Her Very Own Fatal Attraction Parody Piers Morgan Told to ‘F*ck Off’ for Dismissing Trump Fears As ‘Hysteria’ on Real Time With Bill Maher Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer Returns to SNL in the Hope of Becoming Calm Here Are Your 2017 Grammy Winners Saturday Night Live Recap: Alec Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy Keep It Spicey Most Popular Video On Vulture The Best Bloopers From Friends Latest News from Vulture 14 mins ago Adele Used Her Grammy Acceptance Speeches To Praise Beyoncé and Lemonade “You are our light.”\n16 mins ago Adele Had Another Awkward Flub at the Grammys But she rallied.\n29 mins ago Carpool Karaoke Series Trailer: Will Smith, Ariana Grande, and More Sing & Drive The web series based on James Corden’s segment is coming to Apple Music.\n12:07 a.m. Watch Bruno Mars and The Time Pay Exuberant Tribute to Prince at the Grammys Make Bruno Mars wear eyeliner more often.\nYesterday at 11:51 p.m. Chance the Rapper’s Grammy Wins Were a Breakthrough, But He Was No Underdog Those connections to Kanye and Apple go a long way.\nYesterday at 11:48 p.m. A Tribe Called Quest Resist ‘President Agent Orange’ in Grammys Performance Joined by Anderson .Paak, Tribe resisted Trump’s Muslim ban.\nYesterday at 11:40 p.m. Here Are Your 2017 Grammy Winners Who’s collecting golden gramophones?\nYesterday at 11:33 p.m. Watch Adele Sing ‘Fastlove’ for the Grammys’ George Michael Tribute Adele restarted the song, saying, “I’m sorry, I can’t mess this up for him.”\nYesterday at 11:23 p.m. ’80s Queen Carly Rae Jepsen Did a Mighty Colorful ‘It Takes Two’ Remake It probably took more than one take.\nYesterday at 11:20 p.m. Dear White People ’s Justin Simien Explains the Title Controversy surrounding the name reemerged with the upcoming Netflix series.\nYesterday at 11:18 p.m. A GIF Bible of Beyoncé’s Most Glorious Grammy Moments You’ll never need another GIF.\nYesterday at 11:04 p.m. WATCH: For the First Time, the Grammys Recognized David Bowie for His Music It was the first time he was recognized by the Grammys for his music.\nYesterday at 10:45 p.m. Girls Season Premiere Recap: She’s So High Is Hannah Horvath finally growing up?\nYesterday at 10:41 p.m. Beyoncé Gives Moving Grammy Acceptance Speech “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty.”\nYesterday at 10:30 p.m. Why Girls Is So Good When It Leaves New York City Outside, everything is clearer, simpler, more candid.\nYesterday at 10:28 p.m. Katy Perry Pays Homage to Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren at 2017 Grammys She wore an armband that said, simply, “Persist.”\nYesterday at 10:13 p.m. The Walking Dead Recap: Turn That Frown Upside Down “Rock in the Road” has one of the show’s greatest zombie slaughter scenes.\nYesterday at 10:05 p.m. 2017 NAACP Image Awards: Beyoncé, Moonlight , and Black-ish Win Big Read the full 2017 NAACP Image Award winner list.\nYesterday at 10:03 p.m. Watch Beyoncé Perform of ‘Love Drought’ and ‘Sandcastles’ at the Grammys She performed “Love Drought” and “Sandcastles.”\nYesterday at 10:00 p.m. Victoria Recap: A Man of Principle Teamwork makes the dream work, Victoria!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:08:26.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
