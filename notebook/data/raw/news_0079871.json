We have been there. The military operation has been going on for some time already but we have failed. That has to be admitted,\" Duterte told reporters. \nPhilippines army steps up offensive against rebels \n\"But it's a matter of policy that we do not surrender to the demands of paying ransom. It will just increase the numbers,\" he said, referring to the size of the group. \"If you give in and pay, there will be more victims and no end in sight.\" \nAbu Sayyaf has been kidnapping foreigners and locals for decades and holding them for ransom on its remote island strongholds in the southern Philippines. \nKantner's vessel, the Rockall, was found drifting last November off the southern Philippines with the body of his female companion, Sabine Merz, who had been shot. \nMilitary officials on Tuesday said they were still searching for his body and vowed to \"relentlessly pursue\" the assailants and rescue more than 20 other hostages.\nInside Abu Sayyaf: Blood, drugs and conspiracies \nAbu Sayyaf has earned many millions of dollars in ransom payments, and rarely releases a hostage unless money is paid. Relatives and employers of hostages typically pay, rather than governments.\nTwo Canadian men were beheaded by the group last year and a Norwegian man was released . \nDuterte also repeated his request for China to help patrol regional waters to stop more kidnappings, saying Beijing had not given him a response.\nDuterte specified he would like China to patrol the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes between the Malaysian peninsula and Indonesia's Sumatra island.\nAbu Sayyaf emerged in the early 1990s as an offshoot of a separatist rebellion by minority Moro Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south.\nBreakaway Philippine rebels align with ISIL \nSource: News agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:00:38.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
