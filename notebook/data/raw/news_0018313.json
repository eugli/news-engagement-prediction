Police eventually determined that the carcasses were martens, a small animal whose pelts are coveted by fur trappers. \n“My guess is that the fur is going to be used for something but they had no use for the body so they just threw it in the ocean,” Gerry Whittle of Prince Rupert SPCA said of the grisly discovery. \n“It was right at the boat launch at the low-tide mark. It is concerning, especially for the public stumbling across this, because a lot of people visit the Rushbrook Floats.” \nAnyone with information about the incident is asked to call Prince Rupert RCMP at 250-627-0700 or, if they wish to remain anonymous, Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
