(Photo: Provide to IndyStar) 205 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWEST LAFAYETTE – He milked cows. That’s where those hands come from, those claws that grab and don’t let go. Spend hours each day like he did as a boy, under a cow’s udder on a farm in Washington Township. See how strong your hands become. \nHe used those hands to set one of the oldest marks in the Purdue record book. The record is nearly 66 years old, and Carl McNulty was as surprised as anybody to find out the record was his. \nNobody at Purdue told him the night of Feb. 19, 1951, when McNulty grabbed 27 rebounds in the Boilermakers’ 81-78 victory against Minnesota. Nobody told him the next day. He doesn’t have any idea how or when he learned he held Purdue’s single-game rebounding record – maybe one of his boys told him? – but McNulty believes he knows who will finally break it: \nCaleb “Biggie” Swanigan, the 6-9, 250-pound Purdue sophomore who has four games with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds this season, and ranks second in the country at 12.9 boards per game. \n“He goes after every rebound like it belongs to him,” McNulty, 86, was saying this week from his winter home in Naples, Fla. “This is the first year I thought someone would get it, and he’s really going after it.” \nMcNulty has never met Swanigan, but he tells me, “He looks like a nice kid.” \nOh, he is. In fact, I tell Carl McNulty, I’m about to talk with Swanigan. Anything you want me to pass along? \n“Tell him I said hello,” McNulty says, then starts to laugh. “The big hog.” \nMinutes later the message is delivered, and then I ask Biggie Swanigan what he knows about the school's single-game record for rebounds. \n“Nothing,” Swanigan says. “Educate me.” \nIt’s 27. Set in 1951. Held by Carl McNulty. \n“Didn’t know that,” Swanigan says. “And I don’t know anything about him,” Swanigan says. \nWell, that’s where I come in. \nFormer Purdue basketball player Carl McNulty.

Nothing left but ashes, and McNulty sifted through them until he found the basketball goal from his childhood, a perfect circle no more. \n“It melted into this oblong shape,” McNulty says. “I took it home, put it in my garage.” \nBack in the day, his old man hammered the rim onto the side of the barn and told his son: Have at it. Carl McNulty had at it all right, shooting and then tipping the rebound toward the basket, over and over until it went in. \n“I’d spend hours out there tipping, all by myself,” he says. “Always tipping, for what reason I don’t know.” \nFunny how it works, right? McNulty went on to play basketball at Washington Township High, a school that doesn’t exist anymore – it’s now part of Cass High – and in 1948 was so small that the Logansport Pharos Tribune printed every picture of McNulty’s graduating class: 18 smiling faces. \nIf it weren’t for basketball, if it weren’t for that rim on the side of the barn, Carl McNulty never would have gone to college. Eighth grade was as far as his dad went, and he turned out just fine. Carl figured he’d work the farm, but Purdue coach Mel Taube heard about the big kid from the small school in Cass County and offered a scholarship. The first time McNulty saw campus was the day his parents dropped him off at Lambert Fieldhouse, carrying two grocery bags full of clothes. \nAt Purdue he washed dishes to supplement his scholarship – semester tuition was $55, exactly how much McNulty received in scholarship – and became an All-Big Ten forward who had one of the most astounding games in school history in 1951 at Minnesota: 34 points (a school record at the time) and those 27 rebounds. \nHow do you suppose this 6-3 forward nabbed more rebounds in one game than Terry Dischinger, Dave Schellhase, Joe Barry Carroll or any of the Purdue greats who came after him? \n“Tipping!” McNulty is roaring. “A lot of my rebounds that day were offensive rebounds. Not sure I ever brought the ball down.” \n* * * \nIt’s true, you know, what Carl McNulty said about Biggie Swanigan: \nGoes after every rebound like it belongs to him. \nLook, Swanigan didn’t get 22 rebounds against Minnesota on Jan. 1 – he doesn’t get any of his rebounds – by waiting for them to bounce his way. He pursues them, crashing into teammates, telling them to get out of there. \n“Dakota seems like he’s always in the way,” Biggie is saying of 6-4 junior guard Dakota Mathias. “I tell him to get out of the way. Just move . You run on the break – I’m going to get the ball.” \nDidn’t happen Wednesday night against Northwestern, when Swanigan careened into Mathias for a defensive rebound and got a wry look on his face as Mathias came away with it. Swanigan averaged 8.3 boards as a freshman but has hit another level as a sophomore, beginning in the season opener against McNeese State when he had nine rebounds by halftime and then 15, then 20, and now the phone is ringing in Carl McNulty’s condo in Naples. It’s one of his four kids, Stan, calling from Kokomo. \n“Dad,” Stan is telling him, “it’s all over. Swanigan’s gonna get your record.” \nPurdue led 92-52 with nearly seven minutes left when coach Matt Painter emptied his bench. Swanigan came out with those 20 rebounds. \n“I felt like sending him (Painter) a thank-you card,” McNulty says. \nHe’s laughing again, but I’m not sure McNulty is kidding. He’s a competitive sonofagun who coached 32 years at five Indiana high schools (Rochester, Elwood, LaPorte, Warren Central and Kokomo) and won 13 sectional titles in 18 years at Kokomo and hobbles around the par-3 golf course outside his condo these days on two bad knees. McNulty plays weekly with one of his best players at Kokomo, Charlie Hall, for 10 cents a hole. Hall went on to become girls basketball coach at Kokomo and now is the game director for the Indiana All-Stars. \n“Carl was a world-class softball pitcher,” Hall is telling me. \nHall is in his car in Naples, driving to the dog track to meet McNulty for some low-stakes gambling, but I’m trying to make sure I heard him correctly. \nWorld - class softball pitcher? \n“Oh yeah,” Hall says. “Carl’s in the Indiana softball hall of fame . I don’t have any idea how many no-hitters he threw, but it was a lot. You know about his hands, right? He just whipped that ball. Yeah, he gets his hands on you, you’re in a death grip.” \n* * * \nHe played in the NBA for free. Weird story, that one. \nCarl McNulty was 24, two years removed from Purdue – he spent those years with the U.S. Navy – and had just been hired to coach at Rochester. The Minneapolis Lakers had drafted him in the 11th round in 1952, the 96th overall pick in a 97-player draft, and traded his rights to the Milwaukee Hawks. \nMiddle of the 1954-55 season, the Hawks invited McNulty to come play. When his season at Rochester ended, he joined the team in New York for a game against the Knicks but didn’t get in. They took a train to Milwaukee for a home game, and McNulty played 14 minutes. Took six shots. Scored two points. \nAnd retired. \nThe game isn’t the story behind that – the train ride is. \n“I remember the coach (Red Holzman) walking down the gang plank to the train, and he had a six-pack under his arm,” McNulty says. “The guys (on the team) stayed up and played poker, and I think some of those things scared me a little bit. I had a young son, and I just didn’t think it was the right fit.” \nNBA money in 1955 wasn’t what it is now, of course, but for McNulty the money wasn’t anything . \n“I never got paid!” he says. “I never the asked the (Hawks) what I’d be making, and they never mentioned it.” \nHe’ll get an occasional letter from the NBA, but McNulty has a more lasting connection to his playing career than junk mail. He still has that Purdue record from 1951. The rebounds, all 27 of them. He’d love to keep that record, but like a boxer who softens an approaching haymaker by rolling with the punch, McNulty is preparing himself for Swanigan to knock it out. \n“Swanigan’s going to get it, Gregg,” McNulty tells me. “You know that.\" \nWell, let’s see if he even wants your silly record, Carl. What do you say, Biggie? You looking to replace Carl McNulty in the record book? \n“What I want,” Swanigan tells me, “is to go to the Final Four.” \nVery nice. Any individual records you’d like? \n“There is one thing I’ve always wanted to do,” Swanigan says. “I didn’t do it in high school or AAU, but I’ve always wanted a 30-30 game.” \nThirty points and thirty rebounds in one game? Those 20-20’s weren’t enough? It’s true, you know, what Carl McNulty said about Biggie Swanigan: \nThe big hog.
