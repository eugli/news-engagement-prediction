Martinelli | February 10, 2017 10:23 am Follow @MMartinelli4 \nSadly, the days of watching Prince Fielder knock home runs out of the park are long gone , but early in his retirement, he’s embarking on something he’s always wanted to do: a food show. \nAfter an unexpected departure from baseball last season following his second spinal-fusion surgery, the 32-year-old slugger announced his retirement. But he recently told ESPN.com that while he’s “living a normal life,” he had always thought a food show “might be a cool thing to do.” \nAnd in an early retirement, he’s going for it, co-hosting with his wife, Chanel. \nVia ESPN.com : \nI have a food show that’s going to be streaming on Netflix and Hulu. It’s coming out around the beginning of spring training in March, I believe. It’s not just baseball people. It’s a mixture of baseball people, actors, musicians, chefs and whatnot. They bring out different dishes, and at the end of the show, I give the one I like the most the “Fielder’s choice.” It’s good TV.” \nSome of the guest stars Fielder said will be on his show include New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia, actor Chazz Palminteri, singer Jose Feliciano and rapper Xzibit.
