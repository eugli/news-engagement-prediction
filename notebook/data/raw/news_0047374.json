Many are believed to be officers deployed ahead of the protest.\nIt is unclear if the blast was linked to the protests, which began after the city reinstated bullfighting this year.\nGareth Lewis, a British traveller staying in a hostel in La Macarena, on the corner where the explosion took place, told the BBC: \"I was sitting in my room in the hostel, the windows just came in, there was glass everywhere.\n\"Quite a few police have been hurt, they're now sweeping up. They used tear gas and there's quite a bit of blood.\"\nIt happened as police prepared for protests in the city Mr Lewis, who has been advised to stay inside the hostel by officers, said he had witnessed protests \"all week\" and that \"armed police have been everywhere\".\nThe protests began after a decision by the constitutional court, which ruled bullfighting was part of the country's heritage and therefore could be reinstated.\nThe move angered animal rights activists, who have clashed with police during protests against the reopening.\nIn January, demonstrators were arrested and officers fired tear gas to control groups physically attacking spectators.\nTwo people were left with serious injuries after the explosion, which shattered nearby windows But the explosion was not necessarily linked to the protests.\nJorge Restrepo, director of Colombia's Conflict Analysis Resource Center (Cerac), said the attack may have been targeting the police, taking advantage of the fact that many officers were gathered together due to the bullfight.\nHe told the BBC it was possibly linked to a series of attacks against security forces in the capital that have taken place in recent months.\nBogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa vowed to capture the people behind the explosion Meanwhile, Bogota mayor Enrique Penalosa, who attended the scene, has announced he was convening a security council meeting for Sunday afternoon.\n\"The terrorists won't intimidate us,\" Mr Penalosa said on Twitter. \"We are going to do all that's necessary to capture them.\"\nHe earlier tweeted one police officer had been killed, but has since removed the post. It has now been reported there were no fatalities.\nTwo of the injured were said to be in a serious condition.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1470B/production/_94732738_2a389bf4-a118-4de5-a629-908f1c8dcafc.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D253/production/_94734835_1d15b920-e0e1-4331-92ae-8c8cab72f7b4.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12073/production/_94734837_df1e9720-3fd0-46bf-8c5d-d502d1756b02.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:33:17.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
