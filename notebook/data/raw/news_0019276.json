Wow. I didn’t think CNN let you use the f-word on the air.” \nHer further delight over CNN coverage included Tuesday night’s debate of Obamacare that featured former presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz, or, as she called them, “the socialist and the Slytherin.” \n“This event that we expected to be a pointless train wreck actually ended up being a semi-thoughtful debate on the merits and flaws of America’s healthcare system,” she admitted. “I can honestly say, I’d give my left tit to have either one of you wonderful mansplaining pricks in the White House right now.” \nShe concluded, “We were watching CNN… and not just in an airport with the sound off. We saw you serve the public interest for almost half a day.” \nWatch the video below. \nFull Frontal airs Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET on TBS.
