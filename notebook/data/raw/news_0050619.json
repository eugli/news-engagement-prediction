The 14-year-old is battling a chronic liver disease called biliary atresia. As Robertson continues to inspire, he's also brought the jokes to the NBA All-Star festivities. \nDeAndre Jordan learned that the hard way on Saturday. \nRobertson asked Jordan to sign his WWE belt, and as Jordan was signing the belt, he complimented Robertson on his jumper during the celebrity game. Then, Robertson hit Jordan back in the most shocking way. â€” LA Clippers (@LAClippers) February 19, 2017 \n\"I shoot better than you,\" he said. \nOh man. Oh man. \nJordan was speechless. He couldn't come back from that. \nJarrius is the best.
