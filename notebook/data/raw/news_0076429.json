An awkward pause ensued as the La La Land team began shuffling off stage and presenter Warren Beaty stepped up to the mic to explain why he had read out the wrong winner: \n\"I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land. That's why I took such a long look at Faye [Dunaway, his co-presenter] and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny. This is Moonlight - the Best Picture.\" \nWarren Beatty apologises for reading out the wrong winner \nStone had won the previous award for Best Actress and it appeared that the citation cards had been mixed up. \nThe Moonlight cast and crew then gathered on stage to accept their unexpected prize with Barry Jenkins praising the baffled La La Land team in his speech: \"That was so gracious and so generous of them\". \nIn the ceremony's closing moments, host Jimmy Kimmel then took to the mic and said: \"I don't know what happened â€“ i blame myself for this. Let's just remember, it's just an awards show. \n\"I knew I would screw this show up, I really did,\" he added, jokingly. \"I promise I'll never come back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:09:08.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
