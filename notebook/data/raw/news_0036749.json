Sleep-deprived brain can’t form memories \nIt implies that the cold airflow may have a greater impact on the overall sleep of the participants with lower physical strength or a greater sensitivity to cold. \nAccording to researchers of Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan, airflow from an AC stimulates the human body while sleeping and impacts on sleep conditions even if the mean airflow velocity is lower than an insensible level. \nIt suggests some AC setting may have an unintentional negative impact on sleep quality despite the comfort the person feels. AC may give you some comfort, but don’t overdo the chillness factor as it can give your bad sleeping patterns. (Shutterstock) \nThe research team, led by Professor Kazuyo Tsuzuki, had the subjects sleep in two bedrooms using ACs set at different airflow velocities. \nThen they made a comparison of the depth of sleep and body temperature control using electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements as well as subjective reporting by the subjects. \nIn this study, a comparison was made on the influence of two types of airflow, mean velocity of 0.14 m/s (general AC) and 0.04 m/s (customised AC), both at a room temperature of 26 degree C. AC increases heart rates, affecting sleep patterns. (Shutterstock) \nThe participants felt cooler with the higher airflow velocity during wakefulness and sleep. \nHowever, no significant difference was observed in the feeling of comfort, length of sleep depth, skin temperature, rectal temperature or sense of warmth or coolness in each subject before sleeping. \nThe result is useful clue as to how to configure the airflow velocity of an AC to create a comfortable sleeping environment. \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:48.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
