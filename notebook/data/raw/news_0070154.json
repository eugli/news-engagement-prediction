Tinou Bao/Flickr \nIt can be a shock landing that exciting first adult job, only to find out how much of your paycheck actually goes to Uncle Sam. \nThanks to a litany of salary deductions like federal and state income taxes and Medicare, you always end up going home with less than your advertised salary. But how much you lose depends on where you live. \nNew data put together by GOBankingRates shows how much residents in every state actually take home on a $50,000 salary and a $100,000 salary, taking into account varying income tax rates and other witholdings, like taxes for unemployment or disability insurance. \nTo determine how much is taken from each biweekly paycheck, GOBankingRates used ADP's salary paycheck calculator for both a $50,000 salary and $100,000 salary in all 50 states and Washington, DC, under these conditions : filing status single, one federal allowance, zero additional federal withholding, no round federal withholding, and zero additional state withholding. \nIn total, nine US states don't impose an income tax on your salary: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming (but Tennessee and New Hampshire do tax investment and dividend income). Eight states impose a flat tax rate, and the other 33 states, plus Washington, DC, use varying progressive tax structures, taxing higher levels of income at higher rates (see exact state tax rates here ). \nBelow, check out the 15 worst states for your paycheck â€” based on both a $50,000 and $100,000 salary, which amounts to biweekly pre-tax paychecks of $1,923 and $3,846, respectively. \nSkye Gould/Business Insider", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:24:20.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
