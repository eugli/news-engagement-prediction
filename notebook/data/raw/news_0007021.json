But after a photograph showing their son and daughter interacting went viral, they decided to bring their families together... (Vikki Ortiz Healy) \nAccording to Paul Goldenberg, the director of Secure Community Networks — which advises Jewish groups and institutions on security, and is part of the Jewish Federations of North America — there were 17 threats to JCCs on Tuesday morning, including the camp in Lake Zurich, as well as similar facilities in Albany and Syracuse, N.Y., West Orange, N.J., Milwaukee, San Diego and Salt Lake City. \n\"We are aware of it,\" he said of the Lake Zurich JCC camp bomb threat. \"We're tracking them, and I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't more.\" \nGoldenberg said there were similar waves of bomb threats on Jan. 18, when some 30 Jewish institutions in at least 17 states were targeted, and on Jan. 9, when threats were called into 16 JCCs across the Northwest and South, forcing the evacuation of hundreds. \n\"This is a live person telling people, or describing what kind of bomb or devices have been hidden,\" he said. \nGoldenberg said in the first two waves, some of the threats may have been delivered via \"robo calls.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:02:49.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
