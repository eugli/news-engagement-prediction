It is the same hospital where Egyptian Eman Ahmed, reportedly the world’s heaviest woman, is also being treated for severe obesity. The 36-year-old Ahmed, who weighs nearly 500kg, arrived in Mumbai on February 11 for a weight-reduction surgery. \nDoctors at the hospital say though both patients are suffering from severe obesity, there are a number of differences between the two cases. For example, Jogawat’s bariatric surgery can take place within a month, while Eman will have to wait. \nHT takes a look at some of the other differences between the two cases. \n1. WEIGHT \nEman weighs about 480kg and falls under the severely obese category with a BMI above 250. \nJogawat , at 180kg, falls in the obese category with an approximate BMI between 60 and 65. \n2. HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM \nFor Eman , the obesity problem started when she was just 11 years old. She suddenly started gaining weight, which restricted her limb movements. Her obesity is said to be connected to a gene disorder. \nIn Jogawat’s case, obesity is not related to a monogenic disorder (disorders connected to deformity in a single gene). The inspector underwent a gall bladder surgery in 1993, which caused insulin impairment in his body. Since then he has reportedly been suffering from hormonal issues that caused the weight gain.

MEDICAL TROUBLES \nEman is suffering from a number of complications like water retention, severe sleep apnea, severe lymphedema, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hypothyroidism. She also has severe obstructive and restrictive lung disease, gout and is at a very high risk of pulmonary embolism. \nJogawat has been diagnosed with insulin imbalance and hormonal issues. \n4. THE PROCEDURE \nEman’s treatment will go on for next two years. She has to lose 200kg in the first six months after which she will return home. The doctors’ first goal is to help her sit and eat and her own. \nJogawat will undergo a bariatric surgery after a primary diagnosis of his obesity. He will be able to return home two weeks after the surgery. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:17:16.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
