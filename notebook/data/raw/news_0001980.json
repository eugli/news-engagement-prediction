DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nJustice Joe Williams sentences Donella Knox in December. \nOn Friday, the Crown solicitor decided not to appeal the decision, allowing the details of Ruby's death to be publicly revealed. \nREAD MORE: \nAccording to the police summary of facts, Knox was at home in Blenheim with Ruby on May 16. SELINA POWELL/FAIRFAX NZ \nRuby Knox, left, with her mother Donella, the week before Ruby was killed. \nShe used 20 respiradone​ pills to sedate Ruby before putting her hands over her mouth and nose until she died. \nKnox then went to the police station in Blenheim and made a full confession. \nShe was arrested, charged and taken into custody. DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nPolice guard Donella Knox's home the morning after Ruby's body was found. \nKnox pleaded not guilty in September, but changed her plea to guilty two months later. \nAt her sentencing at the High Court in Blenheim, Justice Williams said he would consider the nature of Knox's relationship with Ruby and how her perception of Ruby's treatment and care had affected her mental state. \nRuby was diagnosed with severe autism spectrum disorder when she was an infant. DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nDonella Knox stands in the dock to hear her sentence read. \nShe was unable to speak and had chronic behavioural difficulties and sometimes hurt herself or other people. \nShe also had a severe intellectual disability, spina bifida​, complications from a spinal rod surgery, gastro-oesophageal reflux, hemorrhoids, incontinence and hip pain, Justice Williams said. \nAs Ruby became older, she became stronger and it was more difficult to look after her. \nKnox cared for Ruby full-time with support from respite carers and medical specialists. \nSubmissions from people who knew Knox personally or professionally said she cared for Ruby \"unconditionally and unselfishly\". \n\"You were her tireless advocate and refused to give up, refused to take no for an answer,\" Justice Williams said. \nWhen Ruby turned 20, she could no longer be seen by the pediatric team, could not attend school and respite workers were not always able to handle her. \nRuby's general practitioner, who saw her more than 150 times, likened her relationship with Knox to that of an abusive partner, Justice Williams said. \n\"Your care was met with repeated violence. You told [the GP] you tolerate this because you know Ruby did not understand or intend to do what she did. \n\"His most vivid memory of you, Ms Knox, is of a mother who cared for her daughter, but was constantly physically and mentally exhausted.\" \nIn the months before Ruby's death, Knox noticed Ruby's behaviour change and became convinced she was in great pain. \nShe felt \"brushed off\" by doctors at Wairau Hospital, in Blenheim, Justice Williams said. \nKnox took Ruby to Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital in February last year and surgeons agreed Ruby was in pain, anaesthetising​ her to perform assessments. \nThey described Knox as \"tearful and completely stressed out\". \nStaff members at Wairau Hospital became concerned Knox would hurt Ruby, Justice Williams said. \nKnox told a hospital social worker she did not want any more help. \n\"You're just one of them, I don't know who to trust. I'm done talking, we are fine thank you,\" Knox told the social worker. \nOn the day of Ruby's death, Knox received a letter from doctors confirming they could not find the source of Ruby's pain. \n\"It seems this letter was a trigger for your decision to take Ruby's life. You told the probation officer that when you read the letter, a feeling came over you, that this has to stop,\" Justice Williams said. \nThe case was part mercy killing and part self defence, Justice Williams said. \n\"I think it is right to call your relationship abusive. Not in the usual sense, but because you were tied emotionally to her. \n\"She restricted your social contact with others and any wider career or life ambition you might have had. \n\"There is no doubt a term of imprisonment is required to mark the fact you took a vulnerable life, whatever the circumstances.\" \nThe crown proposed a sentence of eight to 10 years in prison, but the defence argued for two to six. \nJustice Williams gave a discount for good character and the minimal possibility of future offending. \nKnox was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:35:25.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
