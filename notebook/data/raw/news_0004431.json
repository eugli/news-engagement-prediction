LINDA LIPLADY TREVAN/FACEBOOK \nThe Melbourne teen suffered from PTSD following the gang rape and took her own life almost two years later. \nThe girls would bully Cassidy via social media, call the house, and follow her around the local shops. \n\"Our fence got graffitied, banana peel on the front door mat,\" Trevan said. \nThe bullying became so bad Cassidy took a term off school in 2013. CASSIDY TREVAN/FACEBOOK \nCassidy's mother has now publicly shared their story in an effort to warn of the dangers of bullying. \nCassidy eventually returned to school two days a week in February 2014. \nTrevan told 9News the girls approached Cassidy on her return to school to apologise. \nThey said they were sorry and asked her to be their friend, inviting her to join them at a festival the next day. \nThe next day her new \"friends\" led her to a nearby house where they had organised for her to be gang raped, she said. \n\"They were older boys that Cass didn't know. Two girls who sat and waited. Two boys who shared her and timed each other. One boy stood guarding the front door.\" \nCassidy was only 13 years old when this happened. \nShe reported the rape to police but refused to make a formal statement for fear of retaliation and having to relive the traumatic experience. \nBecause there was a lack of evidence and no victim statement police said they were unable to prosecute. \nTrevan said she reported the bullying and rape to the school but was told it was now a police matter. \nCassidy tried to resettle into two other schools but suffered from flashbacks, panic attacks and PTSD. \nMeanwhile, the group continued to bully her. \nTwo years after the bullying began, in December 2015, Cassidy took her own life. \nNow her mother has posted an open message about what happened on social media, where she points the finger at her daughter's bullies. \n\n\"I've kept quiet for about this for far too long...,\" she wrote in the post on January 29. \nTrevan said she did everything she could to keep her daughter alive but she never got over the sexual assault. \n\"I had to watch my baby suffer for the next 22 months from these demons ... she worried you would find her and get her again, she went through continued bullying from some of you who managed to get to her by phone or social media, via others, even after what you'd done to her. \n\"She suffered flash backs of the crime, nightmares, insomnia, separation anxiety, panic attacks, PTSD and subsequent worsening mental illness,\" Trevan said. \n\"I helplessly watched my precious child wither away before my eyes, mentally & physically, until she rarely got out of bed, until she could no longer take the pain and torment you caused her... \n\"I know who you are, you know who you are, and the police know who you are,\" she wrote. \n\"Cassy was my world, she still is and she always will be. But now I have nothing, and I'm still trying to find a reason to go on without her... \n\"This was not a game, this was not just a night of fun for you, you took away my child's innocence, her trust in humanity, her dignity, her rights as a human being, her ability to live a normal life ... and ultimately her life itself.\" \nWHERE TO GET HELP \nLifeline (open 24/7) - 0800 543 354 \nDepression Helpline (open 24/7) - 0800 111 757 \nHealthline (open 24/7) - 0800 611 116 \nSamaritans (open 24/7) - 0800 726 666 \nSuicide Crisis Helpline (open 24/7) - 0508 828 865 (0508 TAUTOKO).
