This week it ran into controversy after being denied certification by the CBFC. Currently in Glasgow for its screening, the director, who made her debut in 2011 with Turning 30!!!, speaks to Deepti Kapoor about the suppression of alternative female voices in Indian cinema How much of a surprise was the censor decision? I was taken aback. Going by the precedent that films like Parched, Pink, Margarita with a Straw and BA Pass had been certified and released mostly without any real cuts, I expected the CBFC would certify the film as adult and leave it at that. After the first screening for the CBFC, they told me it was a divided house and they couldn’t make a decision. But they also complimented the film for telling a hard-hitting story that reflects the reality of Indian women. So the letter that I received post the screening was really not in keeping with the reaction. We applied for a revising committee screening after that. It was a strange and cold interaction: you walk into this room where nobody greets you or offers you a chair, so you are supposed to keep standing while showing your reverence towards the chairperson, Mr Nihalani. And then he made his statement: “We have come to a unanimous decision that your film will not be certified.” There was clearly no space for discussion because he said they have a problem with the film in its entirety. What do you make of the term “lady oriented” as part of the objection? It is laughable really. This is 2017. And the CBFC clearly lives in the dark ages. Maybe they feel that women are chained to their stoves with no thoughts in their heads but how to satisfy and serve men. That women should forever be subjected to the representation of the male gaze with no right to tell their stories. It means that the CBFC believes that only the male-dominated narrative of popular culture is fit for viewing, but alternative narratives from other perspectives cannot be told. Do you feel any kinship with films such as Udta Punjab? Is there common ground? I feel kinship with all artists. A popular culture is created through different art forms. But more importantly, I feel kinship with women. And it is crucial that women, who are almost half the population, are not denied their freedom of expression. I think of something as far back as Ritwik Ghatak’s Meghe Dhaka Tara, in which society is seen to crush a female protagonist who is essentially good, and whose goodness is taken for granted. That film was made by a man. Then as now, it feels that men are allowed to comment on women, yet women are denied this right for themselves. To what extent do you feel this is the case? I love Meghe Dhaka Tara. And Ghatak was a man. But I do feel there are men who can be quite sensitive towards female characters. And there are women who continue to perpetuate the male gaze in their work. But there are such few women telling stories about women in film that it is important to guard our space. Though it’s not incumbent on a woman filmmaker to have a female gaze, or be interested in women’s stories. What is crucial is that the stories of women that are being told are not silenced. Let those films have a level playing field. Let the audience decide. But overall I think there is a problem with the fact that representation of women has been controlled by men. And I feel women have internalised it and continue to play along, because that is the status quo. What do you think the board is afraid of? CBFC is perhaps not educated enough about ideas like the gaze, gender politics, the politics of representation. Are they able to view films in the context of world cinema? Or are they just confined to the popular narrative? Perhaps they are afraid of having any independent judgement? Or maybe they are not afraid at all. They are happy to play robots who don’t understand the nuances of film. And maybe they are fearless because there are never any real repercussions for the decisions they take. There is nobody who holds them accountable. Would you call your film subversive? Yes, the film is subversive. Because the set-up of the characters is that they are confined. The subversion comes in their courage to rebel and dream, despite their confinement. What kind of research did you do for it? It is not a documentary. It’s a fictional story that emerged from my own feeling of not being fully free. It was this feeling I wanted to explore through characters who also have external constraints. Listening to stories of friends, domestic help, neighbours, beauticians, maybe that came into play subconsciously when I conceived of the film. Otherwise, I spent a lot of time in the old city of Bhopal where the film is set. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
