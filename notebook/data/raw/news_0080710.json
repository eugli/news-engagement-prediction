SIMON MANEY \nThe 183m abseil descent into Harwoods Hole is for experienced cavers only. \nIn a statement, police said the alarm was raised by a group in the area and a helicopter had been sent to the scene. \nREAD MORE: * Rescued cavers 'ill-equipped, inexperienced' \nCave rescue specialists, the Fire Service and St John Ambulance were also involved. \nSt John Ambulance crew member Anne-Maree Harris said a rescue crew was trying to gain access to the cave at the moment. \nRobin Reeve, of New Zealand Land Search and Rescue, said LandSAR was setting up a repeater to enable communications between the SAR base at Motueka and rescuers at the remote site which has limited coverage. \nReeve said he understood local cavers had also been called to assist in the rescue operation. \nHarwoods Hole is a 176-metre deep sinkhole. It drops to an underground river that emerges below and flows into Gorge Creek and then into the Takaka River. Ad Feedback \nSeveral scenes from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy were filmed in the complex of caves at the bottom of the shaft. \nSituated in a remote part of Takaka Hill in Golden Bay with little to no cellphone reception, Harwoods Hole is a 45-minute walk from the Canaan car park, through distinctive limestone rock formations.â€‹ \nMORE TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:12:12.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
