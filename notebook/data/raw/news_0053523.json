But in Japan, where few chefs speak fluent English, the concept can be an intimidating and confusing one for foreigners, who are unsure of what they’re eating and even less sure of how to eat it. \nEnter “Sushi University,” a newly launched tour outfit led by interpreters who can school guests on the dos and don’ts of omakase dining, and serve as liaisons between diners and sushi chefs. \nThe meal is a door-to-door experience, with guides accompanying guests from the hotel to the restaurant in a shuttle bus. ADVERTISEMENT \nAt the restaurant — normally a small, intimate affair — the chef provides a short lecture on their culinary philosophy and the menu for the day and answers guest questions which are interpreted by the guide. \nAlso on the syllabus, students learn the dos and don’ts of omakase and sushi etiquette. \nFor instance, guests are taught it’s considered bad manners to engage the sushi chef in conversation or ask questions while they are slicing the fish or molding the sushi rice. \nLikewise, students are advised to skip perfume or cologne when dining at a sushi restaurant, or risk offending the chef and masking the subtle aromas for fellow diners. That also goes for smoking mid-meal. \nTemperature plays an important role in omakase dining and sushi as well, which means that plates should be consumed within 10 seconds of being presented and not left languishing on the counter. \nIn addition to offering an authentic dining experience, the tour is also meant to help travelers who have specific dietary requirements like allergies and aversions, as special requests can be made in advance. \nThe program is divided into three levels, basic, intermediate and senior, and prices range between $88 to $265. \nOther languages in the works for the program include German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, simplified Chinese, Korean and Thai. \nFor more info visit http://sushiuniversity.jp/ .
