In fact, Spicer's comments only served to create more questions about what went on behind the scenes of the White House.\nHere's a look at the contradictions in the administration's account of what transpired with Flynn.\n1. Who decided Flynn had to go? There's no question Flynn tendered his resignation to President Donald Trump on Monday night. But what is unclear is who came to the conclusion Flynn had to go.\nConway this AM on Flynn: \"He knew he had become a lightening rod and he made that decision\" Spicer this PM: POTUS asked for resignation.\nOn Tuesday morning, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told NBC's Today that Flynn determined he had become a distraction and that it was time to resign.\n\"The president is very loyal, he's a very loyal person, and by night's end Mike Flynn had decided it was best to resign,\" Conway told NBC's Matt Lauer. \"He knew he had become a lightning rod and he made that decision.\"\nWATCH: @MLauer's full interview with @kellyannepolls on departure of #MichaelFlynn\nHours later, at Spicer's daily press briefing, Spicer said Trump's trust in Flynn had \"eroded\" and that Trump specifically asked Flynn to resign.\n\"We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,\" Spicer said.\nPress Sec. Spicer: Trust between Trump and Flynn \"eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change\nThe entire situation leaves onlookers wondering who actually made the call for Flynn to go.\n2. What did Trump know about the Flynn situation, and when did he know it? O n Friday , when Trump traveled to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz? Abe, a reporter aboard Air Force One asked Trump if he had seen the reports alleging Flynn had a conversation with the Russian ambassador about sanctions.\n\"I don't know about it, I haven't seen it, what report is that?\" Trump said.\nA reporter clarified that the Washington Post had reported Flynn misled the White House about his discussions with the Russian ambassador, to which Trump again replied that he hadn't seen it and would \"look into it.\"\nTrump lied to the country on Friday when asked about Flynn report, Trump: \"I don't know about it, I haven't seen it\nYet Spicer's provided timeline of when Trump was briefed about Flynn's conversation — and his defense of Trump's answer aboard Air Force One — did nothing to clear up the fact that it looked like Trump lied to those reporters on the plane.\nDuring Tuesday's press briefing, Spicer said the Department of Justice briefed the White House counsel Jan. 26 on Flynn's conversation. After that briefing, however, Spicer said Trump was immediately told of Flynn's actions.\nJan 26, WH counsel's office told, per Spicer. POTUS immediately told.\nIf that's the case, Trump's Friday claim that he didn't know about the Flynn situation looks to be a bald-faced lie.\nSpicer says Trump didn't lie on AF1 when he said he hadn't heard about the Flynn stories: \"He was asked specifically\" about a WaPo story.\nWhen reporters brought that up to Spicer, he tried to thread the needle by claiming Trump hadn't heard specifically about the Washington Post 's particular report on Flynn's conversation.\nSpicer's answer on this: Trump was asked specifically about WaPo report (on this topic!) and that's what he meant he wasn't aware of... https://t.co/UTHdmJhlSx\nThat's an incredibly weak defense.\n3. Why wasn't Flynn fired as soon as Trump was briefed? Then there were questions about why, if Trump knew three weeks ago that Flynn misled Pence and others about his dealings with the Russian ambassador, the national security adviser wasn't forced to step down until Monday.\nSpicer told reporters the White House was reviewing Flynn \" on a daily basis for a few weeks\" and that, ultimately, Trump decided Monday his trust in Flynn had eroded too much to keep him around.\nYet nothing about the facts of Flynn's behavior had changed in the three-week period between when the Department of Justice briefed the White House and when Flynn stepped down.\nThe only thing that had changed was a flurry of media coverage on the situation.\nIf WH was reviewing Flynn issue \"on a daily basis for a few weeks\", how did POTUS say he wasn't aware of the story at all on Friday?\nThroughout that entire evaluation period, Flynn was by Trump's side in briefings, including what was the administration's much-maligned response to the North Korean missile test in a public dining room at Mar-a-Lago.\nDOJ tells WH Flynn is blackmail risk on Jan 26, per Spicer. Trump notified \"immediately.\" Flynn maintains top-level info access until Feb 13\nIn all, Spicer's Tuesday press briefing created more questions about the Flynn situation — and that means this scandal is not going away anytime soon.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/831477092923478016", "https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/831569614215794696", "https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/831574939320852484&quot;", "https://twitter.com/riotwomennn/status/831548287144558598", "https://t.co/UTHdmJhlSx", "https://twitter.com/riotwomennn/status/831548287144558598&quot;", "https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/831477092923478016&quot;", "https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/831582259715198981&quot;", "https://twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum/status/831591345571635202&quot;", "https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/831581077051408385", "https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/831572272485978112", "https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/831572272485978112&quot;", "https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/831570173467299840", "https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/831581077051408385&quot;", "https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/831570173467299840&quot;", "https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/831582259715198981", "https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/831574939320852484", "https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/831569614215794696&quot;", "https://twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum/status/831591345571635202"], "published": "2017-02-15T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:30:18.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
