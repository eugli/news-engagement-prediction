Branson’s blog showcases a contest between the two men to see who could stay up the longest.\nIt took a few days for Obama to learn the basics, Branson says. Obama still had security nearby — as a former president, he always will. In spite of that, writes Branson, “Barack was able to really relax and get into it.”\nA big gift to Northwestern\nAttorney Howard Trienens | Provided photo\nChicago attorney Howard Trienens is the primary donor of a $20 million gift to Northwestern University for the upcoming renovation of its Welsh-Ryan Arena.

And Jim Phillips , Northwestern vice president for athletics and recreation, said thanks to Trienens’ gift, “our basketball, volleyball and other Wildcats teams will have a first-class development facility to use 365 days each year.”\nNorthwestern really is family to Trienens.\nHis late wife, Paula; daughter and Northwestern trustee Nan Trienens Kaehler ; brother, Roger Trienens ; and three of his grandchildren also are Northwestern alums.\nThe exec who played viola\nAlison Donnelly, board member for Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras | Provided photo\nChicago businesswoman Alison Donnelly will be among those applauding the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras when it performs Feb. 11 at Four Seasons Chicago.\nDonnelly is a CYSO board member and a former orchestra member. She played viola.\nDonnelly was a teenager from Wheaton in the 1990s when she joined the CYSO.\n“The music experience was second to none,” she said. But playing with a diverse group of students from across the Chicago area “broadened my perspective and opened my eyes,” she recalls.\n“I became friends with people so different than me, and we had this one connection that brought us together. Many of my closest friends were from the orchestra — people I’d see on a weekly basis,” she said.\nDonnelly went on two European tours with the orchestra. After high school, she studied music for a year at the Boston University College of Fine Arts before switching to the college of communication. She worked for a decade at ITW before being named director of external communications at Deerfield-based Surgical Care Affiliates last year.\nDonnelly serves on the CYSO’s executive committee over marketing. It’s a volunteer position and allows her a chance to share CYSO’s story.\nChicago stars in Palm Springs\nGary and Joan Gand’s home in Palm Springs, California. | Courtesy of Tom Blachford\nChicago-area residents Gary and Joan Gand have created a house tour in Palm Springs, California, featuring their mid-century vacation home designed by the late Harold Levitt.
