That was the hope for Memphis Depay when Manchester United beat interest from rivals Liverpool to sign him from PSV. However the Dutchman's career has stalled and things haven't got instantly better in France. \nThere was a lot of hopes for Depay after 2014 World Cup performances and his last season at PSV where he was the league's top goalscorer, regularly banging in free kicks for fun. \nCheck out our video on Manchester United's biggest flops: \nHowever things didn't turn out too well for him at Old Trafford. Under Louis van Gaal United didn't exactly play an exciting brand of football but his performances left a lot to be desired as he only managed two league goals. \nHe didn't get much of a chance under Jose Mourinho and in January he inevitably moved on, deciding to have a go in Ligue 1 with Lyon. At the weekend he made only his second start for them and things didn't go too well: Impressive first Rhône derby for Memphis Depay. L'Equipe awards him 2/10, making him (in their eyes) the joint-worst player on the pitch. - Tom Williams (@tomwfootball) February 6, 2017 \nAnd his two match 'highlights' show just how bad his career has slumped: Memphis Depay ● Fantastic bicycle kick goal - ASSE vs OL (05/02/17) ● HD 720p pic.twitter.com/Luaa6PEvUu - Lino Treize (@LinoTreize) February 5, 2017 St Etienne - Lyon / Memphis Depay AMAZING Skill. #ASSEOL pic.twitter.com/TCRJWhEC0W - Romano135 :white_circle::m: (@Romanooo135) February 5, 2017 \nAnd based on reports from France it's not the first time the 22 year old has played badly in his short stint in France: Memphis Depay scuffs a horrible pass... Lille get possession and end up scoring. Not a great full debut so far.. - Enda Higgins (@endahiggins88) January 28, 2017 . @etiennemoatti : \"Memphis Depay made a terrible entrance. A very bad match from him. He was rubbish!\" - Get French Football (@GFFN) January 31, 2017 \nCan Depay ever get back to his best?
