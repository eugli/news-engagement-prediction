(Rabbani & Solimene Photography) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, February 8, 2017, 6:30 PM \nSinger Melissa Etheridge says that she attended a same-sex wedding two years ago and Donald Trump was there. Looking back now, she wonders how the man who’s now spearheading a radical conservative movement made the cut. \n“I always think the best of people so no, I never thought we would be on this side of that ,” Etheridge said at the 14th annual Woman’s Day Red Dress Awards at Lincoln Center on Tuesday. \nWhether the gay couple who got married regrets inviting Trump, Etheridge doesn't know. She also seems confused about how The Donald got tied up with people like Vice President Mike Pence, who as the governor of Indiana, frequently championed anti-gay legislation. \n“I can't speak (for the couple), but this is New York City and I'm sure there's a lot of people who worked with (Trump) and socialized with him who are rolling their eyes and going, ‘Really?’” she said. \nThough Pence has been outspoken about his anti-gay sentiments for years, the Grammy- and Oscar-winning singer says that as a gay woman, Trump worries her more “because there's an uneducated, unregulated part of him.” Singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge isn't the only one wondering how President Trump will deal with LGBT issues.
