This internal feud came out in the open last September. After Akhilesh won the right to use the party's electoral symbol, a shaky rapprochement was perceived to have taken place. \n\nBut party founder Mulayam lost his cool again when Akhilesh in late January announced an electoral alliance with the Congress. A furious Mulayam - who was against such a partnership - said that he wouldn't campaign for the Congress. \n\nClearly, Shivpal also isn't in favour of the alliance. \n\n\"I don't want to go where Congress candidates are contesting. If Netaji (party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav) wants I'll go. I will campaign for SP, I haven't thought further,\" said Shivpal to ANI. \n\nThree of seven phases of the UP elections have already taken place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:40:38.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
