Price-wise it matters. We have $50 repairs, all the way to $500 repairs.\"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city remains committed to fixing reported potholes within three days, even when heavy rain leaves the streets riddled with damage.\"This was a monster storm,\" Garcetti said. \"We've cut the pothole repair time in half since I've been mayor and the good thing is even during the storm it's the same repair time - three days.\"\"So call 311. We've got over 1,000 requests in a single day, on the peak day of the storm. We have extra crews out there.\"In addition to the potholes, Los Angeles city officials say since Friday's storm they've responded to more than three dozen land and mud slides in the San Fernando Valley, and nearly 1,000 damaged trees.
