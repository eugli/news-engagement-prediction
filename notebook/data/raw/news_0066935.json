But Fletcher told police his 4-year-old nephew was in the car, prompting an intense search. \nPolice found the car a short time later with no child inside. Police say Fletcher then gave conflicting accounts of the robbery and was vague about the child’s identity. \nPolice say they’re still investigating the suspected robbery. \nBut now Fletcher is jailed on a charge of making a false report to police. \nHis public defender couldn’t immediately be reached.
