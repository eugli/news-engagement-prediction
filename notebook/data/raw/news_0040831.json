Credit: Sky Sports \nArsenalFanTV host Robbie took exception to Neville's branding of the fan, as did several of the most high profile regulars to appear on the channel, who were in no better a mood following Wednesday's 5-1 Champions League mauling by Bayern Munich, as the post match interviews proved. \nOnce Neville agreed to sit down with Robbie, DT, Troopz, Claude and Moh, English football fans couldn't wait to see what unfolded and, earlier today, the Manchester United legend and Sky Sports pundit was grilled by the Gunners' panel for his attitude towards their club and his recent comments as well as whether Wayne Rooney did indeed dive during the 2004/05 'Pizza Gate' Premier League clash that saw Arsenal's 49 match unbeaten league run come to a controversial end after a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. \nWhile the interview is perhaps not as explosive as many thought it would be, it is still well worth a watch as the Premier League and Champions League winning full back is grilled by Claude and co and, somehow, everyone manages to maintain a reasonable level of composure. \nWe just wish there'd been more prolific use of the word 'bloodclart'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:03:56.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
