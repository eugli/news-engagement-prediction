Maybe it's not just about poor funding. Just saying…' Although posted on a publicly available page, his comments were made in a private capacity and aimed at friends and family. A Royal Berkshire spokesman said: 'Dr Davies was posting in a private capacity. At this time Royal Berkshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust cannot confirm details of his claims.' Last night Tory MP Sir Simon Burns, who oversaw a major drive to cut NHS procurement costs under the Coalition Government, said of the contractors' bill: 'This beggars belief. At a time when the NHS could be investing its money in patient care, it's disgraceful to be wasting this sort of money when cheaper products are available on the high street. DIY option: A Homebase one like the one required. Right: Chris Davies' Facebook post 'There's no point in screaming about funding, if such extravagance is going on under your nose.' Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat Health spokesman, said 'profiteering' suppliers were taking the NHS for a ride. He said: 'Once an organisation becomes the official contractor then it's a danger that it becomes almost like a licence to print money. 'The mindset has to be that NHS cash is a precious resource – and any money that is being wasted is money not spent on front-line patient care. 'A lot of money could be saved by an assault on profligacy.' However, he cautioned: 'That's not to say that the system does not need more resources – I'm sure that it is close to breaking point. But this sort of profligacy is very dangerous, because it undermines the case for more money going into the NHS.' The revelation comes as the NHS struggles in the midst of its worst winter crisis in 15 years. On Friday official figures revealed that only 86.2 per cent of A&E patients were seen within four hours – the lowest figure on record. It means almost three times as many people are being forced to wait over the Government target of four hours for emergency treatment. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted that care in some hospitals was 'completely unacceptable', adding: 'No one would want it for members of their own family.' But he also said that an extra £4 billion had been pumped into the NHS this year 'which is more than the entire cost of the fire service'.
