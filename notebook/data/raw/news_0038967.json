John McCain has delivered a withering critique of President Donald Trump in a speech that highlights fractures within the GOP as the new administration struggles to overcome a chaotic start. \nMcCain spoke Friday at the Munich Security Conference. The Armed Services Committee chairman never mentioned the president's name while lamenting a shift in the United States and Europe away from the \"universal values\" that McCain says forged the Western alliance. \nTrump has questioned NATO's value and sought instead to stoke a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has accused Putin of attempting to break the military alliance. \nIn his speech, McCain said \"more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:14:07.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
