I didn’t cry because I got that used to it at the time. \n“I got used to getting hit, that’s why I didn’t cry. \n“I haven’t got proper emotions.” \nBut she was forced to leave the court after breaking down when she revealed she was “physically starved”. \nJurors heard how Leacock threatened to throw her over a balcony. \nThe woman said: “I kept saying no. No means no, it means rape.” \nMr Povall said: “Her ordeal with that family continued until the beginning of May 2016 when she walked into a local shop and as a result of talking to on of the people who was working there she was sent on for medical help and the police became involved.’ \nHe added: “Mandy Leacock isn’t in the dock, she has admitted to assaults on [the victim].” \nThe prosecutor said the convictions do not “make Colin Leacock any more guilty than he would otherwise be”. \nColin Leacock, of Maida Vale, denies two counts of rape and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. \nMandy Leacock, Maida Vale, has admitted three counts of actual bodily harm. \nThe trial continues.
