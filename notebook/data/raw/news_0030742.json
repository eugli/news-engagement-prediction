So temperatures, away from towns and cities, widely below freezing, a few degrees below in a few spots. \n“Maximum temperatures on Sunday will probably not be dissimilar to Saturday, so we are looking at generally between about 2C to 6C (36F to 43F), right the way across the country. \n“Then into the start of next week we start to see some slightly less cold weather actually pushing in. So by Monday probably more in the way of sunshine, temperatures into high single figures.”\nWeather news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:35:08.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
