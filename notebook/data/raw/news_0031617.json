G4   \n\"I instinctively chased after him and grabbed the bag and ended up with stars in my eyes after being punched in the face.\" \nAnsell said he had decided not to report the offender - who was wearing a hat or a hood - to the police because they had recovered their property. \nFellow group member Christie, 35, said: \"I'm very shaken by the incident and am just pleased no one got severely injured. I am also really thankful to Jon for managing to recover my rucksack from the scumbag.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:48:09.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
