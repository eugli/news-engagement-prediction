Dan Eaton The Lithopolis-based coffee shop is moving to the radio station’s Brewery District bar from a space inside Zauber Brewing Co. near Grandview Heights. Joe Contino previously told me his European-inspired shop eschews the low-key, mellow vibe many associate with coffee shops in favor of a more pub-like atmosphere and thumping electronic music soundtrack. Contino and his wife Amy Contino started the business in Lithopolis, where they reside.

In addition to its signature roasts, the shop also will serve pastries including cinnamon rolls, cream puffs, cake-balls and turnovers.
