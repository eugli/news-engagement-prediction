For despite City’s improve recent showings at the back, Monaco are a tough side when they attack and the numbers tell the story – the French side are top of Ligue 1 and have scored 76 goals from 26 games in the league which is nearly 3 goals a game. Their last contest against an English side came in this edition itself when they beat Spurs both home and away. For City, it is another chance to prove that they can belong at the top level of the European football and repeat their best showing of making the quarters last season. \nIn the other game on the night, Bayer Leverkusen host Atletico Madrid in what is expected to be a feisty and yet a cagey contest – one that Atleti manager Diego Simeone thrives upon. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:49:55.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
