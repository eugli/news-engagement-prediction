Woodstock, Il'sfictional Tip Top Cafe was temporarily turned into the real Tip Top Bistro; AMC plays the movie all day every February 2nd; and Woodstock evenhas an annual Groundhog Day festival . The phrase \"groundhog day\"has evenentered our daily lexicon asa shorter way to explain that the same bad shit keeps happening day after dayand especially so within the military . But, more than anything, Groundhog Day 's legacy can be found continuing to permeate pop culture.\nThere are a number of movies that takesimilar conceits to Groundhog Day 's: In 2014's Edge of Tomorrow , Tom Cruise's character gets sent back in a loop every time he dies in battle; inNetflix's ARQ from last year,an engineer invents a machine that causes a time loop; and then there'sthe upcoming YA book adaptation Before I Fall, where a teenager repeatedly relives the day she dies. \nBut this trope rears its head most frequently throughout television's many genres. The popularity of the \"Groundhog Day Loop,\" as the wonderfully obsessive TV Tropes site defines it , is a \"plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected.\" It's easy to see why television shows often deploy this device, which isa way to shake up existingformulasespecially when it comes to sitcoms, which rely onfun but repetitive formatsandinsert a little supernatural weirdness to a show that might not even have any supernatural links. Because of theinherent reset button the trope provides, an episode of TVcanexplore different scenarios, plots, character interactions, and outcomesandif any of them don't quite feel right,the writers can start over(often with the ringing of a shrill alarm clock).\nSuitably, the \"Groundhog Day Loop\" appears most frequently throughout science-fiction-based TVshows, along withother shows that possess supernatural ties. In aepisode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's fifth season, Buffy gets stuck in a time loop whiletrying to kill a mummy's hand; its spinoff, Angel , spun the \"Groundhog Day Loop\"into a random, disorienting new direction with the episode\"Time Bomb.\" Charmed which is set for a reboot, since these daysthe executives greenlighting TVshows are basically living their own version of Groundhog Day closed out its first season with \"Dj Vu All Over Again,\" in which the sisters repeatedly tried to stop a deadly attack on them and their childhood friendAndy. \nAnd thenthere's the famous X-Files episode \"Monday,\" co-written by Breaking Bad 's Vince Gilligan and inspired by The Twilight Zone 's \"Shadow Play.\"It opens with Mulder dying during a bank hostage situationand then waking up from a dream to go out about his dayonly to end up in that same bank, dying,and waking upagain. \"Monday\" is one of the best Groundhog Day television homages, as the loop seemingly and endlessly repeats itselfbut the nice twist is thatMulder (andScully) aren't aware of the loop.Instead, it's an increasingly frustrated and desperate Pam tries to convince Mulder that something is going to happen. \nThere areentire dramas based around this trope, too: In theEliza Dushku-starring Tru Calling (a forgettable series that only I believe is actually underrated), dead bodies suddenly wake up and ask Tru for help, resetting her dayso she can save them. ( Early Edition had a similar premise, with the season four episode\"Run, Gary, Run\" possessinga Groundhog Day feelalthough, as the title implies, itboremore similarities in scope to Run, Lola, Run. ) Day Break , anothershort-lived series, revolved around a detective (Taye Diggs) who kept reliving the day he was framed for murder. Every new/old day, he has to put together morepieces that will prove his innocence. You can even argue that Westworld has ties to Groundhog Day ; every day, the hosts wake up and embark on the same journey in the same timeline, repeating their same words and actions. \nBut this trope isn't just limited to dramas. It pops up in the Canadian series Being Erica , the sitcom adaptation of Weird Science , and even an episode of My Name Is Earl where the trope is heavily subverted, as a character is trappedin a loop due to a brain injury and is the only one who's unawareof what's going on. The \"Groundhog Day Loop\" is so adaptable that it even appears in children's shows, from The Famous Jett Jackson to The Suite Life of Zack and Cody to, yep, a 1996 Sesame Street Christmas special. Even game shows get into the fun: Today's episode of CBS's Let's Make A Deal featured the same contestant getting called down and stuck in the same deal, allowing her to change her decisions. \nIt's this adaptability that allows the trope to remain alive, but it's the wishful thinking that makes it so relatable and watchable. The basic gist of the \"Groundhog Day Loop\"that you can relive a day in which you may have fucked up, that you can literally save someone's life, that you can tell off your boss or punch your enemy or kiss your crush and know that everything will just reset and erase those actions tomorrowprovides viewers with something desirable. It's impossible in real life, but watching these characters, whether they're gleefully wrecking shit or righting a terrible wrong, is the next best thing.\nFollow Pilot Viruet on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:34:09.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
