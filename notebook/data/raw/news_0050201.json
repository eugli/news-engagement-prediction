And her living room—which features baskets of toys for her young daughter, plus shelves of board games and magazines—has become a place for connecting and relaxing rather than staring at a screen. \nSound nice? Then maybe you’re ready to hop on the trend of banishing the TV from your living room, too. More TVs have left the living room—here’s why \nOnce upon a time, the fireplace was the centerpiece of the living room, explains David Pascu , an associate principal architect with Abramson Teiger Architects in Los Angeles. This focal point then morphed into the radio, and later the television. Flash forward many decades. Now, with the increasing popularity of watching videos on tablets—which can be viewed anywhere—there’s less of a need to make living rooms into a space for gathering and watching TV. \nConsequently, designers like Dallas-based Charmaine Wynter are increasingly being asked to create layouts that aren’t designed around sectional sofas facing the wall or a cabinet holding a TV screen. \n“The TV is no longer God,” says Wynter. “There’s less planning around where the cable connection is and where the black box will go.” \nInstead, Wynter is asked to come up with more creative concepts, like “chill rooms,” or spaces that feature clustered seating areas with comfy cushions, or cozy reading nooks that serve as a game room rather than a TV room. “Without the traditional focal point,” Wynter says, “there’s suddenly space for activities such as meditating , reading, and talking. It’s very liberating.” What’s taking the TV’s place? \nWith screens out of the picture in some living rooms, designers are also introducing attention-getting accents and centerpieces . Architect David Pascu has noticed some of his clients opting to showcase an amazing piece of art, rather than give prime living room real estate to a huge TV screen—even the relatively unbulky flat-screen variety. \nIn some instances, the fireplace has reemerged as a focal point. Only these new models play music, or are housed in textured walls. Similarly, the Canadian Ambience Design Group in Woodbridge, Ontario, is installing innovations including oversized aquariums and even living green wall gardens that not only kick off conversations, but improve indoor air quality. \nA customized fireplace and accent wall \n“Many of our clients are seeking moments where technology doesn’t get in the way of spending time together as a family,” explains Sara Abate Rezvanifar of Ambience. “They want a barrier between all the electronic devices and themselves.” \nBest of all, these new focal points don’t have to be expensive—or even particularly innovative. Lexi Bohigian , 23, of Austin, TX, wanted a to create a place to decompress and tune out all the technology she deals with at work. So she simply banished her television from her living room and replaced it with a desk, a radio, and some bookcases. “Now my living room is where I unwind,” explains Bohigian. And her millennial peers keep complimenting her on her home decor decision. “They love it,” Bohigian says. “Because when I have friends over now, there’s much more conversation.” Good for your health, plus a great conversation starter: a living wall garden.\nAmbience Designs \nUltimately, unplugged living rooms might be just the start. “I actually fantasize about getting rid of the television all together,” admits Morrissey, who’s also made it harder for her family to waste time on their phones and tablets by ridding her living room of charging stations, and by limiting their data plans. Because when they let themselves get bored, things like epic Uno games and kitchen dance parties start to happen. “Without the screens, our focus is more on one another,” she says. “The whole vibe has changed.” Why stare at a TV screen when you can commune with fish?\nzazamaza /istock.com Audrey D.
