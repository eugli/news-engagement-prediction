On-site vendors often sell their products at a significant discount exclusively for the show. And some accept cash only. Beware the masses: if crowds make you antsy, then try to get there before noon or at least 1 p.m. When I dropped by on a Sunday at 3 p.m., the exhibition room was packed , making it to difficult to get close to the vendors and examine the goods. Aching to see the chocolate fashion show? Keep in mind that it usually starts near the end of the day, at 4 p.m or later. For a good view, ask on-site volunteers where the catwalk is situated and ensure you're in place at least 15 minutes before the show is scheduled to begin.\nJe t'aime en chocolat: Translation Je t'aime en chocolat is French for \"I love you in chocolate.\" Rather à propos, if you ask me.\nFor more information on the next edition, visit Je t'aime en chocolat's website .\nThis profile is for information and editorial purposes only.
