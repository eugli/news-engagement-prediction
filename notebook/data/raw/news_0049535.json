In November 2016, just before the election, Cuban told an NBC Sports radio show that he’d “rather lose every penny than have Trump as president.”\nIn May 2016, Cuban told NBC’s Chuck Todd that he’s open to running for the Oval Office in the future.\nAdvertisement\n“You don’t have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would’ve been in the past,” Cuban said during the interview on “Meet the Press.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.\nAimee Ortiz can be reached at aimee.ortiz@globe.com .
