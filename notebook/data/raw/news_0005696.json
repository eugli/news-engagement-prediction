(Photo: Jordan Kartholl / The Star Press) Buy Photo\nAn adoption agency with locations throughout the country — including one in Indianapolis — abruptly closed its doors this week, sending waves of fear and anger through families involved in the adoption process.\nIndependent Adoption Center, a nonprofit based in California, sent emails to its clients telling them it would be filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy and permanently closing, effective Tuesday , Jan. 31 . The closure will affect 1,886 adoptions that were in progress, 136 of which were in Indiana, spokesman David Perry told IndyStar.\nAbout 1,060 families were notified Tuesday about the closure. Another 824 families weren't notified until Wednesday because of an \"internal communications error,\" Perry said.\n\"Societal changes have created an environment in the United States where there are fewer potential birth parents than at any other point in our 34-year history of helping to create families,\" the Independent Adoption Center said in a statement on its website. \"Simultaneously, due to changing demographics and the closure of international adoption programs, there are more hopeful adoptive parents seeking to adopt domestically than in any other time in recent history. The IAC has worked tirelessly to adapt to this changing environment, but the many efforts we implemented were ultimately unsuccessful. We therefore cannot sustain the agency any longer.\"\nThe center said the bankruptcy court will determine how much, if any, refunds will be paid to its clients, some of whom have paid more than $20,000 for adoptions that haven't happened. Court records indicate the center had not yet filed for bankruptcy as of early Wednesday evening.\nIts website referred biological mothers and adoptive families to licensing offices in eight states: California, Texas, Indiana, New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia.\nSouth Carolina resident Chris Lacey said he and his husband had paid Independent Adoption Center about $16,000. They received an email at 3:16 p.m. Tuesday notifying them of the impending closure.\n\"For us, it was like being stabbed in the heart,\" he said. \"You trust this nonprofit adoption business to help us find a child that we’ve been looking for for so many years. ... We felt completely deserted.\"\nLacey said the agency's closure also raises concerns about what will happen to families' records, including birth certificates and home studies.\n\"This is a really crappy way to operate a business that’s so personal,\" he said.\nCall IndyStar reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski at (317) 444-6135.
