His departure was confirmed today by the house, who told WWD that his final collections have already been shown – during menswear and couture weeks in Paris. \n“The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the house of Givenchy over the last 12 years represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution to the house’s development,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of Givenchy owner LVMH, said today. \nDespite the seemingly hasty exit – which will not see him take a bow at the ready-to-wear shows next month, and the forthcoming autumn/winter 2017 collection be completed by the studio team – the parting has been described as “mutual and amicable” and was effective on the expiry of his contract on January 31. \nSpeculation has been swirling for several months that Tisci is being lined up to take the helm at Versace. The designer is firm friends with Donatella Versace, even enlisting her for a Givenchy ad campaign, and his dark but sexy aesthetic is seen as a perfect fit for Versace. While speculation over Tisci’s next move is nothing new, the chatter over who should fill his shoes will now begin. A raft of high-profile recent designer departures – Peter Dundas, Hedi Slimane, Clare Waight Keller and Peter Copping – could find themselves linked with the role, while Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing is already being mooted for a move. \nTisci is the go-to red-carpet designer for a diverse collection of stars – from Kim Kardashian West, whose wedding dress he created, and Beyoncé Knowles, to Madonna and Meryl Streep. His unarguable skill, as well as his celebrity pull, make him a desirable appointment for any house, but he may be subject to a non-compete clause meaning his next move may not come for a while.
