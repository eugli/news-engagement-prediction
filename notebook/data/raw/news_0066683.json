Abbott tried that in 2014 and the budget during his leadership but, of course, a whole lot of zombie legislation sat in the Senate unable to be passed.”\nPyne said backbenchers are “very welcome” to state their views but vowed the government would not be “distracted by some of these issues”.\n“The cabinet is very united by behind Malcolm Turnbull ,” he said, noting that when Abbott was leader he trailed Bill Shorten 30% to 48% as preferred prime minister.\n\n“So we are on the right track with Malcolm Turnbull and with the government’s policies.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters in London, Bishop rejected Abbott’s assessment that the government risks a “drift to defeat” if it fails to lift its performance.\n“I don’t accept that characterisation at all,” she said.\nBishop said she had not seen Abbott’s “so-called manifesto”. She said the Liberal party welcomed policy initiatives from ministers and backbenchers and as a former party leader Abbott would have ideas.\nPeter Dutton backtracks on suggestion of people-swap refugee deal with US Read more \nWhen asked if she thought Abbott was doing to the Liberal party what Kevin Rudd had done to the Labor party, Bishop said she didn’t see it that way.\nBishop also rejected a suggestion from conservative commentator Andrew Bolt in an interview with Abbott that – unlike the immigration minister, Peter Dutton – she had not been “conservative, plain-speaking and loyal”.\nBishop said she had been elected by the party to be deputy leader and she owed her loyalty to the party room.\n“If there’s a characterisation about being conservative and plain speaking and loyal I believe I fill that characterisation.”\n\nIn an interview on Radio National on Friday, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, noted the renewable energy target of 23.5% by 2020 had been agreed between Abbott and Labor just 18 months ago.\nFrydenberg repeated the mantra that backbenchers are entitled to their views but noted the Turnbull government had achieved conservative policies including restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:31:32.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
