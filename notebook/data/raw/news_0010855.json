It argued that the White House should support a trade agreement similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump has already rejected , to strengthen economic ties in Asia. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story And it cautioned the administration not tamper with Washington’s commitment to a One China policy — a clear reference to the president’s recent suggestion that the United States could ignore what had become a central tenet of the relationship after President Richard M. Nixon’s groundbreaking trip to China in 1972. The report urged swift action to reassure the United States’ allies in Asia about its security commitments there. It also recommended that the administration initiate talks, as soon as possible, with China’s leaders and develop constructive policies on what the task force identified as the six most critical areas of engagement, including efforts to halt North Korea’s nuclear weapons program . “We’re really at a critical inflection point,” said Orville Schell , a scholar at the Asia Society and a chairman of the task force. “We are worried about the increasingly antagonistic relationship” and “think the U.S. needs to up its game in terms of the effort its puts into high-level negotiations.” Mr. Trump has given no clear indication of how he will deal with China, but his administration has hinted at a more confrontational approach. The commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., has complained about Chinese tariffs, and Mr. Trump named Peter Navarro , a strident critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. The defense secretary, Jim Mattis , has said the United States would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Japan and its Asian allies, which angered China. He has also given China some reassurance , however, saying on Saturday in Tokyo that military maneuvers in the South China Sea were unnecessary. Diplomacy, he said, should resolve the differences.

The report said that “it would be exceedingly dangerous to unilaterally abandon our longstanding One China policy — an understanding that has served as the basis for the U.S. relationship with China, helped protect Taiwan’s security, prosperity and democracy, and preserved peace and stability in Asia for almost four decades.” “Across-the-board tariffs or challenging the One China policy is not the way to go,” said Susan L. Shirk , a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and a chairwoman of the task force. “We shouldn’t undervalue what we’ve achieved over the years — a more or less peaceful Asia, a big market for exports and a key partner on global problems, like climate change . If it was to become unhinged, it’s not just chaos in Asia but destabilizing for the global economy.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
