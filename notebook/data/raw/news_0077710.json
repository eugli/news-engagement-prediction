The team colors of black, grey, red and white remain the same, but the design used has also changed substantially. \n“I think the pedal box is the same, but all the rest is very different from last year’s car,” said team principal Guenther Steiner. “You always try to make a faster car, which is normally a lighter car. Now we can put on more ballast and get better weight distribution. The aero is completely new, as are the tires, so we needed to have some built-in adjustability. \n“Aesthetically, the car has a more aggressive look. It’s lighter and more aerodynamically efficient. Everything we learned from our first car has been applied to our new car.” Photo: Haas F1 Team ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:38:46.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
