The House’s bill — if signed into law — would make the Hyde Amendment permanent.\n“It’s a reflection of the lack of respect for women that we saw in the campaign on the part of the candidate for president,” Pelosi said.\nPelosi again thanked the participant for “prayerfully” sharing her decision. She then cited a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, saying that “public sentiment is everything.”\n“The more the public knows about the choices that are made, the more families know about how those decisions affect them, the more they may weigh in and hold elected officials accountable,” she said.\nPelosi, a Catholic, also said she knows more about having babies than the pope. The Catholic Church and its head, Pope Francis, are staunchly opposed to abortion.\nShe also criticized Republicans for efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, arguing that cutting off access to the organization’s family planning services will result in more abortions.\nA recent Marist poll commissioned by the Knights of Columbus found that 59 percent of Americans support banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother’s life is at risk. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found similar results.\nAnother participant in the town hall told Pelosi that she was given up for adoption by her birth mother, and now she has the opportunity to “thrive and succeed” in life. She asked Pelosi if she thinks everyone should have that ability.\nPelosi replied that the participant’s birth mother chose adoption, “and we want other people to have that opportunity to choose as well.”\nShe added that she wants to work toward promoting education, health care and a clean environment for children.\n“Many of our friends who are so intent on when life begins — in their view — do not subscribe to that after the child is born to meet the needs of the children,” Pelosi said.\nShe added that she hopes the participant will “help us help all of these children to be able to thrive when their mothers make that choice to have them as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:18:48.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
