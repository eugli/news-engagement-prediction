(Supplied: Peter Murphy) \n\"The men were leaving the island [on Monday] when police located them,\" a police spokesman said. \n\"The quokka has not been located and it is unclear whether it was injured. Local authorities will lookout for the animal. \n\"The men have been evicted off the island.\" \nThe men are due to appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court next month. \nQuokkas are found in abundance on the island, and are a major part of its tourist attraction, along with pristine beaches and cycle paths. \nHowever the small marsupial is no longer common on the mainland. \nRottnest Island Authority chief executive Michelle Reynolds said in a statement the safety of quokkas and viability of the population was a priority for the authority. \n\"Rottnest is one of the last sanctuaries available in the world for this threatened species,\" she said. \nThe island got its name from Dutch explorers who dubbed it \"Rat's Nest\" after landing there in the late 1600s, because of the quokkas' rat-like tails. \nPrivate vehicles are not permitted on the island without a special license.
