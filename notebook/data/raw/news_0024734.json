Photo from United International Pictures \nAmerican actress-model Dakota Johnson donned a custom gown by world-famous Philippine-born fashion designer Monique Lhuillier in the “Fifty Shades Darker” film, distributor United International Pictures said on Wednesday. \nThe liquid satin sheath gown with draped neckline and cross back in a silver hue was worn by Johnson’s character, Anastasia Steel, during her grand entrance in the romantic thriller’s exclusive masquerade ball scene. \n“I am so delighted to partner with Universal Pictures’ Fifty Shades Darker to design for the character of Anastasia Steele… Like the Monique Lhuillier woman, Ana radiates confidence and femininity, and so the gown I imagined for this iconic scene encapsulates that modern sophistication,” Lhullier, daughter of Cebu jeweler Amparito, was quoted as saying. ADVERTISEMENT \nCostume director Shay Cunliffe described Johnson in Lhuillier’s gown as a “beautiful siren of simplicity.” \n“We sent Monique ideas and images that evoke old Hollywood, and she and her team took the inspiration from there—crafting this stunning confection. Ana’s cape itself was a challenge—each feather was sewn by hand—but I felt it would magnify Ana’s showstopping entrance at the ball, hearkening back to the 1930s screen sirens,” Cunliffe said. \n“Monique also beautifully resolved our need to create a gown which can effortlessly slip to the ground…another feat of engineering,” she added. \n“Fifty Shades Darker,” sequel to “Fifty Shades of Grey,” opens today, Feb. 8, in Philippine cinemas. It was rated R-18 by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board due to “prolonged and realistic depiction of sexual activity and aberrational sexual behavior; scenes involving bondage and dominance, sadism and masochism; nudity (breast, butt and pubic hair exposure) and strong and/or sexual language.” CDG \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:29:27.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
