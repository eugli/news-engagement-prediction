Sheldon ( Jim Parsons ) said that he was going to go as Albus Dumbledore ( Michael Gambon ) from Harry Potter . He mentioned it twice. But we never got to see the costume, since his friends all decided they weren't going to go to Comic-Con and presumably he isn't, either. \nIf he had mentioned Dumbledore once, it would have been a throwaway line. But he mentioned it twice. This breaks comedy's rule of three, where things that happen three times are funny and satisfying. Two is an awkward number that leaves an itchy sensation. There should have been three mentions of Dumbledore, and on the third reference we should have seen Sheldon in his Dumbledore costume. \nA sitcom as traditional as The Big Bang Theory should know this. \nIf you wanted to see Sheldon as Dumbledore and were disappointed that you didn't get to, TVGuide.com can scratch your itch. Sheldon's Dumbledore cosplay would look a little something like this: \nYour nightmares are welcome. \nThe Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays at 8/7c on CBS. \n(Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.) \nIllustration by Michael Caso", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:42:20.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
