Garrett Medenwald, Tennessee’s second-year strength and conditioning coach, is the man in charge of physically building the young Vols. Players describe him as a game-changer. Lew Evans says he brings a different intensity than other strength coaches he’s worked with in the past. Admiral Schofield credits Medenwald for changing his body, adding six inches to his wingspan through stretching alone. Barnes describes him as more of a program-changer. Medenwald’s role, and how he executes it, is as big as anyone’s in building an elite program. “I think he’s as invested as we are as coaches,” Barnes said. “We don’t look at him as a quote-unquote strength coach. He’s as a big of a part of this staff as anybody.” (Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

(Photo: Tennessee Athletics/UTsports.com) Medenwald, a Green Bay, Wis., native, is settling in at Tennessee in his second season on the job. He followed Barnes to Tennessee from Texas, where he had three years experience with the Longhorns as a graduate manager and graduate strength coach from 2012-15. Medenwald worked under longtime Texas strength coach Todd Wright, now an assistant coach and head of strength and conditioning for the Philadelphia 76ers, a role he took over in 2015. “I think I’ve had the best ever in Todd Wright,” Barnes said of his former strength coach. “The fact that Garrett learned under him, I don’t think there’s any doubt that Garrett, as he continues to grow and gets the experience that Todd had, to me I think he’s the best at what he does, too, because he cares about it. “He cares about the guys in every way that you can care about somebody. He’s concerned about them as people, he spends a lot of time with them.” When Medenwald talks about settling in at Tennessee, he talks about creating the best possible environment to set his players up for the best possible success — developing them physically, mentally, emotionally. “The biggest thing for them is the mentality and understanding what the mindset has to be at this level to even win,” Medenwald told GoVols247 last month. “To win (at the collegiate level), it’s hard, but if you create a mindset and give them the ability to succeed, (it's) with the mindset of’‘How am I going to get better today?’ “(Understanding) what it takes to win — the details, the accountability, the intensity it takes to win at this level — gives them the chance to succeed at this level.” That question — How am I going to get better today? — drives Medenwald when he’s punching the time clock before 6 a.m. “You get your mind ready for the day, in terms of what you need to accomplish,” he said, “then with the team as well. Learning from different experiences, where we’re trying to go as a team.” Helping create that environment for success, Medenwald now has a renovated and expanded Pratt Pavilion weight room at his disposal. The weight room was increased from 1,325 square feet to 4,350 over the summer, including a full-court length stretch of synthetic turf. “The key is creating a great environment for them to be better,” he said. Creation was key as soon as Barnes and Medenwald got their eyes on the existing weight room. “The first time I came here to Tennessee and saw the facilities, coach and I were on the same page,” Medenwald said. “We really wanted to increase the size of the weight room, the functionality to create an environment for guys to train. He was incredible with it.” Barnes went to athletic director Dave Hart with a vision and architectural plans already drawn up in his head. Knock down a wall, taking square footage away from an oversized lobby, and make more room for the Vols to get better. As for what was needed to fill the extra square footage, Barnes put his trust in his strength coach. “Coach and I have great collaboration, a great relationship,” Medenwald said. “We were able to talk through all that stuff. The greatest thing about coach, he has a lot of faith in his staff to create the right environment.” (Photo: Tennessee Athletics/UTsports.com) Additions to the weight room include a custom rubber floor, a 40-foot, steel-reinforced throwing wall, six Keiser Functional Trainers, four TRUEStretch Cages, three custom, 10-foot Power Lift pulley units, seven sets of 90-pound PowerBlocks and a zoned, high-powered stereo system. The 10-foot Power Lift pulley units, typically not made in 10-foot units, are designed with taller athletes in mind. “The way it turned out,” Medenwald said, “with different units we have in there and the different abilities we have to train specifically for basketball, the guys have fun training in there. And that’s the most important thing.” Medenwald isn’t your stereotypical strength coach. Instead of focusing on the traditional heavy lifts — like bench press or squat — he focuses on basketball-motion lifts and training. “When you look at the game of basketball, there are different jump patterns,\" Medenwald said, \"different squat patterns, different reaching patterns.\" A different challenge for Medenwald in his second year has been adjusting to such a young roster. Tennessee has just two seniors of roster, to go with nine scholarship underclassmen. “It’s usually a pretty big eye-opener for them,\" Medenwald said of Tennessee’s freshmen, \"because of the rigors that come with it, the stresses they go through, how long the season is.” Time has helped speed up the adaptation process, though. Those players that worked with Medenwald last season bring the others along, the same way he helped bring them along. “The best thing about it is we have a great group of guys,” Medenwald said. “Everybody helps everyone else out. When you come in as a freshman, everyone has each other’s back, so they tell them this is what to expect, this is what we expect of you.” “Being in Year 2, that’s a big piece,” he added, “where guys can help each other and grow as a team from that standpoint, to help the young guys have success.” That’s Medenwald’s overriding goal. Develop Tennessee’s basketball players both personally and physically while helping Barnes build his program. “The biggest thing is, obviously, you want to echo what coach is getting across,” Medenwald said. What Barnes gets across when discussing Medenwald is the relationship he builds with Tennessee’s players, not just their bodies. “We have a culture that I like to think our players know we want to affect their lives,” Barnes said. “It's not just with what he does for their bodies. But he’s with them, helping them mentally grow and he challenges them in every way he can. “They know they have a friend there that, if they need something, like all of us, is going to be there. We put that (strength coach) position as important as any position on our staff.” (Photo: Tennessee Athletics/UTsports.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:56:53.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
