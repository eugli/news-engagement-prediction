READ MORE: 'Edward Zuma is a little piece of vomit' - Mathews Phosa \nAll this comes from knowing Freddie as he was known of him not having a backbone during his struggle years‚ the less said the better for all citizens‚ the man fails or does not want to accept the fact that branches of the ANC rejected him in 2012 Mangaung conference hence his behavior it's nothing else but anger and hatred. \nThis behavior all comes from the fact that he has eaten too much and still wants to eat more (at least the language they use when drinking expensive whiskeys)‚ so the leadership that is on the driving seat isn't giving him any joy of getting what he wants when he wants it as he was doing during his tenure as the ANC Treasurer General. \nHe wants to service his long time master (Johann Rupert ) who he presented with farms in the province of Mpumalanga when again he was at the helm which turned out to be a disastrous tenure under Mathews Phosa‚ so now he is again trying to climb the ladder using the back door of painting leadership badly and satisfying his makers who are seated comfortably in Stellenbosch‚ South Africa. \nMathews Phosa is against radical economic transformation in this country and we all know that hence all this noise he is making at some point he would talk like a person who just fell from a tree. \nWhat Phosa must know and accept is that this wave he is against will never be defeated by white monopoly capital defenders in and outside of government/ANC‚ Phosa being one of the players of that team as there are far older players on the team he plays for with more brutal hearts in exploiting the poor of this country. \nHe is the last to say that he doesn't want to be part of the burial of the ANC‚ as I would ask what measures has he attempted to take as a disciplined cadre if he still is unless he is part of those that discuss ANC matters in restaurants which I think he is‚ clearly he knows something we don't know because what we know is that the ANC isn't dead‚ but rather has internal challenges which I am confident the leadership in place is more than capable to deal with and I doubt they would even consider Phosa as one of those that would assist in attending to those challenges‚ so he must shoosh and enjoy his ill gotten wealth. \nFor the past 3/4 years he has been working with the father-in-law of a certain CEO in one of the big cellular networks in this country‚ by employing him at Morvest. In return Phosa is getting all the contracts from this cellular network company and here today he wants to preach good governance and rule by the will of the people when he failed given a number of chances even though he fought with leadership at all times. \nMr Phosa‚ anger or not‚ insults or praises you are a traitor and you need to be told because money has come into your head and you think you are everything‚ well no we shall deal with you in a way you deserve to be dealt with you are not the ANC nor am I but the members are the decision makers here‚ so if you have an interests ANC members will decide without being lied to by people like you who are hellbent to sell the ANC to the highest bidder (the Ruperts‚ Wieses etc) 3 issues he must explain: \n1. Malelane Community Farms & how he betrayed them with his company with Johan Rupert. Transvaal Sugar Board (TSB) \n2. The corruption with his wife at SABC over the procurement of content. Refer to the SIU report \n3. How he tried to collapse Chancellor House‚ so he could asset strip it for his benefit. \nI am yet to hear you call on all banks to be probed and harshly dealt with but again I remembered that you can't speak against them as they buy you bread and milk your masters remember. \nAllow the current ANC leadership to rule you Mathews Phosa difficult as it may feel or sound to you accept it maneer. \nAnd those those that think I engage on political issues because I am a Zuma then think again‚ I am an active member of the ANC and am not a member of Jacob Zuma nor does he influence my views fact to those. \nIssued by Edward Zuma in my personal capacity \nThis piece has not been edited.
