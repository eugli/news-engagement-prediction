Dust was roaming the streets without his mother, according to the shelter's Facebook post , weighing a measly 1.8 kilograms (3.96 pounds). \nAfter a bit of TLC, Dust has become quite the curious and affectionate koala, giving its carer little sniffs and kisses. \nImage: facebook/port stephens koalas \n\"Because he's still growing, he will now be on formula until he's around 2.5 [kilograms] at which point he will be released,\" the rescue service explained on Facebook when he was first found. \n\"As he is totally wild, he will be treated with minimum contact and as you can see from his epic cuteness, this will be a tough but essential job.\" \nDust is named after an album by Australian band Midnight Oil called Diesel and Dust. In fact, there's another koala in care that's named Diesel. \nDust is now weaned and will go to rehabilitation to become independent before being released into the wild. You can watch the video of Dust getting petted below. Of course you want to.
