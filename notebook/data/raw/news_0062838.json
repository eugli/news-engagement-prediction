If you'd like to learn more... - \nWinter is not quite over yet in Metro Vancouver. \nSnow was falling again in a number of areas overnight and during the early hours of Friday. \nIt is sticking in some places, such as New Westminster, Surrey, Langley, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam. \nHigher elevations will see more snow than areas near sea level but accumulations will still be minimal. Snowing this morning in Langley ❄️❄️. @GlobalBC pic.twitter.com/hEDERejvLG \n— Ted Field (@tedfieldglobal) February 24, 2017 Just a light dusting of snow in @CityofPoCo this morn.

Vancouver has had 63 centimetres. \nBut Abbotsford is the winner right now with about 108 centimetres in total. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
