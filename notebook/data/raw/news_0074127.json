Having an emotional reaction \nMs McGregor said the transference point when a psychologist started having an emotional reaction to an inmate could start innocuously. \nIt could be the accepting of a gift that their client has made for them, for example, which psychologists are told is not allowed. \n\"You can imagine how someone might feel really badly and think, 'maybe I need to accept this gift', and that's where it can start,\" Ms McGregor said.

(ABC North Coast: Samantha Turnbull) \nShe said forensic psychologists were trained to identify if things were starting to go wrong in the therapeutic relationship. \n\"Asking yourself: 'Am I doing self disclosure? Am I finding it difficult to stay in my professional role? Am I providing a different level of quality of service to this particular client or am I having some personal difficulty affecting my objectivity?'.\" \nFrom the inmate's perspective, Ms McGregor said the client often \"feels grateful\" towards their therapist which they might confuse with attraction. \n\"We're trained to manage our client's reaction to us,\" she said. \n\"Sometimes they can feel disappointed and rejected, but ... we're trying to teach them how to have emotionally mature relationships. \n\"The unfortunate outcome for forensic clients is that because they have such complex issues with trust, they have trouble trusting any form of health intervention.\" Managing their role \nMs McGregor said forensic psychologists were also taught to regularly reflect and be introspective to make sure they were staying as objective as possible, although she acknowledged \"it was hard\".

(AAP: Paul Miller) \nJust as important though was having a good system of supervision. \nMs McGregor said the ideal but \"economically unfeasible\" setup would be to have a second psychologist in the room during prison therapy sessions. \n\"A lot of the sex offender or violent offender group programs are moving to single facilitator from co-facilitator models. I don't agree with that,\" she said. \n\"One of the benefits of a co-facilitator is you can call on your co-facilitator if they're being too easy or treating one client differently to the others.\" \nThe Psychology Board of Australia is responsible for investigating, rehabilitating and deregistering psychologists if an ethical breach has occurred.
