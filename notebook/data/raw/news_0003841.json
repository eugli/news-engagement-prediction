He feared for his safety and acted.\" \nGasser is being held on $750,000 bond. The charge carries a mandatory life sentence if convicted. Ex-Jets RB Joe McKnight was shot and killed in a December road rage incident in a New Orleans suburb.

Sports Stars Gone Too Soon \nWhen asked Thursday by the AP if McKnight had reached into Gasser's car, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand passed the decision to release details to the DA in the case. \n\"I'm not here to compromise our case and I'm not here to argue our case,\" Normand told the AP. \"The district attorney ... alone will decide when he wants to reveal certain aspects of this case.\" \nFollow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. \"Like\" us here. \nMcKnight, 28, was a fourth round pick by the Jets in the 2010 NFL Draft after three seasons at USC.
