The app drawer will take its rightful place at the center location on the dock, which had previously been taken up by a permanent shortcut for the LeEco Live app. \nAlong with the app drawer, the update will bring improvements to the camera, with the Le S3 getting better low-light performance, while the Le Pro3 gets improvements to HDR. The update should be rolling out to devices over the course of the next few days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:13:50.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
