Credit Dongik Lee/William Rawn Associates Tanglewood is planning its largest construction project in decades. The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced Tuesday evening that it planned to spend $30 million on a new four-building complex at its summer home in the Berkshires — and to plant more shade trees on its lawn. The orchestra aims to build a flexible theater space with a retractable glass wall than can hold 200 to 300 people for concerts and lectures; a new cafe; and two small rehearsal studios. The project — which will be Tanglewood’s biggest since Ozawa Hall , with 1,200 seats, opened in 1994 — is expected to break ground after this summer’s festival and to open in 2019. Mark Volpe, the orchestra’s managing director, said that the new buildings were needed to better accommodate students at the Tanglewood Music Center, its prestigious summer music academy, and to allow the orchestra to create a new Tanglewood Learning Institute, allowing for an expansion of its increasingly popular lecture and adult education programs. The orchestra has already raised the $32 million it anticipates will be needed to build the complex, Mr. Volpe said, but was still raising money to endow its programming. The new buildings, which will be Tanglewood’s first year-round structures with heating and air conditioning, will be designed by William Rawn Associates, the architects of Ozawa Hall. The orchestra planned to present the project to officials in the surrounding communities of Stockbridge and Lenox, Mass., this week. The project also calls for an extensive upgrade of Tanglewood’s grounds, from modernizing its lawn irrigation system to planting about 144 new trees. “When you see pictures of Tanglewood 30 years ago, you see thousands of people sunning themselves on the lawn,” Mr. Volpe said. “Now when we open, you see hundreds of people running — not for the open space, but for the shade trees. The dermatologists have won.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:16:29.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
