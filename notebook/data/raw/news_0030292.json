Here are our picks for best dressed. 1. Adele \nDitching her usual all-black fashions, Adele turned heads in a gorgeous green Givenchy gown. She looked stunning and shined in the Swarovski crystal-embroidered design. \nThe queen wears green. (Photo: Frazer Harrison, Getty Images) 2. Jennifer Lopez \nGorgeous, sexy, and for some reason, makes us ready for Easter. This Ralph and Russo stunner is classic J.Lo. \nA lavender delight. (Photo: Lester Cohen, WireImage) 3. Rihanna \nBest dressed? YES. Because this is exactly what we want to see from a performer like Rihanna who owns her personal style. She's killing it in this custom Armani Priv√© ensemble. The best part? How the top is cut to show off her tattoo. \nGrammys look done just right. (Photo: Frazer Harrison, Getty Images) 4. Heidi Klum \nOn anyone else, this would just be a sparkly t-shirt, but Klum makes this simple Philipp Plein look sizzle. \nThe girl does not age. (Photo: Lester Cohen, WireImage) 5. Chrissy Teigen \nIt's dark and dramatic, and a little bit goth -- an edgy look that's perfect for the Grammys. \nA sharp look for Teigen.
