Editor Advertisement \nAnother new sets of findings released by the Public Transport Council survey shows that commuters are more satisfied private hire car services than that of taxis. A poll of over 1,500 respondents found that private-hire services, such as Uber and Grab, were given a satisfaction mean score of 7.9 out of 10, while taxis registered a lower score of 7.5. \nThe Private hire car services scored better than the taxis at all categories. Time for the taxi industry to buck up? First complains that they are operating in an unfair industry, as taxi drivers need to have a taxi licence. Now, new rules also dictate the Private hire car drivers need to be licenced, so playing field level. No more complaints about not being fair. Then, can the taxi drivers buck-up? Commuters already saying their service level is not as good as the private hire drivers. \nIf they want to make a living out of driving taxis, then the taxi drivers and the taxi companies better do something about it. \nAshley Lee \nA.S.S.
