In an extraordinary news conference , Mr. Trump denounced CNN as an organ of “anger and hatred” and accused Mr. Zucker directly of “bias.” \n  In an era of hostility and suspicion toward the news media, perhaps no battle is more pitched than that between Mr. Trump and CNN. The president has shouted down the network’s correspondents, posted insults at its anchors in real time on Twitter and turned anti-CNN epithets into a rallying cry, electrifying the crowd on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference by slamming the “Clinton News Network. ” Later, CNN’s White House reporter was one of several journalists barred from attending a briefing with Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean M. Spicer, a move that the network called retaliatory and that the anchor Jake Tapper, in an on-air monologue , deemed “un-American.” The old CNN may have shied? away from conflict; the new CNN is leaning into it. Once the down-the-middle nerd of the cable news playground, CNN — under the guidance of Mr. Zucker, a former sports and morning show producer with a yen for flood-the-zone programming — is now an elbows-out player in national politics, vociferously pledging to hold a truth-averse White House to account. It’s a quarrel fueled in part by the yearslong, up-and-down relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zucker, two outspoken television addicts who once enjoyed a rapport. They have known each other since the early 2000s, when Mr. Zucker put Mr. Trump in prime time as host of the NBC show “The Apprentice,” and both share an obsession with ratings and a love of spectacle. Once in frequent touch, the men have not spoken to each other since December — “not a good conversation,” by Mr. Zucker’s description — and the dispute has bled beyond questions of coverage into the realm of corporate intrigue. Time Warner, CNN’s parent company, is preparing for a takeover by AT&T that requires approval from Mr. Trump’s Justice Department. Television news is a cynical business, and some current and former executives say the battle is win-win. Mr. Trump’s lambasting of CNN is red meat for a Republican base angry at the mainstream press. “ Saturday Night Live ” portrayed the network as a diaper-wearing reporter banished to a cage in the White House press room. CNN has seen ratings rise as its reporters land big scoops — including major stories about Russia and the Trump campaign — and the network promotes its tough-minded attitude. Mr. Tapper’s skeptical interview with the White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for instance, went viral. Still, Mr. Zucker, who declined a one-on-one interview for this article, was concerned enough to commission a study of how Mr. Trump’s attacks had affected CNN’s reputation. (He said the study had reaffirmed the network’s credibility.) \n  And the network chief finds himself in the unusual position of being castigated by Trump loyalists, just months after some Democrats and Republicans attacked him for enabling Mr. Trump’s rise. At a forum at Harvard in December, Mr. Zucker was jeered for airing Trump rallies unedited and hiring the candidate’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as a commentator. Both supporters and detractors of Mr. Zucker say he can handle — and even relishes — a harsh spotlight. A wunderkind who ran the “Today” show at 26 and rose to become chief executive of NBC Universal, Mr. Zucker has weathered professional and personal setbacks, landing his job at CNN after being conspicuously ousted from NBC and beating back cancer twice.

Cox/Getty Images “One of the keys to his success,” said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News, “is he’s got an almost eerie self-confidence, that allows him to float an inch above the pavement at all times.” Mr. Zucker is coming off a record year at CNN, which rode the presidential campaign to its biggest ever audience. But MSNBC, which fell behind CNN last year, is now attracting more viewers in prime time. (CNN counters that it beats MSNBC among viewers ages 25 to 54, the basis for advertising rates.) Inside CNN’s Manhattan newsroom, journalists say the presidential glare has both rattled and energized them, even as the Trump administration withholds top officials from its airwaves.
