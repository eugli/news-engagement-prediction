There are magic bits around us, you just have to look for them.\" SHARE Middle Kids (left to right) Tim Fitz, Hannah Joy and Harry Day. Photo: Maclay Heriot \nJoy shares the house with her husband and bandmate, Tim Fitz, the group's 27-year-old multi-instrumentalist and producer, while 23-year-old drummer Harry Day lives a few minutes away. If inspiration strikes they can assemble quickly, although in the coming weeks they're more likely to be found in Chicago than Chatswood. \nThe band, with an extra guitarist for the live shows, arrived in America last week and went straight into millions of homes via Conan , Conan O'Brien's network talk show, where they performed Edge of Town , the melancholic then meteoric single that's become their calling card. A further 30 gigs await, including support slots with American outfit Cold War Kids and headline shows at the influential South by Southwest music conference in Austin, Texas. SHARE Link The band just released their first EP. \nEdge of Town now has three million plays and counting on the streaming service Spotify and, as far as Joy is concerned, the cream on top is that Elton John has declared he's a huge fan of the song, placed it on his Apple Music playlist and played it on the Beats 1 radio show. \n\"When I was young Elton was a huge influence, because he helped guide me out of the classical world,\" says Joy, who grew up playing classical piano and went on to study composition before she slipped into a solo career as a singer-songwriter several years ago. In 2015 she met Fitz, a fellow solo artist, who became in turn her producer, bandmate and husband. Advertisement \nWith Day on board, Middle Kids took shape 12 months ago. Edge of Town was uploaded to Triple J's Unearthed website on May 1 last year, and interest started building almost immediately, here and abroad. International opportunities that once took years of hard work to generate, complete with countless journeys up and down the Hume Highway gigging, are now available to Australian acts almost as soon as they form. \n\"Things have happened so quickly that it's just like, 'This is happening, this is happening, this is happening.' And we're just like, 'Okay, okay, okay',\" says Joy. \"We're focused on what the music needs and what we want to create, but we know that we have a lot of amazing opportunities and we're just going to try and take each of them.\" \nRecord labels in the US and UK, corporate and independent, now closely monitor Australian barometers, whether it's Triple J's playlists or Spotify's streaming figures. Two great songs – which Middle Kids had with Edge of Town and the punchy, Pretenders-like jangle of Your Love – are enough to turn curiosity into commercial reality. \nIn August last year, before they'd made any decisions in Australia, the band was playing showcase gigs in New York and Los Angeles to prospective labels. The business mechanics of what followed was handled by the band's Australian legal representationand their manager, Kurt Bailey, who is now based in New York and also looks after another Sydney success story, Gang of Youths. For Joy, the contract wrangling was a surprisingly stress-free initiation. \n\"We have had such a great experience in that world,\" she says. \"You don't know what to expect, but I was surprised – possibly because of the people we were talking to – that it was an awesome process. We feel lucky that the people we wanted to work with wanted to work with us.\" \nAnd there were a few perks involved. \"We frickin' loved the fancy meals!\" \nMiddle Kids are now signed to the US arm of British independent label Domino (Animal Collective, Blood Orange) for North America, and EMI Music in Australia and New Zealand. Their American booking agents got them on the Cold War Kids tour, while locally they've picked up the support slot with Ryan Adams on his May Australian tour. \n\"It's getting pretty hectic,\" says Joy – and all without a major release to their name. It was only last Friday their self-titled debut EP came out with six tracks, including Edge of Town , that spotlight their rough-hewn hooks, self-produced studio idiosyncrasies, and tangle of emotional peaks and troughs. \n\"The songs are super-angsty in the sense that everything is up and down, but it's also beautiful that as people we're changing all the time,\" says Joy. \"I see that so much more now that we're married – Tim is obviously not the same person all the time.\" \nGrowing up, Joy thought her musical career would be as a classical composer, but now she finds herself fronting a rock band. The transition is still underway – she wrote Edge of Town on a keyboard, but when it wasn't working during an early jam session Fitz suggested she pick up a guitar. She hasn't put it down since. \n\"When we got the song to where it is now, that definitely felt like a special moment,\" says Joy. \"We could feel that the song had something. What we didn't know was it would be special to other people.\" \nAfter a first year that's far exceeded any reasonable expectations, Middle Kids have a path plotted out that will take them towards their debut album and beyond. The songs from that red brick house in Chatswood are spreading around the world and becoming part of listeners' lives. \n\"To me that's awesome,\" says Joy. \"Music is so much bigger than any one individual. It's bigger than all of us.\" \nThe Middle Kids play Oxford Art Factory, Sydney, April 21 (sold out) and 24; Northcote Social Club, Melbourne, April 14 (sold out) and 19. \nThe six tracks include Edge of Town, which brought them international fame. MAKING WAVES \nMiddle Kids are by no means the only new Australian music act making waves internationally. Here are three more getting a serious boost on their frequent flier points. \nALEX LAHEY The Melbourne singer-songwriter, who shot to Triple J prominence with the singles Let's Go Out and You Don't Think You Like People Like Me , recently signed an international record deal with the independent label Dead Oceans (Mitski, Julianna Barwick) and has been opening for Tegan and Sara on their British tour this month before starting work on her debut album. \nMETHYL ETHEL With a radically different second album due next month and the sleek grooves of Everything is Forgotten , the Perth trio are about to start a two-month tour of North America and Europe. They're building on the profile created by their 2015 debut, Oh Inhuman Spectacle , seized upon by the revered British label 4AD (Pixies, Grimes). \nTASH SULTANA The 21-year-old solo multi-instrumentalist, who creates a heady sound with guitars, loop pedals and her yearning voice, finishes an American tour with a sold out Seattle show tomorrow. While for now she's self-releasing her music digitally overseas, come our winter the one-time Melbourne busker will be playing the vast European summer music festival circuit.
