Creative RF/Westend61/GettyImages By Hanah Tetro Updated March 16, 2016 . \nMost people think of facials as an indulgence instead of as a necessity. I want you to stop thinking of facials as a treat and instead see them as an indispensable part of your skin care routine. Just like you visit the dentist on a regular basis in order to have healthy teeth and gums you need to see an esthetician for routine facials in order to have beautiful and healthy skin. Regular professional maintenance is key to keeping both your body and your skin healthy. Here are all the reasons and benefits of getting regular facials. Why Routine Facials Are So Important \nHaving the right home skin care routine is essential to maintaining great looking skin but even using the right products on a daily basis is not always enough. That's exactly when getting facials on a regular basis comes into play. Facials do many wonderful things for your skin depending on what your skin needs. For instance if you suffer from acne and blackheads facials will help keep your skin blemish and bump free. This is because estheticians can safely perform extractions during a facial while getting rid of blackheads and popping pimples at home can leave your skin red, irritated, and in the worse case scenario - scarred. Simply put - not everything that your skin needs on a regular basis to look and feel its best can be done at home. There is a real need for professional help on a monthly basis to keep your skin in tip top shape. \nSeeing your esthetician in person is also helpful in order to ensure that you are not only using the right skin care products at home but also using those products correctly which makes all the difference in how our skin responds to a product. Our skin needs change according to the seasons, our health, and our lifestyle choices. When you establish an ongoing and personal relationship with an esthetician you can be sure that your home skin care needs are definitely being met. What Makes Professional Facials Different From Home Care Routines \nEstheticians use professional grade products during a facial that you cannot use and should not use at home. For example the exfoliation products used during a facial are stronger than what you can purchase for home use. Not only are the products used by estheticians during a facial stronger than what can be sold for home use, estheticians are also trained to know how to use these products so that no harm comes to the client. \nWhile using a moisturizer daily or even a hydrating serum or mask are essential for healthy skin, even for people with oily skin, a facial can give you a real boost when it comes to having well moisturized skin. If your skin is not properly hydrated it cannot do all its jobs properly including protecting the rest of your body from water loss and infections. When skin becomes dry or dehydrated tiny cracks can appear in your epidermis which can lead to bacteria entering your skin or water leaving your skin. Once again, during a facial estheticians have a great number of hydrating products to choose from that will help revive your skin and leave it soft and smooth. \nThough you can massage your face at home (and you should) nothing compares to having someone else give you a relaxing massage. This is an essential part of of any facials that has numerous benefits both for your skin and for your overall health. Massage gets blood flowing to your face, helps you to destress and relax, and can help move lymph around the body and get rid of facial puffiness. Facials Are Preventative \nGetting regular facials is like taking out an anti-aging insurance policy on your face. Of course, no facial is going to make you look 20 years younger or even 10 years younger, but getting regular anti-aging facials will definitely ensure that you will look younger than your age. Once again, estheticians have products and ingredients to use during facials that you will not be able to purchase for regular home use that will have definite anti-aging benefits for your skin such as revealing new, healthy skin cells and helping to promote collagen synthesis. Also the facial massage performed during a facial will help protect your skin from premature aging. \nMost of us lead busy stressful lives so taking the time to get a facial, to relax and rejuvenate helps our bodies and minds stay healthy and relaxed. Stress is terrible for our health and for our skin . Taking some time for yourself, on a monthly basis perhaps, will make sure that not only does your skin stay smooth, blemish free, younger looking, and well hydrated but that you stay healthy overall as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:44.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
