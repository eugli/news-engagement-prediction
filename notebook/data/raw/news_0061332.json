Literal middle school survival essentials, along with a Trapper Keeper, a Caboodle, and my Mariah Carey CD. And while I matured into more refined scents like Sweet Pea and Sun Ripened Raspberry, the love I had for the crisp yet cloying cucumber scent always remained as a fond memory of my literal salad days—that is, until now. Bath & Body Works has managed to revive my enthusiasm for cucumber body products with their latest collection. The brand just released a whole new collection of signature body care products, and that includes an entire cucumber range. The Bath & Body Works CocoShea Cucumber line has a hydrating lotion, mist, body butter, body scrub, and body wash, which all basically smell just like the classic cucumber melon scent—minus the melon. Think of them as the grown-up version of Cucumber Melon , less suited for middle school dances, more suited to margaritas and tacos. Besides cucumber, the new body care collection also has a rich coconut line and a nourishing honey line. Each of the products start with a base of decadent cocoa and shea butters, along with specialized ingredients like revitalizing cucumber water or coconut oil or honey. Being that we still have a few more weeks of winter to endure, these ultra moisturizing products seriously could not have dropped at a better time. Best, of all each and every one of these finds is under $17 bucks, which fits both your late '90s budget and your 2017 one, too.
