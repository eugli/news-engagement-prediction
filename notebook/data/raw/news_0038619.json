David Cicilline (D-R.I.) addressed the House floor Thursday morning to address the current state of Trump's presidency thus far, using a metaphor we can all relate to: Stranger Things . \n\"Like the main characters in Stranger Things we are now stuck in the Upside Down,\" Cicilline says. \"Right is wrong, up is down, black is white.\" Trump Things via @davidcicilline urges members \"escape from our own version of the upside down.\" #StrangerThings pic.twitter.com/1w1xH0myEN — Hugh Thomas (@HughTFerguson) February 16, 2017 \nVideo of Cicilline's one-minute speech was caught on C-SPAN, where the congressman called out Trump's \"praise on a thug like Vladimir Putin ,\" railed against Trump's executive orders like the travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, and criticized the administration's ignorance of the Flint water crisis. \nCicilline even went so far as to make his own Stranger Things title, reading \"Trump Things,\" probably using this neat online font generator . . @davidcicilline bringing the House into the upside down pic.twitter.com/cISVQ6rB0c — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) February 16, 2017 \n\"This is not a TV show.
