He urged to put an end to Germany’s culture of remembering Holocaust, calling for a significant change in the way the country sees its past, German media reported. \nHe described the well-known Holocaust Memorial in memory of to the murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin a “monument of the shame in the heart of the capital.” \nHe also compared the bombing of Dresden during the WWII to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to loud applause from the cheering crowd. According to Hoecke, bombings of German cities should have “rooted out our [German] roots.” \nInstead of bringing up the new generation with the great philanthropists, the world famous, groundbreaking philosophers, the musicians, the ingenious explorers and inventors, the German history is represented as “something rotten and ridiculous”, Hoecke said, according to Junge Freiheit. \nJosef Schuster, the chair of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said he was shocked by the statement, according to AP. \n“With these anti-Semitic and inhuman words, the AfD shows its true face,” he said. \n“I would not have dared to think that 70 years after the Shoah such remarks by a politician in Germany would be possible.” AfD is going full neo-Nazi.

We must never let this kind of demagoguery be undisputed,” Gabriel wrote on Facebook. \nHis comments also drew criticism from his own party. Frauke Petry, AfD chairwoman, was quick to distance herself from Hoecke’s statements, calling him “a burden to the party.” \n“It confirms what I said a year ago. Bjoern Hoecke has become a burden to the party with his self-activities,” Petry told Junge Freiheit. once again #dresden seems to be germany's biggest open air psychiatry.. why? nazi psycho #Höcke #DD1701 #AFD \nSimone Peter, Green party leader, has described Hoecke’s statements as “unspeakable” . \n“The AfD must unmistakably distance themselves from this and apologize to our Jewish friends,” she said. \nFollowing the outcry, Hoecke issued a statement, stressing that the idea of him criticizing the Holocaust memorial or German history was “a malicious and deliberately denigratory interpretation of what I actually said.” German #AFD politician, calls #Berlin #holocaust monument \"shame\".

He also added that Hoecke was inspired by a Constitutional Court ruling against a ban on the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) which had been rendered hours before his speech in Dresden. \nREAD MORE: German court rules far-right group ‘too insignificant’ to ban \nThis is not the first time AfD members have stirred controversy by seemingly speaking in favour of Germany’s Nazi legacy or downplaying the Holocaust.
