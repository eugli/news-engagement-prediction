Letting her statement gown do all the talking, the X Men: Apocalypse actress wore her long golden locks in tousled waves. Matching the sparkly feel of her dress, she framed her blue eyes with iridescent shadow and plumped her pout with a nude lipstick. Feeling the chill: Sophie's dress exposed more than a little skin Shine on! The Louis Vuitton dress made her every inch the female warrior Nailed it: The blonde beauty looked every inch the fierce warrior in the opulent gown, which featured a decadent silver skirt with racy thigh-splits Metallic goddess: Matching the sparkly feel of her dress, she framed her blue eyes with iridescent shadow Coquettish: The Northampton-born actress flicked a coy glance over her shoulder In great spirits: She beamed as she made her way across the carpet in her towering heels The BAFTAs, hosted by Stephen Fry, were broadcast on BBC One, with high hopes for Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's flick La La Land winning big after nabbing 11 nominations. Amy Adams' two films Nocturnal Animals and Arrival are the closest competitors with nine apiece, and she faceed her own battle in the category for Leading Actress for the latter, against Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep and Natalie Portman. But it's La La Land's high-commended stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling that headed up the Leading Actress and Leading Actor categories - with Emma scooping the win. Taking centre-stage: Cinching in her tiny waist thanks to a studded belt, the bodice had added drama thanks to studded detailing Disco diva: The Game Of Thrones star harked back to the swinging seventies with her sparkly outfit Stealing the limelight: The blonde beauty confidently strutted across the red carpet Killer accessories: Elongating her lean legs further, Sophie - who is dating Joe Jonas - rocked some black barely there heels and accessorised with diamond jewellery Owning the camera: Sophie rested a confident hand on her hip as she posed for the cameras The movie tells the story of Mia, [Stone] an aspiring actress, and Sebastian [Gosling], a dedicated jazz musician, struggling to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. Though La La Land continues to be the success story of awards season, Best Film nods also go to Arrival, I, Daniel Blake, Manchester By The Sea and Moonlight. I, Daniel Blake tells the story of a middle aged carpenter who requires state welfare after injuring himself is joined by a single mother in a similar scenario. Cheeky: She subtly flaunted her toned behind in the skintight creation Mane attraction: Letting her statement gown do all the talking, the X Men: Apocalypse actress wore her long golden locks in tousled waves Working her angles: The stunning actress showed off her lean legs in the revealing gown Just smile and wave boys: The statuesque star happily greeted the waiting crowds Manchester By The Sea is about an uncle is asked to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies and covers the relationship between them. While Manchester By The Sea receives more nods overall, I, Daniel Blake scooped the highest prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, the prestigious Palme d'Or. In the Leading Actor category, Ryan was beaten by Casey Affleck, among rivals Jake Gyllenhaal, Andrew Garfield and Viggo Mortensen.
