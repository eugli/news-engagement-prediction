This will include the Shelter Afrique, which is an arm of the African Union.” \nDonating a building to the school on behalf of those honoured, IGP Idris said that government could not do it alone. “Private individuals and corporate organisations must must give their widows might in order to augment governments efforts.” ‎ ‎Honoured along with the IGP were Dr. Mahe Dange; Mallam Muhammadu Zauro; former Director General of NIPS, Prof. Tijani Bande; Dr. Bello Aliyu; Dr. Ahmed Achida; Prof. Faruk Haruna and Alhaji Muhammadu Zagi. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:38:56.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
