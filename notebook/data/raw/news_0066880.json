Jadeja c Starc b O’Keefe 2(14) Load More Hello and welcome to India.com’s live coverage of India vs Australia 1st Test Day two at the Maharastra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. Australia will resume on an overnight score of 256 for nine with Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in the middle. Starc on day one smashed a valuable half-century that helped Australia gain back some momentum. Stay tuned as we bring you the live score updates. Preview by Sudipta Biswas : Before the start of the match, former Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne described the pitch at the MCA Stadium as the “eighth-day wicket”. His pre-match pitch inspection proved right as the Indian bowling attack dragged Australia to 256 for 9 from 82 for 0 at end of day one. But Mitchell Strac’s (57) pinch-hitting, down the order, helped Australia to add some crucial runs to their scoreboard. On day two India would like to bring the curtain down on Australian innings as soon as possible and will try to post a massive total on board to get first innings lead over the visitors. On the opening day, openers Matt Renshaw and David Warner gave Australia a nervy start as Ishant Sharma and Ashwin troubled them with the new ball. Warner, who was seen attacking Ashwin to outplay his turn, was exposed by Jayant Yadav who rattled his leg-stump. But the delivery was found illegal as Jayant overstepped.

The breakthrough opened the gates for India as spinners combined with Umesh to peg back Australia. Opener Renshaw was the only Australian batsman who looked fluent with his approach. However he had to ran away to the dressing room because of an upset stomach. In his absence, Indian spinners did the real damage. Shaun Marsh, who scored 104 in the warm-up match, was caught at the slip off the bowling of Ashwin. After Marsh’s dismissal, spinner Jadeja and Ashwin gave India two consecutive wickets. In the 60th over, left-arm spinner trapped Peter Handscomb (22) and while Australian captain Steve Smith (4) fell to Ashwin. Also Check- David Warner survives as Jayant Yadav bowls a no-ball.

He first trapped Matthew Wade (8) lbw, followed by a stunning catch by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha that sent back Steve O’keefe. Yadav’s fourth and final victim of the day was Nathan Lyon who was trapped lbw for zero. But, India’s wish to commence their innings on day one was obstructed by Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc as the southpaw’s pinch hitting down the order helped visitors add some crucial runs to the total. Starc, at the end of the day, scored unbeaten 57 off 58 balls. Now, on day two Indian bowlers will try to get rid of Starc as soon as possible to begin their innings.
