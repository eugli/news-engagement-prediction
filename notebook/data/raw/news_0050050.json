We also got a new Keurig. As far as work trips go, this is definitely a step up from sharing a room at the Courtyard by Marriott in Indianapolis with Shirley from Accounts Payable. On one hand, Courtyard by Marriott has free breakfast. On the other hand, Reese Witherspoon met a horse. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 11, 2017 at 1:01pm PST Shirley could never. The three actresses are in New Zealand filming their roles as Mrs. Who (Mindy), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese) and Mrs. Which (Oprah). Again, I just want to emphasize that I am available for this. Do you need someone to play Mrs. Where's the Buffett or Mrs. When is Payday? Just holler.

Leo is sitting up in his manse looking at these Instas and then glancing at his Oscar for The Revenant and doing some deep soul-searching. He had to crawl through the snow! He had to sleep in a bear! That's not glamorous. Meanwhile, Mindy Kaling is hot tubbing it in paradise. A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 17, 2017 at 10:41pm PST Advertisement - Continue Reading Below These Instas are entirely too much, to be honest. I'm actually confused about how work gets done. I trust Ava, obviously. If she decided to film a paper bag floating through the air, I'd watch it. I'd watch it, I'd cry and I feel more woke afterward. GIF Most Popular But I am really perplexed about when actual, like, movie-making is happening. There seems to be a lot of time spent jumping against a backdrop of blue skies: A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 14, 2017 at 2:22pm PST Now with more Reese: A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 16, 2017 at 11:12am PST Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And now with Oprah: A post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on Feb 16, 2017 at 7:19pm PST Oprah's jump is, by far, my favorite. Oprah's not trying to roll her ankle, y'all. Oprah's ankle is worth more than your life. Photographer: Jump up and down! Oprah: How about I just look fabulous? Photographer: No, jump! So that everyone can see how beautiful it is. Oprah: I'm going to raise my leg and people can use their imaginations, how about that? Honestly, I am so happy for all of them. Like, unreasonably happy. Like, you don't even know them why are your tearing up happy. We all just want the best for Mindy, Reese and Oprah. I think we can all agree those are the core values of America. And this filming experience looks like the best. A post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on Feb 15, 2017 at 12:27pm PST We want the best for them so much we'll excuse the fact that they have totally become that friend who needs you to see every sunset and cloudless sky from her vacation at every single possible angle. Like, we get it: beauty.

Reese, it seems, is no stranger to that chill, sun-dappled filming life. Currently absolutely killing it on the instantly addictive Big Little Lies , she posted a throwback of the cast this week in honor of the premiere. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 19, 2017 at 1:25pm PST Nothing to see here. Just a bunch of movie stars looking amazing on a blanket with some wine. Humpday, amiright? Is this from the series or just, like, lunch? Who knows! All I know is I want to go to there. This is too wonderful. I have to go catch a plane to New Zealand. Cash me outside, jumping on some cliffs until Ava gives me a walk-on role, how bout that? Follow R. Eric Thomas on Twitter .
