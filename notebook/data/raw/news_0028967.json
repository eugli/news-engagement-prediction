When everybody wore red and white on the day of love and I couldn’t wait to find out if I had a secret admirer. \nThat was the one day you could express your love and admiration for that special person, even if it was anonymously. \nOne of my favourite high school Valentine traditions was when a messenger would deliver your card, to your class through a student postal service. \nAt the end of the day giggling girls would get together to compare who received the most cards and the best gifts. Big cards were great but a teddy was even better. \nAs we get older we would like to pretend that that we don’t make such a fuss about the day but the teenager inside of us still looks forward to corny romantic gestures. \nHigh school sweethearts, blogger Jade Robertson ( justjadeblog ) and her partner Hishaam Abrahams’ Valentine’s Day have gone from sending fresh flowers to a chilled night out. The couple who have been together for 11 years. \nHow did you and Hishaam meet and was it love at first sight? \nJade Robertson (JR):We met at High school during my first year. It was Arbour day and I think that a few of the top students in each grade were invited to join the presentation in the Company Gardens. \nI recognised him because I had seen him at a party a few months before. We didn’t speak that day, I just happened to end up at the same High School as him. \nHishaam Abrahams (HA): t I remember a friend of mine telling me “oh look at that girl’s dimples”, and that’s when I noticed her. She always seems to bring up Arbour day... clearly that was when a seed of love was planted. \nWhat was your first date like? \nJR: We went swimming and a few of our friends tagged along. It was during a school holiday. Hishaam said he needed to see my toes before committing. \nHA: Because I needed to make sure that Jade didn’t have ugly toes, we went swimming. Thankfully she didn’t. \nHow do you keep the spark alive? \nJR: We’re friends before anything. To be able to have fun with each other. He makes me laugh every single day. \nHA: It’s so important to have fun and to be able to laugh together. And there’s eating and watching series together as well. \nWhat do you guys do for fun as a couple? \nJR: We love eating so we often have food dates. We'll always try and find new places to eat out. \nHA: We party quite often as well. I’m the party animal and Jade’s my wingman. She’s fun, so no matter what we’re doing, we have fun. \nDo you guys celebrate Valentine’s Day? \nJR: We used to when in school but we don’t anymore. \nHA: Jade stopped treating me special so I gave up. \nDid you have any Valentine’s Day traditions? \nJR: Hishaam, used to get me fresh flowers every year when I was in school. \nHA: I used to feel bad back in the day (like three years ago) if I did nothing for Valentine’s Day and rock up with some flowers. Now we are more of chilled. \nWhat is your most memorable Valentine’s Day? \nJR: I would say the first one. It was a week after we started dating. He came into my class with a rose and one of those mugs with the teddy bear inside. He kissed me on the cheek. It was so cute even though the mug broke in my school bag. \nHA: Yes, I do remember bringing her that teddy, a mug and rose. \nWhat are your plans for this special day? \nJR: I’m sure it will somehow involve food and wine. \nHA: To eat and to drink something is a possibility. \nWhat would you recommend as gifts? \nJR: I love flowers. Underwear is a great gift too. Valentine’s day should be more about time spent together. \nHA: You would have to choose what your partner likes. You can't go wrong with fresh flowers.
