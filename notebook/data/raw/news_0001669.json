Chelsea are 15 points ahead of Manchester Untied and nine clear of second-placed Tottenham Manchester United are 15 points behind leaders Chelsea ahead of Wednesday's game vs Hull Every team in the top four dropped points on Tuesday night. Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham drew while Arsenal suffered a shock defeat to Watford, giving Manchester United and City the chance to close the gap. With City facing a tricky away tie against West Ham, there is every chance Manchester United could leap over their local and into fifth. They must first beat relegation battlers Hull, however, and Herrera says Jose Mourinho's men have an obligation to collect three points in front of their own fans. Herrera says Manchester United have an 'obligation' to beat Hull at Old Trafford 'It is Hull at this moment and we have an obligation to win if we want to be in the top four. 'It is going to be tough. It always is. Every Premier League game is tough. But we are at home, we feel strong and good in front of our own fans and we want to win. 'I will say it again, no excuses, we want to be in the top four as soon as possible.'
