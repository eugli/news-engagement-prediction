HALF of Britons have a lucky number (so what’s yours?)\nMORE: Drunk milkman crashes truck into house and car causing £40,000 worth of damage\nIf accepted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the move would mean that our solar system would acquire 100 new planets – including Saturn’s moon Titan and Jupiter’s moons Europa and Ganymede.\nThe team says, ‘In the mind of the public, the word ‘planet’ carries a significance lacking in other words used to describe planetary bodies… many members of the public assume that alleged ‘non-planets’ cease to be interesting enough to warrant scientific exploration.’", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8U87HzmRlZZsVhSgrmc2Ag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAwO2g9NTAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/c14e1db725e4c2b8e8736d96e2a3f880"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:46.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
