Instead they are asked to call 306-777-6500 and officers will come pick them up.\nCharges for unauthorized possession will not be pursued.\nBray said that could lead to owners who don't have registered guns to register them legally.\n\"Our goal is to enhance responsible ownership, storage and safety and to take unwanted guns off the streets.\"\nGuns will be checked by police to see if they are involved in ongoing investigations. If that is the case, police will follow up.\nThe guns will then be destroyed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:20:19.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
