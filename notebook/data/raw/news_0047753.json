It is not in the interests of our democracy and the governance of the country to do so.\n\"We cannot be leaving the EU in 2017, and remaining in it in 2018, and leaving it again in 2019 and by 2020 to be too confused about what we are doing.\nFormer Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs William Hague Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images 9:59AM Peers debate Article 50 Bill G ood Morning, \nThe House of Lords will conclude the first stage of a crucial Brexit debate tonight after Theresa May ramped up pressure on them not to block or delay Britain's exit from the European Union.\nIn a highly unusual move on Monday, the Prime Minister sat on the steps in front of the Royal Throne in the Upper Chamber as Lords Leader Baroness Evans of Bowes urged peers not to frustrate the passage of the Brexit Bill.\nAs many as 110 peers are due to debate the Bill today in a sitting running late into the evening.\nPeers are likely to vote on the contentious amendments such as giving EU nationals a legal right to remain in the UK after Brexit next week.\nThe Bill is expected to complete its passage through the Lords by Tuesday March 7 but if peers have made amendments, it will return to the Commons, where MPs will debate whether to keep the changes or get rid of them.\nThis procedure, known as \"ping-pong\", would see the Bill repeatedly move between the Commons and the Lords until an agreement is reached on the final text.\nLabour's leader in the Lords Baroness Smith said her party will seek to amend the legislation but said there would be no extended wrangling between the Chambers..\nThis virtually guarantees UK triggering Article 50 by the end of March because dates for this Parliamentary \"ping pong\" have been set for March 13 and March 14.\nRoad to Brexit | Article 50 and the House of Lords", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:29:53.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
