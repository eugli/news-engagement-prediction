So Mr. Guzman obtained a G.E.D., and later landed jobs with the city’s Housing Authority and Family Court in the Bronx. The two friends gravitated to the Nation of Gods and Earths, a black cultural movement founded in Harlem in the 1960s. Mr. Torres took the spiritual name Divine, while Mr. Guzman became C-Truth. Mr. Guzman infused his songwriting with references to black history and to the more recent struggle of young black men with the authorities. In his bedroom, he kept a picture of Trayvon Martin tucked in a mirror and texts like the military treatise “ The Art of War ” on a small shelf. He posted photos of himself on Facebook wearing shirts emblazoned with the slogan “Police Murder People.” A video tribute to Rafael Guzman. A song of his can be heard at the 54-second mark. Video by IN THE KLUB TV While Mr. Torres worked on his record deal, Mr. Guzman performed at events and clubs across the Northeast region with friends in collectives like the Courtlandt Cartel, Poor Family and Spartanz MC . He had talent, said one of his collaborators, William Bonds, who performs as RocStarrJim. “His flow was hard and spiritual,” Mr. Bonds said. “It was beautiful.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As his friends peeled off to the suburbs to start families, Mr. Guzman remained a bachelor bound to the block. With the help of his brother, he found work in 2008 as a law firm file clerk at Malapero & Prisco in Manhattan and, later, White Plains. But the suburbs held no magic for him. He felt most at home on the streets where he had grown up playing youth baseball and rooting for the Yankees. He was often seen walking outside, striking up conversations with acquaintances on the street corners, or relaxing and enjoying a beer on a bench in the courtyards of the Melrose Houses, his neighbor Ray Soriano said. “He never had to worry; everybody knew him,” Mr. Soriano said. “Everybody was like his family.” A New Family, Broken Apart While Mr. Guzman chased his artistic dream, Mr. Juárez was laboring long hours to provide for the family he was expecting to have. He told his girlfriend’s family he wanted a better life for his baby than the poverty he had endured in southwestern Mexico. He was born in June 1994 in El Platanar, a small, indigenous village in Guerrero State, where most people speak a Mixtecan dialect. When he was 6, his parents moved the family to a nearby city, Tlapa de Comonfort, so that their eight children could learn Spanish and get educations. Photo Police cordon off the crime scene. Credit Edwin J. Torres for The New York Times Mr. Juárez dropped out in ninth grade, after his family ran out of money to pay for school. At 15, he was resigned to working on their farm growing corn and pumpkins. He heard it was easier to make money in the United States, where an older sister lived, so on Jan. 15, 2012, he set out to make the perilous trek across the American border. It took Mr. Juárez two weeks to make his way to New York from Tlapa, traveling by car, by plane and by foot. He hiked with other migrants through the desert and crossed the border at Nogales. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Three years later, in August 2015, he said, he met Ms. Tomas at a get-together at a friend’s apartment on the Grand Concourse near East 167th Street. She was an American high school student from New England, visiting friends in the city. That night, he found her on Facebook. A month later, he said, he moved to be with her, supporting himself with jobs in a restaurant and then in a vineyard harvesting grapes. They soon got tattoos with each other’s names. When December arrived, she learned she was pregnant. Her mother, Tara Simmon, wept at the news, fearing Mr. Juárez would abandon her daughter. But he assured her that he was eager to take on the responsibility. Mr. Juárez, seeking better money, returned to the Bronx last February with Ms. Tomas, who dropped out of school. After a few months of living with his siblings, they saved enough to rent a $1,000 room just up the block, at 688 Courtlandt Avenue.

Torres for The New York Times He held down two jobs as a busboy at expensive restaurants in Manhattan, going to work in a dress shirt and a bow tie. “He would leave one job and — sometimes he couldn’t even change — go right to another,” Ms. Simmon said. All the while, he was saving money to get married after the baby was born and move to a safer neighborhood. The baby shower was intended to be another demonstration of his commitment to Ms. Tomas and the child. But the future they imagined has been shattered. On Aug. 31, Ms. Tomas gave birth to a daughter, Evelyn Martina. Mr. Juárez met his firstborn in a city jail on a barge in the Bronx. “I was very happy and emotional, but at the same time, sad,” he said in prison, dressed in a gray inmates’ jumpsuit, a tattoo of Ms. Tomas’s first name visible on his left forearm. “This is not how I expected it to be.” If convicted of murder at trial, he faces a minimum of 15 years to life in prison. Even if he pleads to a lesser charge and receives a lighter sentence, he would spend his daughter’s childhood in prison and would most likely be deported after his release. \nReporting was contributed by Al Baker, Sandra E.
