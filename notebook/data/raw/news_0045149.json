PUBLISHED: 03:20,   04:00, Sun, Feb 19, 2017 GETTY Marine Le Pen has criticised Hollande for leaving France at the brink of a \"civil war\" \nThe Front National leader said the Government has been quick to \"rush to the bedside of the very few victims of police violence without even waiting for… justice\" – but are unable to quash the risk of a \"real civil war\" on the streets of Paris. \nIn a ruthless rant, Le Pen wrote: “In a state of emergency, it is completely irresponsible to let a protest against the police and alleged police violence take place. Related articles Le Pen pledges that she 'WILL NOT SUBMIT' to Merkel \n“This government has remained unresponsive for years to scoundrels who make their laws in certain districts and do not hesitate to unleash their violence as soon as a demonstration gives them the opportunity. \n“Is it necessary to say that the magistrates need a strong and effective police force in order to do their work? \n“Must we remind them that this same police force, as well as the gendarmerie, now needs to be permanently changed?\" \nThe presidential hopeful claimed French Magistrates Union is supposed to provide lessons of morality to countries across the world, but their inability to condemn the protests means their union essentially “despises forces of order”. \nIn a direct attack to her Hollande, she claimed the French president’s \"calls for social peace\" were made only to “make the French believe that the situation is under control”.
