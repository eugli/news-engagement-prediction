That's half of what being in good shape is about. The other half is we are genetically hard wired to find a fit partner. For these reasons we feel better after we exercise. A movie promoting a lifestyle that encourages the opposite is poorly researched for starters, but also incredibly irresponsible. You realize the people who made this movie are not going to be responsible for God knows how many women shoving their faces with lil Debbie's, getting fat, and then wondering why they aren't happy. Smh despicable. Life Changing by LeoraPearl To the negative nelly one star reviewer...have you even watched the film? I doubt it because your comments have nothing to do with this documentary. The #1 principle of this movie is health before beauty. It should always be our priority and we deserve to be comfortable in our own skin. Accept what you cannot change about your body. I loathe my toes but I'm not going to have surgery to change them. I'm going to #embrace them. Be strong, be healthy and be beautiful for you and no one else. Amazing movie. by jenmcyp Just saw this in Oregon. Such a wonderful movie! So empowering and impactful, really a movie everyone should watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:49:02.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
