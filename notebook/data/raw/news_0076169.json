One West Yorkshire driver kept his licence even with 62 points Credit: PA \nDavid Nichols, from road safety charity Brake, told the BBC: \"The penalty points system is supposed to be in place to protect the public from dangerous repeat offenders and it's appalling that these risky repeat offenders are allowed to keep driving.\" \nCommon reasons for so many points to be amassed include a failure to inform the DVLA of an address change, followed by speeding offences. \nThe loss of a job is not enough to pass the \"exceptional hardship\" test but magistrates may decide not to ban an offender if it would cause bankruptcy or the default of a mortgage, legal experts say. \nIt is not known why the West Yorkshire man was allowed to continue driving.
