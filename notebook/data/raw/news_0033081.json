Some of us feel it, too. \n“Pribumi is an Umno offshoot or splinter group. Our DAP leaders spend a lot of time strengthening ties with our brothers in Pakatan but not within our own party,” he said. \nTeh added that Pribumi leaders were long-standing Umno members and he was worried that working with the party would eventually lead to the formation of “Barisan Nasional II”. \n“Then we’ll have Mahathir, Muhyiddin and Mukhriz all over again,” he said, referring to Pribumi chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and deputy president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir, all former Barisan leaders. \nFour DAP state leaders quit the party on Sunday. They are Kota Melaka MP Sim Tong Him, and assemblymen Goh Leong San (Duyong), Lim Jack Wong (Bachang) and Chin Choong Seong (Kesidang). \nOn Monday, Selangor exco member and state DAP vice-chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim blasted fellow party members for badmouthing the four who resigned. \nHe was responding to a statement by DAP central executive committee member Liew Chin Tong who thanked the four for their past contributions, but added that the Malacca DAP leaders quit the party because they lost in the party election in December 2015. \nTeng also took to task acting DAP national chairman Tan Kok Wai’s statement that described the four as “malignant tumours” whose departure was good for the party. \nTeng said one should never be abusive to former comrades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:07:54.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
