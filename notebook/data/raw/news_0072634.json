With just 12 Premiership fixtures remaining, the odds on becoming Scotland’s first post-war ‘invincibles’ are shortening by the week. But Gamboa insisted: “We don’t talk about it. As a group, we don’t think about the record, we don’t think about how many games we have unbeaten. ‘We just try and get the three points and go further and further up the table. I think this is the key to success. Before every game the gaffer tries to get everyone in the same mindset – to do whatever it takes to win the game. This is the key. We keep winning.” Inverness remain the only side to have taken a point from Celtic this season. Richie Foran’s side host Celtic again on Wednesday and Gamboa is adamant Brendan Rodgers’ side are desperate to atone for that one blot on their copybook. Dembele celebrates after he continued his rich vein of form in front of goal at Celtic Park ‘We just remember that game and at the end they scored for a draw,’ he said. ‘We’re not thinking about revenge – just the three points as we aim to be top of the table at the end of the season. ‘I think it’s football – sometimes it can happen that you draw. After that we realised we had to work harder and after the Inverness game we’ve been on our run. ‘Sometimes you get chances as we had at Inverness and then they scored right at the end. It happens. ‘It was the only game we drew but we have kept a good run going ever since.’ Cristian Gamboa believes Dembele is capable of playing for any club in the world RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:07:13.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
