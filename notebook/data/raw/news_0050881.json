The Snapdragon X20 modem will boost the theoretical download speeds to 1.2Gbps from the 1Gbps that the current Snapdragon X16 modem can theoretically reach.\nOf course those speeds won’t be reached on a consistent basis once the chips make it into your phone. Last year, Qualcomm told The Verge that in simulations, average speeds ranged from 112 to 307Mbps, with a peak of 533Mbps for the X16 modem. The average speeds for the X20 modem will likely surpass that, thanks to the higher max speeds. \nBut if you’re hoping to see the X20 modem in the next iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, you’re out of luck — the chip won’t be available in consumer devices until early 2018, according to Ars Technica .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:43:31.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
