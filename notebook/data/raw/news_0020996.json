But the noise is a consonant-like sound, suggesting that human ancestors may have combined similar noises to make early syllables and words.\nSerge Wich, a professor at Liverpool John Moores University and the co-author of the study published in Nature Human Behaviour, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the noises contain an “enormous” amount of information, from the gender of the orangutan to what kind of context it is made in.\nThe orangutans have also learnt to sometimes put leaves in or in front of their mouths to change the noise.\nProf Wich explained that the finding was interesting because researchers had previously assumed that that amount of information would not be available in a consonant.\nEvolution of human ancestry “We are very used to studying vowels in primates and those have been the building blocks of our theories in speech evolution,” he said.\n“A lot of the vowel sounds are very common in a lot of primates and the consonant sounds seem to have less information in them so we just studied them less.”\nH e said that the new research showed the information in the consonant-like sounds were essentially the same as vowels.\nHe concluded: “It is likely that orangutans started to combine [the two] and maybe human ancestors combined those to repeat the same information… That might be the start of early syllables and words.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:35:42.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
