But today, I am glad that I was proved wrong and I am happy that you have made it on your own.\" I am happy to hear this from you as well. You have been the driving force in my life. If it wasn't for all the rejections and mocking, I wouldn't have been here. Karan, you made fun of my English on this couch. But I haven't held this against you. Somewhere, these things drive you. I am not trying to fit in. \nOn nepotism in Bollywood \nIn my biopic, if it is ever made, you will play this stereotypical Bollywood biggie who is very snooty and completely intolerant to outsiders and flag bearer of nepotism, the movie mafia. You will have a huge part to play in my biopic. I like the antagonist in you in my biopic. \nKangana did not stop here and said that Karan has given her unnecessary attitude in Bollywood. \nOn friends in industry \nI have no friends. I have consciously made an effort to not have that kind of friends. Initially, I did and it got very complicated. Every time I have tried to make friendships, it has only harmed me. \nOn creative conflicts \nI fight with my directors a lot. If a set doesn't have creative conflict, it is not going right. It is not about taking instructions and pleasing people. It is really about collaborating. My directors like that about me that I give my 100 percent. And honestly, who don't, I don't like them either. If you want to be the most intelligent person in the room and be a dictator, then you are not the person I would want to work with. \nOn missing from social media and award shows \nIt is a matter of fact that you don't have visibility. When you are missing from these award functions or social media, you an see it as tangible. There are brands who would not hire you or they would come with this condition that you be on social media or you would lose out to some one who has 10 million followers on Instagram. I have the best songs every year, I don't do stage shows, I lose out on a lot of money, I don't endorse fairness creams. You make a choice. You let that go for something more valuable. I am trying to do things I resonate with. \nOn Taimur controversy \nIt is horrible to subject a newborn to a scrutiny like this. Why is it getting so difficult for people to be happy for others? Be it a successful film or a marriage or a newborn or a delivery. There is so much negativity that it feels where is our world heading towards. \nALSO WATCH: Kangana on being called witch, whore and psychopath To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
