After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,\" Bercow said. \n\"An address by a foreign leader to both houses of Parliament is not an automatic right; it is an earned honour.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:03:42.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
