I realised she was not there. I turned the engine off and went to the back of the car. \n“She was lying on the floor next to the rear passenger side wheel. She was not breathing or conscious. \n“I took out my phone to call 999 and other people came to help at that point. \nAmanda said she had been running late when the tragedy happened in Wraysbury, Berks, last November. \n“We were running late as usual,” she said. “The last time I recall seeing her was at the front door of the house. \n“I rushed, I thought she was already in. I thought I had already fastened her into the seat. \n“I did not reverse back very far. The bump I felt was very slight, it did feel I had run something over.” \nThe hearing was told little Karen suffered a brain haemorrhage and fractured skull and died at the scene. \nEmma Jones, assistant coroner for Berkshire, record a conclusion of accidental death.
