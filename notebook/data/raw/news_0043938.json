I didn't watch the Jungle, and I haven't really seen her so I don't really know her personally. But I'm sure the boys are going to have fun with her, and she'll have such a fun time.\" Last month, ITV confirmed that after a successful three years of her co-presenting the hit show, producers had decided that they were dropping the former Pussycat Dolls star (Photo: ITV) \nAnd the Allyn founder - who launched her footwear label, which was her first venture into the fashion industry, earlier this month - believes comedy duo Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly will work well with Scarlett because they share the \"same banter\" as they are all from Newcastle. \n\"I know they'll probably have a good time and have the same banter,\" she added. \"I absolutely love and adore those boys and we've all talked. It's been a great run. I did four seasons with the boys and it's been awesome, I love them to pieces. I've known for a little while. Everybody reached out to me and we all had a nice discussion and it was handled well. Again, good wishes.\" Producers have given her role to Scarlett Moffatt following her I'm A Celebrity win (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nAshley plans to still tune into the show if she is \"sitting alone\" on a Saturday night. \nShe said: \"I'm sure, if I'm in London and sitting alone on a Saturday, I'll tune in for sure. They're really funny.\" \nHowever, the former Pussycat Dolls band member has teased she already has plans in place to join forces with Ant and Dec again. \nShe added: \"We all said we are going to work on something in the future.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:18:16.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
