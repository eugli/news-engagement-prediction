Image: Hollander/Epa/REX/Shutterstock By Ariel Bogle 2017-02-22 02:44:54 UTC \nWhile Australia is increasingly pro-medical cannabis, it's still hard to get your hands on the stuff if you're in need (and have a prescription). \nThe government has indicated it's open to speeding things up, with Health Minister Greg Hunt announcing Wednesday that authorities will allow more rapid importation of the drug while a domestic supply is built. Medical cannabis is often used to alleviate pain associated with cancer as well as epilepsy.

The change is intended to counter delays for patients prescribed medicinal cannabis, who currently have to rely on \"case by case\" imports from overseas. \n\"We are now making it easier to access medicinal cannabis products more rapidly, while still maintaining strict safeguards for individual and community safety,\" Hunt wrote in a Facebook post . \nHe estimated that \"within 8 weeks, possibly sooner\" Australia will have a store of imported medicinal cannabis ready to go. \n\"What this means is that there will be a supply to meet all Australian demand,\" Hunt told ABC Radio . \"That won't happen overnight but what we've done here is issue a call for people to be able to establish an interim supply for and within Australia through importation.\" \nAustralia is still in the process of building its own domestic stores of the drug after legal changes allowed cultivation under strict controls in 2016. On Monday, the Office of Drug control announced it had granted its first licence to cultivate and research medicinal cannabis. \nThe federal government took a significant step towards legalisation in February 2016 when it amended the Narcotics Drugs Act. The change created a national licensing scheme for the controlled cultivation of medical cannabis, but access for patients has been stymied by a patchwork of state laws. \nThe legal approach to medical cannabis varies state by state. While New South Wales has a Medicinal Cannabis Compassionate Use Scheme that allows police the discretion not to prosecute use of the drug by \"adults with terminal illness,\" Victoria became the first state in Australia to legalise medical cannabis in early 2016 . \nThere has been no movement in Australia on legalising marijuana consumption recreationally, however. A Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) estimate in 2016 suggested the government could make millions if a 10 percent goods and services tax (GST) was hypothetically placed on household consumption.
