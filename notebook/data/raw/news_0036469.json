Photo evidence emerged on social media of Trump sitting alone at the show. \nGoldberg said “Tiffany, I’m supposed to go to a couple more shows, I don’t know what’s gonna happen, but I’m coming to sit with you because nobody is talking politics. You’re looking at fashion. She doesn’t want to talk about her dad.” \n“I’ve been there, where people say we’re not going to sit next to you,” she said. \nTrump tweeted a reply to Goldberg, thanking her and saying she’d “love to” sit with her. Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg I’d love to sit with you too! 😊 \n— Tiffany Ariana Trump (@TiffanyATrump) February 15, 2017 \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
