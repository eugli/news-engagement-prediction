Although in most cases they are unlikely to face a bill because they can offset what they pay to the taxman in their country of residence. \nHowever high earners can face a bill from the US Internal Revenue Service even after they have paid substantial taxes to the Government in their adopted country. \nIn addition they are expected to file a US tax return every year, irrespective of what they earn. \nAmericans living abroad are also taxed on any profit they make on selling their home when they live abroad, even if they have no intention of ever living in the United States. \nNew laws passed in 2010 made life even more difficult for American expatriates. Boris Johnson Credit: Matt Cardy/Getty \nT he Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act - or Fatca for short - requires banks to declare savings held by US citizens to the American tax authorities. This requirement, which applies to Americans living abroad, has led some banks to refuse to open accounts for US expats or threaten to close them down. \nThose giving up their US nationality include “accidental Americans” who were deemed to be citizens because they were born in the United States, even if they lived their entire life elsewhere. \nBoris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary who was born in New York, is among those to have renounced their US citizenship.
