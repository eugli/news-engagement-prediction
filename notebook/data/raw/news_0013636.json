Supplied \nThe Chief Big Mac jail is also heading south. \nThe equipment will now take pride of place at the Lake Ruataniwha Holiday Park, four kilometres south of Twizel. \nRitchie said the combo would complement old McDonald's playground equipment already set up at the entrance to the holiday park. \n\"I already had the Hamburglar swing and jail but I needed the roundabout to complete the set.\" John Bisset/Fairfax Media \nTwizel is the new home for Hamburglar and other McDonald's retro play equipment. \nWhile Ritchie admitted the price paid was hefty, he was pleased that he now had a full quota to give campers of all ages a fun piece of nostalgia. \n\"It was ridiculous really, but i just really wanted that one piece, the merry go round, to make my set.\" \n\"We're just a family camp and really into making the kids happy – it's amazing how many people that pull into the camp, open their cameras and take a photo – all the 35 to 40 year olds remember them from the original McDonalds. \n\"On the sign for the park I've been cheeky and used a golden arch 'M' on [the word] motorcamp - It's pretty cool, and people love it.\" Ad Feedback \nThe McDonalds pieces were auctioned by Nelson man Dennis Maxted, who decided to sell after years of enjoyment by his family. \nOriginally from the Nelson restaurant, Maxted had rescued the items from a paddock before installing them in his backyard. \n\"We decided to give them a second chance as everyone deserves one, even a Hamburglar,\" he said last week. \nAs is often the case with Trade Me auctions, the final few minutes proved crucial in deciding the winner. \nWith the 78 auction bidders narrowed down to two by 1.49pm on Sunday, a frantic five minutes saw the auction price rise another $3600, before a final bid of $11,550 was submitted. \nThe reserve on the listing was $3,000. \nThe nearest McDonald's restaurant to Twizel is located 145km south-east at Oamaru. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:40:38.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
