When the extent of the tragedy emerged, Russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions, most of them fanciful and most blaming Ukraine. One such version suggested that it was a failed attempt to shoot down President Vladimir V. Putin’s jet, which was aloft at the same time. A Dutch-led investigation concluded that the powerful surface-to-air missile system that took down the airliner was trucked in from Russia at the request of Russian-backed separatists and returned over the border the same night. As tensions with Europe escalated over the past several years, all sorts of false news stories emerged. State news media and Russian officials falsely claimed that a 13-year-old Russian immigrant in Germany had been kidnapped and raped, for example, and websites linked to Russia spread rumors, like one that Sweden had been approached to sell weapons to female fighters for the Islamic State. The stories that Russia labeled “fake news” were certainly more mainstream fare. The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News. Indicating its reach would be wide, however, one article was included from the Santa Monica Observer in California, about the sudden deaths of a number of Russian diplomats in recent months. Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quotes Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia’s presidential spokesman, as denying any link. The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty. The story quoted unidentified officials as well as experts in the field, and it noted Russian criticism of some aspects of the treaty. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A spokeswoman for The Times strongly defended the article and criticized the practice of simply labeling news reports fake without any substantiating evidence. “It’s a dangerous and troubling situation for governments or individuals to simply assign the label of fake news to a story they don’t like, instead of challenging specific facts or offering counter evidence,” said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman. “We stand by our reporting.” Russian social media erupted with a certain amount of derision about the whole enterprise, particularly since the link in Russian to the page translated as “publications and refutations.” “So to slap a red stamp and grandly say that something is ‘fake’ — this is what they call refutation these days?” wrote one Russian man on Facebook. A reporter for the English-language Moscow Times asked via Twitter whether he could borrow the big red stamp. Ms. Zakharova said that the ministry would not be assessing Russian news media for fake news. It deals with foreign relations, she noted. \nIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:26:18.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
