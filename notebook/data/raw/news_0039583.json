But to do it twice? That's madness.\nAnd that's exactly what the former Wimbledon and Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel DIDN'T do, despite being quizzed by the cops recently.\nThe well-travelled 43-year-old - who is a scout at German club Hoffenheim these days - has also been on the books at Bradford Park Avenue and Huddersfield Town during a bizarre and varied career, and he's found himself at the centre of a penguin puzzler for the second time according to reports in German paper Bild.\nA penguin - definitely not being stolen (Photo: RALPH LEE HOPKINS/National Geographic) Because when the flightless bird disappeared from an animal park in Mannheim, an anonymous call to cops suggested the ex-keeper was the culprit.\n“The police phoned me about a stolen penguin,\" Pfannenstiel told reporters. \"They had received an anonymous tip-off that I might be involved.\n“But it wasn’t me. I urge the thief to return the penguin, as this is no joke. I know it well from the sins of my youth.\"\nLutz's book was a big hit Because it seems as though the person who 'reported' Pfannenstiel did so because of a story in the German's epic 2014 autobiography , in which he explains what he did when playing in New Zealand 14 years ago.\n“In 2003 I took a penguin home from its colony and put it in my bathtub,\" he explains, matter-of-factly. \"But I returned it inside two days after my club chairman explained penguins were a protected species.\n“Besides, my housemates were not delighted, as it stank like a fish factory. I did not steal it – I just borrowed it.”\nHe just borrowed it, okay?!\nLike any normal person would.\nAlthough given that this is a man who once spent 101 days in a Singaporean jail and was once declared dead on the pitch, then who knows what normal is when it comes to him?\npoll loading Would you ever steal a penguin? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yeah, obviously I'd have nowhere to put it WTF even is this?!
