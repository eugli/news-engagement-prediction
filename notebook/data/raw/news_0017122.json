Post to Facebook Date-night dishes for two You know love is in the air when you're willing to share.  //usat.ly/2kWytSJ   Date-night dishes for two Keith Flanagan, Special for USA TODAY 7:12 a.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Certain dishes, like lasagna, need a helping hand — or four — to finish. At Buca di Beppo, a special Valentine’s Day lasagna is little (it’s perfectly sized for two), and a bit cheesy (it’s shaped like a heart). Buca di Beppo Fullscreen For classic romantics, the big night out means one thing: steak. At Chicago’s Spiaggia, the Valentine’s Day menu features Bistecca Florentina, a classic Florentine dish meant to be shared. Couples each get their own half of a hefty T-bone, and however much truffle hollandaise sauce they desire. Haas and Haas Photography Fullscreen For others, Valentine’s Day means something sweet: chocolate. Pastry chef Kriss Harvey takes heart in Beverly Hills at The Bazaar by José Andrés with a Chocolate Cake of Your Dreams. The heart-shaped dessert is made of chocolate biscuit and fleur de sel ganache that’s surrounded in chocolate mousse and finished with a red cocoa topping — couples, eat your heart out. Ryan Forbes Fullscreen Of course, there are a few folks who might prefer sharing a sip or two. On this season’s menu, New York City’s Slowly Shirley has cocktails designed for two. Its Perla Negra, for one, is a sultry rum cocktail mixed with activated charcoal, honey, ginger and more, then garnished with a flame — skip dinner and have drinks by candlelight. Nick Vorderman Fullscreen From Orlando to Las Vegas, Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House will serve an Oysters & Pearls for Two on Valentine's Day; slurp together, and indulge in a pair of glasses filled with Veuve Clicquot Champagne (or Grey Goose VX Vodka, if that’s your fancy). Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group After a complete renovation, Las Vegas’ Aureole is prime for meat lovers. Chef Johnny Church’s Valentine’s Day menu features a Center Cut Châteaubriand for Two, which comes with buttery anna potatoes and a batch of miniature vegetables. Aureole At NYC’s Langham Place Hotel, another Châteaubriand is served at Ai Fiori, with a beautiful lineup of beef tenderloin, bordelaise and béarnaise. Ai Fiori Fullscreen If you can share, Indianapolis’ Petite Chou Bistro and Champagne Bar is offering a bowl of mussels in white wine broth that’s flavored with tomato, shallots, basil and garlic — you’ll need a partner to handle their recommended pairing: Duck Fat Pommes Frites. Stacy Newgent Duck is the main attraction at The Morris in San Francisco, where a Smoked Muscovy Duck for Two is prepared with two swoon-worthy ingredients: honey and espresso. Leo Gong, courtesy of The Morris Revamping the supper club concept in Boston, Yvonne’s made-for-two Grilled “Viper” Chop pairs 24-hour short rib with kimchee fried rice. Nina Gallant Treat your sweet in NYC with Pasquale Jones’ mainstay, a pork shank with rustic flavors like rosemary, black pepper and lardo. Paul Wagtouicz Fullscreen A whole fish to yourself might be selfish, so the whole Branzino, soon to hit the week-long Valentine’s Day menu at Chicago’s FIG & OLIVE, is made for sharing. It comes with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, which you might need help with, too. FIG & OLIVE On the His, Hers, Together Valentine’s Day menu at NYC’s Little Frog Bistro & Bar, a fiery Normandy Duck Flambe for Two arrives ablaze. Paul Wagtouicz Fullscreen Should your meal end with a kiss, NYC’s Quality Italian is a worthwhile finish; its Baci Tartufo (Baci, the Italian equivalent of the Hershey Kiss) is a giant chocolate mound full of hazelnut praline and gelato — yes, it’s also a mouthful. Quality Italian Fullscreen It’s all about puppy love at NYC’s Allora Ristorante inside The Bernic Hotel, where the Maccheroni alla Mugnaia serves a real-life take of 'Lady and the Tramp.' The dish’s thick spaghetto is a single strand that’s more than 30 feet long — pace yourself, and there might be a smooch waiting in the middle. Allora Ristorante Inspired by the same scene, Austin, Texas' Juniper restaurant is going extra traditional, serving an exact interpretation of Spaghetti alla Bella Notte, piled high with spaghetti, sauce, meatballs and one major departure from the film: two forks. Juniper One final retake, this time in Missouri, is on Cielo Restaurant’s Valentine’s Day menu inside the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis. Its Sweetheart Noodle Challenge is an easier feat than the aforementioned dishes, measuring at 14 feet long. Cielo Restaurant Also in St. Louis, Público, which cooks the majority of its menu on an open hearth, serves a rotating whole grilled fish along with a stack of house-made tortillas. Greg Rannells, courtesy of Público Fullscreen At Chicago’s B restaurant, the Living Salad proves that love takes work. Featured on the B. My Valentine menu, microgreens hit the table in a water bowl — stem and roots intact, still growing — along with scissors, tweezers and accoutrements, prompting budding romantics to cut and prepare their salad together. courtesy of B For a little less effort, Austin, Texas' Sophia’s will serve a holiday entrée of grilled Dover sole — relax, it’s deboned tableside. Sophia’s Fullscreen There’s no better place to go Dutch than at The Dutch at W South Beach, where a Gripper’s Grail for Two is a display of decadence. An endless list of sweet ingredients like caramel ice cream, passionfruit sorbet, house-made marshmallow fluff, fruity syrup and chocolate sauce, hardly even needs a cherry on top — a caramelized banana does the trick. Noah Fecks Those who dip together stay together at NYC’s Blank Slate, where a S’Mores Dip needs a helping hand to scoop up the bubbling marshmallow. Blank Slate Further downtown, milk meets its match at Boulton & Watt, which serves a Cast Iron Chocolate Chip Cookie that’s sweet for sharing (Note: No cookie monsters allowed). Ryan Gleason Boston gets beefy at State Street Provisions, where a Grilled Porterhouse is a mighty number on the Valentine’s Day menu — it takes two to tackle it with ease. State Street Provisions New to the West Village, Pinto Garden, a crafty Thai restaurant, is serving a special Red Snapper this holiday — the fish gets sultry with Thai herb consommé, a spicy crimson sauce that’s even redder than the snapper. Pinto Garden In Austin, Texas, Old Thousand just opened in time for Valentine’s Day with an array of eclectic Chinese food; partake in a classic shared experience, the clay pot. Inside is pork belly, Chinese sausage, duck confit and more. Kristin Vrana Fullscreen In Atlanta, another traditional share sizzles at Nakato, a decades-old Japanese staple restaurant, where Shabu Shabu — a classic meal where extra thin slices of sirloin beef are dipped into a simmering broth fondu right on the table — is a savory share indeed. Nakato in Charleston, S.C., Pawpaw will serve a Millionaires Cut, which fortunately costs $68, on its Valentine’s Day menu. Assembled with potato puree, seasonal veggies and a béarnaise sauce, the 32-ounce Dry-Aged Ribeye is prime for indulgent couples. Pawpaw Love can be wild at Party Fowl in Nashville, where brunching lovebirds can split a 55-ounce Bloody Mary that’s crowned with a feast: Two fried Cornish hens, Scotch eggs, okra and more. Party Fowl Why gift flowers when you can eat them? In Austin, Texas, Boiler Nine Bar + Grill sprinkles fresh flowers — plus figs and spinach — on top of its Capra Lamb Neck special. Boiler Nine Bar + Grill You’ll need to share the weight at Stoke in Charlotte, N.C., where The Doughnut is a whopping full pound. Brioche dough is fried and dusted with sugar before it's filled with cream and topped with Heath bar crumble. Rick Lew Designed specifically for two, Brooklyn’s Loosie’s Kitchen crafts a Mac & Cheese Carbonara; the skillet-full creation is rich with homemade ricotta, comté cheese, ham and an egg yolk on top. Loosie’s Kitchen Just opened, and just under NYC’s High Line, The Wild Son serves a Smoked & Roasted Trout that requires a partner. Couples can take folds of crispy griddle bread to make trout tacos together. The Wild Son In the East Village, Hanoi House, a new Vietnamese spot, serves parties of two with family-style feasts, such as this Cha Ca dish, a spread of pan seared turmeric halibut with a hefty helping of rice vermicelli and zippy sauces. Hanoi House In Phoenix, Tomaso’s Italian Restaurant will dish a special Cupid Seven Fish Cioppin, a romantic red sauce full of spice, shrimp, sea scallops, shelled clams and mussels, like a sampling of the sea. Joseph Martori II Fullscreen Dessert shares the table with drinks at XIX (Nineteen), the top-floor restaurant at Philadelphia’s Hyatt at The Bellevue. The final course of the Valentine’s Day menu, a His and Her’s Martini Duet, includes two martini glasses, one with triple chocolate mousse and another with whipped vanilla cheesecake. They’re best washed down with bubbly, of course. XIX (Nineteen) It might be known for its tapas, but California’s La Marcha Berkeley suggests that Valentines share something traditional: paella. The Paella Huertana, rustic with kabocha squash, cauliflower, saffron and farm egg, is an untraditional take on the Spanish share. La Marcha Berkeley For dessert, a sensible split is, naturally, the Banana Split. At Sway, an Australian-Thai-style restaurant in Austin, Texas, the dessert gets a fusion of ingredients: five-spice ice cream, black sesame brownie bites, coconut milk jam and more. Sway On the Hilton New Orleans Riverside’s special menu, When an Aphrodisiac Meets an Old Flame, a made-for-two Lobster Macro is stuffed with sautéed mushrooms and shrimp, all arranged in the shape of a heart. Hilton New Orleans Riverside In Dallas, CBD Provisions is offering a Chateaubriand Steak. The tenderloin for two comes with potato gratin and frisee salad, all served on one large cutting board. CBD Provisions Couples get fired up at Tom Douglas' Dahlia Lounge in Seattle, where a two-person Rotisserie 5-Spice Duck is cooked over a fire that’s smoked with applewood, and served on top of sesame yams. Dahlia Lounge Fullscreen Top off your Valentine’s Day with literal cherries — Amarena cherries, in this case — at Chicago’s The Publican (as well as its sister property, Publican Anker), which serves a classic sundae for two drizzled in a homemade dark hot fudge and sprinkled with candied marcona almonds.
