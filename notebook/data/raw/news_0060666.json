Those costs could have been cut significantly if more people would get their children vaccinated, the study says. Enlarge One-year old Ben Dunavant prepares to get vaccines. His mother, Becky holds him while… more Children’s Hospital Colorado and the Colorado Children’s Immunization Coalition used data from surveys and from the Colorado Hospital Association for its annual report. It covers preventable illnesses that required emergency-room visits or overnight hospitalization. The study indicates that Colorado is making progress on childhood vaccinations but still has a long way to go. “If we were able to increase our rates of vaccination in the state and reach a higher level, I think we could reduce roughly by half these expenses,” said Dr. Edwin Asturias , an infectious-disease specialist at Aurora-based Children’s Hospital and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine . Asturias was one of the study’s authors. In 2015, 75.4 percent of Colorado children received the recommended number of doses of vaccine — a significant improvement from the roughly 40 percent as recently as 2013. The 2015 figure ranked the state 14th nationally. Still, hospitals recorded 4,247 instances in 2015 where children came into the emergency room with vaccine-preventable diseases, plus 472 other instances in which the diseases were so advanced that the kids had to be hospitalized. This resulted in more than $35 million in charges — $25.6 million for influenza alone — plus untold additional costs involving medication, lost wages and decreased productivity by the parents, the new report says. Three Denver counties recorded the largest share of these costs — $6.1 million in Adams County, $5.1 million in Arapahoe County and $4.7 million in Denver County. But the per-capita societal costs likely are higher in rural counties where immunization rates are lower and diseases can spread more quickly among the population, Asturias said. The study seems to make a case as well that people are not taking advantage of free preventive medical services like vaccinations that are available through all health-insurance plans to the roughly 93 percent of Coloradans who are insured, said Adam Fox , director of strategic engagement for the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative. That may be an issue of people actively deciding not to get immunizations for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported last August that 87 percent of its members had been confronted in the previous 12 months by parents who refused to have their children immunized. Or it may signal that too many Medicaid recipients and other low-income Coloradans continue to have trouble accessing doctors who can offer the immunizations. “A lot of people still have trouble getting in to see a doctor and get the vaccinations they have access to,” Fox said. Behind influenza, the highest costs for treating vaccine-preventable diseases incurred to children with pneumococcal disease ($8 million), pertussis ($696,106) and tetanus ($642,314), the study found. Two of the influenza cases were fatal. Ed Sealover covers government, health care, tourism, airlines, hospitality, restaurants and brewing for the Denver Business Journal. Phone: 303-803-9229.
