The motion will be argued during the legislature's third sitting on Tuesday. \nModiba said the ANC in the province had great confidence in Makhura and the sensitivity with which he was handling the Life Esidimeni tragedy. \n\"Already remedial actions are being implemented on this matter. The affected families have been very clear in their call that this tragic incident should not become a political football as this only serves to exacerbate their pain \nMakhura's spokesperson, Phumla Sekhonyane, echoed Modiba's words, adding that political games would not distract them from working \"tirelessly with the affected families to find restorative justice by implementing all the recommendations of the Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba\". \nA day before the Gauteng State of the Province Address, delivered by the premier on February 20, the EFF issued a motion of no confidence against Makhura. \nEFF provincial leader Mandisa Mashego said the motion was filed after the party laid criminal charges of murder against Makhura earlier this month. \n\"Our motion is on the basis that we opened a murder charge. If we are pursuing a murder charge it means that the premier cannot possibly continue working in a public space on the back of taxpayers' money if he has murdered people, whether directly or indirectly.\" \nMashego said there was no way Makhura could evade the consequences of the deaths. \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
