While Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg offered a measured rebuke of President Donald Trump’s immigration order, C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg , the most prominent female executive in Silicon Valley, has been growing more forceful in her condemnations. On Thursday, in the wake of an earlier executive action making it harder for women around the world to access reproductive health care, the Lean In author shared a link to a New York Times story about the effects the so-called global gag rule will have on women. “We don't have to guess—we know what this will do,” she wrote, a day before the anti-abortion March for Life in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, Sandberg tore into the White House again, though she didn’t mention Trump by name, focusing on the harm his ban on refugees and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries would have on women. Sandberg shared a picture of her great-grandmother, who immigrated from Lithuania to the United States through Ellis Island in the late 19th century to escape religious persecution. “The Executive Orders issued over the past week defy the heart and values that define the best of our nation,” she wrote in a Facebook post . “Families have been separated. Frightened children have been detained in airports without their parents. People seeking refuge have been turned away and sent back to the danger they just managed to flee. This is not how it should be in America.” Sandberg, an advocate for women who has sometimes been criticized as representing a particularly corporate vision of feminism , explained how Trump’s executive order cracking down on immigration would have a disproportionate impact on women and families. “Anything that pulls families apart and traumatizes kids has a huge impact on women and their children,” she continued. After criticizing Trump throughout the election, most tech leaders remained largely silent in the weeks following his electoral victory, with some vowing to work with the president to create jobs in the U.S. But the mood in Silicon Valley has shifted significantly in the days since Trump’s inauguration. Over the weekend, with H-1B worker visas reportedly on the line, tech leaders began speaking out en masse against the president’s immigration ban. The only major voice in Silicon Valley to express agreement with Trump’s action was Trump adviser Peter Thiel , another member of the Facebook board. 1 / 7 Photos: Tech C.E.O.s Who Have The Most to Lose in a Trump Presidency Jeff Bezos: The C.E.O. of e-commerce and delivery giant Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post has already sparred with Trump. But Trump could come after Bezos for anti-trust issues, too: Trump is on the record as saying Amazon “is controlling so much of what they are doing.” The fact that The Washington Post has been reporting on Trump, often critically, probably does not endear Bezos to Trump, either.

Tim Cook: Trump has repeatedly criticized Apple for making its products overseas, and has called on the company to “start building their damn computers and things” in America. Cook must also contend with tariffs that will inevitably arise if Trump gets the U.S. into a trade war with China. And then there’s the fact that Trump denounced Apple in 2016 for refusing a court order to cooperate with an F.B.I. request to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year.

Jack Dorsey: Twitter, already a tech company struggling with employee retention and a falling stock price, has been forced to contend with its role in handing Trump a megaphone to spout his opinions, whether those include attacking a union leader or merely suggesting the U.S. stock up on nuclear arms. Dorsey was also excluded by Trump from the tech summit at Trump Tower in December, reportedly as retribution for not allowing the Trump team to use an emoji-fied version of the #CrookedHillary hashtag.

Mark Zuckerberg: Trump’s favorite golden boy in Silicon Valley, Peter Thiel , is both an early Facebook investor and serves on Facebook’s board, which bodes well for the company’s ties to the president-elect. But Trump could also change immigration laws in a way that affects Facebook’s ability to hire highly skilled employees. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and others in the tech community signed onto a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in favor of Obama’s executive actions, arguing that more immigration benefits the tech industry and the country. Trump appears to disagree. Photo: From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Marc Lore (Jet.com): E-commerce companies like Jet.com could become victims of a Chinese trade war. Trump has threatened to add tariffs of 45 percent of Chinese exports. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they're doing,” he told supporters earlier in 2016. Trump’s proposed solution could make foreign-made goods—which comprises the bulk of e-commerce products—vastly more expensive. Photo: From Rex/Shutterstock. Josh Kushner: Jared Kushner’s brother, Josh, runs a healthcare start-up in New York called Oscar Health—which just so happens to be built on the back of the Obamacare exchanges that Trump, Jared’s father-in-law, has threatened to destroy. The company, which is reportedly bleeding money, is now pivoting its business model to focus on narrow networks and roll-out plans to small and large businesses, moving away from plans connected to the Affordable Care Act.

Elon Musk: Though Musk and Trump ally Peter Thiel are close—they helped co-found PayPal together, and made their respective first millions of dollars off of it—two of Musk’s companies may be in a precarious situation under a Trump administration. Shareholders in both SolarCity and Tesla Motors now must consider what Trump could do to federal clean-energy tax credits and subsidies, which both companies currently receive. Current electric-car and solar-energy subsidies will expire under Trump’s tenure, and aren’t likely to be renewed. Photo: From Rex/Shutterstock.
