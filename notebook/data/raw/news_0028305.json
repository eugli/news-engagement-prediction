What started as one of the most common flu strains developed into a rare autoimmune disease that caused her body to attack the brain.\nAnd although those who develop the disease have a viral or bacterial illness weeks before, doctors say Eva's death was likely preventable.\nOn February 7, Eva was admitted to Cleveland Clinic Children's with a fever of 105F and a case of the flu - Influenza B, the most common of the flu viruses.\nDoctors administered several tests before diagnosing her with a viral infection. But her body's immune response had caused damage to her brain.\nEva had developed a severe form of a neurological disease called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).\nWhile there are a variety of viruses that can trigger ADEM, the disease does not appear to be caused by any single infectious agent, and Eva's case was extremely rare.\nIt was not long before she was placed on life support, with a cardiac drip and on a ventilator.\nIn a statement, the Quote: : 'We are truly humbled by the outpouring of love, prayers and support from the community for our beloved daughter, Eva Harris.\n'We are deeply saddened to share that Eva has passed away. As her family, we wish to request privacy as we remember and celebrate her amazing life.'\nA YouCaring page had been set up to cover Eva's medical expenses, but the current donors are pledging to bring the family meals and other necessities.\nWHAT IS IN THE FLU SHOT? Strains of the flu virus are constantly changing, so a new vaccine is made each year.\nScientists make the vaccine before flu season starts by predicting which flu strains are likely to be the most common during the upcoming season.\nFor the 2016-2017 season, flu shots protect against three or four strains of flu virus.\nTrivalent vaccines protect against two influenza A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, and one influenza B strain.\nThe quadrivalent flu vaccines protect against the same strains as the trivalent vaccine, as well as an extra influenza B virus.\nThe CDC estimates that between 157 million and 168 million doses of injectable flu vaccine will be available.\nThis season will be the first since 2013 that the flu nasal spray is not available due to new data that questioned its efficacy.\n'ADEM is basically the body attacking itself. You get an infection, it's usually a virus that provokes a response from the body that causes it to attack the brain, Dr Maz Wiznitzer told WKYC .\nThe pediatric neurologist from University Hospital Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital said that the condition, however, is not contagious.\nMost ADEM patients have a viral or bacterial illness two to three weeks before developing ADEM.\n'The children present with change in mental status, seizures, fever. They may have a weakness on one side or unsteady when they walk,' said Dr Wiznitzer.\nHe insists, however, that there is no link between ADEM and the flu vaccine.\nHe said: 'The present vaccinations that we give do not have an association with ADEM.\n'In fact, we know the diseases those vaccines protect you against. Those are the ones that can cause this bad inflammation of the brain, swelling and inflammation of the brain. The vaccine would actually protect you against that.'\nIn New York City, four pediatric influenza deaths have been reported by the New York State Department - all in January.\nNone of the ages, or whether or not the children were vaccinated, were disclosed.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that it's seen epidemic levels of flu activity late last month.\nAccording to a CDC report last week, there have been 15 flu-related pediatric deaths.\nEva had developed a rare case of ADEM, an autoimmune disease that attacks the brain and the spinal cord. Two days after being admitted to the hospital, she was placed on life support. Her family posted a throwback picture (left) and a more recent picture (right) online in tribute\nParticularly New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania all reported high levels of flu-like activity.\nDr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that although the deaths are tragic, the number of cases is New York is not unusual for flu season.\nHe said: 'It's clear that the substantial majority of children who die from influenza every year have not been vaccinated.'", "external_links": ["http://www.ksdk.com/news/health/community-rallies-behind-child-fighting-rare-complication-from-flu/406804859", "https://www.youcaring.com/evamarieharris-754193"], "published": "2017-02-14T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:49:44.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
