(CBS4) – Three people were run over by a horse that was apparently spooked by a low-flying drone during the annual Skijoring race in Silverton on Saturday. \nThe Skijoring race features horses pulling skiers through the street.

They report two women were taken away in an ambulance and another man had a minor injury. \nThe horse rider was trying to wave the drone away when his horse became agitated and then charged into a crowd of spectators. \nThe competition was shut down for about 30 minutes. \nThe drone pilot was given a ticket for illegally flying over the crowd and drones are no longer allowed at the event.
