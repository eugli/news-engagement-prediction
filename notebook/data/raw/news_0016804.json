By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 5, 2017 3:57 PM Sasikala Natarajan is selected as the new legislative leader of AIADMK. (Source: twitter) \nIn a major an announcement, AIADMK Legislators elected Party Chief Sasikala Natarajan as its new legislative leader after which the current Chief Minister O Panneerselvam resigned as the Chief Minister of the state leaving the most important chair vacant for occupation. According to the reports by PTI, Panneerselvam himself presented Sasikala’s name for the CM post making her the top contender to take the post. \nHere is everything you should know about Sasikala Natarajan: \n1. Sasikala Natarajan is married to M. Natarajan who once used to serve as the public relations officer in the Tamil Nadu government but lost his job. This forced Sasikala to enter a video renting business and later she entered into politics. \n2. She met Jayalalithaa, the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and the General Secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 1980 and they shared a very close relation for years to come. At, one point they were living together and Jayalalithaa’s foster son even got marries to Sasikala’s nephew. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\n3. However, their relation went sour and on December 19, 2011, Jayalalithaa expelled Sasikala, her husband and many other people from her party suspecting that they were plotting against her. It was reported that Jayalalithaa believed that she was given sedatives by a nurse who was appointed by Sasikala. \n4. Sasikala was brought back into the party after she clarified that she had no idea about any such conspiracy and broke all her ties with her family members. After that, she was a huge support for the former Tamil Nadu CM and even accompanied her to the jail in the Disproportionate asset case but was acquitted by the High Court \n5. She has always played an ‘off-camera’ role for the party and didn’t hold a specific position but her decisions and advises were always taken seriously by Jayalalitha who declared her udanpirava sagodhari which means a sister not related with blood. \n6. On December 29, she was appointed to as the General Secretary of AIADMK in the aftermath of Jayalalitha’s sad demise. She placed a copy of the party resolution appointing her as the AIADMK general secretary at the burial site of Jayalalitha with teary eyes.
