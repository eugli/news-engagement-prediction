Among his many allegations, the singer claimed that “the russian dossier on Trump is real. 100% real. he’s being blackmailed by the russian government, not just for being peed on by russian hookers, but for much more nefarious things.” most of the info i referenced is of public record, or will be relatively soon. also hoping #trump #bannon iran war plans are thwarted. \n— moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) February 13, 2017 Just imagine how scary @realDonaldTrump and #PresidentBannon would be if they weren't so incompetent. \n— moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) February 14, 2017 When/if there's another war or terror attack just remember @realDonaldTrump tweeting about Nordstrom instead of attending security briefing \n— moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) February 14, 2017 the #trump admin's incompetence is staggering. compromised and incompetent. #impeachtrump isn't partisan, it's imperative. @gop \n— moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) February 14, 2017 no, the 'real story' is that you're an incompetent and your admin is compromised. #impeachtrump \n— moby XⓋX (@thelittleidiot) February 14, 2017 \nHowever, he added, the Trump administration is “in collusion” with the Russian government. \nHe went on to claim that while there are “right-wing plans to get rid of Trump,” international intelligence agencies “are working to present information that will lead to high level firings and, ultimately, impeachment.” \nDropping yet another bomb, Moby wrote that the U.S. has plans to go to war, “most likely with Iran.” \nHe concluded the post, writing, “I’m writing these things so that when/if these things happen there will be a public record beforehand. These are truly baffling and horrifying times, as we have an incompetent president who is essentially owned by a foreign power.” \nIn a later post, Moby made a plea to Americans to vote against Trump in 2018 midterm elections, to boycott and to “be brave, be vocal.” \nResponding to speculation over his sources, Moby tweeted, “most of the info i referenced is of public record, or will be relatively soon. also hoping # # bannon iran war plans are thwarted.” \nAnd in an Instagram post, the singer captioned an illustration of a clown, “Hey, I’m just a clown. I mean, maybe there isn’t a #trump administration plan to go to war with Iran. And maybe trump’s inner circle isn’t filled with Russian operatives. And maybe russia Doesn’t have utterly damning info on trump that’s keeping him under their thumb. And maybe the Koch bros and their pals aren’t looking at options to get trump out of the White House. Just don’t look too closely at Flynn and manafort and the uss Cole and the Russians who’ve disappeared or died recently and what’s currently happening in the Ukraine. Again, I’m just a bald clown who probably knows nothing. I’m going to go make some balloon animals now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:08:16.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
