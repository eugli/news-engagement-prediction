She announced the news by posting a stunning photo of her pregnant body on Instagram , soon shattering the standing record for most likes on the social media platform. It now has more than 8,500,000 nods of approval. \nThe divine portrait of Bey shrouded in a pale, wispy veil is allegedly the work of photographer Awol Erizku. According to Artnews , Erizku confirmed his involvement over text. The Huffington Post has since reached out to Erizku to corroborate, but have yet to hear back. A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nBorn in Ethiopia and raised in the Bronx, the photographer has previously made his affection for the Carter family known ― in a sculpture of stacked basketball hoops titled “ Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a Trillion ,” a line from Jay Z’s “Picasso Baby.” As further evidence of his involvement in Beyoncé’s pregnancy shoot, you can look to Erizku’s Instagram, which features staged portraits reminiscent of Bey’s, involving Day-Glo backdrops, fake flowers , ancient mythological vibes and all. \nBeyoncé has since uploaded more images from the pregnancy series to her website, which also combine religious iconography with a highly staged and hyperartificial pop feel. They resemble Erizku’s distinctive aesthetic , which blends classical imagery with contemporary cultural markers and a kitsch sense of humor.

For example, she featured body paintings by the Nigerian artist Laolu Senbanjo , whose work is inspired by Yoruba culture. Senbanjo applied body paint he described as “the sacred art of the Ori” to women in the “Sorry” video, which has been viewed over 180,000,000 times on YouTube. After the video’s release, Senbanjo was interviewed by The New York Times , who attributed Beyonce’s video to the artist’s “own mainstream fame.” \nAnother creative whose reputation was bolstered by Beyonce’s support is Warsan Shire, the London-based Somali poet whose words were adapted for “Lemonade.” The poet was known prior to the album, for writing phrases like “Give your daughters difficult names. Give your daughters names that command the full use of tongue.” However, “Lemonade” catapulted Shire to a new level of prominence. Within hours of the film’s release, Amazon sold out of her paperback books. \nShire also wrote a poem to accompany Bey’s pregnancy announcement, featured below.

Even the term “emerging” seems to minimize the respect they’d previously earned in their respective fields. It is widespread acclaim that Beyoncé’s following affords, acknowledgement that is nearly impossible for a poet or visual artist to attain. The Beyhive is real. \nThe list of artists of color supported by Beyoncé goes on and on. The video for “Freedom” features 22-year-old Michaela DePrince, a Sierra Leonean-American ballerina, dancing on stage. A later scene includes shots of actress and activist Amandla Stenberg and French-Cuban sisters Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Diaz of the musical duo Ibeyi. There are also cameos by Zendaya and Quvenzhané Wallis. \nWith her music, films, and even her baby announcements, Beyoncé shines her light on the many other artists working to imagine a different and more beautiful world. Bey uses her queenly powers to amplify voices aside from her own, thereby providing an unmatchable platform that for many young artists, changes the course of their lives and careers. \nSo, yeah, that’s how you tell people you’re having twins.
