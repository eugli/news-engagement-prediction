If he feels jaded, if he feels the spark has gone, then he should retire. If, however, the passion and energy remains, then he should be encouraged to continue. Let’s at least judge him in May, not February. ROB DRAPER It’s a shame Wenger didn’t do the smart thing and quit on winning the FA Cup in 2014 when his contract was up. He could have argued that was mission accomplished: stadium built, major trophy won. Or, surprise us, and quit in 2015 after that FA Cup win. Because the last two years have been painful. I believe he will go when the crowd turns, as they will, in the next few weeks. And, yes, he should go. But there is nothing shameful about doing a wonderful job for 20 years and then handing on to someone else with fresher, different ideas. Good companies do it all the time. The shame is that it will be perceived as him being hounded out when he should be carried out shoulder high in acknowledgment of his achievements. Alexis Sanchez left in despair after Bayern Munich score their fifth goal of the night RIATH AL-SAMARRAI Yes. Regretfully it seems to be time to stop. Wonderful manager but he has hit that point where you have to question if he has another trick up his sleeve. It doesn’t look like it. He’s tried for the last decade or so to build another title-winning side but clearly can’t do it, so it feels like Arsenal need new ideas if they are to move forward. Quite who they choose is another matter altogether. That lack of options could be vital in whether he stays or goes. MIKE KEEGAN As an outsider looking in, it’s hard not to feel sympathy for a man who turned Arsenal from boring to brilliant and who bankrolled a beautiful stadium while keeping his side competitive. It does, however, feel like the end of the line. If Wenger goes, who replaces him? Sanchez kept his frustrations in check until the game was over, late into the second half CRAIG HOPE In a few years’ time perhaps we will say they should never have got rid of Wenger - but Arsenal at least have to try. This cannot continue. It is all painfully predictable and has been for far too long. He should have left after the last FA Cup triumph with his head held high. As it is, this looks increasingly like becoming the season when they finally miss out on the top four. JACK GAUGHAN Sadly the time has now come for Wenger to move on. A shame for Wenger, whose undoubtedly been one of the greatest managers this country’s ever seen. But there are no real signs of a title-winning squad being built and each season follows the same pattern. What’s the theory about doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? Yeah, that one. Wenger is now under pressure and could walk away from Arsenal after 20 years this summer The Frenchman has been unable to guide his side beyond the last 16 in six straight seasons LAURIE WHITWELL It really should be his last season. As much as his team’s capitulation in Munich, as much as the lack of leaders meaning Kieran Gibbs wearing the armband, as much as the continued acceptance of Mesut Ozil’s loose commitment to effort, it was Wenger’s dishevelled post-match answers which underline this ought to be his last season. There was no anger in evidence, just a mild explanation for events. That kind of reaction allows players to escape scrutiny, post meaningless selfies, and continue to underwhelm when the season reaches crux moments. Whether the club’s board see things than way when set against the balance sheets is another matter. But for Arsenal to progress, Wenger must depart before his legacy is tarnished even more. Thiago was the standout player as he scored twice to give Bayern Munich victory over Arsenal Bayern are on the brink of knocking Arsenal out of Europe again after a one-sided first leg CHRIS WHEELER It's the right time for Wenger to go at the end of the season. Arsenal are stuck in a cycle of mediocrity that shows no sign of ending, and it would be a shame if the Wenger era was tarnished any further by the kind of performance we saw in Munich. He should be allowed to go with dignity, but he has taken the club as far as he can.
