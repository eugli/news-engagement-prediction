Michael Bennet, Colorado’s senior senator, was quick to post a gif on Twitter showing his view of Trump’s “fine-tuned machine.”\n. @POTUS : \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" pic.twitter.com/m0rO7oQMOv\n— Michael F.

Cory Gardner, Colorado’s Republican senator, notified constituents he was set to talk about the importance of Colorado’s agriculture on the senate floor.\nHeading to the Senate floor to discuss the importance of #Agriculture to Colorado.

Diana DeGette, D-Denver, challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan to explain the House GOP’s position on cutting funding for Planned Parenthood and TitleX.\nReally, @SpeakerRyan ? So why is @HouseGOP so eager to attack women’s health and ditch #TitleX funds? Can you explain? We’ll wait. pic.twitter.com/dfymBPyk9k\n— Rep.
