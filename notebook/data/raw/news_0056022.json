With age though, comes hair loss. \nUser QueenieMum kicked off a lively chat with other mums following \"an animated conversation with some friends earlier this week.\" There's no stopping the ageing juggernaut (Photo: Getty) \n\"Apparently lady gardens can lose their lawn completely after the menopause. I've never heard this before, is it true?! I also can't decide whether I'd love it or hate it!\" \nMany mums came forward and confirmed that this did indeed happen, decribing it as the \"last great secret of womanhood.\" \n\"At the risk of over-sharing, mine is not as fulsome as it once was,\" commented one. \"But I sort of presumed it had been getting a bit disheartened as I sometime wax/Immac/shave bits off.\" Can women look forward to being able to ditch the wax? (Photo: Getty) \nThere was, of course much jubilation from many of the women, who described this hair loss side-effect as a \"a plus.\" Even members of the medical community weighed in. \nOne nurse replied with: \"As a nurse I can safely share that I've probably seen every lady garden type out there and would say about 75 per cent of ladies seems to have nothing left in their elder years, although some do still have full lady gardens but grey.\" Going grey seems like an inevitability \nThis was substantiated by a retired nurse, who added: \"I've seen more older women's lady gardens than I have had hot dinners. \n\"Yes, they do tend to get much more sparse with age. There are exceptions to every rule but in general this is true.\" \nEven Whoopi Goldberg had something to say on the matter during her recent appearance on Graham Norton, daring to admit what so few women talk about. Whoopi Goldberg knows (Photo: Rex Features) \nWhile this hair-loss news received largely a positive reception, many of the other comments pointed out how, what Mother Nature took away with one hand, she gave back (double) with the other. \n\"My fingers sprout more hair than my eyebrows,\" revealed one mum. \n\"Post-meno, my lady garden appears to be - not disappearing - but re-emerging on my chin,\" added another. \nAnd this: \"I found a hair under my chin a few weeks who that was SO long it must have been there at least a few months.\" \nGreat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:42:24.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
