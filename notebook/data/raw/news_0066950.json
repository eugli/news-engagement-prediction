David Lindquist , david.lindquist@indystar.com Published 9:47 a.m. ET Feb. 22, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago Country star brings marathon concert to Bankers Life Fieldhouse Eric Church will perform Feb. 23 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. (Photo: Getty Images) 36   \nEric Church's new tour has the country star talking about bringing a T-shirt design out of retirement. \n\"I Survived Eric Church Live\" shirts were available at the country singer's merch table early in his career, when the North Carolina native built a reputation as an onstage beast in the spirit of outlaw icon Waylon Jennings. \"I was ready to eat the microphone and pound people for an hour or more,\" he recalled during a phone interview. \nChurch hasn't lost his wild streak, but there's less of a need to pound listeners into submission in 2017. Fans are eager to rally around chart-topping hits \"Drink in My Hand\" and \"Springsteen\" on his \"Holdin' My Own\" tour that visits Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Thursday. \nThe idea of survival comes into play because Church makes each date of the tour an endurance test. Instead of yielding the first part of the show to an opening act, Church is onstage for the duration. He plays two sets packed with a total of nearly 40 songs. And the tour began with seven shows in a 10-day span. \n“Maybe I’m the one who survives Eric Church live,\" he said with a laugh. \"Maybe I need to wear the shirt.” \nThe 39-year-old is embracing the marathon format. \n“It’s truly been a little bit of survival, for me and the crowd,\" Church said. \"It’s fantastic. It’s great. But it’s every bit of a three-hour journey. Then for me, it’s coming off that stage knowing there’s one the next night somewhere else. It’s about getting that turned around and being able to do it again.” \nGoing the distance: When talking about his career-spanning show, Church mentions he owns a modest collection of five No. 1 singles (“Drink in My Hand,” “Springsteen,” “Give Me Back My Hometown,” “Talladega” and “Record Year\"). He doesn't perform \"The Only Way I Know\" and \"Raise 'Em Up,\" chart-topping songs for Jason Aldean and Keith Urban that featured Church as a collaborator rather than lead artist. To fill three hours of music, he gratefully relies on non-singles from his five studio albums. \"You couldn’t play a show like that unless people had taken songs like 'Carolina' or 'These Boots' or 'Pledge Allegiance to the Hag' — songs that never saw the radio — and turned them into these anthems,\" Church said. \"You could never play a show that long.\" Eric Church yanks 600 resale tickets for Indy show \nAgainst the grain: Church said unconventional singles have helped his career, even when the songs don't reach No. 1 on the charts. He credits 2010's \"Smoke a Little Smoke,\" which he describes as \"a pro-pot anthem from a guy who never had anything better than a No. 10 song,\" for galvanizing his fan base. The lead single from 2015 \"Mr. Misunderstood\" album was its title track, a tune that revs its pace and includes references to non-Nashville songwriters and abstract visual artist Jackson Pollock. \"I knew the song ‘Mr. Misunderstood’ was going to be a little bit of a challenge, but I wanted that to be heard,\" he said. \"I wanted Ray Wylie Hubbard and Elvis Costello and Jackson Pollock — those names and those images — on country music radio. I wanted people experiencing that.” \nWorth the effort: Church said too many established acts make safe choices. \"The genre would be a lot better, and I think all genres would be a lot better, if people who had the leeway used it and pushed a little more,\" he said. \"An artist who’s successful can push it quite a bit. They’ve built up the equity to do that. I always try to use every bit of that equity. Then I have to go find some more after I use it all up.\" \nEarly days: Before breaking through to the mainstream, Church toured with \"14 people on a 12-bunk bus.\" Meanwhile, he saw fellow emerging acts — who he says \"weren't as good as we were\" — receive radio airplay and score supporting-act slots on arena tours. \"We were playing 220 shows a year, eating potted meat on a bus,\" Church said. \"But we outworked them.\" \nShow time: Unlike earlier tours that involved pyrotechnics and a 30-foot inflatable Satan onstage, the \"Holdin' My Own\" production is confined to \"lights and music,\" Church said. Attendees are a big part of the show, thanks to 360-degree stage design. \"People in front of the stage can not only see me, they can see the people reacting behind me,\" he said. \"It creates this real frenetic thing as the show goes on. I enjoy standing in the middle and watching it happen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:00:46.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
