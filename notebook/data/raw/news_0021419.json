Source: YouTube \nSince the music video’s release, Bregoli again appeared on Dr. Phil and, just like her last appearance, the 13-year old didn’t mince words. \nWhen Dr. Phil asked the viral sensation if her new-found fame was a good thing, Bergoli replied as ruthlessly as you’d expect \n“I guess what’s good for you is I made you just like how Oprah made you,” answered Bregoli, smiling. “You were nothin’ before I came on this show.” \n“Thank you for that,” replied Dr. Phil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:08:14.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
