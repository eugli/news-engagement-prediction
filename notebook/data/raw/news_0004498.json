Donald Trump's TERRIFYING future weapons Wednesday, 18th January 2017 As Donald Trump has promised to start an arms race, we take a look at the futuristic weapons being developed for the US military. 1 / 9 Alamy Stock Photo A projectile fired from an electromagnetic rail gun. Rail Guns use an electro magnet to propel a projectile at speeds up to 2500 meters per second. \nMark Dubowitz, an Iran sanctions expert who is advising the president, said: “Michael Flynn [Trump’s National Security aide] did not put Iran on notice as mere empty words. \n\"Iran's continued missile and terrorism activities will lead to dozens of new US designations and tough new congressional sanctions. \n“This is merely the beginning of what Flynn meant.\" \nSenator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also revealed his team were \"in the early stages\" of working on legislation related to the nuclear issue. \nGETTY WAR: Trump says 'nothing is off the table' when it comes to Iran \nHe added: \"Now we have a partner [Trump] that's willing to deal with Iran in the way that Iran should be dealt with... and so we're in a real different ball game.” \nBut Iranian officials have declared they will not bow down to US “bullying”. \nIran's acting commander of the Revolutionary Guard, Gen Hossein Salami, said “[Iran will] never change direction by a world power's demand, and our missile and non-missile power will be updated every day. \n\"If our missile power was not such a power to put fear into the hearts of Americans, there is no reason for these controversies.\" Is this the END of days? Monday, 9th January 2017 We live in turbulent times. Trump has the keys to nuclear weapons, and could end work to prevent climate change. Putin is looming in the East, the far-right are on the rise in Europe and Kim Jong-un is developing nuclear weapons of his own. Is this the END of days? 1 / 13 Getty Images Before his inauguration, Donald Trump asked a security expert three times during a briefing, why the US couldn't use nuclear weapons after he becomes president. \nHouthi rebels, who are allied with Iran, recently launched a suicide attack on a Saudi Arabian vessel which US defence officials believe was mistaken for a US warship . \nThe White House has declined comment. \nA US State Department official added: \"As standard policy, we do not preview sanction decisions before they are announced.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:58:42.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
