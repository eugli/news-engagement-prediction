An archived photo of the UCF Knights. (Orlando Sentinel) Gabrielle Russon athletics department received a $5 million pledge Wednesday, its largest gift ever from an alumnus.\nThe donation, which the university will receive over 10 years, is the main issue to be discussed Friday during a trustees meeting, according to the board agenda released Wednesday. \nFor Ken Dixon, a real estate developer from Kissimmee, it’s the second time he’s donated a significant sum to the school. \n“They’re going to spend the money as they need fit. I don’t like to direct it,” said Dixon, who graduated in 1975 from UCF with an accounting degree. “This is money I’m giving to the athletic department to do the things they need to do to hopefully make it a Top 25 program one of these days.” \nSome athletic needs include walkways and building signs as well as other priorities for UCF sports set by athletic director Danny White, the school documents said. \nDixon said he wanted to give money that would have a “lasting impact” to be something “around a long time, long after I’m gone.” \nWith the donation, the school will give him naming rights to what they described as an “athletics village,” pending trustee approval. The village will consist of the 95 acres where CFE Arena, Bright House Networks Football Stadium as well as the sports facilities are located. \nDixon’s name is already a familiar one around campus. \nThe accounting school is named after Dixon after he donated $2.5 million, an amount that grew larger because it was also eligible for state matching funds. He made the donation to the academic department in 2004. \nUCF Foundation CEO Michael Morsberger could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. Morsberger is leading the foundation’s $500 million fundraising campaign that officially kicked off in September. \n, @gabriellerusson , or 407-420-5470 Caption Wine pairing and soy caviar at Morimoto Asia \nLauren Delgado visits Morimoto Asia to learn about wine pairing and how to make soy caviar. \nLauren Delgado visits Morimoto Asia to learn about wine pairing and how to make soy caviar.
