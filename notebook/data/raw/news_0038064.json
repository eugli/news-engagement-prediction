(Natalie Sherman) Natalie Sherman Manufacturing Bootcamp, which aims to equip men from some of Baltimore's toughest neighborhoods with skills such as woodworking and welding and place them in jobs, are confident they're on a promising path.\nThe first group to complete the program all found employment. Some of the 12 employers who showed up to hire in January were even left hanging. \nThe Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., one of the sponsors of the program, was one of them. But President Tim Regan didn't seem to mind too much. \n\"To me it's just a great indication that we are finally starting to connect the dots between ... great human potential and great opportunities,\" Regan said Thursday at an event celebrating the kickoff for the second group. \nSagamore Development Co., owned by Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank , is working to transform the historic Recreation... \nA job fair will be held Thursday and Saturday afternoons in South Baltimore for careers in engineering, food and beverage and housekeeping at a luxury hotel opening next year in Fells Point. \nSagamore Development Co., owned by Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank , is working to transform the historic Recreation...

The men — so far, it's been all men, but it could include women too — receive a wage of $15 an hour for their time in the program. \nChristopher Simms, 30, of Baltimore was one of the eight who started at the initial boot camp. He's now working at Columbia-based HMC Inc., along with several others from the program. HMC designs and builds interiors for food-service providers, including Starbucks and Hilton Hotels & Resorts. \nSimms said he's gone through other job training programs that didn't end in employment. \n\"This is the first one that actually turned out real good,\" he said. \nThe classes are held at City Garage's makerspace, The Foundery, which is outfitted with 3-D printing equipment and other machines and is open to the public through classes and membership. \nOfficials said the latest participants were too busy to talk Thursday, as they broke into groups, feeding wooden boards through a planing machine or learning about lasers and metalwork. But during the press event, they listened intently as Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and others said they saw in them hope for the city. \n\"This is one of the most inspiring things that we in this town get to see,\" said Joe Jones, the president and CEO of the Center for Urban Families. \"African-American men who have largely been on the opportunity sidelines who are getting a chance to play the mainstream game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:35:21.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
