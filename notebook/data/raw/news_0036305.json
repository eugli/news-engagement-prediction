Most of the couples married on sight at Mashru and Gowda's Oxley townhouse, south of Brisbane. The ceremonies involved only a signing of documents and handing over of birth certificates. 'These were sham marriages,' crown prosecutor Greg Lynham told the jury in his closing address on Wednesday. Renee married a man named Manjeet (pictured) but says she was not paid what she was promised and her husband disappeared Mashru and Gowda guilty of a total 66 charges and potentially face 10 years behind bars Bride-turned-witness Leilani Rose May testified she was paid $1000 cash after marrying Amritpal Singh in 2011 and a further $250 each week into her bank account. The 25-year-old said she had never met Mr Singh before their wedding and continued to sign false documents to keep up the relationship ruse. In a statutory declaration signed in front of a justice of the peace, Ms May stated she'd met her husband at a friend's birthday party and later exchanged phone numbers. 'He's a sensitive and caring man and loves me a lot,' the document said. It further claimed Ms May was learning Punjabi, how to make the curries she loved and wanted Mr Singh's visa to be sorted as soon as possible so they could travel a bit before settling down and starting a family. But Ms May admitted it was all a lie except for one element. 'I love curries,' said. Mashru (left) told the court on Thursday he should not be punished because 'I don't believe I'm guilty'. He and Gowda (right) were remanded in custody and are due to be sentenced on Friday It took the jury a whole day of deliberations to find Mashru and Gowda guilty of a total 66 charges, 34 of which relate to Mashru helping the grooms to complete dishonest immigration applications. Mashru, who represented himself at trial, told the court on Thursday he should not be punished because 'I don't believe I'm guilty'. He and Gowda were remanded in custody and are due to be sentenced on Friday. Mr Lynham said the Crown would be asking for both to be given jail sentences with actual time spent behind bars.
