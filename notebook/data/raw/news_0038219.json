Charlie Baker chose to side-step the issue, saying he wasn't \"in a position to speak to that one.\" “I don’t know much about what goes on in New Hampshire,\" Baker told reporters following a weekly leadership meeting at the State House. “Obviously people have concerns up there and I’m sure there’s a process of redress people can pursue to determine if in fact there were any issues.”\nStory Continued Below\nTrump told senators last week that he and Republican Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if it weren’t for the “thousands” of Massachusetts residents “brought in on buses” to vote “illegally.”\nBaker did say that he opposes same-day voter registration, which is legal in New Hampshire but illegal in Massachusetts, noting the “difficult task” it poses for smaller communities. He called early voting, which went into effect in Massachusetts ahead of November’s general election, a \"big success.\"\nBaker largely stayed out of the Granite State during the 2016 election cycle, crossing state lines only once ahead of the state's primary on behalf of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:07:58.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
