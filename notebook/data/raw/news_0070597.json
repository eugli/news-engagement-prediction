Allyson Douglas-Cook told CBC Toronto over the weekend, calling it \"a fine line.\" \n\"If the hate crimes unit discovers evidence of hate, then the way the law works, depending on how that's manifested, it can either be an aggravating factor in sentencing, it can form the basis of a charge,\" Pugash said. \"But it depends on the way in which it's manifested.\" \nOn Friday, some on their way to the mosque told CBC Toronto the rally blocked them from going inside for congregational prayer. Muslims hold Friday to be the holiest day of the week. 'Celebrate Islamophobia' \nMany in support of Friday's protest outside the mosque have described it as peaceful and an expression of free speech. \nA Facebook event for the rally, entitled \"Defy M103 — Celebrate Islamophobia,\" appears to characterize the rally as a show of support for Eric Brazau, a man convicted in 2014 of wilful promotion of hatred and criminal harassment. A Facebook event for the rally, entitled 'Defy M103 — Celebrate Islamophobia,' appears to characterize the rally as a show of support for Eric Brazau, a man convicted in 2014 of wilful promotion of hatred and criminal harassment. (Facebook) \nLast March, Brazau lost an appeal for further charges of mischief, disturbance and breach of probation relating to a separate 2014 incident aboard a Toronto subway in which he denounced Islam and Muslims as part of what he termed \"a social experiment.\" \nIt's those kinds of incidents that spurred Suraia Sahar to file a formal complaint about the rally, she said. \n\"I'm a Muslim who lives in Toronto, and I have to see this every single day,\" Sahar said on Tuesday. \"It gets emotional for me. I'm 30 years old, I've been dealing with Islamophobia here in Canada for half my life. Especially after the 9/11 attacks.\" \nSahar said she felt especially threatened by the rally because it took place less than a month after a shooting left six men dead after an evening prayer at Quebec City's busiest mosque. \n\"After the Quebec shooting massacre, I was devastated. And to see our elders from our community break down into tears after losing their friends.… it really, really hurt,\" said Sahar. \n\"It concerns me not just personally but it makes me concerned for my family, for my friends, for my community … they have the audacity to do it less than a month after the Quebec mosque shooting.\" \n\"That to me, was a threat.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:29:27.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
