Most Popular Feb 2, 2017   The mayor of a small town in Texas has just made state history after coming out as transgender, the Texas Observer reports. Jess Herbst is the mayor of New Hope, Texas, a suburb with a population of less than 700 people in a very conservative county. She says she has received incredible support after coming out to her town. After serving on the town council for more than a decade, Herbst ran for an alderman position that included becoming road commissioner and mayor pro-tem in 2016. During the election cycle, the mayor suffered a heart attack and died days before the election, but still won, leaving the town without a mayor. Herbst was then appointed to the position. Most Popular In a blog post , Herbst wrote that she started to come out to a few city councilmen and local officials in November, and \"everyone was immediately accepting.\" This week, Herbst officially came out in a letter to her constituents in New Hope: \n\"As your mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories. I am transgender. Two years ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and son-in-law, I began hormone replacement therapy (HRT). At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the mayor's position, but here I am. [â€¦] I live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such.\" Herbst is now the first openly transgender mayor on record in the state of Texas. She is serving as mayor during a time when the state is debating anti-transgender \"bathroom bills,\" similar to the law enacted in North Carolina. She held her first city council meeting in 13 years as Jess this week, CBS Dallas Fort-Worth reports, and said her response has been all positive, which she didn't necessarily expect. \"I was hoping for tolerance,\" she told the station. \"What I have received is overwhelming acceptance.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:44:42.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
