(Mizzou Athletics photo) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nCOLUMBIA, MO. • Missouri’s football stadium renovation must wait for the summer for approval from university leadership, but athletics director Jim Sterk expects the process to stay on course for completion by 2019. \nThe University of Missouri Board of Curators approved the hiring of an architect to design the south end zone facility for Memorial Stadium by a five-to-one vote during Thursday’s meeting on Mizzou’s campus. Rather than vote on full approval for the project, set to cost an estimated $96.7 million, curators asked to split the approval process into two votes. Thursday’s vote also authorized design costs of $4.31 million, which already have been raised by the athletics department through private donations. \nCurators will vote again in June to approve the total project. Mizzou athletics has raised nearly $44 million in donations for the facility, Sterk said. MU has planned to cover the balance of the costs through revenue bonds financed through the university. \nThe June approval “doesn’t slow the momentum,” Sterk said after Thursday’s vote. “It doesn’t slow the timing of the process. … It gives us time to improve the financing plan we put in front of the curators.” \nThe board approved MU to hire Populous, Inc., a Kansas City architectural firm, to design the facility. \nThe proposed project is a four-story football team facility affixed to a newly constructed south side of the stadium that will feature new areas for private suites and general admission seating. Rather than build around the current south end zone structure, Missouri has decided to take down the entire south bowl and build a new structure. The redesigned south bowl will feature more premium seating options, but the stadium’s overall capacity (71,168) won’t increase, Sterk said. The capacity could decrease depending on Populous’ design, he said. The south bowl currently holds 10,800 general admission seats. \nPending board approval, MU will begin construction this summer and continue through the season, but current south end zone seats won’t be disrupted for the 2017 season, Sterk said. MU plans to take down the south end zone section after the final home game, set for Nov. 11 against Tennessee. \nThat assumes the board will approve funding when it meets June 22-23 in Columbia. \nPamela Quigg Henrickson of Jefferson City was the only curator who voted against Thursday’s measure. She didn’t voice any opinions about the proposal during the public discussion. \nRyan Rapp, the UM system’s chief audit executive, formally introduced the measure before voting took place. \n“The project is important to MU athletics to remain competitive in the SEC,” Rapp said. “It’s an important part of the recruiting process. Additionally MU athletics is a self-sustaining operation that supports the campus. The success of MU athletics has a direct impact on MU’s ability to not only recruit student-athletes but helps the campus grow and maintain enrollments.” \nRapp said delaying the project approval another four months “allows us to better understand what our fiscal picture is going to look like going forward.” \nSterk said he’s sensitive to the state’s current economic climate — newly elected Gov. Eric Greitens plans budget cuts for higher education — but pointed to the project’s financial impact as measured by a recent study by consultant firm Convention, Sports and Leisure. The study projects a $700 million regional impact from the project along with 1,200 new jobs, MU announced in December. \nThe June approval decision also allows Mizzou to raise more money for the project. \n“If in fact we approve this, (athletics fundraising is) not slowing down,” curator Phillip Snowden said. “They’re going to continue to raise private dollars to add to the number as we go forward.” \nCurator John Phillips of Kansas City said he was reluctantly in favor of the project in light of the fiscal challenges the board faces. \n“I think it might be helpful to say a lot of us raise our eyebrows at the amount we devote to athletics, myself included,” he said. “But I’m convinced this particular project would benefit the entire university, particularly the MU campus. There’s such private support for it, it’s hard to say no. So, I’m a reluctant yes. I do appreciate in this time where we have restricted funds we can have a project that’s well-funded at this point privately. I think we have to explore it.” \nCurators Donald Cupps (Cassville), Maurice Graham (Clayton) and David Steelman (Rolla) also voted in favor of the proposal but did not speak during the public discussion. \nDave Matter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:53:26.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
