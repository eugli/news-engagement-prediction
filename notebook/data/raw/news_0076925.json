She said the FBI doesn't think there's much to the allegations, but it's not time to worry about Sessions' role in the investigation.\n\"I don't think we're there yet,\" she said.\nHuckabee Sanders said the investigations will find no connection between Trump's campaign and the Russian government. Multiple media reports during the last few months have cited intelligence sources saying as many as four Trump associates were in contact with the Russian government during the campaign.\n  Huckabee Sanders said the FBI has told the White House that's not true. She said the congressional investigations and any other investigations are going to show the campaign was innocent.\n\"We're extremely confident that whatever review, they're all going to come to the same conclusion, that we had no involvement in this,\" she said.\nHuckabee Sanders said the administration is trying to focus on doing what Trump campaigned on, such as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\nA new analysis given to governors on Saturday showed millions may lose their healthcare under a Republican plan being written in Congress. Huckabee Sanders declined to say if Trump would sign a bill slashing healthcare coverage after promising not to just before he took office.\n\"I'm not going to speak specifically for the president, but what I can say is that he's made it a high priority\" to keep people on their coverage, she said.\n  Report: GOP healthcare plan would end coverage for millions Report was prepared for governors preparing to meet in Washington\nBy Kyle Feldscher â€¢ 02/26/17 10:36 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:48:12.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
