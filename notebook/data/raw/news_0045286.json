The weekly breakdown is three hours of workshops, five hours of work, and some mentoring. All up it goes for seven weeks. The entire course takes place online - the participants never go to the office of the business they are working for. \nThe first two partner companies are Scentre Group Westfield, the shopping centre operator with assets of $40 billion, and Foyster Media, a digital publisher with eight employees, some part-time. \nRobyn Foyster, CEO of Foyster Media, told Hack it was not an internship. \n\"It's actually a course,\" she said. \nPaper Plane has not registered with national or state bodies designed to ensure some minimum standard of quality and oversight for training courses. \n\"We have had an overwhelming response to our latest campaign,\" Managing Director Mike O'Brien told Hack . \"People are crying out for opportunity to prove their value and show employers they have the skills that are in demand.\" \nThis is not an internship - this is about learning.\" \nOthers disagree. Keelia Fitzpatrick, co-ordinator at the Young Workers Centre, said the Paper Plane model fitted the common broad definition of an internship. \"It's a work experience program for a specific period of time when a person is using their skills and applying it to productive work in that company, but with some training and development attached,\" she said. ... but should anyone pay to work? \nWhether or not it's an internship, the obvious big ethical question here is: should anyone be paying for the privilege of working for a business? In this case, the partner companies do not get any money from the participants - the $1,500 all goes to Paper Plane - but they do get their labour and ideas, and they can cultivate new talent for free. \nHave you ever paid to do an internship? \nMr O'Brien said industry was under pressure to innovate because of the \"disruptive\" effect of digital technology. Asked if they should be paying employees for the innovation, he said it was unfair to think all businesses could afford the resources. \n\"That is still to me putting employers in a box and saying that they're not made of people, they're massively wealthy, and have all these resources,\" Mr O'Brien said. \n\"This isn't just about massive employers, this is about strong employers - people who want to invest in a diverse ecosystem. \n\"Maybe we need to shift our thinking about employers a bit as well. \n\"Businesses are ultimately made up of people.\" \nThe first two projects, with Westfield and Foyster Media, will start in early March. Mr O'Brien said there were 4-5 spots available on the 10-12-person courses. Why would you sign up? \nTwo developments are driving the popularity of internships - the tightening labour market and the normalisation of internship programs. \nIn the last decade, internships have boomed in Australia - about 58 per cent of young people have done unpaid work experience in the past five years, according to a 2017 report by the Commonwealth Department of Employment. \nInterns also said they were generally satisfied - about a quarter reported their internship led to paid work with the host organisations. \nBut while internships may be good for individual applicants, it's not clear how the internship trend has been good for graduates. They are now competing harder for the same number of graduate jobs. In fact, youth unemployment has gone up: 13 per cent - the rate of youth unemployment, (compared to a low of 7.6 per cent in 2009); 1 in 6 - the number of young people reporting being under-employed , compared to 1 in 30 in the 1970s; 4.7 years - the time it takes for graduates to find full-time work. \nUniversities eager to improve their graduate employment statistics have partnered with internship brokerages such as Navitas. The ASX-listed company offers a \"professional internship program\" where the intern pays $2,000 for a 16-week placement. Navitas is partnered with 11 publicly funded Australian universities. Its website includes testimony from one architecture graduate who paid $2,000 for a placement with Coca-Cola Amatil. He found it \"beneficial\". \n\"It boggles the mind that someone would be paying one of the biggest multinationals in the world to provide their labour to them,\" Keelia Fitzpatrick from the Young Workers Centre told Hack . \nYou can't make this stuff up.\" \nThe intern may have the best chance of getting the job, but work experience tends to get devalued as it becomes more common. This creates a cycle of demand. Hack was able to find over 40 internship brokers operating in Australia. Of these, about five were partnered with Australian universities. \n\"These large publicly listed companies who facilitate internships are frequently allowed onto campuses to attend career days,\" Keelia Fitzpatrick said. \n\"Or they enter formal partnerships with universities. Almost all universities at the moment have relationships with these kinds of companies.\" 'This is the future' \nPaper Plane is not affiliated with any Australian universities, although it is connected to Laureate International Universities, the world's largest for-profit higher education company. Laureate International operates Torrens University in South Australia. \nPaper Plane MD Mike O'Brien said his startup was \"disrupting\" the conventional higher education model of multi-year degrees in single disciplines. \n\"We're not anti-university, we're anti-traditional education,\" he said. \nHe said uni students were currently paying \"exorbitant amounts of money to get a qualification that doesn't even necessarily get them a job.\" \n\"We're about creating multiple projects that people will be able to enrol in. By the time they've experienced 5-6 projects for the quarter of a cost of a degree they will have been certified by 6-7 employers and recommended for skills they've demonstrated.\" \n\"Traditional education was set-up to meet the needs of an industrial age. \n\"What's happening with digital disruption is that all industries are getting disrupted really quickly now - advances in automation and robotics, the internet of things, immersive technology - these are all things that change what people need to learn really quickly.\" \n\"Anything that is going to prepare people better for the future of work should be embraced.\" ... but regulation 'stuck in the past' \nThe future of education may be in \"agile\" \"disruptive\" Paper Plane programs, but, according to Keelia Fitzpatrick, the regulation remains stuck in the past. \nInternships outside of vocational courses, including potentially the seven-week program offered by Paper Plane, are not covered by the Fair Work Act. The FWA does set some rules around unpaid internships - they may be illegal where the intern is doing productive work for a long period of time, and the employer is getting the most benefit. In 2015, the Fair Work Ombudsman investigated an Adelaide-based law firm that asked junior lawyers to pay $22,000 to secure an internship - the law firm later backed down. \nBut outside of ruling out grossly unfair cases, the FWA doesn't set any rules for non-vocational internships. Compare this to France where interns are given lunch vouchers and paid a minimum amount when the placement lasts for more than two months. \n\"The Fair Work Act doesn't even go near the idea someone would be paying to do this kind of work experience,\" Keelia said. \n\"It simply hasn't caught up with this new grey area where they're not in studies and not doing internships as part of their studies. \nHack was provided with the results of a bot program that has been trawling online ad sites for internships since July 2015. All up, there were more than 4,000 ads over the 20-month period. \nHere's a snapshot: Accounting, Sydney : A well established tax firm in Edgecliff is looking for a reliable hardworking and career oriented Accounting Taxation Trainee on voluntary unpaid basis; Graphic design, Melbourne : Opportunity for 3-6 month internship for current 3rd year university student or recent graduate with marketing graphic design qualification; Fashion, Melbourne : This is an exciting opportunity to get behind the scenes of the fashion industry as well as the chance to establish industry networks; Design, Melbourne : Australian-born brand creating a global community of dream chasers and action takers; Social media, Sydney : Assist source and draft content. Posting content to LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook Manage twitter followers. Unpaid internship for 3 months; Copywriting, Melbourne : This internship is unpaid for 2 days per week for 12 weeks Social Media amp Community Management Copywriter Communication Internship. \nThe Young Workers Centre and Internships Australia as well as other groups are calling for a parliamentary inquiry into internships. \n\"What relevant government regulator would ensure interns rights are being protected and employers aren't doing dodgy things?\" Keelia said. \nMr O'Brien said programs like Paper Plane were not only for young graduates. He said some of his clients were mid-career professionals who were trying to \"pivot away from what they have studied in university\" but did not have time for a diploma. \n\"What we need to remember is the idea that having a degree support you through a 40-50-year career journey - those days are over.\" \nThe future, he said, was about \"lifelong learning\" and \"agile\" courses. \n\"Ultimately, we're putting better and more opportunities in the hands of learners to be able to drive their own learning. \n\"If we can get people from zero to hero at a fraction of what they would pay for a qualification, then we're doing a lot for the future of learning.\" Credits ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:50:10.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
