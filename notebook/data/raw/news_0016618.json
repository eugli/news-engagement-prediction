(Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Buy Photo \nJonathan Byrd's has ended its business partnership with the city-operated Grand Park Events Center and is re-evaluating its role in other facilities at Westfield's Grand Park sports campus. \nBusiness Development Director Jonathan Byrd II said the company closed its restaurant and its lounge Jan. 29 at the facility, a 370,000-square foot indoor soccer arena and events center that opened in July at Grand Park. The company also has ceased to manage marketing for events at the center under a related agreement. \nWestfield operates the privately-built $25.7 million facility and was heavily involved with backing its financing through a public-private deal with developer Holladay Properties. The center is an anchor at the 400-acre city-owned sports park that's become a draw for competitive youth sports teams across the Midwest. \n\"While we appreciate our relationships with all those involved and have enjoyed working within Westfield and Grand Park. It was during an evaluation of our long-term business plans that we determined that the company would no longer remain at the park,\" Byrd said in an email. \nByrd declined to release terms of the separation. Westfield Mayor Andy Cook, his chief of staff Todd Burtron and spokeswoman Erin Murphy could not be reached. \nByrd Enterprises and the city entered into the 10-year lease on Sept. 21, 2016. Under the agreement Byrd was to pay $406,016 in base rent the first year, in monthly installments of $33,835, plus other operating costs. The base amount was to increase 2 percent annually. \n\"We have a great relationship with the city, and we have much admiration for the city of Westfield, as well as for Grand Park and all that is going on,\" Byrd said in the email. \nByrd Enterprise is re-evaluating other partnerships relating to Grand Park. \nByrd Enterprises continues to operate a cafe and concession stand and retain naming rights at the nearby privately built and operated 88,000-square foot Jonathan Byrd's Fieldhouse , a smaller indoor facility adjacent to Grand Park used for basketball and volleyball. \nHowever, fieldhouse owner Andy Card said Byrd Enterprises has contacted him about their partnership. \n\"We are in negotiations with them about their long-term strategies,\" Card said. \"In the near term, they will continue to operate it. I haven't had a lot of discussions to be honest with you. I think they are just evaluating their long-term plans.\" \nWestfield and Byrd Enterprises also have paused plans to develop a hotel at Grand Park. In 2015, the city selected Byrd Enterprises for a public-private partnership to build the hotel. At the time, plans to build private hotels were progressing slowly and city officials were trying to fill a void in the market. \nSince the project was approved, though, construction has begun on two privately owned hotels near Grand Park, a Hampton Inn and a Cambria Suites. \nCall IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at (317) 444-6036.
