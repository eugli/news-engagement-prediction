(Photo: AP) \nThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 25-point lead and allowed 31 unanswered points in their Super Bowl 51 loss to the New England Patriots. As we've discussed extensively, Atlanta sports teams just have the worst luck . \nOne fan, in all his misery, stepped up to do something about it. This fan buried the jersey he wore during Super Bowl 51 and attached a note. A friend of mine buried his Falcons jersey today... pic.twitter.com/CK7ikOlGfV — Belle Es You (@SouthernbeLLSU) February 7, 2017 \nBut let's not overlook the note because it carried a critically important message: THIS JERSEY IS BAD LUCK. \nThe note reads: \nIf you have un-earthed this, you have not found anything vintage or cool. This shirt is bad luck…Seriously re-bury it immediately. \nIf you are still curious and don't believe me, Google Super Bowl 51. This shirt blew a 25 point lead. \nPut it back! Trust me! \nIt probably wouldn't hurt if every Falcons fan followed along and discarded of the gear they wore during Super Bowl 51. Nobody wants to carry that kind of bad luck.
