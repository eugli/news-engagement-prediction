Lots and lots of communities live and work there and that's part of the glory of London.\"\nSasha Simic, Hackney resident and activist \n\"It's come as a bit of shock that in the heart of Dalston (an area in Hackney) that there's a place putting a platform up for these poisonous ideas,\" he said, adding: \"There are very few places in London that are more multicultural than Hackney.\"\n\"The thing about Hackney is its diversity. Lots and lots of communities live and work there and that's part of the glory of London.\"\nDiego has denied she is a racist and told local outlet, the Hackney Gazette, that an art gallery needed \"to be able to open discourse\".\nHowever, Simic dismissed the idea that the works are merely artistic expression as \"nonsense, absolute nonsense\".\n\"I think we need to be clear, this woman agrees with the agenda of what's going on, that's been confirmed by her Facebook posts,\" he said referring to a leaked Facebook conversation involving Diego, where she appears to defend Trump's ban on Muslims entering the US .\n\"I don't like using the term alt-right, but she has clear fascist sympathies.\n\"There is no artistic right for the persecution of other people or for expressing the idea that another group of people are manifestly inferior.\"\nThe campaign group 'Shut Down LD50', which is leading the fight against Diego, also accuses her of leaking the identities of her critics to far-right organisations.\nUntil Friday - when the post was deleted - the gallery's website published screenshots of social media posts made by its critics on its front page.\nDiego also recommended journalists seeking more information contact an openly racist Twitter account for comment, later telling the Hackney Gazette, that she did so because it was \"funny\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:38:41.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
