A killer business plan can help you turn it into a successful business. Creating a well-crafted business plan is no easy task, however. You'll need to not only flesh out your idea, but also have a deep understanding of the different aspects of running a business — before you even start one. \nFiguring out how to do this correctly is hard enough, but there are several tools available to make this arduous task a little bit easier for would-be entrepreneurs. Instead of starting from scratch, here are a collection of business plan templates, software, apps and services to help you start a business the right way with a professional business plan. Business plan templates \nBusiness plan templates show you exactly what a business plan is supposed to look like and what goes in each section. You can find them as downloadable sample business plans that you can copy and modify to fit your business, or as fill-in-the-blank or question-and-answer forms. There are also different types of business plans: simple business plans that cover the essentials, comprehensive ones that cover every aspect of a business, and those designed for a specific purpose, such as to raise funding or find business partners. Here are some business plan templates worth considering. \nThe $100 Startup One-Page Business Plan.
