TREVOR READ/FAIRFAX NZ \nOne of Len Lye's biggest pieces, Blade, is currently out of commission. \nAgain there is no agreement yet between the Len Lye Foundation and the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery as to who pays for the cost of the monitoring and maintenance of this massive piece. \nThe New Plymouth District Council funds the gallery and Len Lye Centre to the tune of $4.16 million a year. The gallery itself raises about $650,000 a year. That could rise next year with some hire fees at the centre set to double. \nHiring the Todd Energy Foyer is set to go from $300 an evening to $600 while a full day at one of the education studios will go from $200 to $400, or $300 to $600 if you want to use both at the same time. \nThere are many positives in the report to the committee, including more visitors over Christmas than expected, with an average of 900 visitors a day between December 26 and January 8. Ad Feedback \nSince the LLC opened in July 2015 there have been 141,992 visitors to the art centre. \nCentre director Simon Rees said the kinetic sculptures were machines and just like motor vehicles needed regular maintenance. \n\"It's an ongoing process.\" \nThey do maintenance work on Tuesdays when the centre is closed, he said. \nThere's a volume of work, he said, because their engineers repair and do maintenance on Len Lye's sculptures all around the world. And, while the other institutions pay for the work, there is limited staff resources. \nAn engineer can't be in Chicago and New Plymouth at the same time, he said. \nNew Plymouth district councillor Shaun Biesiek said there was a difference between repairs and maintenance. \n\"We need to maintain and oil and grease, but that's different than when they're breaking down. A break is a fault, it shouldn't be on the ratepayer.\" \nThe problem could be solved by an entry fee, he said. \n\"Costs have blown, because so many people have visited and it costs more to man and all that sort of stuff. You can control that with a door charge.\" \nCouncillor John McLeod said maintenance and conservation of the works should be done by the Len Lye Foundation, not the ratepayers. \nHe thought there had been a maintenance budget at one stage, so would be bringing it up at the meeting, he said. \nThe Len Lye Committee meets on Monday at 3pm. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:37:26.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
