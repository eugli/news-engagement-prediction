The novelty factor. The fun of administering it. The fact that it goes with a vast range of delectable puddings.\nSome people even like to incorporate it into, er, more adult activities, which is totally up to them.\nThe point is, it has a pretty solid and positive public image.\nSadly, an incident on Tuesday at the Greenhithe branch of Asda threatens to tarnish this very image.\nWhat should have been a straightforward and uneventful shopping trip for one customer turned into something very different when they witnessed a fellow customer do something \"vile.\"\nTaking to the Dartford Gossip Facebook page , the customer's story unfolded, and they issued a stark warning.\n\"Caught a bloke putting a canister of cream in his mouth,\" began the post.\n\"[He] filled his mouth then promptly put lid on and put back on shelf for some other customer to buy.\"\ndisgruntled customer's facebook comment (Photo: Kent Live,Facebook) The customer and witness then decided to confront the man. However, the cream-thief could not be reasoned with.\n\"When confronted I was then subjected to threatening, vile behaviour,\" the customer added.\nThings reportedly went from bad to worse. \"The general manager was happy for this excuse of a human being to buy his shopping and pass through checkout and walk right out of shop without being challenged,\" the post fumed.\nIt was then rounded off with a warning:\n\"People check what you buy is sealed as you can't guarantee where it may have been!\"\nAll responses to the story shared in the author's disgust.\nRead More Mum's supermarket trip completely nails the reality of doing a weekly shop with your partner ASDA Greenhithe (Photo: Google) One man issued a damning indictment of the human condition, saying: \"When are people going to wise up and realise, the human is the most vile, disgusting, greedy animal on the planet.\"\nAsda have since responded, saying:\n\"We are aware of a disagreement between two customers in our Greenhithe store but as there were no colleagues present at the time the discussion took place there is little else we can comment on.\n\"When the store manager was made aware of the matter and went to talk to the customers to find out what happened, they had already gone their separate ways.\n\"We work hard to make sure all our customers enjoy shopping at Asda and we take all complaints seriously.\"\nThe moral of the story? Don't eat yellow snow and check the seal on your squirty cream before you buy it.\nRead More Why you definitely should stop using these everyday household items in 2017 Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorWeirdNews Subscribe to our Daily Asda", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://www.facebook.cim/Dartford-Gossip-page-441688112603698/?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorWeirdNews", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-16T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:17:40.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
