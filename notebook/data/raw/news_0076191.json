Those opposing the bill, including women who called themselves pro-life, worried about providing women with conflicting information. \n\"The claims of a medical reversal are not supported by a body of science…. It’s wrong,\" Rep. Linda Lawson, D- Hammond, said. \"This bill seeks to dictate medical practice based on junk science. This is not true.\" \nA medical abortion requires patients to take two different medicines spread out over the course of a few days. In order to reverse the effects, advocates of the bill say patients need to be given a high level of progesterone after the first of the two abortion medicines is taken. \n\"We’re just saying you have the right to try,\" said Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn. \"We’re not saying it’s going to work.\" \nLawmakers struggled to get the bill out of committee last week. The House Public Policy Committee voted 7-6 for House Bill 1128 7-6, but House Speaker Brian Bosma sent the bill back to committee, citing several issues. \nA main concern that the bill initially required abortion providers to use an ultrasound to determine the age of the fetus. That requirement was removed from the legislation once it returned to committee. \nThe committee then passed the legislation for a second time by the same narrow vote. \nThe measure now heads to the Indiana Senate for further consideration. \nRead more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:20:32.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
