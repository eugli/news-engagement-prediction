After winning the first leg in Nnewi, the Nigerian side were handed a similar 1-0 defeat by the Egyptian side, after extra time and in the ensuing penalties, the latter converted three of their spot kicks while Ifeanyi Ubah failed to score, putting an abrupt end to their campaign in the Confederation Cup. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:22:19.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
