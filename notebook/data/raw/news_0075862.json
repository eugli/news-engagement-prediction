A deceitful justification for aggression and war.\n\"Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever.\"\n'Stand in solidarity' The Salesman tells the story of a married couple who are appearing in a local production of Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman and whose lives are thrown into turmoil after the wife is attacked while alone at home, sparking the husband to seek revenge.\nAsghar Farhadi sent a recorded message to those watching the London screening All six directors nominated in the best foreign language film category had signed a statement before the ceremony condemning a \"climate of fascism\" in the US.\nFarhadi, whose movie A Separation won the same category in 2012, had organised a free screening of The Salesman in London's Trafalgar Square on Sunday.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan told the crowds: \"President Trump cannot silence me.
