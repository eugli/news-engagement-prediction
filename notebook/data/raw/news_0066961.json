So, when he was summoned for jury duty on Wednesday, he had no excuse to get out of it. Trea Turner is not at Nats camp today because he has been summoned for jury duty. Lol real life sucks - Jamal Collier (@JamalCollier) February 22, 2017 \nWhat do you think it's like when a Major Leaguer serves as a juror? Does he relate everything back to baseball, looking for objective truth like an umpire? Does he turn to his fellow jurors and say things like , \"Our job is to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat\"? \nWell, whatever Turner did, it worked. He is apparently as quick at serving his duty as a citizen of the United States as he is in the outfield : He appeared in court, Turner said, and was told he wasn't needed on Wednesday. Justice has been served! Back to work! #GuiltyOrNotGuilty - Trea Turner (@treavturner) February 22, 2017 \nTurner said he was just glad to avoid a two-week stint on a jury. His manager, for what it's worth, would've understood: \n\"When they call, you don't have much choice,\" Dusy Baker said. \"[Turner] seemed pretty happy about not doing it though.\" \nEither way, it wasn't long before he was back at his day job: And he's back in camp pic.twitter.com/cD6nB7Hgko - Jamal Collier (@JamalCollier) February 22, 2017 This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs. more from cut4 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:30:19.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
