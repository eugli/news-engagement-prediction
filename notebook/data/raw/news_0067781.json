Notable potential suspects include Gollum and teammate Julian Edelman for their love of rings and Jaws for its violent history.\nHere’s the complete list:\nSwiper, the antagonist in Dora the Explorer Scooby, one of Brady’s three dogs Lady Gaga, Super Bowl LI halftime show performer Jaws Prison Mike, one of Michael Scott’s alter egos in The Office “Creepy Me,” courtroom sketch of Brady Norman Snively, alcoholic clown from Airbud O’Doyle family, bullies from Billy Madison Gary Oak, Ash Ketchum’s rival in Pokémon Gollum Crab people from South Park Pyat Pree, a warlock from Game of Thrones Julian Edelman, Patriots wide receiver Edelman, also known as a “sneaky lil squirrel,” posted a response on Instagram shortly after Brady called him out. The Patriots wide receiver stuck to the Good Will Hunting reference from Brady’s original caption and photoshopped his head onto Chuckie Sullivan.\n@tombrady we'Il find it one day bubs…but until that day comes, keep your ear to the grindstone\nA post shared by Julian Edelman (@edelman11) on Feb 22, 2017 at 10:54am PST", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/tombrady/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0x39UBjPq/?hl=en", "https://www.facebook.com/TomBrady/photos/pb.214003275307497.-2207520000.1487783980./1457718784269267/?type=3&theater", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0x39UBjPq/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:40:34.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
