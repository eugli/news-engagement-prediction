The phenomenon has tripled since 2013, Netflix says. According to the company's data, 48% of streaming couples in the U.S. include at least one partner who has \"cheated\" on the other. It isn't just an American pastime. It's happening around the world. Read More Mexico and Brazil have the most cheaters (58% and 57%, respectively), while the Netherlands has the most faithful viewers, with 73% of them remaining true. We don't mean to. It just sort of happens. Of those who cheated, 80% said it was unplanned. \"Nearly two-thirds (58%) of cheaters in the U.S. admitted they were unfaithful to their streaming partner due to 'an uncontrollable desire to find out what's next,'\" the study says. There's also a lot of \"sorry, not sorry\" going on. Three in five say they would cheat more if they could be assured they wouldn't be caught. And how are folks stepping out? Mostly waiting until their partners fall asleep, though some said \"sleep cheating\" shouldn't really count. More than half are watching dramas over comedies without their loves. The shows that are the most tempting? \"Orange is The New Black,\" \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Breaking Bad,\" \"House of Cards\" and \"Marvel's Daredevil.\" While many folks don't take this kind of infidelity very seriously, 40% of those polled in Hong Kong said they believed that watching ahead of your partner is worse than having an actual affair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:46:43.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
