Manchester City’s thoughts will have already turned to Monaco in the Champions League, while promotion-chasing Huddersfield’s priorities were made clear by the stadium announcer at half time. “Pep Guardiola thinks this is the biggest match of our season,” he shouted. “We’ve got Reading on Tuesday so it isn’t even our biggest match of the week.” \nCity made eight changes for this FA Cup tie, Town seven, though both managers like to mix things up a little when they can. One of Guardiola’s alterations saw the return of Claudio Bravo in goal, and the City manager will have been as gratified as the fans behind him in the away end to see the Chilean deal with the first shot he had to face. Rajiv van La Parra’s effort was not exactly scorching, it must be said, but Bravo has been so low on confidence of late it is almost a surprise to see him stop anything. \nCity came back with a chance of their own, Joel Coleman saving from Nolito then Mark Hudson clearing the follow up effort from Jesús Navas off the line. The visitors should really have taken the lead midway through the first half when a route-one punt up the middle went all the way through to Sergio Agüero on the edge of the Huddersfield box. For a split second, As Agüero reached the ball before backpedalling defenders and the onrushing goalkeeper, a first-time shot might have lifted the ball into an empty net. Agüero chose to take a touch, however, and had to turn away from goal in the process, so his eventual lob was guesswork and went high over the bar. \nA fingertip save from a Jack Payne free-kick provided a further boost to Bravo’s confidence before Agüero carved out a chance for Fabian Delph, only for the midfielder’s control to let him down in the area. Nolito shot narrowly wide and Agüero brought a save from Coleman before the interval as City stepped up the pressure, though Huddersfield were willing to trade punches. Van La Parra forced Bravo into action again at the end of the half, frustratingly with another tame shot that was far to close to the goalkeeper. \nPart of the reason the sides seemed so evenly matched was that without Yaya Touré, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne the visitors could neither hold the ball in midfield nor move it forward as smoothly as they would have liked. Delph has his admirers, but he looked rusty here and even at his best he is not in the same class as that trio. David Wagner, the Huddersfield manager, sent on two attacking substitutes after an hour in an attempt to win the game, Guardiola waited a few more minutes before introducing De Bruyne and Leroy Sané. Delph was booed as he made his way off the pitch; they have long memories in these parts for people who used to play for Leeds. \nThe substitutions did nor really make much difference. De Bruyne showed too much of the ball to the goalkeeper when Navas played him into the area in the last 10 minutes, though City’s best chance of a goal had been and gone a few minutes earlier. Navas was not having the most influential of games, but he made his way to the byline on the right and sent a low cross right across the face of goal. Agüero should have been somewhere in the six-yard box ready to pounce but no City player was available to provide the touch that was required and the ball ran through to the opposite wing. Agüero did arrive in the right place right at the end of four minutes of added time, but he put a header well wide and that was that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:15:36.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
