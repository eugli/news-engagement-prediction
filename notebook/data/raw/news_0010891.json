A number of savage blows are landed during the scrap (Photo: DRN) Read More \nThe mobile is then passed around by inmates who take turns filming. One prisoner even films himself using the phone - despite risking an extra two years on his sentence. \nOne says: \"The wing's empty, you know.\" \nOther inmates can be heard saying \"keep the door locked, man\" and \"gang members only\". \nA prisoner steps then forward to quiet the rabble, saying: \"All right then, let's sort it out. Anyone over-talking, we're battering ourselves.\" \nThe prisoners back away and the fighters attack on the count of three. \nThe first fighter immediately rocks his opponent with two savage punches. \nThe opponent then lands one in return but is knocked backwards into the crowd by a flurry of blows to the head. \nThe prisoners push him back into the fray, shouting: \"Go on, and again. Come on.\" The full footage lasts five minutes (Photo: DRN) Read More Jails are 'full of drugs' says chief prisons inspector as he blasts 'failure of leadership' \nHe is backed up against the wall and hit with another powerful combination, prompting calls of \"grab him\" and \"woo-hoo\" from the inmates. \nPinning him into a corner, the first fighter eventually floors his rival with several right hands to the chin. \nThe crowd swarms around as he rains punches down on the man, filming it on mobile phones and shouting: \"Finish him. Finish him, blood. MMA, blood.\" \nThe beaten fighter curls up and desperately tries to shield his face from the onslaught. \nIt is eventually halted when one inmate says: \"Stop, stop, stop, he ain't defending.\" \nThe video was uploaded anonymously to Facebook last week but it is not clear when the footage was taken. \nHMP Featherstone is a Category C men's prison which houses more than 600 inmates. \nIn August last year, a major incident was declared at the jail after inmates set fires and assaulted guards in a week-long outbreak of disorder.
