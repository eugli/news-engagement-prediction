(Getty Images) \nSanti Cazorla has been ruled out for the rest of the season, according to reports. \nThe Daily Mail claims that the 32-year-old will not play another game this term as he continues his recovery from an Achilles tendon injury. \nThe Spaniard last featured for Arsenal in their 6-0 victory over Ludogorets Razgrad on October 19 and was initially rested after swelling formed in his ankle. \nBut after missing a month of action, Cazorla needed surgery to fix the problem at the start of December. Cazorla has been sidelined since October 16. (Getty Images) \nFollowing his operation, Arsenal estimated that Cazorla would be sidelined for around three months, but Arsene Wenger revealed at the start of January that the midfielder’s recovery was taking longer than expected.
