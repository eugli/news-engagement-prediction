Public sector beats private \nPrivate sector workers saw wage rises of 1.8 per cent over the year, a record low, and 0.4 per cent over the December quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. \nPublic sector workers fared marginally better, with wage increases of 0.6 per cent over the December quarter and 2.3 per cent over the year to the December quarter. \nWorkers in the health care, social assistance, education and training industries saw some of the highest annual wage increases of 2.4 per cent. \nJP Morgan senior economist Tom Kennedy wrote in a note that the ongoing weakness in wages growth suggested that core inflation will remain below two per cent, the bottom of the Reserve Bank's inflation target, for some time. \nMr Kennedy said the rise in the jobless rate since 2013 and a surge in profits taken by employers had kept a lid on wages and he said JP Morgan expected the RBA to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in August and in November to boost the economy. \n\"The industry data reveal a broad deceleration in wage growth across all of Australia's sectors in recent years,\" he noted. \nNational Australia Bank's economists said the data indicated the low point for wages had been reached, with private data, such as NAB's business survey and figures from employment website Seek, suggesting that wages were on the rise. \nReserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warned today that record high household debt and record low wage rises were constraining consumer spending and hurting the economy. \nMr Lowe noted that wage growth \"is not expected to decline further.\" \nBut Capital Economics chief economist for Australia and New Zealand Paul Dales disagreed, saying that wages could start to decrease. \n\"The stagnation in overall wage growth at a record low in the fourth quarter and the fall in private wage growth to a new record low is a bit of a blow to the RBA,\" he argued. \n\"\"If wage growth doesn't rise as fast as the RBA expects, then underlying inflation will probably remain below 2 per cent for longer. \n\"With CPI inflation having risen to 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, and due to rise to 2 per cent early this year, real wages may soon fall. \n\"That will restrain consumption growth and overall GDP growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:58:58.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
