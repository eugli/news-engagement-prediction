Increasing the ratio to five parts water halved arsenic levels and soaking it overnight cut the toxin levels the most. It comes after the Food Standards Agency warned against overcooking potatoes and toast because of increased levels of the cancer-causing chemical acrylamide. Arsenic gets into the rice as a result of industrial contaminants and pesticides that were used in the past and can remain in flooded paddy fields for decades Acrylamide, which is also found in tobacco smoke, has been shown to cause cancer in animal tests. The evidence suggests that all age groups, but particularly children, are consuming more acrylamide than they should. HOW TO LIVE LONGER Eating brown rice could prevent an early death, research suggested last year. Experts at Harvard University found just one 16g serving per day of whole grain cuts the risk of dying from any cause, heart disease or cancer. And, they argued, the more whole grains people eat, the bigger the benefits. Their analysis of studies showed that for every single serving (16g) of whole grains, there was a 7 per cent drop in risk of death from any cause. Typically, rice has ten times more inorganic arsenic than other foods and the European Food Standards Authority has reported that people who eat a lot are exposed to worrying concentrations. Chronic exposure can cause a range of health problems including developmental problems, heart disease, diabetes and nervous system damage. However, most worrying are lung and bladder cancers. Professor Meharg has previously suggested that cooking rice in a coffee perculator would stop any arsenic from binding to the rice. By allowing steaming hot water to drip through the rice, contaminants will be washed away. In previous experiments, there was a 57 per cent reduction in arsenic with a ratio of 12 parts of water to one of rice and in some cases as much as 85 per cent. The latest investigation will be shown on tonight’s episode of the BBC’s Trust Me, I’m a Doctor.
