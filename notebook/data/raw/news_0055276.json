They're likely counting on it. The team that is known for its signature, chip-on-your-shoulder brand of toughness is 26-4 and 16-1, which is complemented by a RPI of 40. The Shockers' overall résumé, which features only one top-50 win, puts them as the first team out in USA TODAY Sports' latest bracketology. \nIn the same week they jumped to No. 25 in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll , Wichita might just sneak into the field of 68 projections as a heavy contender for an at-large bid. Credit that to the fact that WSU keeps winning as well as a relatively weak bubble with fringe teams (ahem, Indiana) continually losing. \nShould we be surprised? Maybe, considering the emergence of Illinois State — another bubble team with a better RPI (33) but uglier, résumé-staining losses. Midway through the season, the Redbirds took it to the Shockers in a 76-62 decision, as if to say the Valley was no longer theirs. Marshall and Co. weren't having it. Their next meeting against an injury-prone Illinois State was a statement win if there is such a thing. They clobbered the Redbirds by 41 points in Wichita. And that trend has continued here in February as March nears. They obliterated Northern Iowa by 29 points this past weekend and destroyed Evansville by 26 on Tuesday night. On their 10-game winning streak, only one of those wins wasn't decided by double figures. Although the selection committee won't necessarily use this data, it's kind of impossible to ignore when comparing to a power conference team six games below .500. \n\"Last year we weren't supposed to be in, then we have Arizona down by 25,\" Marshall told reporters last week . \"They were a No. 6 seed. You gotta ask Sean Miller and teams that have played us. How good are they? Do you want to see them in your bracket?\" \nThe departure of All-Americans Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker seemed to leave the cupboard bare for 2016-17. But in reality, WSU's success has never been about individual players. In fact, the Shockers' team that went to the Final Four was hardly Marshall's best team. It was just the one no one saw coming. \n► No. 1 seeds: Villanova, Kansas, Gonzaga, North Carolina \n► Last four in: Syracuse, Tennessee, TCU, Kansas State \n► First four out: Wichita State, Clemson, Vanderbilt, Illinois \n► Others considered for at-large bids (in no particular order): Georgetown, Wake Forest, Providence, Georgia Tech, Alabama, Pittsburgh, Indiana \n► On life support: Rhode Island, Houston, Ohio State, Georgia, Ole Miss, Penn State. \n► No longer considered: UConn, Texas Tech, Texas, Texas Arlington, Charleston, New Mexico, Boise State, LaSalle, Davidson, Chattanooga, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Joseph's, BYU, Oklahoma, Charleston, Nebraska, Temple, North Carolina State, Stanford, Nevada, Texas A&M, Memphis, Utah, Iowa, Auburn \nMoving in: Kansas State \nMoving out: Clemson \n► Multi-bid conferences: ACC (10), Big Ten (7), Big 12 (6), Big East (6), Pac-12 (5), SEC (5), A-10 (2), AAC (2), WCC (2).
