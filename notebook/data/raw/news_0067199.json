Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez are the current favorites to win. By Hayley Miller \nFormer Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean endorsed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg Wednesday as the next DNC chairman. \nDean, a former Vermont governor and 2004 presidential contender, praised Buttigieg on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for representing interests “outside the beltway.” The endorsement could mark a major blow to frontrunners Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as Saturday’s election nears. \n“If you want to change this party have you to have leadership that looks like the people you are going to change,” Dean said. “Pete is organized and he’s been in an area that most people wouldn’t want to go to: Afghanistan. I think this is the only way that we are going to capture this generation and get them to align with the Democratic Party.” \nButtigieg tweeted Wednesday that he was “honored” to receive Dean’s endorsement. Honored by the endorsement of the architect of the 50-state strategy @GovHowardDean - who says it's time for DNC to look outside the Beltway — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 22, 2017 Gov. Dean is calling for not just a 50-state but a 50-year strategy. That's what I will work to establish as DNC chair - time for a change.
