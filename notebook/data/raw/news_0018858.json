Although visitors will have to pass through checkpoints to enter the forecourt, it will remain free. \"All the work to secure the Eiffel Tower is being done in consultation with the Architectes des Bâtiments de France [the country’s architects’ association] so that it fits as well as possible in the neighborhood,\" Martins said. “This is a necessity in terms of security, but it will also make it possible to re-establish a link between the forecourt of the monument and the gardens.\" © Philippe Wojazer / Reuters \nThe 300-meter-tall Eiffel Tower, constructed for the 1889 World’s Fair to be the tallest in the world at that time, is already surrounded by a temporary chain-link fence, put up for the Euro 2016 football tournament last summer, following the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015 that took the lives of 130 people.The €20 million wall is said to be part of a wider €300 million refurbishment of the Eiffel Tower, which is the most visited landmark in the world, seen up close by about 7 million tourists each year. The project will see more elevators, hopefully cutting the famously long queues and relieving visitors stranded up on the tower, and a sprucing-up of the lower viewing platform.

El-Hamahmy was shot several times, and remains in critical condition in hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:25:09.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
