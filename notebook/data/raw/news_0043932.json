He is a regular contributor at Forbes .\nShawn is also the former editor-in-chief of Rap Genius, and has written about music and culture for The Atlantic, Vibe, The Source, GQ, Esquire, The Sondheim Review, and more. \n\n  Image via Getty/Craig Barritt The VH1 series  The Breaks  airs its first episode tonight after a successful pilot last year. The show follows three young friends in 1990 as they try to break into the hip-hop industry, just as the music they love is starting to blow up into a worldwide phenomenon. The show features hip-hop royalty both in front of (Method Man, T.I.) and behind (Phonte Coleman, DJ Premier, DJ Rob Swift) the camera.\nWe reached out to series co-creator Dan Charnas, author of The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop , on which the show is based, to exclusively give us the titles of this season&apos;s episodes, and explain what they mean. Each episode is, appropriately, named after a famous break.\nTHE EPISODE TITLES: 101 - \"Hard to Handle\"\n102 - \"It&apos;s Just Begun\" \n103 - \"Blind Alley\"\n104 - \"Substitution\"\n105 - \"Amen, Brother\"\n106 - \"Runaway\"\n107 - \"Under Pressure\"\n108 - \"N.T.” \nTHE SONG TITLES THEY ARE BASED ON  “Hard To Handle” by Otis Redding\nsampled by Marley Marl on \"The Symphony\"  \n“It’s Just Begun” by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nsampled by the Jungle Bros on \"On The Run\"  \n“Blind Alley” by The Emotions\nsampled by Big Daddy Kane on \"Ain&apos;t No Half Steppin\"  \n“Synthetic Substitution” by Melvin Bliss\nsampled by damn near every producer on the planet, but, for example\nby Naughty By Nature on \"O.P.P.\"  \n“Amen, Brother” by The Winstons\n sampled by, again, damn near every producer on the planet, but, for example\nby N.W.A. on \"Straight Outta Compton\"  \n“Runaway” by Coke Escovedo\nsampled by T La Rock on \"Runaway\"  \n “Under Pressure” by Queen & David Bowie \nsampled by Vanilla Ice on \"Ice Ice Baby\"  \n“N.T.” by Kool & The Gang\nsampled by Nas on \"NY State of Mind\"  \nTHE BACKGROUND \n“The Breaks,” as a phrase, is a multiple-entendre. It could refer to the classic song of the same name by Kurtis Blow (the first rap record to be certified Gold by the RIAA ). It could refer colloquially to the characters attempts to break into the business, or alternately to their failures to do so. But the highest meaning of \"the breaks” is that it refers to “breakbeats” —the canon of soul, funk, R&B, and rock records that form the sonic bedrock of hip-hop; the genre’s incontestable, singular musical contribution to global pop. Without breakbeat, we not only wouldn’t have hip-hop, but also much of electronic music, R&B, alternative rock, and so forth.  \nIf the breakbeats are hip-hop scripture, then the holy books that preserve them are the two-dozen Ultimate Breaks & Beats   albums, compiled by Louis Flores, called “Breakbeat Lou” by those who know and love him. The album covers, attached, are class and instantly known to any hip-hop DJ or producer from the 80s or 90s. Louis has his own incredible story , and one of the great pleasures of making  The Breaks  was a chance to get him an onscreen cameo this season, to show our respect for his work. \nEach of these titles refers in some way—and sometimes in a number of ways—to events in the episode to which it corresponds. And vice-versa, “breaks” themselves will figure significantly in the larger story as the season progresses.\nContrary to fable, hip-hop wasn’t created by gangsters, it was created by nerds: Guys like Flash or Marley Marl who experimented with electronic equipment; folks like Hank & Keith Shocklee or Prince Paul or DJ Premier who were virtual librarians of recorded music history. The episode names are a nod and a tribute to them. —  Dan Charnas \nWatch Now Tags: News , Hip Hop , Television , VH1 , VH1's The Breaks , The Breaks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:10:48.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
