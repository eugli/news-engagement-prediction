No Panthers wrestling team had ever won a district championship before. \nKnight felt good going into the district tournament; the Kingwood Park wrestling team was having their best season ever. Midway through the tournament, when Michael Walters , the fourth seed, beat the top seeded wrestler in his weight class, giving the team another final match, Knight was confident that the team would be winning that first district championship; he had been adding up points in his head all day. \nThe individual results were announced before the team results. When Amanda Squyres kept hearing Kingwood Park wrestlers announced in top places, she knew the team was going to win. \nThe top seeded wrestlers won the matches that they were supposed to win and several of the lower seeded wrestlers beat higher seeds. \"They really stepped up,\" said Knight of the wrestlers who came into the tournament with lower seeds. \nTwo boys, Seth Kerscher and Sam McDaniel , won district championships in their weight class. Five girls, Lex Harris , Amanda Squyres, Maritza Toscano, Grace Klauzner , and Caitlyn Hunter won district championships in their weight class. \nHarris has qualified for the regional tournament all four years and became the first ever Kingwood Park wrestler to win three consecutive district championships. She has sent a new school record for wins this year with 37. \nSquyres was confident heading into her championship match. She had beat that opponent earlier in the year and knew that she was stronger and had better technique than she did. She pinned her opponent in the second round, just as she had done the first time they faced off. \nMcDaniel had put in a lot of time training over the summer. His coach was a Cuban Olympian and they travelled to Cuba a couple times where McDaniel wrestled with the Cuban national team. After McDaniel won his championship match, he ran to his father and the two shared a long embrace. His father has never missed a single one of his wrestling matches. \nKerscher was extremely nervous going into his final match. The entire team was lined up behind the mat cheering him on. He was unable to put how he felt into words but mentioned the satisfaction of having all of the hard work that he has put in pay off. \nSix boys, Chris Pennington , Jorrin Crow, Faron Crow, Nate Sandquist , Connor Wood, and Michael Walters, took second, and three, Jacob Norton , Zavier Perez , and Vlad Small took third. One girl, Olivia Sanders took second, and two, Bella Yamawaki and Reyna Aguilar , took third. The top four finishers in each weight class advanced to the regional tournament, which will take place at Bryan High School on Feb. 17 and 18. \nThe team set a school record for the number of people that qualified for the regional tournament. \nBoth the girls wrestling team and the boys wrestling team posed for a photo with their championship banners and trophy. Knight wants to have the photo enlarged and hung up in the wrestling room.
