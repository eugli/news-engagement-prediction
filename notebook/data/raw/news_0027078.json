The customers know each other and the staff. They come to catch up with everybody, not just for a meal or a coffee.\" \nHe said it had been a privilege to be a part of that for so long, but it was time for them to move on. \n\"It's definitely bittersweet,\" he said. \"[The cafe] has been an incredibly big part of my life, the customers and staff are like family to us.\" \nIn 2003, Gerard Quigan became friendly with a group of people who operated Cafe Express together. \nThe group eventually invited he and Claire, who works front of house, on as part-owners. Ad Feedback \nAt the time the cafe was a slowly fading local legend, he said. \n\"They wanted someone to come on board as an owner and right the ship, and the rest was history.\" \nCafe Express had been in a rough patch, but they rebuilt on a solid foundation of the loyal regulars and bought full-ownership in 2008, he said. \nThe couple had been touched by the sentiment and well-wishes from regulars and staff since they announced their plans to leave. \nGerard Quigan said he wanted to reassure customers that nothing would change straight away, as they planned to leave the cafe in the hands of senior managers until a new owner was found. \n\"I'm fully confident they will continue the good work as we enjoy our new life.\" \nHospitality New Zealand regional manager Chris Hince said Quigan would be missed, and whoever took over from the couple had \"big shoes to fill\". \nHe said Quigan had been a staunch advocate for high quality, professionalism, the workers and the customers in the Manawatu hospitality industry. \n\"Gerard is always willing to give back...He's been a steady, sensible voice on any issue that's come up. \n\"It's never been for his own personal gain, it's always been for the industry as a whole.\" \nThe cafe was named Cafe of the Year at the 2014 Manawatu Hospitality Awards. In the same year Gabrielle Eyres and Bridget Grimes were nominated for Waiter of the Year and Emerging Chef respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:21:16.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
