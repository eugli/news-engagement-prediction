Lack of leaders, lack of characters, hunger, desire. Roy Keane often has a lot to say about Arsenal (Photo: ITV) \n\"But I have to say, tonight at this level, this stage of the competition, they're just not good enough. \n\"So there's no point in being too critical of them, because they're not good enough. \n\"They've only got two decent players. The rest, average.\" \"When I see Gibbs with the captain's armband on... you're in trouble.\" \nKeane was very critical of Wenger's decision to hand Kieran Gibbs the captain's armband in the second half of their Champions League clash with Munich. \nThe wing-back was named skipper after Laurent Koscielny limped off after 49 minutes - moments before the game was turned on its head. \nGibbs endured a tough time at the Allianz Arena - arguably his best contribution was illegally saving a ball off the line with his hand. The Man United legend was critical of the decision to name Kieran Gibbs captain (Photo: Rex Features) \nAnd Keane was less than impressed with his ability to rally his troops as the result became increasingly embarrassing. \n\"When I see Gibbs with the captain's armband on at the end of the game, you're in trouble, said the ex-united midfielder. \"We will see half the Arsenal players with their gloves on.\" \nBack in September 2016, Keane actually had a few positive things to say about the Gunners, before he quickly amended his tone. \nArsenal had just beaten Basel 2-0 in the Champions League, but the Irishman predicted the positivity would soon come to a head. Keane hit out at the Gunners players for wearing gloves (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nAt the time he told ITV: \"When they are in that form and have that possession, they are great to watch. They could have scored seven, eight, nine goals easily - a joy to watch. \n\"But the crunch games are coming up for them over the next few months, when the cold nights come in and we will see half the Arsenal players with their gloves on.\" \"They're soft. They're weak.\" \nKeane had a lot to say about Arsenal back in October 2015, after they were beaten 3-2 by Olympiacos in the Champions League. \nAt the time he picked out David Ospina for particular criticism, asking why he was selected to start over regular keeper Petr Cech. \n\"They're soft. They're weak,\" said the Irishman.

They look like they lack characters, leaders and winners.\" \"They're more interested in selfies and six packs.\" \nBack in August 2015, when Arsenal were preparing for the new season, getting ready to stun Liverpool on the opening day, Keane had a few things to say. \nIn an interview with Ireland's Sunday World newspaper, he suggested that Gunners players were far too \"interested in [taking] selfies\". \nHe claimed that it was this 'addiction' - for want of a better word - that was standing in their way of winning a Premier League title. Keane suggested Arsenal were more interested in selfies than winning games (Photo: twitter) \n\"It's all about how their bodies look, how their hair is, more so than winning football matches, which is the way things are going,\" Keane said at the time. \n\"They've got good players, really good players, it's just one or two of their players, they're more interested in selfies and six packs.\" poll loading What should Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger do? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:02:41.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
