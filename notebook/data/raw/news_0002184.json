Sporting News \nPublished on Feb. 2, 2017 \nUpdated at 4:32 a.m. ET \nIt’s the photo doing the rounds, leaving everyone wondering whether Quade Cooper’s bout on the Mundine v Green undercard is all a big joke. \nMORE: Anthony Mundine snares world's best neurosurgeon for Danny Green fight \nThe Wallabies playmaker will step into the ring against Jack McInnes prior to Anthony Mundine’s re-match with Danny Green at the Adelaide Oval on Friday night. \nThe old saying goes, 'you should never judge a book by its cover', but plenty of people are taking a look at McInnes and wondering whether or not he’ll be up to the challenge of fighting one of Australia’s best athletes. \nThe 22-year-old currently holds a professional boxing record of 0-2, however his coach Craig Glover believes pundits should write him off at their own risk. \nMcInnes has the edge over Cooper in terms of experience. Cooper has stepped into the ring professionally on two occasions (2-0-0) also, however McInnes reportedly boasts 55 fights in Muay Thai, boxing and MMA. \n“Quade will be fit, he’s always been an athlete and I expect nothing less,” Glover told the Fraser Coast Chronicle . \n“I think his body will be fit and ready but the one thing Jack has on him is fight experience. \n“Fifty-five fights under your belt compared to three is a heck of an advantage for Jack as long as we can hang in there in the fight.” \nIt remains to be seen how the bout will play out, however you can be sure of fireworks every time a footballer steps into a boxing ring.
