If you take that answer at face value, you run the risk of joining a company that talks a big game, but ultimately fails to take action. And in a worst-case scenario, this results in anyone from a non-traditional background feeling isolated and uncomfortable at work.\nAsk any company whether they’re diverse and inclusive, and they’re probably going to tell you \"yes.\" But you don’t have to wait until you’ve accepted a position to figure out whether or not a company walks the walk when it comes to sexual preference, race, religion or gender. The interview process is an opportunity not only for a company to get to know you, but for you to get to know the company —and there are a number of questions you can ask that will help shed light on their commitment to equality and inclusion. \nSo, what exactly should you ask? We asked a few HR and recruiting experts to weigh in.\n1. What Are Your Most Important Values? \"This question typically highlights many things, including diversity, and provides a glimpse into their culture and helps the candidate get a better feel for whether their values match the company,\" says Lee-Anne Farley, Global HR operations leader at Glassdoor. While this is admittedly a less direct question, it makes it more likely that you’ll get a straight answer about whether or not they value diversity. Because what an interviewer does or doesn’t say can speak volumes.\n2. How Important Is Diversity To You, And What Value Does It Bring? \"Every organization should have an idea of their business case for diversity and inclusion and should also be able to articulate that,\" says Sara Taylor, president and founder of deepSEE Consulting . If they don’t have a stated business case, Taylor says, ask if they have any knowledge of how diversity has contributed to the bottom line. Companies that are aware of the concrete benefits diversity provides are much more likely to promote it.\n3. What Are You Doing To Make Sure Everyone Feels Included? \"While diversity does positively impact the bottom line, inclusion is just as important,\" Taylor says. \"Organizations that are actively creating inclusion strategies have assessed their organization to know both their inclusion strengths and challenges. They’ve also created plans to address those challenges with best-practice programming.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:41:26.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
