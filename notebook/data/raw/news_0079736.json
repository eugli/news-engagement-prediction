So cute! \nThe release of the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast starring Emma Watson is just around the corner, and we're wearing our voices thin practicing \"Be Our Guest\" in time for the big debut. \nWith any movie release comes merch, and these figures from Funko's Dorbz line really captured our hearts. Not only are there basic versions of Belle and Beast in different looks, there's also an exclusive version of Beast only available through Entertainment Earth. Entertainment Earth Belle comes in both her peasant clothing and her trademark yellow gown for $8.99. There's also a rare chase version of her in her village outfit, but you'll have to look for that one in stores or fork over $34 , as she is much more rare.\nOriginal Beast is also $8.99 , and the exclusive flocked version is $9.99 . he sure is a cutie! We love the happy expression. Buy them here and here \nMORE BAZAAR DEALS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:04:50.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
