The Air Traffic Control (ATC) was immediately informed, said a senior official. At around 2 pm on Sunday the pilot of an Indigo flight saw the drone like object in the sky approximately 3 nautical miles from the runway. The ATC was informed at 2.24 pm said a senior official. The pilot said that he saw the object 900-feet above the ground just a few minutes after take off.\nA few months ago a similar incident was reported when a pilot of another IndiGo airlines flight from Dehradun had told authorities that he spotted a drone some 100 metres below the aircraft, while landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai.\nThree people were arrested in the matter, after it was revealed that the drone camera was being used to prepare for a film shoot in Charkop area of Western suburbs. The actual film shoot was scheduled later, they said.\nYou May Also Like To Watch:\nIncidents of drones flying near or even onto passenger jet airliners’ paths have increasingly become common. Reason behind that is the fact that drones are now available cheaply and also people are unaware about the danger their activities may pose to airfraft flying overhead. While authorities have repeatedly warned of the threat, the effect on the ground is still not effective enough, today’s incident shows.\nDrones are allowed in many places but a domestic airport is amongst the zones which are no-entry. In Gurgaon, Haryana, drones map the towns of Sohna and Manesar and use the images to update decades-old land records, check encroachments and resolve disputes over land and property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:12:33.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
