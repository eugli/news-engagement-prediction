When asked by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly in an interview to air Sunday before the Super Bowl why he respects Putin, Trump said, \"I respect a lot of people but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not and if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight and Islamic terrorism all over the world, major fight -- that's a good thing. Will I get along with them? I have no idea.\"\nO'Reilly hinted at Putin's reputation as a \"killer,\" and Trump said there are \"a lot of killers.\"\n\"What do you think?
