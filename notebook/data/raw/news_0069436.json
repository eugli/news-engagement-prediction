The College Board, headquartered in New York City, creates the framework for Advanced Placement classes and the SAT. Colleges typically give more consideration to students who take and fare well on AP courses.\nCollege Board officials made the announcement Tuesday at Gwinnett’s Duluth High School.\nSince 2014, student participation in AP has increased in Gwinnett by five percent each year, College Board officials said. Last school year, 61 percent of Gwinnett students scored a 3 or better, which is the threshold for strong performance.\nDuluth High principal Anthony Smith credited the students for the honor.\n“It is a celebration of what you have accomplished,” Smith said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:07:03.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
