IndiaToday.in | Written by Srivatsan A + A - \nOn Friday, a popular Malayalam actor was abducted and molested by a gang of six, who reportedly took pictures of the actor to blackmail her. Several celebrities from across the industries showed their support to the actor. \nWhile the news report that shook the entire nation is yet to sink in, Tamil actor Varalaxmi Sarathkumar took to Twitter and shared a disturbing incident that she was part of. Needs to be said..!! pic.twitter.com/GjJimBIKd3 â€” varu sarathkumar (@varusarath) February 20, 2017 \nIn her letter, Varalaxmi said, \"I was in a meeting with the programming head of a leading TV channel. Towards the end of the half-hour meeting, he asked me, 'So...when can we meet outside?' To which I replied, 'Regarding some other work?' His reply was(said with a smug smile like it was the norm) 'No no! Not work... for other things.' I hid my shock and anger and told him, 'Sorry! Please leave.' His last word on the topic was, 'So...that's all?' He smiled and walked away.\" \nCriticising that it's ingrained in our society, Varalaxmi said, \"A common reaction from people; both inside and outside the industry when they hear such things is, 'Film industry is like this. You knew this when you joined. Why complain now or act surprised?' My response is this: I didn't come to the industry to be treated like a piece of meat, or to follow the standards of exploitation of women already practiced. I love acting. It's my profession by choice. I work hard and I'm good at my work. I certainly do not want to choose either option of 'Put up with it or quit'.\" \n\"I am an actress. Just because I lead a glamorous life on screen, it doesn't mean that I can be disrespected. It's my life, my body and my wish. No man should assume that he can get away by disrespecting me. To those who believe this as a minor incident, this is the tip of the iceberg. And for those of you asking about the identity of the man, this is not the place and time for it as it will deviate from the bigger issue at hand. It may be a small incident that fortunately ended safely for me but it helps me to shed light on a very important topic,\" she added. \nSlamming at those who lecture women on how to behave, Varalaxmi said, \"Instead of lecturing women on what to wear, how to speak, and how to behave appropriately; how about we start by telling men to stop thinking with their genitals, and start looking at a woman as strong, free, capable and an equal human being? Teach the men to be better people. Every parent needs to start this at home.\" \nConcluding the letter, she said, \"The incidents of rape, molestation, manhandling and disrespect to women are rising at alarming rates. Our education is failing us. I am not a victim and I don't intend to play one. I am speaking out on behalf of all the girls who are not speaking out due to fear. Women feel that they'll be punished for speaking out. If we don't act now #SafetyForWomen will be just a dream and we will never remove the word #rape from our society.\" \nVaralaxmi is the daughter of noted Tamil actor Sarathkumar. She made her acting debut in Poda Podi (2012) and shot to fame after her stellar performance in Bala's Tharai Thappattai (2016). \nALSO READ: Malayalam actor files rape charge, film fraternity to protest today in Ernakulam ALSO WATCH: WATCH: Seven detained in Malayalam actor molestation case, rape charges filed To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
