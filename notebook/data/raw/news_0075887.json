Wolfgang Puck slipped in a snarky presidential comment into a discussion of #Oscars tacos, so I think politics are going to come up. — Linda Holmes (@nprmonkeysee) February 26, 2017 \nPuck also made a point to mention that the remaining food from the after-party would go to feed the local homeless population. \nPuck’s youngest son, Oliver, stood by his side during the segment. The child apparently helped in the preparation for tonight’s food. \nOn the carpet, Puck showed off a few golden-statue-themed desserts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:40:55.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
