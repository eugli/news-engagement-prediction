Earlier today, we saw a white LG G6 next to its predecessor (the G5), and now we have newly leaked renders that show a black variant of the upcoming handset. Revealed by Evan Blass (known as @evleaks on Twitter), the new renders present the front, rear, left, and right sides of the G6. Given Evan Blass' reputation, we're likely looking at renders that LG itself will use to promote the phone.
