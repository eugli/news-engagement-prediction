All the way! by JBieber's GF About a year ago all my friends started reading the books and I wasn't into it.. so one day I bought twilight and couldn't stop reading. When i saw the movie I instantly fell in love and watched it over and over again. But how can you not when you have the hottest guy in it ever... Edward Cullen/Robert Pattinson! The second movie was amazing and I kept liking Jacob Black even more and more. Until he hung up the phone on Edward. That drew the line for me! I give this movie 5 stars! Can't wait for Eclipse! Go TEAM EDWARD!!! At Least it stayed true to the book... by mad4u! New Moon was overall not bad. Kristen's acting was better and she wasn't constantly blinking. Taylor did very good on taking the role of Jocab. Though Rob, looked kind of wimpy to me. He wasn't as strong and muscular like he is supposed to be. And this time, the writers stayed on topic of the book. They didn't make up anything like in Twilight. If you want to see a good sequel, then choose New Moon. I don't think you will be disappointed. :) its ahhmazing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:38:08.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
