Groups of protesters gathered as the anti-Islam candidate, who has lived in hiding for more than a decade, launched his bid in Spijkenisse, a blue-collar suburb of Rotterdam. Surrounded by police, Wilders today handed out fliers and posed for selfies with supporters at a market. The controversial populist has said he intends to 'de-Islamise' the Netherlands if he gets into power Wilders, whose Freedom Party now has 12 lawmakers in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament, is riding high in polls, with most putting him narrowly ahead of the right-wing party of two-term Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The Netherlands will go to the polls on March 15, but even if he does win, Wilders would struggle to form a government since most major parties have ruled out joining a coalition with him. Wilders has lived in hiding since the 2004 murder by an Islamist of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
