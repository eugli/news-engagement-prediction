That was Intel’s drone army, where 300 fully autonomous drones flew in formation to mesmerising effect! Lady Gaga’s halftime show at Superbowl 2017 would forever be remembered for its political statements and Intel’s Shoot Star drone army, which appeared to fly in formation behind Lady Gaga, lit up in red, blue and white -- the colours and pattern of the American flag. As the Intel-powered drones flew up in a choreographed aerial show to kick-off Lady Gaga’s performance, they achieved several firsts. Flying so many drones in the sky like a small aerial swarm army is not only restricted under American law but it invites a heavy penalty, but Intel received a special waiver from the FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to fly the Shooting Star drone fleet up to 700 feet -- this is the highest the Intel Shooting Star drones have ever flown. Intel also received an additional special waiver to fly the drones in the more restricted class B airspace. Deconstructing The Drone... Featuring built-in LED lights that can create over 4 billion colour combinations in the sky, the Intel Shooting Star drones are designed specifically for light shows and weigh only 280 grams – less than the weight of a volleyball. The Intel drones are constructed with a soft frame made of flexible plastics and foam. They contain no screws and they can fly for up to 20 minutes. \nIntel Shooting Star Drone Weighs Only 280 grams and can fly for up to 2 hours \nAccording to Intel, this is the first time drones have been used during a televised event and/or Super Bowl. Not just that, this is also the very first-time drones were used to complement an entertainment act at this scale, featuring 300 autonomous drones. All 300 drones can be controlled by one computer and one drone pilot, but there is always a second pilot on hand as a backup. … And Intel’s Technology Behind The Drones The Intel Shooting Star is the company’s first drone created for entertainment light shows. The drone is designed with safety and creativity in mind with a lightweight structure and virtually limitless colour combinations. \nThe pilot software controlling the Intel Shooting Star drone formation in the air “We believe drones are an important computing platform for the future and we are continuing to invest in technologies and companies that will enable us to provide the best compute, sensor, communications and software integration for the growing drone ecosystem,” said Anil Nanduri, Vice President, New Technology Group & General Manager, Unmanned Aviation Systems, Perceptual Computing Group at Intel -- yeah, his job sounds like a lot of fun, doesn’t it? To emphasise his point, Mr Nanduri draws attention to Intel’s acquisition of MAVinci GmbH, a drone company based in Germany that offers best-in-class flight planning software.
