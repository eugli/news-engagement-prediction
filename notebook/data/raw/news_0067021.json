SIX FACTS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT GIANT PANDAS It's estimated that there are around 1,600 Giant Pandas in the wild. There are 300 in zoos and breeding centres around the world. It's unsure how long Giant Pandas live in the wild. However Chinese scientists reported zoo pandas as old as 35. A wild panda's diet is 99 percent bamboo while the remaining one percent is usually small rodents. Giant Pandas need to consume around 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo each day to get the nutrients they need. On all four legs, Giant Pandas stand at around three to four feet tall. Cubs do not open their eyes until they are six to eight weeks of age and are not mobile until three months.
