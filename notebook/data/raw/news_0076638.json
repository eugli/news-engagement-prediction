Jim Larranaga is going to get to the Big Dance for the third time as coach at the U. \nFor Duke, well the loss here, though reasonable, is the bigger story. Yes, it’s hard to win on the road. I do not and will never downplay that reality. But for a team that was still listed as the favorite -- the favorite! In all of college basketball?! -- to win the national title earlier this week, only putting up 50 is a problem. \nNot having Grayson Allen ( held out due to an ankle issue ) was absolutely a factor. Duke was randomly hot (all Frank Jackson and Jayson Tatum) but couldn’t run consistent offense. \nSo Duke’s dropped two straight -- both on the road -- and next up? Home to Florida State, then the roadie at UNC to close up the regular season. At this point, Duke is what it is. Really talented, capable of beating really anyone in college hoops on a neutral court. But this team is not consistent enough, purely in terms of style and execution, to make you believe that consistency will suddenly appear in the tournament. \nCould it happen? Mike Krzyzewski’s on the sideline. Of course it could. But it’s just a crapshoot, it seems. If Allen plays on Saturday, I do think Duke wins, though, even if it would’ve been in an ugly style. \nAlso cool. Check out Miami’s football coach hanging back at his seat while the fans flooded the floor. WOW!!!! What a great image! It's great to be a Miami Hurricane!
