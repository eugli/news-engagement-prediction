There are a lot of South Africans with businesses in Nigeria. If I go back home it won’t be good for the South Africans living in Nigeria. They say we are selling drugs but they didn’t find any. Why did they steal our things if they are looking for drugs?\" \nA woman whose house was also vandalised cried hysterically while police looked on. \nSome among the angry mob were drinking beer during the raid. At least five police officials looked on as the mob forced its way into the block of flats. \nSome South Africans as well as Congolese nationals who live in the block told News24 their houses had also been ransacked. They said the mob, which claimed to be looking for drugs, found nothing but instead stole their belongings. \nShops in and around the area have closed and people are leaving the area in search of safety. \nLieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, said he would investigate why police stood looking on as resident's homes were vandalised. \n\"I am not sure about that but I will look into it. We have enough officials on the ground in the area and they are supported by a police chopper.\" \nNo arrests have been made, he said.
