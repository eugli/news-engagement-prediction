He's now preparing to apply for refugee status because he is afraid to go back to Egypt to renew his passport.\nThe 23-year-old gay man said when he thinks about having to go back to Egypt, he is afraid.\n\"It puts a lot of fear and it makes me feel like my life is in danger,\" Habib said.\n'Thank God I'm here': Gay Syrian finds refuge in Winnipeg Asylum seeker says husband, mother were killed on wedding day in Somalia Habib became a student at the University of Winnipeg about five years ago and had a student visa. After graduating, he received a post-graduation work permit for his job as an office assistant at the university.\nHe began applying to immigrate under the provincial nominee program and was approved for the next steps in January, but learned that it could take 16 months for his application to go through.\nThere is one large hurdle in the way â€” his Egyptian passport is set to expire in June.\nSamer Habib hopes the information in his binder will lead to a successful asylum claim in Canada. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\nTo have his passport renewed, Habib would have to return to Egypt and complete three years of mandatory military service.\n\"I don't feel safe. Like, what's going to happen in the next few months if I have to leave the country?\" Habib said.\nParticularly because he is a gay man, he fears his life will be in danger.\n'Impossible to be publicly gay' \"It's impossible to be publicly gay where I come from,\" he said.\nWhile homosexuality in private is not against the law, other laws regarding debauchery, indecency and prostitution have been used to prosecute gay men, said Winnipeg immigration lawyer Bashir Kahn. People found guilty under those laws can face five years of imprisonment and heavy fines.\nHuman Rights Watch said in a 2016 report that forced anal examinations are used regularly in prosecuting homosexual sex.\nHabib said in Egypt, the police and military patrol gay websites like Grindr and some people believe gay people are diseased and sinful.\nMuslim states block gay groups from UN AIDS meeting Winnipeg LGBT centre puts out call for help after spike in refugee calls \"It can ruin your entire life there\" if people even suspect you are gay, Habib said.\nHe has only come out to his father, who told him to never speak about it again and threatened to silence him if he does, Habib said.\nHabib is most afraid of what could happen to him if he has to join the military.\n\"I'd rather die than go there because, to me, it's like being a slave but also a prisoner at the same time,\" he said.\nIf the military suspects a person is gay, \"they decide what they want to do with you next,\" he said.\n\"It could be putting you in jail, putting you in a room, abuse, humiliating you or ruining your reputation,\" he said.\n\"They could take away my passport, they could take away all my IDs and say, 'There you go, you can't live your life anymore.'\"\nApplying for asylum Habib is applying for asylum on two grounds: membership of a particular social group and political opinion, Kahn said.\n\"If he says, 'I refuse to be in the military,' and if he is required under Egyptian law to be conscripted into military service, his refusal to do so is seen as an act against the Egyptian state,\" Kahn said.\n\"That is how the government would crack down on him very hard and punish him.\"\nBashir Khan, a Winnipeg immigration lawyer, says there are two grounds for Samer Habib to file an asylum claim. (Austin Grabish/CBC)\nAlthough Habib has been in Canada for years and not filed a refugee claim, he still has a right to do so, Kahn said, because only now has deportation become an immediate danger.\n\"Now is when his fears have come to life,\" Kahn said.\nHabib will compile all of the documents in his binder containing his hopes and fears for the future into a claim he will file next week.\nIf he qualifies, it will be at least two months until he has his hearing.\nHabib said he can't sleep thinking about what will happen if the judge doesn't support his claim.\n\"That just scares me just as much as what's waiting for me back home,\" he said.\n\"And I don't know what's going to happen.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/12/dignity-debased/forced-anal-examinations-homosexuality-prosecutions"], "published": "2017-02-23T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:24:38.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
