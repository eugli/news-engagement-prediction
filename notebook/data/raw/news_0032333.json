On “Whistle Blowers,” a highlight from their recent EP Step Brothers (Karate in the Garage) , they joyride the featherweight and Tarantino-sampling beat from Rob Stone’s “ Chill Bill ,” taking it into much stranger lands. It’s undeniably the bounciest track either have appeared on in a long time. But this penultimate moment on the EP is far from a let-your-hair-down moment. After Don Trip mentions seeing a Photoshopped image of him and Barack Obama as proof to not believe everything he sees, he casually mentions, “And y’all know damn well I didn’t vote.” On face value, the line is a bit shocking, but it is something the two of them have done frequently together—they build to a moment, then swerve away from the easily feel-good conclusion. Instead, Trip’s blasé line feels like gleeful, purposeful bathos. Somehow, it works, and the borrowed beat makes the sentiment all the more weird and animated. When Starlito appears later to rap nimbly about trapping in college and drops lines like, “At the drive-thru might surprise you/ Like ‘how the fuck he pull up in this?’’ it’s a reminder of how potent his sleepy, frequently deadpan raps are. They’ve taken a breezy radio song into uncharted lands and, take or it leave it, the power of their writing shines through on “Whistle Blowers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:35:46.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
