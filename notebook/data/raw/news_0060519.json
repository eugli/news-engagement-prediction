And really showcase what we can do.\" \nSenior federal ministers regularly visit the Australian Maritime Complex at Henderson to highlight Defence shipbuilding projects in Western Australia. \nThe purpose of Labor's Defence advocate role would be to secure more of that work for the state by enhancing the Federal Government's awareness of WA's capability.

(ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) World-class operation \nMr Stothard's company is building a massive luxury yacht for a Singaporean client, the largest vessel of its type in the world. \nHe believes WA firms can easily adapt their operations to the demands of Defence work if given the opportunity. \n\"This would be one of the most complicated ships ever built in Australia ... show me someone else who can do that in Australia. You won't be able to,\" he said. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visited Henderson with Premier Colin Barnett earlier this week, taking a cruise on a Cape Class patrol boat built by WA company Austal Ships. \nMr Stothard said the Prime Minister should have taken the opportunity to look at the capability of other firms in the complex. \n\"I think it was a wrong move by the state and the Federal Government to only visit one yard when they were here last week, absolutely,\" he said. \n\"I know the rest of the strip wasn't happy with that outcome for sure.\" Defence advocate \nUnder Labor's proposal, a newly elected Labor Government would appoint a Defence advocate and a minister for Defence issues as part of a deliberate strategy to boost work in the state. \n\"I want to make sure we get our fair share of Defence build. We get our fair share of submarine and frigate contracts. We get our fair share of new contracts coming forward,\" Opposition Leader Mark McGowan said.

(ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nLiberal Commerce Minister Michael Mischin said the work was already being done. \n\"All of that advocacy is currently being done and has been done quite effectively by the Premier, and myself and by industry through government support,\" he said. \nMr Mischin is confident WA will get a large share of Defence maintenance work as the new Barracuda-class submarines come into service. \n\"We are currently responsible for the maintenance and sustainment down in Henderson of all six of the Collins-class submarines,\" he said. \n\"Our capacity down there will be expanded in order to do the maintenance on the short-fin Barracudas as well.\" \nAs part of its Defence strategy, Labor would also lobby the foreign navies, including the United States, to increase the visits of foreign naval ships to Fremantle. \nMr McGowan said despite the turbulence in the Trump White House, he would seek more visits by US ships, and remained committed and confident about the US-Australian alliance. \n\"I think the Defence relationship with America will endure Donald Trump,\" he said.
