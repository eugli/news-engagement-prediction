Daniels said the protest is about keeping communities safe.\n\"It's just a show of participatory democracy and collectively forcing a conversation around what we want,\" she said.\n\"We want safety, we want to feel safe in our communities, and if you can't trust the people that are supposed to protect you – that we pay for them to protect us – I think that's a pretty sad statement.\"\nDaniels said the protest is also meant to encourage the RNC to further discipline Snelgrove.\n\"He doesn't need to be held criminally responsible in this case, although we are disappointed with that result, but he doesn't need to be held criminally responsible to be removed from his position,\" she said.\nJen Daniels says the protest, called \"Hell no Snelgrove!\" is planned for 12 p.m. Monday outside the RNC headquarters.
