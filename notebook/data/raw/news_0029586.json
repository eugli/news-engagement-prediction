One of those people was Rory Feek of country duo Joey and Rory. \nRory's partner and wife, Joey, passed away in 2016 from complications with cancer. Before she passed, the duo released \"Hymns That Are Important To Us.\" That album earned them a Grammy nomination for best roots gospel album. \nJoey made Rory promise her that he'd attend the award ceremony if they were nominated. Incredibly, they even won. In his speech, Rory shared his story and tearfully dedicated the award to his late wife. Click Here for more from St. Pierre Boston, born and raised.
