The month I look forward to all year, as it is finally time to start my favourite of all gardening jobs, sowing tomato seeds. But rather than just sticking to familiar red varieties, this year I implore you to try something that most people seem instinctively to avoid without ever giving them a go, delicious green tomatoes. Green toms are rich in tomatidine, which studies suggest may have intriguing health benefits \nThis group of tomatoes retain their emerald hue even when fully ripe, but contrary to what you might assume, they are also some of the sweetest, richest and most aromatic types around. Keeping hold of their green chlorophyll means these fruit are still photosynthesising, churning out sugar (from which other flavour compounds are also derived) even once the fruit has been picked. They also happen to be rich in tomatidine, a compound that some emerging studies suggest may have intriguing health benefits. Research at the University of Iowa, for example, found that in mice tomatidine was capable of not only reducing muscle wasting, but even reversing it. The critters given tomatidine actually saw an increase in muscle mass, strength and exercise capacity, with similar results also being observed in human muscle cells cultivated in test tubes. \nOK, it’s still early days with the science here, but I can’t wait to see what future research may uncover. If you want to give green tomatoes a go this summer, here are three of my favourite ones (I have tested dozens) to get you started. Green Zebra \nOften described as an “heirloom” or “heritage” variety due to its fantastic flavour and quirky looks, this fella was really only introduced in the 1980s, which gives it all the vigour of more modern types. Beneath forest green striped fruit lies bright, tangy, almost citrus flesh with a good old wallop of umami. Green Grape \nI’d grow this one for looks alone, with beautiful, translucent, grape-sized fruit that look like they have been carved from jade. A nice early-ripener with an exceptional tropical fruit-like flavour and very intense sweetness. Think “classic tomato” with hints of lychee and (surprise, surprise) green muscat grape. Sungreen \nA descendant of the same Japanese breeding programme that created the famously delicious Sungold tomatoes, these guys sadly have never reached their gold cousin’s lofty heights of popularity, which I think is a huge shame. These cherry-sized fruits pack in the same surprising, almost syrupy level or sweetness, but with fresh, grassy, herbal notes. Just like Sungold this is super early and a generous cropper, too. For me, a winner all round. \nEmail James at or follow him on Twitter @Botanygeek ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:03:57.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
