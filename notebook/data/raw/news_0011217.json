Wenger is out of contract at the end of the season and has revealed he go with his gut feeling when deciding whether to extend his stay in north London. A new two-year deal is understood to have been prepared for Wenger but talks are on hold while the 67-year-old waits to see how the campaign pans out. View photos Gunners chiefs cannot leave the task of finding Wenger’s replacement until the last minute and have already begun the recruitment process. A four-man shortlist has been drawn up as a contingency plan should the Arsenal boss decide to end his time at the helm. Borussia Dortmund’s Thomas Tuchel, Max Allegri of Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt and Monaco’s Leonardo Jardim are thought to be the candidates being considered for the role. Here’s a look at each of the contenders and what they could bring to the Emirates Stadium if given the nod to replace Wenger. Thomas Tuchel View photos Tuchel was appointed as Jurgen Klopp’s successor at Dortmund following his move to the Premier League with Liverpool. He is yet to win a trophy as manager but has maintained the same gegenpressing style that has become a hallmark of teams at the Westfalenstadion. Tuchel, 43, is a trained physio and has an excellent grasp of the English language, which would help him settle in quickly at the Emirates. Max Allegri Allegri, who replaced Antonio Conte in Turin, would be a safe pair of hands and has long been linked with a move to Arsenal. He was cagey when questioned over the link recently. “I won’t deny or confirm anything,” he said. “I am in sync with the club, now we have to focus on winning.” A proven winner in Italy, the 49-year-old would be an experienced option capable of tightening things up.
