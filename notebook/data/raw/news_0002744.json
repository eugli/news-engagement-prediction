And the more hate there is the more we need this,” said Bailey. “I just feel like there’s a whole lot of hate right now.” \nIf it has only gotten worse, some would question why Bailey would continue spending his free time and nearly every day on a corner telling everyone to love everyone. \n“There’s always going to be people out there that just won’t fall in place and do this,” said Bailey. “But I guess I’m kind of a dreamer.” \nOn a cold Thursday afternoon while standing at the corner of Trophy Lake Drive and 114, Bailey was reminded he was not dreaming. \nA father pulled over and approached him with his daughter wanting to take pictures with Bailey. \n“Can we have more of them out here?” questioned Andrew Clugston, who lives in Trophy Club. \nClugston stopped by hoping to set an example for his 4-year-old daughter, Maya. \n“The message needs to be out there,” said Clugston. “If there’s anything a few folks feel is lacking in the world, it’s sympathy, empathy and ultimately love.” \nAs much as he bleeds for his sign and message, Bailey is realistic. \n“We can’t really love and help everybody, but we got to try,” said Bailey. \nA dreamer who hopes one day he will not be needed. \n“It’d be awesome,” said Bailey. “Until then, here I am.” \nBailey’s Facebook group has reached nearly 60,000 followers. \n  Jeff Paul facebook Follow Reporter Jeff Paul joined the CBS 11 News team in 2014.
