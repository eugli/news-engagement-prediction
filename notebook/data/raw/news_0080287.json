Corbyn looks crushed following by-election defeat Fri, February 24, 2017 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves his home following a humiliating blow by the Conservatives after snatching Copeland in a by-election victory. The struggling politician was talking on the day his party lost a by-election to the government, the first time this has happened in over 30 years. Adam Gray / SWNS.com 1 of 10 Jeremy Corbyn is seen at Savoy Place in London where the Labour leader was giving a speech on Brexit \nWriting in the Telegraph, he said: “Even the other members of this club have usually enjoyed by-election swings in their favour, or in my case, victory in European and local elections.\"We were generally under pressure for not going forwards quickly enough. We haven’t had a member before who only went backwards.” GETTY Hague had a troubled time as the Conservative Leader \nThe comments follow the sensational claims by John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor who insisted an “alliance” between some parts of the Labour Party and the media are “intent on destroying Jeremy Corbyn and all that he stands for”.Hague continued: “The ominous current silence of Len McCluskey of the Unite union will turn into disenchantment and betrayal by the trade union leaders, and that even plotters with the level of incompetence of the Labour moderates will then launch another leadership challenge. \n“It is also true that when you think things can’t get any worse they will do so.“The Brexit process has placed Labour in an impossible quandary, from which there will be no relief over the next two years of exit negotiations. The party is not likely to benefit from any economic slowdown when it is not remotely seen as credible on the economy.” GETTY Corbyn should resign to protect his left wing ideals according to Hague \nIn reference to Corbyn’s socialist ideals, Hague believes he is damaging them more by clinging to power then he would by going.“Their ideals matter more than any individual. He is too damaged by controversies and losses. He (should) resign soon, before the May elections and on a date when no one is expecting it, triggering a contest that another candidate of the Left should be able to win.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:37:05.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
