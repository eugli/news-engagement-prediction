Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump did not mean that the incidents got no coverage ​but that they did not get ​the same attention as other events. \n\"Like a protest gets blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage,\" Spicer said.​​ \nExcluded from the list were attacks in countries that have been most devastated by terrorism, including Iraq, Nigeria and Syria. \nThe News had coverage of a number of attacks in those strife-torn nations, such as the massive bombing in Baghdad on July 4 that killed 175 people and wounded almost 200. The White House did not explain why those countries were omitted. \nThe ​list of attacks was described as \"executed or inspired by\" the so-called Islamic State. \nFifteen of those stories ran on the front page of The News . Some — such as San Bernardino, the 2015 Paris attacks and the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando​ — took up much of the front page for days ​on end. \nSome stories — such as the Garland and Pulse shootings, the Paris attacks and ​a ​student who drove through a crowd in Columbus, Ohio — were paired with coverage of the local ​reaction. Dallas' LGBT community preaches love after Orlando shooting: 'We need a dose of Jesus in the world today' \nThirty-three of the 78 received more than one day of coverage, and stories are still being produced on some of the incidents. \n​For example, ​ The News continues to follow the trial and sentencing of a man linked to the two men who were killed after opening fire outside the Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland. \nA search of archives turned up only 17 incidents that ​ T​he News did not include in its print coverage. Five of those incidents resulted in deaths. Some included injuries, such as a Danish citizen wounded in a shooting in Saudi Arabia, and others did not involve casualties. \nOne shooting where two people were supposedly injured is described as a January 2016 \"drive-by shooting outside a hotel frequented by tourists.\" An Al-Jazeera report on what appears to be the same attack cited no injuries. \nOne incident that details a Molotov cocktail attack on a mosque and community center in Malmo, Sweden, was ruled a minor arson incident and not terrorism. \nIn another incident, police ruled that a knife attack in ​​Queensland​, Australia -- which ended with two dead and one wounded -- was not linked to extremism, though a romantic relationship may have factored into the attack. \nThough some of the 47 incidents ran in ​ The News' inside pages as brief stories taking up several lines, others were featured prominently as centerpieces on the World and Nation pages. \nOne such story ​reported on a man opening fire on a Philadelphia police officer in January 2016. \nYet another incident — the bombings in New York City and New Jersey — started as a shorter story when little information was available. By day three, the suspects' arrest made up much of the front page of the paper. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:52:34.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
