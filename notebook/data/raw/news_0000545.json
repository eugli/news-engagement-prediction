On her latest track, “Wrong For You,” Burch hones in on the pains of unrequited love. Burch’s breathy words float into a parallel universe as she sings over ’60s Laurel Canyon-inspired folk melodies. It’s hard not to get nostalgic for all of those who have wronged you in the romance department, but as Burch pleads, “I know that I am so very wrong for you,” the slight lilt in her voice says she just might be fine with that. Her smoky vocals soar over shimmering guitar riffs, as a wordless, cleansing coo, that closes out the song expels all her lovelorn thoughts. While Burch knows there’s little hope for resolution, it doesn’t matter: she’ll be damned if she doesn’t go out with the last word.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:25:37.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
