Both teams might make the N.C.A.A. tournament and help give the Atlantic Coast Conference a record number of teams in the field. Credit Timothy D. Easley/Associated Press The cream of the Atlantic Coast Conference plays Wednesday night, with No. 10 Duke meeting Syracuse and No. 7 Louisville facing No. 8 North Carolina. All four programs have won national titles, feature Hall of Fame coaches and (assuming Syracuse finishes reasonably strong) will qualify for next month’s N.C.A.A. tournament.\nBut if the A.C.C., one of college basketball’s most storied leagues, leaves a mark this year, it will not be because of its best teams. It will be because even its worst teams are pretty good.\nThe conference is within striking distance of the record for tournament berths. That figure, 11, was achieved in 2011 by the Big East in its earlier, larger incarnation of 16 teams. Already, the A.C.C., which has 15 members in men’s basketball, will almost certainly become the first conference other than the Big East to send more than seven teams to the tournament, according to figures provided by the N.C.A.A. The tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 (and to 65 in 2001 and 68 in 2011).\nNo matter what happens, numerous people familiar with both leagues agreed that the Big East of 2010-11, which included eventual champion Connecticut, is not as good as the A.C.C. of this season.\n “Looking at the A.C.C., they probably have more depth, because some of the so-called bottom teams like Georgia Tech and Pitt and others have gone and beaten good teams,” said Mike Tranghese, a former Big East commissioner. (Tranghese is now a consultant on basketball matters for the Southeastern Conference.)\nContinue reading the main story Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey, who led the Fighting Irish to second place in the Big East’s regular season in 2010-11 and currently has them fifth in the A.C.C., agreed. “I think this one’s tougher than that Big East year we got 11 in,” he said, because “the so-called bottom of the league is better than the bottom of the Big East back then.”\nPhoto Even an A.C.C. team like Shelton Mitchell’s Clemson Tigers, who have a losing conference record, could join Duke in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Credit Gerry Broome/Associated Press As an example, Louisville Coach Rick Pitino noted that while a preseason news media poll picked Georgia Tech to finish second to last this season, the Yellow Jackets are 16-11 and 7-7 in the conference. Georgia Tech’s solid N.C.A.A. tournament résumé includes wins over North Carolina, No. 19 Florida State and No. 21 Notre Dame.\nThe conference’s bottom three teams — Boston College, Pittsburgh and North Carolina State — have beaten Syracuse, Florida State, Duke and No. 18 Virginia.\n“On any given night,” Pitino said, “the bottom can beat the top.”\nHow the A.C.C. arrived at this point is similar to how the Big East arrived at its own.\nWhen the Big East was formed in 1979, the A.C.C. — which then had eight members, half of them from North Carolina — was its model as a tidy, basketball-centric league in a college sports landscape dominated by football. It steadily accumulated members, including several football powers that helped the league amass the revenues of a so-called power conference, all while maintaining an emphasis on national-championship-level basketball.\nThe 16-team Big East, which had grown alongside other leagues after adding football, came apart soon after the 2010-11 season, and the diaspora spilled over not only into a new Big East — a leaner, 10-team league with superb basketball and no football — and the newly formed American Athletic Conference, but also to three different Power 5 conferences.\nThe A.C.C., which at previous points had absorbed Big East members like Virginia Tech and Miami, poached the top four Big East teams from that 2010-11 regular season: Syracuse, Louisville, Notre Dame and Pittsburgh.\n Now it is the A.C.C. that has the resources that come with being a football powerhouse — the current football champion, Clemson, is a charter member — to add to its tradition and its historical emphasis on basketball.\nSign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\n Its recruiting footprint extends up and down the East Coast and nearly to Chicago. Its coaches range from Hall of Famers like Pitino, Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski and North Carolina’s Roy Williams to lifers like Florida State’s Leonard Hamilton and Miami’s Jim Larrañaga to up-and-comers like Georgia Tech’s Josh Pastner and Virginia’s Tony Bennett.\n“You’re talking about another league with institutions seriously interested in being really good at college basketball,” said Kevin White, Duke’s athletic director, who also served in that role at Notre Dame when it was in the Big East.\nWhite, who is a member of the men’s basketball tournament selection committee, added, “The A.C.C. has collectively been very strong-minded about being a pinnacle conference in basketball.”\nFor now, the drama centers on the bubble. Virginia Tech (18-8, 7-7), Syracuse (16-12, 8-7), Georgia Tech, Wake Forest (15-12, 6-9) and Clemson (14-12, 4-10) are all candidates to claim at-large bids to the N.C.A.A. tournament — or to miss out. If all got in, the A.C.C. would almost certainly place 12 teams in the bracket, breaking the Big East’s record.\nEarning more berths does lead to more revenue, as conference payouts are determined by the number of games members play over a rolling six-year period, with each game currently worth about $250,000. Given the A.C.C.’s cuts in several television deals worth billions, however, placing the most teams in tournament history might mainly be worth its weight in bragging rights.\nAnd some other leagues have plenty to brag about as well. The Big 12 is poised to place seven of its 10 teams in the tournament for the third straight season — a proportion that would be even more impressive than the A.C.C.’s getting 10 of 15 in. Both espn.com and kenpom.com rate the Big 12 higher than the A.C.C.\nMoreover, what tends to stick most in people’s memories is not which conference has the most teams at the tournament’s outset, but rather at its conclusion. Last year, North Carolina lost the championship game to Villanova — the Big East, perhaps, taking pre-emptive revenge.\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
