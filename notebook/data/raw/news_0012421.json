Secrecy prevailed as did cover ups.\" Francis Sullivan, chief executive of the Truth Justice and Healing Council, which is coordinating the Catholic Church's response to the inquiry, described the situation as a \"massive failure.\" \"These numbers are shocking, they are tragic, and they are indefensible,\" Sullivan said, \"As Catholics, we hang our heads in shame.\" \nThe inquiry is ongoing.
