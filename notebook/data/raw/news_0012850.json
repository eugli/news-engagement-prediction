Since the show’s debut in 1990 on ABC, 30 episodes — and a feature-length movie prequel, subtitled Fire Walk with Me — have been released. The network will unveil 18 new episodes this summer, all directed by Lynch. \nLet’s hope there are no fish in the percolator when Twin Peaks returns Sunday, May 21 at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime.
