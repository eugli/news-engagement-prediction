We'd heard Breitbart was considering dropping their not-so-golden boy over his comments, but now we've heard straight from the horse's mouth. \nSpeaking on the company's Sirius XM radio show Tuesday morning, Editor-In-Chief Alex Marlow said: \n\"It was something that was a total surprise to people in the Breitbart organization that there is video that surfaced that appeared to show him justifying sex between an adult and a minor, at least in certain circumstances which was very troubling and upsetting.\" \nOh, good. An understandable reaction. B t that's when Marlow started to justify it with context: \n\"He seemed to be speaking from personal experience as a gay man; he also revealed he's a victim of child abuse himself. He himself told me he's never had inappropriate contact with a minor since he was an adult.\" \nWe guess this is Marlow's attempt to gently shove Milo under the bus. \nRelated: Leslie Jones Responds To Milo's Lost Book Deal! \nHe stops short of defending the comments, saying: \n\"It's all very upsetting and something we take very seriously at Breitbart. We've been going through things and trying to figure out the best way to handle this, but the bottom line is the comments on the video are not defensible, and I think most people [agree] with that.\" \nWow. Great. Guess we're done here, and just have to wait for the official firing- NOPE! \nThis is Breitbart we're talking about! They're like shit sharks. If they aren't being awful, how will they breathe? \nNo, rather than leave the scandal alone, Marlow takes the \"opportunity\" to be point out there are worse people in the opposition! Um, what? \nHe says: \n\"We have many examples on the left who have admitted to statutory rape; Lena Dunham had in her book touching her sister's private parts as a child; you have Roman Polanski; you have millions of examples of the left of normalizing behavior, similar to what Milo described. There's no evidence Milo has been a predator, and so I do think that is also very important context.\" \nOK, first off — Roman Polanski is not a celebrated pundit for progressive values. He doesn't work for Huffington Post . That is a false equivalency of the first order. \nSecond, Lena Dunham 's story about her weird, gross thing with her sister was about two small children being weird and gross . Think what you want about her, she wasn't giving the green light to adults to have sexual relationships with teens. \nRelated: Breitbart News Has Been Losing A Shit Ton Of Advertisers \nBreitbart may have a hard time simply reproaching their ally, but make no mistake. Milo is almost certainly getting the boot. \nDespite the EIC's half-assed defense , there is a press conference scheduled for later today, with a different PR firm from their usual one — meaning they probably mean to actually display some kind of humanity and have to be coached up on how that works. \nSo we'd bet our bottom dollar he's out. \nWhat do YOU think?? \n[ Image via Channel4 /Adriana M.
