She refused to pay and now faces her salary as an MEP being docked each month. \nShe denied the allegations of fraud and said she would not “submit to persecution” by repaying the money. \nIn a statement to Reuters news agency, Le Pen described the demand as “a unilateral decision taken by political opponents ... without proof and without waiting for a judgment from the court action I have started”. \nAn EU official said failure to pay could lead to her monthly EU parliamentary salary being halved to about €3,000 euros from February, and she could also lose other allowances. In total, about €7,000 could be taken from her EU payslip every month. \nFive other Front National members of the European parliament including Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had previously had their EU payments cut because of misused money that was not reimbursed, an EU official told Reuters. \nSeveral EU lawmakers from other political groupings have also been investigated for expenses that were not in line with EU rules. Most have agreed to reimburse misspent money. \nThe investigation into misuse of funds was led by the watchdog on fraud against the EU budget. That agency has also taken the case against Le Pen to French courts, which will decide whether other sanctions are warranted.
