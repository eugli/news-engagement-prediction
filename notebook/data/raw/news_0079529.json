It’s an absolute scandal,” he said.\nShadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said it was a \"scandal\" (Photo: Getty) Mr Ashworth said Mr Hunt “stands accused of a cover up.”\nHe added: “Two months into 2017 and the Health Secretary lurches from one crisis to another. Hospitals overcrowded, waiting lists out of control.\n“He can’t deliver the investment our NHS needs, he can’t deliver a social care solution, he can’t deliver patient safety and now he can’t even deliver the post.”\nMr Hunt denied he had covered up the blunder, saying he was advised to keep it quiet to avoid GP surgeries being “overwhelmed” by inquiries form patients.\n“As soon as we judged it was possible to do so, we informed this House, we informed the public and we stayed absolutely true to our commitment, both to patient safety and to transparency,” he said.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On NHS Department of Health Jeremy Hunt Jonathan Ashworth Hospitals Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:48:46.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
