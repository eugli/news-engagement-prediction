Eastleigh have taken seven points from a possible 30 under Martin Allen Eastleigh manager Martin Allen has demanded his players \"have a hard look at themselves\" after suffering a third-straight defeat in the National League. \nThe Spitfires lost 1-0 to Macclesfield on Tuesday and are now without a win at home since 25 October. \n\"Some of these players are near the end of their contracts, coming to me saying they should be playing,\" he said. \n\"I think they need to have a good hard look at themselves, because that's nowhere near what I've been used to.\" \nEastleigh's seven-match winless streak has seen them drop to 15th in the National League under Allen's management. \nHe told BBC Radio Solent : \"I've stood back and watched some games here, watched our team play and it's been awful, nowhere near good enough. It's not acceptable to me; it's not acceptable to the chairman.\" \nAllen joined Eastleigh from Barnet on 1 December , and after winning promotion from the National League in 2015 with the Bees and from League Two with former club Gillingham in 2013, the 51-year-old said he was surprised by what he had seen so far. \n\"I've won two championships, with Gillingham and at Barnet, and it's been through hard work, desire and everybody in the team competing week in, week out,\" he added. \"I'm not getting that here at the moment and I'm not enjoying it. \n\"There's certainly a lot of work to be done over the summer to make me happy, to make the club happy and ultimately to make the supporters happy, because I know we're well off of it.\" Share this page ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:16:10.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
