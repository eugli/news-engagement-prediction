Warner, a wide receiver from Scottsdale, Arizona, had offers from some FCS schools but has instead decided he’d rather walk on at Nebraska. He also had the option to walk-on at other schools like Arizona State , Iowa and UCLA . \nWhile he may not have had any FBS scholarship offers, Warner was rather prolific in high school. He finished his three-year career at Desert Mountain High School with 241 receptions for 2,892 yards and 35 touchdowns. \nThe walk-on path may not be the easiest way to go, but it’s certainly been one plenty of players have gone down before to find success. Plus, let’s not forget the road Warner’s father took to the NFL Hall of Fame. \nKurt Warner’s football career began in the Arena League, and he was bagging groceries on the side for extra cash before ending up with the St. Louis Rams , winning a Super Bowl and two NFL MVP awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:57:07.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
