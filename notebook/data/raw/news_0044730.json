Lucky for us, weâ€™re right next door to a world-class facility with a whole department dedicated to working with difficult veins.' She said two members of the hospital's vascular team arrived at the zoo on Friday. Their first attempt to tap into a vein lasted 30 minutes before it blew. A second attempt into Fiona's deep leg vein succeeded. She said: 'Five bags of fluid later, Fiona is showing signs of recovery. She is still sleeping a lot but has started to take bottles again and has periods of carefully-supervised activity. The catheter is still in place.' Sylvia Rineair of the children's hospital said: 'We are happy to extend our expertise to our neighbors at the Cincinnati Zoo. Like many people, we are rooting for Fiona!'. Fiona was only around half the normal weight of a baby hippo when born. The medics regularly have to find difficult veins in premature babies far smaller than Fiona Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:14:35.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
