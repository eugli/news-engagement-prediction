They enjoyed open bar and open games. Sources inside tell TMZ Travis was tearing up Dance Dance Revolution. \nTMZ was told Abel and co. had the run of the place from 11 PM to 2 AM. Meanwhile, Selena was in NYC for Fashion Week ... but made sure to leave her credit card to handle all charges. \nD & B is clearly one of The Weeknd's fave spots -- he partied there with Selena and friends just a few weeks ago. His bday isn't until Feb. 16, so we're guessing there will be another celebration ... maybe WITH his gf. \nPhoto: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:12:49.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
