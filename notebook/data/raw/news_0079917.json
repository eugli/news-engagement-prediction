Joe Kania (left) and Mark Hambleton, found the gold (PA) \nThe treasure was found about 45 miles north of Hammerwich, near Lichfield, the site of the 2009 discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard. \nThe largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold ever found is perhaps the most famous discovery made by a metal detectorist. \nThe seventh century find, which dates back to the Kingdom of Mercia, is made up of 3,900 pieces of precious metal. \nIt was valued at Â£3.3 million by experts at the time, and is on display at various museums around the UK. \nTheir find echoes the antics of MacKenzie Crook and Toby Jones in comedy The Detectorists (BBC) \nThe hoard contains mainly military items, in comparison with the jewellery which makes up the more recent discovery. \nThe decoration on the Leekfrith bracelet is thought to be some of the earliest Celtic art from Britain. \nIt is not known why the Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs were buried, but it could have been for safekeeping, as an offering to the gods, or as an act of remembrance after their owner died. \nThe find was spotted by lifelong friends Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. \nMr Hambleton used to go metal detecting when he was younger with his father, who told him to resurrect his old hobby after hearing he had started fishing. The treasure was found about 45 miles north of Hammerwich, near Lichfield \nHe said: \"I am so glad we took his advice and pleased of course that he got the chance to see these amazing pieces and prove he was right all along.\" \nThe pair have said they plan to split any proceeds with the farming family which owns the 640 acres of land where the find was made. \nDr Julia Farley, curator of British and European Iron Age collections for the British Museum, said: \"This unique find is of international importance. It dates to around 400-250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain. \n\"The torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. \n\"Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\" \nStaffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins said: \"As a county and as a council we are both proud and unbelievably lucky to be home to some truly exceptional finds, including of course the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold. \n\"This amazing find of gold torcs in the north of the county is quite simply magical and we look forward to sharing the secrets and story they hold in the years to come.\" \nThe finds, which were probably made in Europe, have been handed over to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, part of Birmingham Museums, which manages the voluntary recording of finds. \nAn inquest will be held at 11am in North Staffordshire, where coroner Ian Smith will rule if the pieces are treasure. \nThe pieces will then be provisionally valued by an expert.
