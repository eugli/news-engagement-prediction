The loudest of all the amen s came from a man sitting a few seats down from me: Dr. Jeff Warren, senior pastor at Park Cities Baptist Church and host of this event meant to organize those dealing with the fallout of actions being taken in Washington and Austin. 'Dallas is not this sort of city,' but it will be if Donald Trump gets his un-American way \n\"Yes,\" said Warren, a bald man with the bright grin and soothing cadence of a former youth minister . \" Yes. \" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, too, nodded along as the mayor spoke. \nRawlings, speaking as immigrants across the city and country were striking , said the idea came from Mayor Pro Tem Monica Alonzo, whose West Dallas district is heavily Hispanic, and council member Jennifer Gates, whose district includes Vickery Meadow, which she once called \" the melting pot of America .\" He offered few details, because none exist at the moment. It's far from certain what this will become -- a fully staffed office or, perhaps, one or two city employees answering calls when someone phones for help. \nThe proposal belongs now to the new city manager, T.C. Broadnax, who has been tasked with finding an answer suitable to present to the Dallas City Council in coming weeks. \nThe mayor said he asked Broadnax, \"How do we as a city make sure that we put processes, discipline, organization and money around being a welcoming city?\" The new city manager, all of two weeks into his new job, was apparently receptive and hinted at a path forward. Rawlings said Broadnax said a city solution could well be \"an organizational structure that leverages all the organizations that are already working on\" issues related to immigrants and refugees. \nWhich is far better than the very little to absolutely nothing the city's done up until now. Immigrant office not in Dallas budget plan Officials still back idea, but say it needs firm proposal, public input \nDallas, for now, has some phone numbers on the mayor's page tucked away on the city's website , which isn't exactly a beacon in the darkness. It was launched on Feb. 6, with a note from the mayor that said, in part, \"Recent events have understandably left many residents and visitors in and around Dallas on edge.\" \nAnd that was even before the nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement round-ups began last week . Ever since, not a day passes where I don't receive several emails from friends and readers giving me a heads-up about a rumored raid taking place somewhere around town. Last night, a friend sent me a note about local charities making emergency plans to care for U.S.-born children whose parents now live in fear of imminent deportation.

Lee/Staff photographer) r \nThe mayor has given many forceful speeches about how Dallas welcomes all regardless of circumstance, and issued countless statements about how this city intended to \" treat all of our residents with respect and compassion .\" He has been unafraid to speak up in defense of ĂŠmigrĂŠs, famously telling MSNBC in 2015 that he's \" more fearful of large gatherings of white men that come into schools, theaters and shoot people up \" than he is of Syrian refugees. And last month, as travelers were being detained at DFW Airport because of the president's immigrant ban, Rawlings hastily called a press conference to denounce the executive order. \nSaid Rawlings that night, he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the detentions taking place at DFW. \"Dallas,\" he said, \"is not this sort of city.\" \nOn Thursday, he made very public his intention to prove it. Because, until now, the mayor said, \"We've never put our money where our mouth is.\" Former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert spoke before the Mayor of Dallas Candidate Forum hosted by the Republican National Hispanic Assembly Dallas Chapter on March 28, 2011, at Thomas Jefferson High School. (Ben Torres/Special Contributor) \nThat's because, a decade ago, Dallas City Hall made the very conscious decision not to. \nIn July 2007, then-Mayor Tom Leppert actually proposed an office of immigrant affairs that, as we reported at the time, would be \"dedicated to assimilating immigrants, legal and illegal, into the city of Dallas.\" Leppert, like Rawlings, was prodded on by his West Dallas council member, Steve Salazar -- who was eventually replaced by Alonzo, his former assistant when Salazar served on the council. \nLeppert, who had the backing of local Latino activists shortly after his election in the spring of '07, was being pushed to open such an office in the wake of the U.S. Senate's vote in June of that year to kill the immigration reform bill that would have given legal status to millions of immigrants . President George W. Bush tried to get it through, but ran into lawmakers who said the attempt at reform was little more than amnesty for lawbreakers . \nLeppert said in July 2007 that the new office was coming: \"All I want is to make sure we have a clear direction,\" he told this newspaper. \"Who does it serve and how are we going to measure its success?\" But two months later, it was more rumor than reality. Leppert insisted in September 2007 that he was \"comfortable\" with an office for new Americans, \"as long as we clearly define who it serves and what it is going to do and how we measure that.\" \nThat was the last anyone ever heard of it. \nDavid Dewhurst tried to hurl the proposal back at Leppert in 2012, when they were running against Ted Cruz for Kay Bailey Hutchson's vacant U.S. Senate seat. The then-lieutenant governor said Leppert had proposed making Dallas a sanctuary city, which most definitely wasn't true. All he wanted was an office for immigrants. North Texas has the country's fourth largest population of unauthorized immigrants, survey finds \nExcept, as it turned out, he didn't. Not really. \nIn 2012, PolitiFact writer Gardner Selby asked the former mayor's then-campaign spokesman, Daniel Keylin, what became of that proposal in 2007 . The response: \n\"Keylin told us via email that one reason the office did not come to be is that Leppert did not want it to serve illegal immigrants.\" \nRawling was clear about this on Thursday: He's not looking to pick a fight with D.C. or Austin. But from the church's pulpit, he said that if he has to choose sides, he's standing with The Book of Matthew (\"I was a stranger, and you invited me in\") and Jewish philosopher Matthew Buber . \nBuber, the mayor said, \"had this great concept of I and Thou. His basic philosophy was you define yourself by how you define 'the other.' When you demonize the other, you demonize yourself, and when you find the divine in the other, you raise yourself up.\" \nWell, hot damn. And hallelujah.
