Here are 5 ways to track what your lawmakers are up to. TWEET In the last couple of years, Congress hasn't been as productive as its constituencies may think. In 2014, both the House and Senate worked approximately 133 days, while an ordinary citizen totaled 240 working days. In 2016, Congress took a big summer break , from mid-July through early September. Things are shaping up to be different this year, with President Donald Trump calling it \"the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever.\" With the round-the-clock hearings, committee meetings and House votes in the wake of Trump's inauguration, it may feel like a challenge to keep up with all of Capitol Hill's recent developments. Need help keeping up? Here is a list of platforms that offers daily updates on lawmakers' decision-making. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) leaves Capitol Hill after a congressional debate on gun control.
