Baker Spring, a national security policy research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said the Constitution “makes it clear that the President — not the House, or even the Senate — must take the lead in the making of American foreign policy.” \nThe left-leaning, San Francisco-based appeals court rejected the Trump administration’s request to resume the controversial executive order in a 3-0 vote. The legal panel included Judges William C. Canby, Jr., appointed by former President Jimmy Carter, Richard R. Clifton, appointed by former President George W. Bush, and Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by former President Barack Obama. \n“We hold that the government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,” the court’s decision read. \nTrump’s order placed a 90-day freeze on entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries and established a 120-day moratorium on the refugee resettlement program with an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, which is caught in the middle of a bloody civil war. \nThe president took to Twitter, vowing to take on the court, immediately after the decision was announced.
