But that's to be expected, considering the fact that the red carpet is typically easy fodder for awkward moments. It would be one thing if actors and actresses just had to navigate the walk towards Dolby Theatre in teetering heels. But the traditional interviews, conducted by Ryan Seacrest and others, create ample opportunities for cryptic facial expressions and awkward laughs. The king and queen of the gif-able red carpet this year may have however been Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel . The duo kicked off a photo bombing streak , and hammed it up repeatedly while walking the carpet. Timberlake, for his part, continued to create gifs for himself and for others once he got inside the theater. His intro number, a song-and-dance routine, may have been easy for the life-long showman to pull off, but the guests in attendance weren't as easy on their feet. ( Taraji P. Henson , was however an exception. And clearly had a good time dancing to the music.) While there hasn't been a gif as memorable as Chrissy Teigen's reaction to Stacy Dash last year , the night is still young. So here's hoping that the best gifs of the 2017 Oscars include one--or multiple--of Teigen's typical candid moments.
