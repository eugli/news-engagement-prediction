In fact, Chinese authorities have already carried out research on relevant core technologies as well as the standardisation of maritime nuclear power plants. \nAs per reports, the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) expects to build 20 floating nuclear power stations. \nSun Qin, former chairman of the National Nuclear Corporation, said in March 2016 that the facility is scheduled to be put into operation in 2019. \n\"Floating power stations are less susceptible to natural disasters. In an emergency, the station could pump seawater into a boat to prevent core melting. Besides, the platform is small and can be dragged to a suitable place for maintenance,\" reported in February, quoting an expert. \nChina claims all most all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the islands. \nLast year, an international tribunal quashed China's claims over the area, a verdict Beijing rejected questioning the legality of the tribunal. \nWith PTI inputs First Published: Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - 15:29 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:13:03.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
