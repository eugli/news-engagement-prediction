BYU will make the trip to Knoxville on Sept. 7, 2019, while the Vols will venture out to Provo for a game on either Sept. 1 or 2, 2023. \nThis game completes Tennessee’s non-conference schedule in 2019, as the Vols will also play Georgia State , UT-Chattanooga, and UAB. That’s not exactly the kind of non-conference schedule that’s going to go a long way toward impressing any playoff committees, but the Vols will always have their SEC schedule to fall back on. \nBut have you seen BYU’s 2019 schedule now? \nWith the addition of Tennessee to the schedule, the Cougars will start off the 2019 season by playing at home against Utah , at Tennessee, and then return home to take on USC and Washington . \nThat’s a difficult September right there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:08:17.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
