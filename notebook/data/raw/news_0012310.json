She decided not to tell anyone — and in an interview with CBC News Sunday, she said it wasn't an easy choice. \n\n\"It was the hardest decision for the baby and for the whole family,\" Alkarnake said through a translator. \"Because I felt I was going to lose the visa. That's why I took the decision.\" \n'Brute determination': Syrian refugee mom gives birth hours after reaching new home Finding work, not cold, biggest hurdle for Edmonton Syrian refugees \nAfter arriving in Fort McMurray, Alkarnake was taken to a local hospital. Her son Eyad was born healthy hours later.​ She and Eyad have since left the hospital and attended service with the rest of their family at the church that's sponsoring them. \nThe congregation welcomed the Muslim family with a round of applause and a video documenting their welcome. Alkarnake sat at the back of the church cradling Eyad. \n\n\nTravel bans and mosque massacre \nThe Alkarnakes arrived in the midst of    ban on people entering the United States who hold citizenships from Syria and six other majority-Muslim countries. \nDays before they landed, six Muslims were killed in a mosque in Quebec. \n\nDespite the recent turmoil, the Alkarnakes were welcomed by Canadians, many posting messages of welcome on social media. \n\n\nIbtesam's strength & determination is so incredible. Welcome to Alberta! We're glad you're home. @FortCityChurch #WelcometoCanada #ymm https://t.co/mwFJP2bbk6 \n— @RachelNotley \nSome saw the mother's determination to have her child in Canada and the church opening its doors as powerful sign that Canada remains a welcoming and open country to Muslims and immigrants. \n\"The Alkarnakes' story has touched a lot of people powerfully,\" Fort City Church pastor Doug Doyle told his congregation Sunday. \"It's kind of a push back to the other news and what's happening right now.\" \nIbtesam Alkarnake's water had broken by the time they landed in Fort McMurray. (Fort City Church/Supplied)\nAlkarnake was in her final month of pregnancy when her water broke on Tuesday. She and her refugee sponsors expected her to give birth in late February or March. \nWhen her water broke, she didn't tell her family or flight attendants because she feared her years of work through the refugee immigration process would be delayed once again. \nThe Alkarnake family fled their bombed-out home in Syria five years ago, and had lived much of the time since then in a camp in Mafraq, Jordan, with more than 100,000 other refugees. \n'Didn't want to go into labour in the camp' During the time in the camp, the family sat through a confusing and at times \"frustrating\" refugee process, father Medyan Alkarnake said. \nWhen they finally got the all-clear to come to Canada, Ibtesam was in her eighth month of pregnancy and they jumped at the opportunity to leave. \n\"My wife didn't want to go into labour in the camp,\" Medyan said. \nDespite the pain of imminent labour, all she could think about was her family and all they endured fleeing their home. \n\"I sacrificed for the family,\" Ibtesam said, \"I felt like the other decision was to postpone arrival into Canada and that's going to hurt my kids for school and their life in Canada.\" \nIbtesam Alkarnake and her family arrived at the Fort McMurray airport in labour Tuesday night. Alkarnake gave birth to her son Eyad Wednesday morning at the Fort McMurray hospital. (Fort City Church/Supplied)\nEven safely on Canadian soil, Alkarnake waited until her family was in their townhouse to tell her sponsors that her water broke. \nIbtesam was rushed to hospital and gave birth to a healthy baby boy early Wednesday morning weighing just over six pounds. \nShe and the husband said the family have been through a lot, seeing Syria change from a peaceful country to an unstable state. \n\"I hope to have the peace here in Canada,\" Ibtesam said. \"I hope that I have stability.\" \nThe church has launched an online fundraising campaign to help support the family of six that has one more mouth to feed. It's calling on its members to donate whatever they can. \nAs for the family, they'll spend the next year learning English and adjusting to life in Canada.   \nFollow David Thurton, CBC's Fort McMurray correspondent, on  Facebook ,  Twitter  or contact him via  email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:13:07.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
