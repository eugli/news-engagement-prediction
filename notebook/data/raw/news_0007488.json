The distraught family of a man who sought the release of his body from a hospital to carry out his funeral rites, is finally relieved as he has been laid to rest. The body of Dominic Stanislaus, who passed away on January 18 at a hospital in Sharjah after several days of illness, was buried on Thursday. Dominic's body had been lying in a hospital in Sharjah for want of funds. \"I have finally received all approvals to proceed with my husband's funeral as per Sharjah Municipality's regulations,\" Marilyn Stanislaus, wife of the deceased, said before the funeral. The story first appeared in Khaleej Times on January 26 and our readers have continued to enquire about the wellbeing of the Stanislaus family. Following the report, the UAE authorities, Indian Consulate, Indian Association, Sharjah, and scores of readers came forward to help Dominic's wife and three daughters who struggled to settle the bills. Expressing gratitude, Marilyn said: \"My family and I would like to thank Khaleej Times for the timely support and right channel of help provided to us.\" She also thanked the UAE government for helping in the release of the body from Kuwait hospital.\"We have received moral as well as material support from within the UAE, thanks to Khaleej Times,\" she added.
