Enlarge Image \nThe president isn't happy with Judge James Robart. Cheriss May, NurPhoto via Getty Images \nWhat it is to be Judge James Robart. \nOne minute you're a well-respected federal judge based in Washington state. The next, you're being called \"so-called.\" \nThe judge's ascent to fame was caused by his temporarily blocking of President Donald Trump's immigration ban, which was opposed by many tech companies . Trump's executive order suspended immigration to the US from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. \nThe president wasn't pleased by Robart's Friday ruling and on Saturday took to Twitter to berate him. \nOn Sunday, when an appeals court rejected the government's attempt to restore the ban , Trump went back to Twitter to attack the judge. \n\"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" he tweeted . \nWhat some might also find bad is the notion that a president could blame, say, a terrorist attack on a judge ruling against him. Many people's impression of the Constitution is that the court system exists to offer some sort of check and balance against overreach from other branches.
