An NYPD officer just chanted: \"Free Charles Oakley! Free Charles Oakley!\" — Frank Isola (@FisolaNYDN) February 9, 2017 \nLet's take a step back and look at the total insanity of this story. \nA former legendary Knicks forward was seated near courtside, and, having had a long-standing beef with the team's owners, became involved in an altercation with an unknown person. Security was called in, Oakley objected to their approach, eventually shoving a security official. The team's own former star was then forcibly removed, handcuffed and charged with trespassing by way of refusing to leave a game of the team he used to play for. \nThat's just crazy. \nPlenty of people came to his defense online, as both #FreeOak and #FreeOakley were popping around the trending topics. And one NBA star also seemed to hold Oakley in respect: A photo posted by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Feb 8, 2017 at 8:23pm PST \nThere will be surely more to this story, and we'll keep updating it as the drama unfolds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:35:02.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
