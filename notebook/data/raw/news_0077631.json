Mahershala Ali accepts his best supporting actor Oscar for his role in \"Moonlight.\" Story highlights Ali was raised as a Christian but became an Ahmadi Muslim as an adult Ahmadis are sometimes viewed as non-Muslims and have been killed in attacks (CNN) Of all the memorable moments at the Oscars Sunday night, Mahershala Ali's win for best supporting actor marked an especially poignant triumph. Ali is the first Muslim actor to take home the golden statue. And he comes from a sect of Islam, Ahmadiyya, that has faced persecution and violence. Ali did not mention his Muslim faith during his Oscars acceptance speech for his role in \"Moonlight,\" in which he plays a kind-hearted Miami drug dealer who becomes a father figure to a boy who is struggling with his sexuality. But while accepting a Screen Actors Guild Award last month, Ali talked about his conversion to Islam and what it has taught him.

I'm a Muslim. She didn't do backflips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 yrs ago,\" he added. \"But I tell you now, you put things to the side, and I'm able to see her and she's able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. And that stuff is minutia. It's not that important.\" When Ali was in graduate school he began to \"question the divinity of Jesus\" and \"why I was taught, told, and instructed to pray to Jesus, instead of God,\" he wrote in a book titled, \"Short Stories by American Converts to Islam.\" Ali said he was introduced to a mosque by a friend and was interested in converting. But still, he had some reservations. JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:58:05.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
