It’s just too bad it won’t be on display all that often while the Cubs are on the field.\nOf course, some might argue that Baez went a little overboard with this tattoo. After all, there’s at least a decent chance his career will eventually lead him away from Chicago. That might lessen the significance some, or perhaps make things awkward with a different team and fan base.\nBreakout Cubs star Javier Baez will never let us forget his team won the 2016 World Series. (Getty Images) More Then again, it could and should always serve as a reminder to current and future teammates what the ultimate goal is. In that regard, it could serve as motivation.\nBeyond that, Baez certainly earned the right to commemorate the accomplishment any way he sees fit. He may have been a part-time player during the regular season, but he was a breakout star and a catalyst for Chicago when it mattered most. For that, he’ll always have a place in the hearts of Cubs fans.\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n– – – – – – –\nMark Townsend is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
