She was however sent a message by her agent barely five minutes after starting work telling her she was ‘ no longer required ’. \nIn her words she said \n“I was quite disappointed to be sent home. I didn’t really know what to do. Maybe that company employs plain looking people and maybe if you don’t look that way they don’t take you, maybe I was a distraction.” AD: How I went from a 2mins man to 35mins man in Bed. Now I satisfy my woman - See Solution Here \nShe went on to say that she did not wear anything provocative as many may have have thought – she said she was wearing a shirt and trousers and ‘did not look inappropriate’ and had never been sent home before ‘because of her looks’. \nBut the company owner, Adam Luckwell, told the Mirror Miss Hulse was dismissed following a three month probation period. He said there were a number of things they found out in which they were not happy with.
