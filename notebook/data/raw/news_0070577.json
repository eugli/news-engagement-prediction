During an interview earlier this week on SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio, Perez, who has competed against Woods since junior golf, praised the former world No. 1 as “the needle” in golf but said that right now, “he knows he can’t beat anybody.” During an interview earlier this week on SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio, Perez, who has competed against Woods since junior golf, praised the former world No. 1 as “the needle” in golf but said that right now, “he knows he can’t beat anybody.” “He knows it,” Perez said. “The guy shot 77 [in the first round in Dubai]. That guy can’t shoot 77. What does he do the next day? Ah, my back’s gone. He knows he can’t beat anybody! I told you! “He’s not going to come out and play, and play poorly. I said this how many months ago? He’s not going to do it for a long time.” Woods launched his new corporation, TGR, and signed equipment deals with TaylorMade and Bridgestone in anticipation of a busy early-season schedule, with four events in a five-week span. He lasted only three rounds. He withdrew from Dubai because of back spasms, and his condition hasn’t improved to the point that he’s able to compete in tournaments. \n\n\nO you done fucked up now, Pat Perez! You done fucked up! Talk about waking a sleeping giant, my friend. Tiger might win every major from here on out for the next 3 years. This is EXACTLY what Tiger needed to hear. A little shit talking. A little banter. Tiger needs a motivator and this might be the perfect thing. It’s so fucking on. Look out, PGA Tour. Look out! \n\n*takes off Tiger fan boy hat off for a second* \n\nListen. I’m the biggest Tiger fan running but even I can’t disagree with what Pat Perez is saying here. I might even go as far as to say that Tiger Woods himself has admitted as much before this latest comeback. At every single press conference he talks about TGR. It’s TGR this and TGR that. He called his return to golf Phase 2 and plastered his TGR stuff all over it. It was the main takeaway from his press conference announcing his return. So I believe everything Perez is saying to be true and I think everyone (including Tiger) agrees. Did I think anyone would have the balls to come out and say what Pat Perez said? NOPE. Not in fear that it would light a fire under Tiger’s ass (although I’m hoping that’s what happens), just that you don’t hear dudes rip into Tiger like that. Ask anybody and they’ll wax poetic about the glory days of Tiger and all the things he did for the game. I kinda respect the shit out of Perez for saying what he did.
