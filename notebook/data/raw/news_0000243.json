In one of the highest-profile cases, anti-drug officers kidnapped a South Korean businessman then murdered him inside the national police headquarters as part of an extortion racket, according to an official investigation. Then Amnesty on Wednesday accused police of systemic human rights abuses in the drug war, including shooting dead defenceless people, fabricating evidence, paying assassins to murder drug addicts and stealing from those they killed. It also said police were being paid by their superiors to kill, and documented victims as young as eight years old. CRIMINAL UNDERGOUND \"The police are behaving like the criminal underworld that they are supposed to be enforcing the law against,\" Amnesty said as it warned of possible crimes against humanity and that the International Criminal Court may need to investigate. However Duterte was unrepentant on Thursday as he launched a profanity-laced tirade against his critics and rejected charges of human rights abuses. He gave a lengthy explanation of the problems for people who used the highly addictive methamphetamine known locally as shabu. \"And you bleed for those son of a bitch(s),\" he said, adding that roughly 3,000 had been killed so far. \"I will kill more. If only to get rid of drugs.\" Police have reported killing 2,555 people in the drug war, while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:42:32.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
