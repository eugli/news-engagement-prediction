The first adjunct ever to receive the prestigious award, Birmingham laid bare the treatment of contingent faculty as one of the great shames of the modern university. It is a place where your football scoreboard may cost a million dollars but where your teacher very likely makes around $3,000 per class, receives no benefits, and qualifies for Medicaid or food stamps. But even as I stood to applaud this indictment of the \"system\" that enables literary criticism, I couldn’t help but think that Birmingham completely misidentified the place and power of tenure-track faculty within it. \nFirst, I should clarify a few points of agreement. When undergraduates are eager to pursue graduate study, I believe faculty are being professionally negligent if we don’t warn them about the overwhelming odds, low pay, and perilous market conditions that await them. When a new cohort of graduate students arrives on campus, I believe we commit professional malpractice if we don’t frankly and frequently discuss the placement of our students and the sorts of salaries they make two, three, and four years after they complete their degrees. And I believe we are complicit in exploitation if we don’t adjust the size and structure of our graduate programs to improve the placement of our students in decent, satisfying jobs, inside or outside academe. These problems point to a system larger and more pervasive even than the mighty MLA. But even if all faculty could do all those things by fiat, I’m not convinced that we would have gone very far to change the system that Birmingham rails against. It may be true that \"if you are a tenured (or tenure-track) faculty member teaching in a humanities department with Ph.D. candidates, you are both the instrument and the direct beneficiary of exploitation.\" It may also be true that the fast-food worker who uses his paycheck to buy cheap electronics at Walmart is an instrument of exploitation. But such observations do little to identify and move the real levers of power.\nBy Birmingham’s own reckoning, only 17 percent of today’s college faculty are tenured. In 1969, almost 80 percent were tenured or in tenure-track positions. Faculty hiring has been outpaced by that of administrators and staff charged with managing a growing army of adjuncts and monetizing the university’s recreational and residential wings. Say what you will about Miltonists, but almost without exception this does not reflect their priorities and it was not their doing. \nT he change does, however, mirror broader economic and political trends, and this is important if we want to talk about \"the system\" with any real hope of changing it. Across the country, public disinvestment in universities over the last 20 years has been dramatic and nearly universal. During that time, undergraduates — not graduate students — have become the real coin of the realm, as their tuition dollars have filled the gap. Student debt has ballooned, and recent studies have shown shocking levels of hunger and homelessness among the undergraduate population . Outside of this supposed ivory tower, income inequality in the United States at large has arguably become worse than at any time in the 20th century.
