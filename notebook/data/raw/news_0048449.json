Written by Kriti Sonali | New Delhi | Published:February 21, 2017 6:58 pm Taapsee Pannu trained herself in mixed martial arts and Kudo along with Krav Maga for her role in Naam Shabana \nTapsee Pannu is super busy with back-to-back films. While her The Ghazi Attack continues to get acclaim, the actor is already promoting her upcoming film Naam Shabana, in which she will be seen doing a lot of action.

She is not the only one seen kicking some backside in the film, Akshay in an extend cameo will be seen giving her a helping hand. But if it has to be one action star she looks upto, who would it be? “I am doing action in the film, and when it comes to martial arts, Akshay sir is the best in our country. Thus if I have to look upto someone for action, at all, it has to be him.” She further added, “It is my privilege to do so many stunts in a film of which he is also a part.” \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nTalking about the film, Akshay who just completed his part of the shoot, said, “This film is different and special. We have seen a number of films in Bollywood about missions and how they complete it, but this film is about the making of a spy. This is what we have not seen till date.” \nNaam Shabana is a spy thriller directed by Shivam Nair and produced by Neeraj Pandey and Shital Bhatia. The film is a spin-off of the 2015 film Baby and will see Taapsee Pannu reprising her role as Shabana. \nThe film also stars Malayalam superstar Prithviraj Sukumaran, who was seen earlier in Aiyya and Aurangzeb.
