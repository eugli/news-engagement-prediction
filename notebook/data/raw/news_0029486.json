I said, ‘Absolutely.’” Mr. Ruddy said that he had told Mr. Priebus that he would not take back his criticism. But he said they had agreed to “meet up and have dinner in the near future.” Despite his prominent role at the White House, Mr. Priebus is not a longtime confidant of the president’s. As chairman of the Republican National Committee, he remained neutral through the primary race and became an enthusiastic backer of Mr. Trump in the general election. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story During the transition, Mr. Trump named Mr. Priebus chief of staff, but announced the choice in the same news release in which he named Stephen K.

Since Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump has moved quickly to issue a series of executive actions and make good on his campaign promises. But the first three weeks of his term have been marred by controversies over the travel ban, his insults of judges and others on Twitter, ethical charges revolving around Trump businesses, and reports of infighting among White House staff members. Mr. Ruddy declined to say whether he had discussed Mr. Priebus with Mr. Trump on Friday, or whether he thought the president was inclined to make a change. “It’s really the president’s decision, if he were ever to make that,” Mr. Ruddy said. “It’s his alone. I think you are going to see results in the next 60 days. That’s a critical time.” A version of this article appears in print on February 13, 2017, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Longtime Trump Friend Blames President’s Stumbles on His Chief of Staff.
