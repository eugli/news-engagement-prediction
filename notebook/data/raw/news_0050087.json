By: FE Online | Published: February 21, 2017 4:55 PM Allahabad North is constituency No. 262 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Allahabad and comes under the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. (Source: PTI) \nThe Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections have drove into its third phase as the polling in 69 constituencies took place on February 19. 826 candidates from 69 major constituencies are in the fray and voting took place in 12 districts amid tight security arrangements. The key parties to watch out for during the elections are Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress , Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Amid the election uproar, UP has witnessed some high-decibel rallies and roadshows over the past few months and all major political parties have tried their best to lure voters. The ongoing polls are touted to be a litmus test for the ruling SP and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is leaving no stones unturned to retail his government. As per the ongoing waves, Akhilesh has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank in various regions of the state. His ‘kaam bolta hai’ campaign has gained a good response in rural as well as the urban areas of the state. However, there has been a little anger against him because of the law-and-order failure in the state. \nBJP is another top contender for the throne, but there is no ‘Modi wave’ like it was during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. BJP, has put high stakes on its star campaigner PM Narendra Modi who has successfully managed to create a strong foothold in some particular casts and communities. Also the the saffron party has blamed SP of acting as a roadblock to the development of the state for years. \nMayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has cemented itself as one of lead contenders in this political run. However, the party is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. With such high voter turnout in all the three phases of the polls so far, it clearly indicates that the electorate is turning out to vote to effect a major change. \nAllahabad North is constituency No. 262 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Allahabad and comes under the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters As per the Election Commission data, this constituency has a total of 3,54,924 registered electorates out of which 1,99,867 are male and 1,55,042 female registered voters. There are also 15 registered voters in the Others category. \nWhat are the key issues Development and law-and-order failure are some big issues here. \nWho was the winner last time Congress won this constituency by a margin of 16,092 votes during the 2012 Assembly elections. Anugrah Narayan Singh from Congress bagged a total of 54,787 votes followed by Harshvardhan Bajpayee from BSP who got 38,695 votes. The voter turnout was a poor 40.90 per cent. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Anugrah Narayan Singh (Congress), Amit (BSP), Harshvardhan Bajpayee (BJP) and Vindeshwari Prasad (Shivsena). \nWhy this constituency is important? The constituency is one of the few very Congress still has a strong hold. BJP might face some hurdles in this region as some upper cast communities are upset with the saffron party and this that they have been taken for granted. BSP might also be able to do the magic here and BJP demonetisation drive has brought in a lot of rage and anger in the people.
