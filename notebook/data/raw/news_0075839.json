Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, is the sponsor of House Bill 2021. He got the idea for the bill from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center considers an extremist anti-immigrant hate group.   (Photo: Handout) \nArizona Rep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, gets extra points for transparency — but it may be part of the reason his anti-immigration bill may die a quiet death.\nArizona lawmakers are typically reticent to admit which lobbyist or advocacy group is actually behind many of the bills they introduce. But Thorpe has been vocal about where he got the idea for what could become the state's next Senate Bill 1070: the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based group is well-known in immigration circles on both sides of the issue. For 40 years, it has advocated to limit immigration — both legal and illegal — into the United States. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , who helped former Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce write Arizona's immigration law SB 1070 and then worked on President Donald Trump's transition team, worked for the group at one point.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center considers the federation an extremist anti-immigrant hate group.\nThat didn't stop the Thorpe's House Bill 2021 from passing the House Federalism, Property Rights and Public Policy Committee or the House Committee of the Whole, despite emotional debate on the House floor.\nHB 2021 would expand Arizona's immigration law to give law enforcement more freedom to question individuals about their legal status. Specifically, it would expand Arizona's immigration law to make it illegal to restrict any law enforcement or local government entity from:\n• Complying with an immigration detainer.\n• Giving a federal immigration official access to an inmate for an interview or information about the status of an inmate.\n• If permitted by federal law, \"initiating an immigration status investigation.\"\n\nThe bill would require all public elected or appointed officials in the state to report any violations of the statute.\n\"I've heard the comment that we're a nation of immigrants,\" Thorpe said during hearings on the bill. \"I like to say we're a nation of citizens.\"\nLawmakers weigh in Rep. Charlene Fernandez , D-Yuma, said she was concerned about the source of the bill.\n\"I'm really concerned that an organization that isn't even based on Arizona, that does not know our values in Arizona, that seems to not care about the values here in Arizona, would lobby one of our legislators to bring forth such a bill,\" she said. \"They don't know our relationship with Mexico. They don't know that they are our neighbor.\"\nReps. Isela Blanc , D-Tempe, and Cesar Chavez , D-Phoenix, both said they came to the U.S. without legal documents as children. They opposed the bill, and its source.\n\"As somebody who came to this country undocumented, as somebody who thanks this great nation for all of the opportunities that have been given to me and my family, this group is anything but fair,\" Chavez said. \"This group is uneducating a population that is against immigration reform.\"\nRep. Kelly Townsend , R-Mesa, supported the bill.\n\"Bringing your children into a country illegally is going to create consequences,\" she said. \"I'm grateful the United States is a beacon on the hill, but we are also a nation of laws. We've gotten accustomed to breaking those laws. There's an effort with this bill to restore the rule of order this country was built on and made us great.\"\nThe bill was scheduled for a final House vote during a late-night session Thursday, but House Speaker J.D. Mesnard , R-Chandler, never put the bill up for vote. It's unclear if it will ever get put up for a vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:24:23.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
