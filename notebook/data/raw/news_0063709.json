The idea that Putin gives a flying rat’s a**e about Paul Nuttall winning in Stoke – I just don’t see it,’ Ukip’s spokesman added. \nThe propaganda accounts praise Jeremy Corbyn, who you might think is an unlikely target for bolstering by pro-Russian activists. \nHowever, Corbyn has criticised Nato and said suggested some troops should be withdrawn from the Baltic states to ‘wind down’ tensions with the Kremlin. Pro-Russian twitter agents are tweeting anti UKIP messages. Seems odd until you remember what Corbyn said about NATO troops and Russia. \n— Kevin Chun (@exeterkevin) February 21, 2017 Paul Nuttall was ridiculed over the false claim (Picture: Twitter/Metro) \nMr Nuttall has faced calls to resign as an MEP after false statements about Hillsborough, where 96 Liverpool fans died, were highlighted. Dishonest PC sacked for failing to tell farmer about hoard of gold he found on his land \nA Ukip press officer has taken the blame for the remarks carried on Mr Nuttall’s website for six years. \nMr Nuttall has also insisted he stands for an NHS free at the point of use after opponents highlighted that he backed its privatisation in several previous statements. \nThe by-election results should be announced in the early hours of Friday morning, when Mr Nuttall will find out whether he has beaten Labour’s Gareth Snell, who is trying to defend the seat after the resignation of Tristram Hunt.
