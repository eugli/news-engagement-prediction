And then fake tears, fake 'I love Serbia and I see it as my house' story.\nJelena Polic has since deleted her attack on Everton off Facebook “Well, why don't you go back to Brazil and show your dark fingers to them and swear on Brazilians mothers and everything will be ok.”\nThe FK Rad players have since released a public statement apologising but claiming they did not hear any racist remarks, while also shifting blame onto Everton.\nThey said: \"We express regret and condemn such action. We condemn racism and any form of hatred in football stadiums.\"\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Everton Luiz leaves pitch in tears after racist chants Share this video Watch Next The 28-year-old insists he wants to fight against racism though and show his abusers that he is stronger.\n\"That hasn't passed my mind.
