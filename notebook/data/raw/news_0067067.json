Bizarre incident involving police at Canadian border crossing Will Canada/US border crossings endanger Canadian rail safety? \nUnder preclearance, travellers don’t have to pass through customs in the U.S., because they’ve already done so before departing Canada. \nCritics have concerns about the legislation, arguing that it would lead to the erosion of rights of people travelling both to the United States and Canada. \nThe bill “does not address Canadians’ concerns about being interrogated, detained and turned back at the border based on race, religion, travel history or birthplace as a result of policies that may contravene the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,” NDP public safety critic Matthew Dube said in putting forward a motion that could effectively kill the bill. \nREAD MORE: Bill letting U.S. border guards detain Canadians could face legal challenges \n\n“What we’re seeing right now is a reality where people are being discriminated against at the border,” Dube told reporters. \n“Given that reality, we have serious concerns about these new, extra powers being given to American agents.” \nDube cited the example of a Vancouver man who said he was turned away from a B.C. border crossing after a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officer scoured his cellphone for recent messages. \nREAD MORE: U.S. can search Canadians’ mobile phones at the border: Ralph Goodale spokesman \nThe officer suspected the man was a sex worker based on one email message, the man reportedly told Daily Xtra. \nOn his way into a Liberal caucus meeting Wednesday, Trudeau suggested it’s better to be cleared for travel while still on Canadian soil. \n“If we didn’t have preclearance in Canada, people would be passing customs in the United States,” said Trudeau. \n“And in the United States, American laws dominate and control the behaviour of people in border crossings. \n“When you’re doing preclearance in Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Canadian laws are in place, so there is extra protection.” © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:18:12.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
