Ritter is getting ready to retire from his service after 36 years and is looking to transition into the civilian workforce. \nHe’s worked as an aircraft mechanic his entire military careers and says this kind of lifestyle change can be daunting. \n“Fear keeps me up of not knowing whether I am hirable on the outside,” said Ritter. “I think that I can offer something, but I don’t know because I’ve always done the same thing.” \nDespite his worries, employers say he is exactly the kind of person they are looking to hire. \nEmployers say veterans have strong and committed work ethics. \nRitter says this new phase of his life is going to take a little getting used to. \n“I have a suit and tie on. I’m not used to that,” said Ritter. \nLast year Hiring Our Heroes held about 80 job fairs throughout the country. \nThey estimate 200,000 to 250,000 veterans make the transition from a military career into civilian life each year. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
