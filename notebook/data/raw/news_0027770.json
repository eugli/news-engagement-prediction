Pink can be a strong colour and women are strong.\" \nIt was edgy with fruit symbolising women's fertility, a lightly clad female posterior and one image of \"the naughty finger\" but Jolly still shared it with her grandmother. Meg Jolly \nA photo representing the feminisation of an object associated with aggression and masculine power. \n\"I like it Meg. I think the photos are interesting....\" was her grandmother's response. \nIt is also optimistic. \n\"We are coming into an age where women are powerful and have a new voice,\" Meg explained. Meg Jolly \nThis image represents self love for women and de-sexualizing the female body. \nThis year Meg is studying communications at Massey University with a plan to combine her interest and abilities in design work with journalism and marketing. She intends picking up photography as an elective subject in her second year. Ad Feedback \nThe $2000 a year toward her future study was appreciated and would look good on her resume for may years to come. \nWakatipu High School principal Steve Hall said it may be the first time the school has had a nationwide top scholar in the year 13 scholarship programme. Debbie Jamieson \nPhotography work by Wakatipu High School student Meg Jolly, which saw here awarded New Zealand's top photography student. \nIn addition to Meg's outstanding scholarship the school received another 11 scholarships. \nElysia Harcombe achieved scholarships in statistics, English, Biology and an outstanding scholarship in geography. \nEsmond Paterson also received an outstanding scholarship, in Drama. \nScholarships were also awarded to Hamish Attenborough (Calculus), Ella Buchanan (Drama), Lily Gamson (Drama), Rosie Glanfield (Statistics), Ashley Kirkness-Burney (Technology) and Anna Moore (History). \nWhile most scholarship students were in Year 13, Hamish was in Year 11 and Esmond and Lily were Year 12.
