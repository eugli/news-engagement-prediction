Amy Duggar finally confessed who physically abused her , and it is absolutely heartbreaking. On Friday night's episode of Marriage Boot Camp , we learned the sad truth that Amy was abused by her own father. \nThe former 19 Kids and Counting star had fans in a tizzy earlier in the season, when a preview made it look as though she was saying her husband Dillon King had physically attacked her. She later clarified that it wasn't him, but a family member who had hurt her. \nMore from CafeMom: Another Duggar May Be Headed Down the Aisle Soon \nAmy revealed that she was \"scared s***less when she described how her father had abused her as a child. \"My dad was like, 'Amy, did you brush your teeth?' And I was like, 'Yeah daddy.' And he was like, 'No you didn't.' And he picked me up by my throat, all the way up to the ceiling. He was like, 'You will brush your teeth,'\" she revealed. \nShe also revealed that she's \"been called every name in the book,\" and that her dad tried to run her over with a car. She said, \"It scared me half out of my mind.\" \nUm, yeah, it should have! No person should ever have to experience fear, pain, and trauma like that, especially from a parent. Parents are supposed to be our protectors when we're young, not a source of fear. \nMore from CafeMom: Josiah Duggar's Ex-Girlfriend Might Be Getting Ready to Spill Family Secrets \nAmy still obviously has issues from it, as Dr. Venus Nicolino explained in the clip. \"Amy's coping mechanism is to pretend that everything is always happy in her world. It's how she blocks out the trauma she faced in her childhood.\" \nThankfully, she seems to have moved on since this episode was filmed. She told PEOPLE magazine last month that she had forgiven the man who had traumatized her. \"It was a very heartfelt moment where I actually forgave that person who hurt me when I was younger,\" she explained. \"I love the person very much and we're better now. But I did need to heal from that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:17:39.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
