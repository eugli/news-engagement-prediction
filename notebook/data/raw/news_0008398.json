That case is ongoing. \n“These acts by the authorities show blatant disregard for the civil rights of this American,” said attorney Susan Hutchison in a statement back in August. \nThe story — including pictures of the incident — quickly gained worldwide attention. While many people on social media were quick to show support for Mohamed, the high school freshman and his family also received several violent threats. That forced the family to move overseas so that the teen could study in Qatar. “I get a lot of hate,” Mohamed stated in August. “I got a lot of support in the beginning, but it’s the hate that sticks.” \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.
