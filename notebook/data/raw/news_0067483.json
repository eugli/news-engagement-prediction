Allen said he his wife are moving to Vancouver to enjoy the ocean and milder winters. He plans to spend some time offering speeches.\nMayor Melissa Blake said Allen will be missed, adding that he was not just a heroic firefighter but also a soccer coach and philanthropist.\nAllen said his priorities during the 80,000-person evacuation last May were to “save lives, save lives, save lives.” First responders did just that.\n“When first light came on the fourth (of May), I was worried we might see lots of vehicles still on the road burning with people,” he said.\nIn fact, no one had perished in the flames, although two died in a collision while evacuating and 2,400 structures were damaged or destroyed.\nWhile it could have been far worse, Allen admits the fire left him emotionally scarred.\n“I’ve gone to speak to professionals about how I’m feeling,” Allen said. “We did well, but as a firefighter we still feel guilty about what was lost.”\nAllen said he’s not sure he will feel ready to return to Fort McMurray for the one-year anniversary of the fire in May.\nAt the same time, he said he’s pleased with what he achieved during his career. “I have no regrets,” he said.\nWith a report from CTV Edmonton’s Breanna Karstens-Smith \nPhotos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:41:39.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
