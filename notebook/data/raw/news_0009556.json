Last week King Abdullah of Jordan went to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to discuss how to stabilise Syria under the continued rule of Bashar al-Assad. This week he has been in Washington, DC, anxious to explore how Jordan might help President Donald Trump to implement his idea for carving up Syria into safe zones.\nPlaying great powers off against one another has long been a Hashemite trademark. King Abdullah’s great-great-grandfather, the Sharif of Mecca, dallied with both the Ottoman and British empires, before going for British gold. Before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 King Abdullah received envoys from both Saddam Hussein and President George W. Bush, auctioning his backing to the highest bidder. Now, as funding from Saudi Arabia dries up, the king (via the Russians) is in contact with the Saudis’ arch-rival, Iran, whose forces operate on his borders with Syria and Iraq. He once sounded the alarm over a “Shia crescent” extending Iran’s influence to the Mediterranean; now that it is materialising he is coming to terms with it.\nIn this section The hardships of doing business in Africa Cracking down on African street vendors Nigeria’s foreign-currency shortage Jordan plays it safe Schools are reopening in Mosul, after two years of jihadist rule Iran Politics Middle East politics World politics Government and politics\nSuch realism goes against advice from a think-tank in Washington, which last year called on him to create “Greater Jordan” by incorporating “elements of Iraq and Syria” into his kingdom. The region’s ungoverned spaces would have a pro-Western monarch, argued the Washington Institute of Near East Policy, thus stemming Iran’s westward advance. In return, Jordan would gain two major rivers, oilfields and large phosphates deposits.\nBut King Abdullah knows the dangers of overreach. Over the past century, the Hashemites called themselves Kings of the Arabs but lost two major capitals, Damascus and Baghdad, and Islam’s three holiest places, Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. The king’s grandfather, Abdullah I, raged against his confinement to a desert kingdom like “a falcon in a canary’s cage”. But he lost half of Palestine, and his son, King Hussein, lost what remained. By contrast, the current king is the first monarch “with Jordanian, not regional ambitions”, says Oraib Rantawi, a political analyst.\nTake Syria. King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to urge Mr Assad to quit. With Saudi and Qatari largesse, he funnelled intelligence, weapons and cash to favoured rebels in Syria’s south. But the fighting sent around a million refugees into Jordan, so priorities shifted from offensives against the regime to defending the border from global jihadists, many of Jordanian origin. With few exceptions, the rebels in Syria’s “Southern Front” have held their fire against the regime for almost a year.\nSome Jordanians still toy with the idea of deploying the Southern Front to create a sanitised belt 10km wide on Syria’s side of the border, which might meet Mr Trump’s demand for safe havens. It would offer protection from refugees and Islamic State, whose suicide-bombers have tried to ram Jordan’s border four times since the summer, most recently last week.\nBut senior Jordanian generals suggest co-operation with Mr Assad’s forces. Were the Southern Front to pull back from Nassib, a former border crossing that is now closed, Jordan could reopen its northern crossing. With the highway from north to south back in Mr Assad’s hands, trade might again flow from Turkey via Jordan to the Gulf. Jordan’s economy could then profit from Syria’s eventual reconstruction.\nIn Iraq, too, Jordan is weighing the aspirations of émigrés against relations with the existing regime. Rich Iraqis who decamped to Amman, the capital, after the American invasion of 2003 have helped turn it into one of the region’s fastest-growing cities. Living in mansions, Sunni tribal sheikhs exiled from Anbar, Iraq’s western province, broadcast appeals on their satellite networks to establish an iqlim , or autonomous region for Sunni Arabs, as the Kurds have done. Connected to Jordan, together they would build a Sunni bulwark against Iran’s advance west. But Jordan’s trade with Anbar pales in comparison with the potential of ties with Iraq as a whole. A bilateral agreement to build a pipeline from Basra’s oilfields to Jordan’s port of Aqaba promises to turn the kingdom into an energy hub.\nOn Palestine King Abdullah is most cautious of all. Palestinian nationalists shot his grandfather dead after he split Jerusalem with the Zionists in 1948. His father, Hussein, only just survived a Palestinian revolt in September 1970. Abdullah prefers to keep out of the fray. Jordan First, he tells the Palestinians who make up most of his population, rejecting a larger West Bank role. Better a falcon in a cage than a bird shot down in mid-flight.\n under the headline “Not much might in the Hashemites”", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20170204_MAM964.png"], "published": "2017-02-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:38:13.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
