Photograph: Wallace/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock View more sharing options Press Association   22.22 GMT \nInverness celebrated their 1,000th competitive game with a 2-1 victory over Rangers after Billy McKay’s 89th-minute overhead kick consigned Graeme Murty to a second consecutive Premiership defeat as caretaker manager. \nRangers conceded the opening goal for the fifth match running when Greg Tansey swept home from 22 yards in the final minute of the first half but they were handed a lifeline midway through the second period when Louis Laing’s late tackle on Lee Wallace gifted the visitors a penalty, which Martyn Waghorn converted. Mark Warburton carries the can for deeper malaise troubling Rangers | Ewan Murray Read more \nHowever, Inverness finished the stronger team and Wes Foderingham saved an Iain Vigurs penalty shortly before McKay held off Rob Kiernan to control a deflected cross and hook the ball in off the post. \nThe victory was Caley Thistle’s first in 15 league games and was enough to take them off the bottom above Hamilton. Rangers face falling nine points behind second-placed Aberdeen, who host Ross County on Saturday, after a fourth league game without a win. \nThe visitors started well and Inverness were forced into a reshuffle when their left-back, Carl Tremarco, went off injured in the 15th minute. \nBut the hosts settled down and there were warning signs for Rangers before the opener with Billy McKay having a free header blocked and Tansey and Liam Polworth shooting wide. \nThe breakthrough came from a throw-in midway inside the Rangers half. Polworth’s run was not tracked and although the midfielder’s shot was blocked it fell for Tansey, whose shot found the corner of the net. \nRangers took time to get going in the second half but a steady stream of chances began around the hour mark. Miller set up Hyndman but both he and Tavernier had shots blocked, while Fon Williams tipped Barrie McKay’s shot over. \nToral missed a sitter after being set up by Hyndman but Rangers were soon gifted an even better chance and Waghorn sent Fon Williams the wrong way from the spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:30:36.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
