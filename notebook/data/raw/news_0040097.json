Light attack planes could replace the A-10s in big missions – as these planes cost over $10,000 per flight hour. 'Machete is a big project around here,' said Chris Beskar, Stavatti's CEO. The Machete was first discussed when the Air Force was toying with the idea of purchasing some 100 light attack planes that could replace the A-10s in big missions – as they cost over $10,000 per flight hour. However, the Air Force's taste for light-weight planes diminished after 2009 when Congress mandated budget cuts. The military branch even went so far to retire the remaining A-10s, but Congress stepped in in an attempt to save the Warthog fleet – stating A-10 cuts are to be delayed until after 2021. But last year, the idea of light weight planes resurfaced. A-10: THE UGLY WARTHOG It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal. The A-10, often called a warthog, was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground. Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks, It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute. The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions. The A-10, often called a warthog, was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground. ts top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane. The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons. Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing. On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets. Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities. It is believed that the Air Force is on the market for about 20 'OA-X' light weight combat planes and is looking to purchase them in the near future. Even US senator John McCain has supported the idea of taking on new light attack planes – he proposed the military branch should acquire 300 models. And Gen. Dave Goldfein, the Air Force's chief of staff, said McCain's proposal was a 'great idea.' However, because the Machete is still a concept drawing, the plan would not be available in time to fulfill the OA-X need. But Beskar said he believes the plane 'could be contender for a broader acquisition of attack planes', reports Axe. Stavatti unveiled designs for a new attack plane called the 'Machete' that consists of a new metal foam developed in conjunction with the US Department of Energy. The metal foam is lightweight and strong - and can stop bullets in much less space than traditional armor can He stressed the design has evolved and is more advanced than its early 2009 beginnings. 'It's basically doubled in weight' to 30,000 pounds, Beskar explained, which is close to the same weight as an A-10. Adding the new metal foam into the design allows the plane to stop projectiles in a lesser amount of space than the traditional armor. 'We could stop the bullet at a total thickness of less than an inch, while the indentation on the back was less than eight millimeters,' said Afsaneh Rabiei, an engineering professor at North Carolina State University, who tested the metal foam. 'To put that in context, the [National Institute of Justice] standard allows up to 44 millimeters indentation in the back of an armor.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:47:34.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
