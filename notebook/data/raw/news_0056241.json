He was then asked again why Trump \"decided to back down\" from his earlier call to bar Muslims, not people from specific countries, from entering the U.S. \n\"I think he's made it very clear from the beginning that this was a country-focused issue, a safety focused issue ... I don't see anything other than that,\" Spicer told reporters. \nThat contradicts Trump's earliest statements calling for travel restrictions in response to terrorism concerns. \nTrump in December 2015 called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" As the campaign progressed, though, he backtracked from rhetoric about Muslims specifically, instead calling for \"extreme vetting\" from specific countries. \nThe Trump administration has repeatedly said it chose the countries based on a list compiled during the Obama administration. \nStill, Trump's aides did not do him any favors. Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani said last month that Trump wanted a \"Muslim ban\" and asked for \"the right way to do it legally.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:28:35.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
