But asked if some of those who fled are “aligned with terrorists,” Assad quickly replied, “Definitely.” \n“You can find it on the Net,” Assad went on: “Those terrorists in Syria, holding the machine gun or killing people, they [appear as] peaceful refugees in Europe or in the West.” He said he couldn’t estimate how many there might be, but he added that “you don’t need a significant number to commit atrocities.” He noted that the 9/11 attacks were pulled off by fewer than 20 terrorists “out of maybe millions of immigrants in the United States. So it’s not about the number, it’s about the quality, it’s about the intentions.” \nThank you Mr. Assad for telling the truth, once again . \nThis is an obvious statement of fact, and yet our 9th Circuit court of lunatics just ruled these refujihadists have an inalienable right to enter America because it’d be “discrimination” to keep them out . \nThe supposed “evil dictator” Bashar al-Assad is more honest and cares more about the truth and protecting Americans than the lunatic judges on the 9th Circuit. \nHere’s one of the pictures Assad may have been talking about: \nThere’s a bunch more here , you can judge their veracity for yourself. \nNote too, Assad’s calling Syrians back home. He wants the young military aged males who fled Syria and left their wives and children behind to collect welfare in Europe to come back and rebuild their cities and fight to end the war so they can live in peace . \nGee, I wonder why our lying media hates Assad’s guts and lies about him at every opportunity?
