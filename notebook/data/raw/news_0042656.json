Beyond the Last Supper reference, both the ship and the movie are named for a term that has its own Biblical meanings , after all.) \nThe new image heralds the debut of new footage from the movie Wednesday, in an ad break during FX's critically acclaimed Legion , the first peek at the movie since the Christmas Eve release of the initial trailer. The movie, which starts Katherine Waterston, Michael Fassbender, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride, will be released May 19.
