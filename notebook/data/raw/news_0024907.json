The AP could not verify that each of the incidents had connections to the Islamic State group. \nPresident Donald Trump claimed during a speech earlier Monday that the media was deliberately ignoring attacks. \nTrump said that, “in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” adding, “They have their reasons.” \n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
