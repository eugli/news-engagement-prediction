Police officials said the substances will be sent for testing. \nA 19-year-old man was arrested at the home. \nHe has been charged with criminal negligence causing harm, trafficking 2C-B and possession of the proceeds of crime and is scheduled to appear in Prince Albert provincial court on March 7. \nPolice officials said 2C-B is a synthetic psychedelic drug that if taken, could have serious medical consequences. They could not confirm if 2C-B was seized at the home. \nThis is the first time 2C-B has been seized in Prince Albert.
