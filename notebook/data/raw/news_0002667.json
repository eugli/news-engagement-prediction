Everywhere I turned, there seemed to be a new piece of information that was stressful in some completely new way.” \nSo on Tuesday, she decided to post a note on her studio’s front door, promising her clients serenity that will not be interrupted by any Trump talk. \nThe poster reads, “We know the world is really intense right now. Especially if we care about what’s going on, we need to have spaces where we can rest, reset and hit pause on the constant inflow of news.” \nThe poster goes on to ask students to avoid talking about news while in the studio. Moreover, anyone who would like to bring something political up is asked to get permission first. \n“Be aware of who you may be accidentally including in your conversation in our small space,” the poster reads. \nPeters says she feels getting bombarded by information and people’s opinions on U.S. politics on social media leaves the majority of people so stressed, they can’t do anything productive about it. \n“When your nervous system is overtaxed in that way, it’s incredibly hard to be focused and empathetic,” Peters said. “I think now is the time when we really need to be listening to each other.” \nBut Peters is adamant this is not a call to disengage. \n“I am not saying, stop engaging altogether or avoid what’s going on in the world, but rather – here is a space where you can regain some of your footing, so you can really choose the actions that you want to take.” \nPeters says they have always been a feminist and body-positive studio, and have a community of people who are already quite politically engaged and sensitive about what goes on in the world. \nShe says the reaction to her poster was almost overwhelmingly positive. \n“Some people came in and said nothing, but some people said, thank you so much, what a relief, I really needed to have a space like this,” said Peters. “A yoga studio is not necessarily where you discuss politics a lot, but it is nice to have an explicit boundary in place.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
