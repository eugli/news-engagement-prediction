While the Seewalds decided on Henry partly because Jessa \"really liked\" it, Wilberforce has a history to match older sibling Spurgeon's namesake . \nHenry's middle name is an homage to William Wilberforce, a British abolitionist who campaigned against slavery for 20 years and worked as a missionary in India and Sierra Leone in the 1800s. \n\"He was very instrumental in abolishing the slave trade in the British Empire, as well as doing a lot of other great things,\" Ben explained. \"He's a real hero of ours.\" \nThe Counting On stars even spilled the beans on a hint for any future Seewald babies' names. \n\"We were joking that people are going to start looking at the books on our fireplace mantle because we had a Spurgeon book up there before he was born,\" Jessa quipped. \"We also have on the right side of our fireplace a six-volume set of commentary on the Bible by Matthew Henry.\" \nNoted!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:52:28.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
