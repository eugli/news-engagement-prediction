This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-91f3683c-5e3c-4a2e-92eb-7d7f6a024c02", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E660/production/_94767985_redcrescent.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17383/production/_94770159_redcrescent2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/fladig/status/833970767587057664", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/DB2B/production/_94770165_libya976217.png"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:54:45.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
