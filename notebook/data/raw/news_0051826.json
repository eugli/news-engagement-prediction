It wouldn’t work so well without all three of them.” Gogglebox - The Moffat family - Dad Mark (49), mum Betty (45) and daughter Scarlett Moffatt (Photo: Channel 4) \nBetty, 46, and Mark, 50, were not on screen in the last series because it clashed with Scarlett joining campmates in Australia. \nShortly before the I’m A Celeb final in December, Betty said it was “up to Channel 4” whether they continued on Gogglebox. \nScarlett, who attended the National Television Awards in London with her parents last month, is lined up to join Ant and Dec for the new series of Saturday Night Takeaway and front a revamped version of the dating show Streetmate.
