Seta Tamanivalu also seems happy with the result. \n\"Who the hell is Whetu Douglas?\" \nThe query wasn't meant to be unkind, and not one Douglas should take offence at, when it was aired before the Crusaders met the Brumbies at AMI Stadium last Saturday night. \nRather, it placed more emphasis on the fact that many Crusaders supporters have been so used to seeing Kieran Read wear the No 8 jersey since he switched over from the blindside flanker's role in 2010. \nSo when Douglas, a relative unknown in these parts, scored a try in the 17-13 win over the Brumbies last weekend more than a search engines were fired-up so that the gaps could be filled. \nREAD MORE: * Car sponsor dumps Dan Carter over drink-driving charge \nLast year the closest Douglas, who captained Waikato in the Mitre 10 Cup and was also invited on the New Zealand Maori tour of the northern hemisphere, got to a Super Rugby team was when the Chiefs invited him to join training for a few weeks as injury cover. \nNew Crusaders coach Scott Robertson clearly thought Douglas, 25, went alright for the province he had represented since 2013. \nRobertson sent out a message that he was keeping an eye on him, and when it was confirmed that Read required an operation on his wrist during the offseason and wouldn't return to the Crusaders until mid-April, Douglas got invited to Christchurch for pre-season training and was told to fight for a job. \nYou won't find Douglas's name in the official squad, but that is irrelevant. Given how the Crusaders pack operated against the Brumbies, and he noted that packing down behind so many All Blacks was a magic carpet ride, he should get a run against the Highlanders, in Dunedin this weekend. \nNot surprisingly, given that the Brumbies fielded a number of internationals and veteran full-time professionals, Douglas said the pace and physicality of his first Super Rugby game was a standard above the Mitre 10 Cup. Ad Feedback \nOne of the toughest areas to negotiate, he added, was the lineout. \n\"At lineout time the movements on the ground and getting in the air is a split-second quicker, so you have to trust your instincts and what you have practised during the week,\" Douglas said. \nIf Douglas hadn't been asked by Robertson to join the Crusaders he was unsure which team he would be aligned with. \n\"I hadn't heard anything otherwise, to be honest the first interest was from Razor (Robertson). I would be definitely battling away with the University club in Hamilton.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:16:08.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
