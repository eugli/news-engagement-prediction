The incentive: It will be bought by the civic body. \n\nOn the drawing board is a plan to set up compost collection centres, on the lines of dry waste collection centres, in every ward. The civic body has found suppor t from the Agriculture Department , which has offered to take the compost from these collection centres and supply them to farmers. \n\nComposting is a process by which micro-organisms break down complex organic matter such as kitchen waste into useful nutrients for the soil. \n\n“Ultimately, the idea is to ensure garbage does not go out of the ward it is generated in,“ Municipal Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said. \n\nPrasad, who composts wet waste himself, uses the manure for his lawn and a nearby park. The initial investment is just about Rs 1,000, he said. More than 300 link workers will be deployed to help citizens compost waste, he said. \n\nAgriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said there is a shortage of organic manure. “We've offered to take compost from the city and sell it to farmers at a subsidised rate.However, our department can't pos sibly collect from individual homes.Hence, we offered BBMP the idea of setting up collection centres where individuals or groups can drop composted garbage,“ he told ET. \n\nThe Swachh Bharat mission offers an incentive of Rs 1,500 per tonne for composting, which the Agriculture Department can claim, Prasad added. \n\nComposting has received significant attention of late, with many resident groups taking it up in the city. Local bodies, too, are at it. Navi Mumbai's Panvel City Municipal Corporation has announced a 2-3% property tax discount for housing societies and commercial establishments that ensure wet waste is segregated, composted or used for biogas generation. \n\nThe key , however, is segregation.Since February 1, the civic body has stopped collecting mixed waste from households. \n\n“We've achieved 60% segregation in the outer areas and it's slowly going up elsewhere,\" BBMP joint commissioner (solid waste management) Sarfaraz Khan said. “We're now collecting about 1,000 tonne of wet waste and we need to push for another 500-600 tonne. Once that's done, we can start focusing on inhouse composting.\" \n\nVasuki Iyengar , promoter of waste management firm Shudh Labs, hailed the move. “What do I do with the compost is a question people usually ask during awareness campaigns. These collection centres can be the answer,“ he said.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:29:31.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
