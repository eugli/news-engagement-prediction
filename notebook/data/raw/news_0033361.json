It includes the construction of a bridge connecting to Opotoru Road where currently there is just a foot bridge. \nThere's five phases to the development, which will take between 12 to 20 years to complete. \nStage one has 89 residential properties, 36 of which have already been sold. \nThe average section size is 600 square metres with a range from 385 to 1356 square metres. \nLots are expected to cost between $200,000 and $400,000. \nThere's a design guideline too that will encourage people to be \"design focused\" with their architecture. \n\"We want to try to create a variety across the subdivision so it's not all the same,\" Sophie Peacocke said. \n\"We want it to look like what Raglan looks like now, different colours and different sizes. \n\"We're not coming in and flattening this area. It's very much going to be the natural topography as much as possible.\" \nLaity said when they started selling the lots in December 2016, they offered Raglan residents first option. \nConstruction on the properties is expected to being around June 2018. \nStage one will also include a 200sqm commercial site that would be home to a local business. \n\"We won't be having a McDonalds or anything like that,\" Laity said. \nFrom April they will be \"pushing go\" on certain aspects of the construction. \nRaglan has been growing in popularity over the past few years. \nRaglan's Chamber of Commerce co-chairman Geoff Kelly has previously said it was a town that was filled with \"solo mums, hippies and surf bums\" but that has quickly changed over the past five years. \n\"First thing...there's a lot more money in town. Demographics have changed hugely. \n\"Now, there's a lot of international people and a lot of ex-pats coming home. So many expats are coming home and buying here. We're seeing a lot more families in town. More kids, heaps of childcare centres popping up. \n\"In five years I can see it becoming a wee bit like Wanaka. I hope it becomes like Wanaka, with a mix of super wealthy and then you've got your transient.\" \nPeacocke said they want the town to grow in a \"cool way\" and not just tack on inch by inch, moving closer and closer to Hamilton. \nWaikato District Council's customer support manager Sue Duignan said the Plan Change decision allowed \"seven physically discrete but connected precincts to be developed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:44:26.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
