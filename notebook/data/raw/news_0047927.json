(PTI photo) LUCKNOW/ NEW DELHI: A 61.16 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the third phase of the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh polls which concluded by and large peacefully. As many as 69 Assembly constituencies in the Yadav heartland, considered crucial for the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state, went to the polls in this phase. \"Turnout of voters was 61.16 per cent when polling drew to a close at 5pm,\" UP chief electoral officer T Venkatesh said. He said the exercise was held by and large peacefully in this phase, adding that tight security arrangements were put in place at all the 25,603 polling booths. In the 2012 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the turnout in these areas was 59.96 and 58.43 per cent respectively. The polling percentage was 64.2 in the first phase of the ongoing election and a little over 65 in the second phase. \"The voting was by and large peaceful,\" UP CEO T Venkatesh said. Besides BSP supremo Mayawati , Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh with his family cast their votes in Lucknow while UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav voted in Saifai (Etawah). Most of the leaders claimed their parties will form the next government. Mayawati, who cast her vote in Mall Avenue area here, told reporters that her party would win over 300 of the 403 seats in the state and she would form the next government. \"Like the Congress and the BJP, I'm not saying this without any basis. The way in which people are attending my rallies, I can say I'm going to form the next government. The people of the state want change as are fed up with misrule and 'goondaraj' of SP ,\" Mayawati said. In a similar refrain, the home minister after casting his vote here, claimed that the BJP was getting the majority. \"I'm sure BJP is going to get absolute majority,\" he said. In Saifai, Akhilesh aired similar views, saying, \"People of the state have made up their mind in favour of SP-Congress alliance.\" On uncle Shivpal Yadav, he said, \"I just want all SP candidates to win.\" Polling began slowly but gathered pace later. At some polling booths there were reports of minor skirmishes between supporters of the candidates. Shivpal complained that his supporters were attacked by political opponents in his Jaswantnagar constituency. In the 2012 Assembly polls, SP had won 55 of these 69 seats, while the BSP, the BJP and the Congress secured just six, five and two respectively. One seat went to an Independent.
