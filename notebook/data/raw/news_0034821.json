We now have an update on what's going on with \"Team Thor.\" At San Diego Comic-Con last year we got a look at what Thor was up to during the events of Captain America: Civil War . Now, we have a new look which shows that not a lot has changed between Thor and his roommate Darryl. \nToday's issue in one of paying the rent. It would seem that while Agard does have its own currency, they also still barter as Thor has apparently given Darryl some gold items, and also a pumpkin, to cover his part of the rent. To be fair, it's possible the landlord could use the pumpkin , we're not certain if Darryl has asked. What is clear is that Thor is trying to put one over on his roommate, as he claims his Asgardian coins are all worth a \"gazillion\" human dollars. Of course, we're assuming that since this scene is taking place in Australia, Thor is referring to the Australian dollar, the exchange rate with the American dollar would certainly be different. Perhaps .8 gazillion. \nIf this video continues with Thor hiring a servant we're afraid to find out who it might be or what might happen to them. We're guessing that this version of Thor isn't going to treat them very well. It looks like Thor might be backsliding into the kind of guy he was at the beginning of the first Thor. \nThe clip, which does look to be part of a larger whole, is part of the extras attached to the home release of Doctor Strange . It's a good place to put the video as one of the credits sequences of Doctor Strange gave us our first official look at the Asgardian since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron . We know that we'll be seeing Doctor Strange again when Thor: Ragnarok hits screens this fall as the sorcerer will assist Thor and Loki in their attempt to locate Odin. \nOnce again what these \"Team Thor\" videos show is that the Thor films are headed in a very different direction than they once were. Director Taika Waititi is bringing a sense of humor that we simply haven't seen previously from the character. It will be interesting to see how this manifests in the films, and if it does, we're curious how this will be explained in the movie. Are these videos actually canon for the MCU? Did Thor just get lazy and become a slacker while hanging out with humans? \nWe certainly can't wait to find out. Doctor Strange is currently available on Digital HD and will be released on Blu-Ray February 28.
