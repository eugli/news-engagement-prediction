This is what's causing the pong... Share Get daily     \nEver been driving along the M60 through Stockport and wondered what the horrendous smell is? \nWell, wonder no more...this is what’s causing the pong. \nBehind the trees lining the motorway, sits the Stockport Waste Treatment Works. The vast sewerage plant is largely hidden from view, but the stench it creates sweeps across the motorway, particularly if it’s picked up in a southerly wind. \nThe smell is pretty strong on a hot summer’s day, so be sure to wind your windows up. Not that it will make much difference. \nObnoxious smells from the plant have blighted the town for over 60 years.

Residents who have to put up with the smell all-year-round, but things were a lot worse a decade ago. \nBack in 2005, the smell got so bad, the council nearly took United Utilities to court for causing a public nuisance. \nSoaring temperatures, restrictions on spreading slurry during the foot and mouth crisis and the breakdown of important machinery caused an almighty whiff. \nSewerage could not be sent out to farms as normal and had to be stored on site, creating an eye-watering odour. Read More Waitrose recalls popular frozen fish because of possible health risk \nScores of residents from Cheadle Heath, Shaw Heath, Edgeley and even across the river in Heaton Mersey said the smell was so unbearable they couldn’t in their gardens or open windows. \nEventually, plant bosses ploughed more than £9m into tackling the problem - and it isn’t so bad nowadays. \nDuring the 1970s, Cheadle Heath home owners won a five per cent rates reduction to sweeten up the bad smell.
