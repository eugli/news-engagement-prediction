By Kim Bellware \nProtesters in Barcelona took to the street by the thousands Saturday to demand Spain’s conservative government accept more refugees from war-torn countries like Syria and Somalia. \nProtesters held banners reading “Volem Accolir” (“We welcome” in Catalan), while other signs translated into “Enough excuses! Welcome them now.” JOSEP LAGO via Getty Images A woman holds a placard reading \"We want to welcome\" during a demonstration to demand to welcome refugees in Barcelona. \nBarcelona police estimated 160,000 people participated, while march organizers said as many as 300,000 took part, the Associated Press reports. \n“There is an ample consensus in Catalonia to demand that the [government’s] commitments are upheld,” organizer Ruben Wagensberg told the AP.

The country has thus far only accepted a fraction of the refugees it said in 2015 it would accept. \nIt pledged to take in more than 17,300 refugees ― largely from Italian and Greek refugee camps ― by late 2017; so far it’s accepted just 1,100. \nBy contrast, Germany accepted 280,000 asylum seekers last year and 890,000 in 2015, according to Germany’s Ministry of the Interior.

We came here for a secure place because Syria is not a safe place.” JOSEP LAGO via Getty Images A woman marches in the pro-refugee demonstration in Barcelona on Saturday.
