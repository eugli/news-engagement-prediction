It’s very surprising to see how he hasn’t changed one bit. But this time it’s serious guys! We’d better stop mocking Swami. The saint man put up a video recently where he warned people to stop criticising him and hating him or they’ll have to face his wrath. If you think Swami taking credit for everyone’s victory in captaincy tasks during the show was annoying, you’ll definitely find this amusing. Swami also took credits for a recent earthquake in Delhi. Yes, it’s because of you guys who are constantly mocking him for being right. \nBut you still have a chance. Swami says that if you stop criticising him, you’ll be saved from a earthquake that’s about to occur tonight at around 10.30 pm. If not, it will be as destructive as the one in Nepal. Swami possesses magical powers and has already saved us from a missile attack once using just his tantrik powers. He even rooted for Manveer Gurjar in the show and he won Salman Khan’s reality show. Check out this video and bookmark it to be entertained whenever you’re bored. (ALSO READ: This video clip of Om Swami being “kidnapped” by the Bigg Boss 10 team is going viral ) \nAre you scared enough? Post your thoughts and prayers in the comments below. This is not the first time that Swami has threatened everyone. In fact, during the show he even threw holy water on the contestants to bless them but got kicked out of the house. He accused the makers of drugging his food inside the house which made him act so un-Swami-like. He also slapped Bhai since he had connections with the ISI and underworld mafia. It made a world of a difference in Bhai’s life, who has taken a vow of celibacy to join the saint man. \nAlso, do not sleep before 10.30 pm tonight and wait for that earthquake. Make sure your house is calamity-proofed and hide your pets in a safe place. While you take these precautionary measures, stay hooked with us for more scoop.
