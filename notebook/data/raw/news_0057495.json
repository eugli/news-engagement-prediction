Jamie xx, Chase & Status and Solange to join Frank Ocean at Lovebox 2017 \nYep, back in 1997 Sporty Spice, Baby Spice, Ginger Spice, Scary Spice and Posh Spice became the poster girls for Cool Britainnia with a barnstorming performance of Wannabe and Who Do You Think You Are, which of course featured Ginger’s now iconic Union Jack dress – an outfit still inspiring fancy dress costumes around the world even now. \nThe performance was a classic – in 2010 they won the Brit Award for Best Brits Performance of 30 Years for the moment – and they also capped off the night by picking up two awards – Best British Video (for Say You’ll Be There) and Best British Single (for Wannabe). \nWith just the stage to play with – and no big sets or anything to hid behind – the performance proved that with the right song, and a whole load of attitude, a moment like this will last for generations.
