K.J. Wright (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:21 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:21 a.m. ET \nK.J. Wright admits it. \nFor one night, the freshly minted Pro Bowl linebacker became a fan of the team that defeated his Seahawks in the playoffs en route to representing the NFC in Super Bowl 51. \nMORE: Ranking the 11 best teams that lost the Super Bowl \nThat’s because the Falcons were the lesser of two evils. \nAtlanta's Super Bowl opponent, the Patriots, were a far more loathed adversary — and understandably so. New England was the team that dashed Wright’s hopes for a second straight NFL championship with a comeback victory in Super Bowl 49. \nWright experienced the same heartbreak vicariously through a Falcons squad that suffered an even bigger collapse , squandering a 25-point lead as the Patriots secured their fifth Lombardi Trophy of the Bill Belichick/Tom Brady era. \n“I really hate (the Falcons) didn’t get the Super Bowl because they had it,” Wright told SiriusXM NFL Radio Tuesday night. \nMORE: Roddy White says Shanahan 'destroyed a dream' in Super Bowl \nWright said he “watched every play” of Super Bowl 51 as the Patriots overcame the 28-3 deficit. \n“It was just frustrating that they couldn’t figure out how to at least slow them down,” Wright said. “I knew once Tom had figured out (Atlanta’s defense), there was pretty much no stopping them. \n“You’ve got to tip your hat to Tom and the (Patriots) coaches because they just really, as always, game-planned them real well and made the in-game adjustments to find a way to get the job done.” \nWright believes New England’s experience from previous Super Bowl appearances paid dividends, especially when it came to handling the fallout from an extended 30-minute intermission during Lady Gaga’s halftime show. \n“You could tell,” Wright said. “(The Falcons) got really hyped in the beginning. As the game kept going on, I believe that fire kind of went out and they lost that energy they had. They were prepared for the game, but of course, it always comes down to finishing. \n“The Patriots have been in that position before. They have a veteran quarterback who has been there and a veteran coach.” \nMORE: Shanahan will 'live with consequences' of Super Bowl calls \nThe 2014 Seahawks also lost in crushing fashion to New England, when the Patriots overcame a double-digit deficit to win. Like the Falcons, Seattle’s offensive play-calling — specifically choosing to pass rather than run at pivotal moments — also came under heavy scrutiny as the main reason for coming up short. \nWhile they haven’t returned to a Super Bowl since, the Seahawks did advance to the NFC’s divisional round the past two seasons. Asked how the Falcons can rebound, Wright said, “It takes a lot of maturity. You’ve got to be honest with yourself and just find a way to make sure that’s not going to happen again. \n“You know you’re going to be in positions where you’re up in a big game. You’ve got to do the little things right to find a way so this (opponent) won’t come back. You’ve got to find a guy who makes an extra play in the game.” \nSeattle edged Atlanta at home in Week 6 of the regular season, well before a 36-20 playoff loss at the Georgia Dome. Matt Ryan’s 322 passing yards in the latter game was the highest total yielded all season by the Seahawks defense, which failed to neutralize Atlanta’s waves of skill-position personnel. \n“From the top down with the offensive coordinator (Kyle Shanahan) to all the different weapons they have, they just find a way to put guys in bad positions,” Wright said. \nMORE: Why Pats can go back-to-back \nBeside having toppled Atlanta, the 2016 Seahawks can stake claim to being the only team to defeat New England this past season with Brady under center. The Seahawks forced two Patriots turnovers and quarterback Russell Wilson outplayed Brady with 348 passing yards and three touchdowns in a 31-24 Week 10 road win. \n“That was one of those games we were really on as a defensive unit,” Wright said. “We were just looking for a little payback from that Super Bowl loss we had.” \nHaving beaten the Patriots and Falcons should give the 2017 Seahawks confidence about their chances of reaching Super Bowl 52. Wright said the top area of concentration for defensive improvement will be forcing more turnovers. Seattle finished with 19 takeaways, compared to 28 in 2015. \n“All my guys are coming back for the most part,” said Wright, who notched a career-high 126 tackles in 2016. “Of course, we might lose a few guys here and there in free agency but the core of the team is coming back. \n“I’m just excited that we have a year of wisdom to learn from each other and keep growing. I believe the guys are going to have a hungry mindset to get back to where we want to be as a team. We’re going to find a way to get it done.” \nThis way, Wright and his teammates won’t have to cheer for someone else if the Patriots return to the Super Bowl. \nAlex Marvez can be heard from 7 to 11 p.m. ET weekdays on SiriusXM NFL Radio.
