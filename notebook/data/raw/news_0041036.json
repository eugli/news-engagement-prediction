Fans watched her film the video in RHOBH Season 7 and it finally dropped on Feb. 14. Really, there is no better way to celebrate Valentine's Day with your friends or your significant other than with Jayne's new video, which is totally on fire. \nIt is far from anything you may think a Housewives video should be, but who ever said a Housewife had to fall under certain criteria? Jayne never said that, nor would she ever follow society's so-called rules of how a woman should act or carry themselves.

The video showcases the Bravolebrity in barely any clothes (and she totally rocks it) on a bed, in a bathtub, and dancing it up with both male and female dancers. If anything, by video's end, you'll probably find the song stuck in your head and you'll obviously want to become Erika Jayne. \nWith that, here are just a few highlights from the video that will most likely make your mouth drop open and utter at least once, \"Dayum.\" The Bathtub Scene \nA bath never looked so sexy and glamorous. \"Pat The P*ss\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:46:59.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
