Maybe you're looking for the ultimate Mother's Day gift or for an upcoming birthday well have no fear because you can show them how much you love them with Dimitri Payet memorabilia for just a snippet of the price. \nThe Frenchman might have left east London for pastures new but that won't stop you being able to celebrate him for all his glorious time at Upton Park and his less so glamorous time at the London Stadium. \nOf course the club were left so upset by his departure, because who likes to see a loved one move on, that they replaced the mural outside the ground with one of Andy Carroll's recent scissor kick but you can keep the love close to your heart with a cut price t-shirt. \nYou can get your own Payet t-shirt for just £3! That's a whole 50p cheaper than a pie at a West Ham game according to last year's Price of Football survey. \nBut a £3 t-shirt, in which Payet looks like he's in the middle of a target for those of you interested in that kind of thing, is a nice gesture to buy someone who really loves West Ham and Payet but is it really enough to show you love them? \nSure if it was Christmas time and you were looking for a stocking filler or a secret Santa gift for that guy in the office you really like then a crappy cheap ass t-shirt is great but what if it's your spouses 30th birthday, then you'd want to go all our right? \nWell fear not because the Payet sale at the Hammers shop also gives you the chance to grab a true bargain by only spending £150 on a framed signed shirt instead of the usual £300 it should cost! \nBargains really don't get better than that! Just ask Marseille who forked out £25 million for a player who only cost £10 million 18 months before and had only scored two Premier League goals this season. \nWatch West Ham fans sing their new chant for their dearly departed Payet: \n(Credit: George Karby) \nHammers legend recently said the club were better off without the French winger saying, \"It always looked like they'd get £25m for him, that's not too bad a deal at all considering we paid £10million for him. More importantly the unity of the team has proven the most important thing. \n\"In one sense it's sad to lose him but no matter how good you are if you behave like a prima donna and don't want to play [it's no great loss].\" \nIt's almost like fans don't love him?!
