While initially she brushed it off, the sensation did not go away and she eventually went to a nearby clinic close to her home in Injambakkam, in southern India. \nAt first doctors were perplexed, with the 42-year-old referred to three separate hospitals. At the fourth hospital, doctors used an endoscope to finally find the culprit - a full-grown, live cockroach that had nestled comfortably at the base of her skull, between the eyes and close to the brain. \nAccording to the New Indian Express, whenever the insect moved the woman felt 'a burning sensation' in her eyes. \nAt first doctors tried to use a suction device to remove it, but the insect clung to the tissues. Using a combination of suction and forceps, the doctors were eventually able to extract the bug after a 45 minute procedure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:59:14.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
