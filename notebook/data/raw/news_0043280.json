After a gradual slowing down of box-office numbers throughout last week, Akshay Kumar has much reason to smile now. \nHis film Jolly LLB 2 got massive footfalls on Saturday and thus, the box-office graph saw a sudden rise. Rs 100 crore doesn't seem so far now if this pace can be maintained throughout week 2. \nMOVIE REVIEW: JOLLY LLB 2 \nCompeting against Jolly LLB 2 are multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases that hit the screens this week. \nMost prominent among them are The Ghazi Attack which is expected to do well thanks to positive word of mouth. On the Hollywood front, there is the action thriller John Wick 2 and the animated film The Lego Batman Movie. \nNevertheless, Akki has already crossed the Rs 85-crore mark. It is only a matter of time till Jolly LLB 2 is declared a super-hit. \nHere is the complete day by day box-office collection of Jolly LLB 2: \nWEEK 1 \nDay 1 (10th Feb, Friday) - Rs 13.20 crore \nDay 2 (11th Feb, Saturday) - Rs 17.31 crore \nDay 3 (12th Feb, Sunday) - Rs 19.95 crore \nDay 4 (13th Feb, Monday) - Rs 7.26 crore \nDay 5 (14th Feb, Tuesday) - Rs 9.07 crore \nDay 6 (15th Feb, Wednesday) - Rs 5.89 crore \nDay 7 (16th Feb, Thursday) - Rs 5.03 crore \nWEEK 2 \nDay 8 (17th Feb, Friday) - Rs 4.14 crore \nDay 9 (18th Feb, Saturday) - Rs 5.02 crore \nTotal box-office collection of Jolly LLB 2 after TEN days: Rs 86.87 crore \nJolly LLB 2 is the first of many films starring Akshay Kumar this year. Akshay will be next seen in a cameo role in Taapsee Pannu-starrer Naam Shabana, the prequel to Baby. Followed by this, Akshay will be seen in the Hindi film Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and 2.0, the sequel to Enthiran, that will unite Rajinikanth with Akshay as hero and villain, respectively. \n2016 was a highly successful year for Akshay Kumar as all his three films that released last year, Airlift, Housefull 3 and Rustom, earned over Rs 100 crore at the box office. Will Akshay be able to replicate that success this year? Only time will tell.
