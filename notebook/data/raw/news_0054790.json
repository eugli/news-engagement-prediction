Those poignant pieces, scrawled with phrases like Common sense is not so common and Tomorrow is now yesterday were crafted in collaboration with artist Coco Capitán. If Capitán’s signature sketchy font seems familiar, you probably recognize it from Drake’s “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” album cover, which was an unauthorized knock on Capitán’s style. And if her name sounds familiar it’s because she was helped create much of Julien Dossena’s earliest imagery at Paco Rabanne, and her photography has appeared in international fashion mags. Her emotive text is an easy match for Alessandro Michele’s romantic visions at Gucci, and when the brand came calling about a collaboration, saying yes was obvious. \"Who wouldn't!\" she proclaims about why she accepted the job. Of Michele, she has only good feelings, too, explaining why she loves his Gucci thus: “His non-nostalgic vision of the past with his ability to make it contemporary. The importance he gives to love. The uniqueness of everything he has done since he arrived.\" For the collaboration, Capitán focused on her sayings, leaving the garments and their creation to Michele. \"The focus was on the message and not so much in the materials or platforms used to transmit it,” she says. “That is always flattering for an artist. They have been the first ones in considering possibilities for my work outside of the established.\" Considering Michele wore a tee with her text on it for his finale bow, we’d say her contributions to the collection were among the designer’s favorite pieces. She reciprocates, naming the text on the tee the designer wore as her favorite piece. Its slogan? I want to go back to believing a story.
