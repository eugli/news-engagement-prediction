They can diversify the team so well when counter-attacking. So quick with the ball, without the ball. Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling have struck up a friendship - and Yaya Toure thinks they could terrorise defences for City for years to come \n“Raheem with the ball, without the ball. Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero the same, with the ball, without the ball. I think this year, they’re younger and very, very fast.” \nSterling has been transformed under Guardiola, after Manuel Pellegrini tried to get him to fit into his one-touch, two-touch style of playing. \nFrom day one Guardiola told the England winger that he wanted him to get on the ball and run at defenders. \nAnd that has made Sterling a disruptive attacking force, even if his end product still requires some polish. Raheem Sterling has caused defences serious problems this season \nToure says that will come for the 22-year-old and for 21-year-old Sane. \nAsked if they could be world-class, Toure said: “I think so. For them to participate in Champions League, to be able to play against big defenders, they’re going to learn more. \n“Those guys can make any defence, even in Premier League or Europa or Champions League, they can make them suffer. \n“In training sometimes when Sane or Raheem take me, it’s so difficult. They’re quick, they’re sharp. When you see them they’re hungry, they push them. Push them. \n“I think you can see, when you compare Raheem from last year to this year, I see a massive change.” Leroy Sane has looked like a quality player since he returned from injury last month \nIs that down to Guardiola? “To be honest, yeah,” said Toure \n“Because now Raheem is full of confidence, playing clearly, his feet, he’s good and always up there – always the same pace. \n“Unbelievable, you see Sané as well, playing brilliant as well. I think our strikers are fantastic, fantastic.” \nToure, playing against one of his former clubs, also feels that City's style might be more suited to success in Europe, with the Blues trailing behind Chelsea in the Premer League.

If we all chase and focus on goal, we can do it.” BT Sport is your home of unmissable live football.
