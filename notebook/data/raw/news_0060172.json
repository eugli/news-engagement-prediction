And it was real.’’\nIt was 12 years ago already, and since then the Sox have participated in one – count it, one – postseason appearance.\nRowand, the center fielder who crashed into walls for that team who now serves as Sox coordinator for baserunning and outfield play, is here to do his part to change all that.\nAaron Rowand, in action during Game 3 of the American League Division Series at Fenway Park.

When you have a leader like [first-year manager] Rick Renteria, he inspires people. I can’t say enough about what he’s already done to bring this group together. And it’s only going to get better the longer he’s here. He’s going to do a great job. He already is.’’\nRowand echoes what so many others are saying here about the things Renteria is doing to bond players in camp. Rowand says unity is key and vastly underrated. In fact, the tightness of the 2005 team is what still stands out to him.\n“Just how close we were as a group, that’s what was so special about that team,’’ said Rowand, who played five of his 11 seasons in Chicago. “Taking home that trophy was a big deal and what everybody sees. What they don’t see is how close we were as a unit and how much we cared about each other. We not only spent all our time together on the field but away from each other. That team was about as tight as tight gets.’’\nThe 2005 team is close to this day, and that kind of chemistry translated into better baseball, Rowand insists.\n“There was a lot of selfless play,’’ he said. “Nobody cared how [statistics], we just knew if we played together, backed up our teammates, the numbers would be there at the end of the year. It was a group of guys who bought into winning.’’\nRowand got a taste of being on the manager’s side during the Arizona Fall League with the Glendale Desert Dogs, a mix of young players from the Sox, Phillies, Dodgers and Astros farm systems.\nWas that the beginning of the grooming of a future manager?\n“Maybe when my kids get older,’’ Rowand, 39, said. “My son is in sixth grade so it’s kind of important for me to be around them right now. I wouldn’t rule it out but honestly I don’t have any agenda for what I want to do.’’\nCourtney Hawkins, for one, can see it happening.\n“He was a player so he was like one of the guys as a manager, but he knows the game and he had our respect,’’ said Hawkins, a 2012 first-round draft choice who played for the Desert Dogs. “I feel like that was a steppingstone for him. He was great at it.’’\n“It was a great learning experience,’’ Rowand said. “The baseball part of it is easy but when you manage you have to manage people, too.\n“I’m a lighthearted guy. I loving having a good time on the field, in the dugout and in the clubhouse. But there is a time to play and a time to do things the right way. I take the same approach as a coach I did as a player.’’\n# white-sox Aaron Rowand Chicago", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=1024", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-26gp", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=150", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=1340", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=768", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=458", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-55893358.jpg?w=670&#038;h=438"], "published": "2017-02-23T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:20:02.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
