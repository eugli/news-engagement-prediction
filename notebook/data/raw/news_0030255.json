We automatically think that's a good thing,\" said Perry.\n\"They aren't yet ready … to develop a critical way of analyzing the information they are getting.\"\nDuring CBC's education forum, Inside the Classroom, featuring 30 educators from across the province, several teachers and counsellors raised issues about social media, video games, and their impact on student behaviours.\nSocial media issues \"A lot of the problems we have in school are because of social media,\" said Joe Santos, a high school teacher on the northeast Avalon.\n\"There's very few students now in schools that don't have some kind of device they can communicate with.\"\nJoe Santos, a high school teacher on the northeast Avalon, said students often make sinister plans quietly with their cell phones. (CBC)\nStudents are speaking behind each other's backs and sometimes making sinister plans in total silence — out of earshot from intervening teachers.\nSantos said some of the issues they've encountered range from settling scores with violence, to making drug deals, all arranged quietly through the use of cell phones in school.\nUp all night Technology raised concerns with other teachers as well, who spoke of students coming to class zonked after long nights of video gaming.\n\"They're too tired to learn,\" said Kimberly Fifield, an elementary school teacher on the northeast Avalon.\n\"They could fall asleep in class, they could become agitated, they're more irritable. They're just unable to focus on what you're trying to teach them in the run of a day.\"\nElementary school teacher Kimberly Fifield said her students come to class tired from playing video games all night. (CBC)\nAccording to Santos, attendance rates go down after the release of a highly anticipated video game, as his students stay up all night to finish the game.\nThe long hours spent playing video games, sometimes graphic and violent, can have an impact over time, said Angela Wilmott, a school counsellor in central Newfoundland.\nInside the Classroom: Read all of the reports in our series \"If you're role playing war games for hours every day, it has an impact in how your brain is working and how you're dealing with stress and anxiety,\" she said.\nWhile there is some scientific debate over the impact of video game addiction, several studies have linked playing for excessive hours with issues like depression, anxiety, and attention deficit disorder. Whether gaming is causing the disorders, or is simply an outlet for kids with those disorders, is unproven.\nQuestionable language Video games could also be partially responsible for the language kids are using, Wilmott said.\nKids play interactive games like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto , where their online teammates and opponents could be adults.\nOnline games like Call of Duty put younger students into social interactions with strangers, who could be much older and using foul language, said school counsellor Angela Wilmott.\nWilmott said she worries about the kids being exposed to vulgar language through those interactions.\n\"That's becoming much more common,\" she said.\n\"To see that now in primary, elementary… Where are those kids going to be in Grade 11?\"\nClick here to read more stories from Ryan Cooke It's a question Perry also ponders, as he sees students at his school being consumed by technology.\n\"We see that shift [to the social media age] and think they are so much more exposed to things, but they are not ready to handle the sorts of things they are exposed to,\" he said.\nWith files from Ramona Dearing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:04:30.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
