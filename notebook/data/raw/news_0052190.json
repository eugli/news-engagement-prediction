In 2015, it apologized after labeling Ben Carson an “extremist.” The latest report included many California groups, such as the Golden State Skinheads, Identity Evropa and Islam Threat, whose platforms are explicitly discriminatory. But the classification of other groups drew pushback. Californians for Population Stabilization , a Santa Barbara group with thousands of members, was labeled anti-immigrant by the center. Mr. Potok attributed the determination in part to troubling remarks about race and eugenics made by people formerly linked to the group. Benjamin Zuckerman , the group’s president, vehemently objected to the characterization. The organization’s objectives, he said, are twofold: environmental conservation and fairness to working Americans who are harmed by “over immigration.” “I consider us pretty much just ordinary people,” said Dr. Zuckerman, who is also an astronomy professor at U.C.L.A. “We just have a view that too many people for a given environmental carrying capacity is just not good.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)
