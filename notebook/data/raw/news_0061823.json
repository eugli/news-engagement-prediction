But now we need to make sure we have good quality control and a transparent framework.” What can this tiny island show Texas about finding great teachers? A lot, actually \nTexas has more than 200 providers who train teachers, including traditional universities as well as a thriving alternative certification sector, by far the nation’s largest. In fact, more than half of all new teachers in Texas earn their license through alternative certification. \nBut the quality of teacher prep programs ranges dramatically because of loose regulations, the report found. For example, would-be teachers aren’t required to have any significant classroom experience before they take the lead. \nThat means teachers are entering the classroom woefully unprepared, Fitzpatrick said. \nSo the report recommends using data to identify which programs are doing the best job training future teachers and which are struggling. The state should also create a tiered licensure process that reflects the level of preparation, such as if classroom experience was included. \nThe top tier would be awarded to master-level teachers, top-performing educators who would serve as peer leaders,taking on additional duties like mentoring. \nMeanwhile, all teacher programs would be required to meet higher standards for certification and reapply for accreditation. \nWhile some changes would require legislative action or regulatory steps by state officials, local districts can also take action to improve quality, such as more formalized mentoring, said officials from Educate Texas. \nPriscilla Aquino Garza, a policy director at Educate Texas who worked on the report, admits she struggled as a first year history teacher. \n“Most teachers are entering the classroom under prepared on Day 1 no matter where they were certified,” Garza said. “Someone just gave me a box and supplies and that was it. It’s just really hard to prepare for everything, so you need those mentors you can reach out to to help you along the way.” \nEducate Texas is an initiative by the Communities Foundation of Texas that brings together educators, nonprofits and state officials to work on education issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:53:02.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
