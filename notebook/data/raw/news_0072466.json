While they do the dirty work, Future spends most of his time hanging out in a phone booth, in case you forgot how atmospheric actual telephones in big glass boxes could be. \nNot only do they take the money and run, but Future's accomplices also get to take out their violent rage on apparently deserving ex-boyfriends. It's a win-win for everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:04:00.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
