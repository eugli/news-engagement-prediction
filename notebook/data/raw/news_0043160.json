Today, a series of questionably-sourced images lend a bit more credence to Samsung getting rid of the S7’s physical home button and moving entirely to on-screen virtual buttons. China protective film manufacturers exposure Galaxy S8 pic.twitter.com/8VOXpikUsc — Ice universe (@UniverseIce) February 21, 2017 Ditching the actual button gave Samsung the freedom to design the S8 with an extremely minimal surrounding bezel at the top and bottom of the phone. (The side bezels had already reached “barely there” status on the S7 Edge.) The images appear to show the screen turned on, but I’m not entirely sold on that. The shots with Samsung’s always-on display (the big clock) seem realistic enough, but the main photo of the screen feels a little fake to me — more static demo unit than actual OLED display. Still, these shots align with a previous leak from VentureBeat . Those photos showed the S8 in silver, while these appear to be the black model (with a glossy black aluminum frame). https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/833937819030544384 Look at all those sensors at the top of the phone! It’s a bit unsightly but makes sense since the S8 is likely to feature an iris scanner, something we first saw in the recalled Note 7. Separately, a tipster has provided Android Police with a purported “system dump” of files from the upcoming Galaxy Tab S3 tablet, rumored to debut at Mobile World Congress. Among those files are some images that depict the Galaxy S8, confirming the relocation of the phone’s fingerprint sensor to the left side of the camera lens. Android Police The images also confirm on-screen navigation keys and that tiny bottom bezel. And finally, we get a very basic look at Samsung’s dock for the S8, which will give it a desktop-like experience similar to Windows Continuum. Samsung reportedly plans to call this feature “DeX.” According to VentureBeat , Samsung plans to unveil the Galaxy S8 at a March 29th event in New York City, launching the device in two sizes a month later on April 21st.
