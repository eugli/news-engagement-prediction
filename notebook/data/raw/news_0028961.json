And early indications are that the powers that be in the state party aren’t wild about their options.\nAdvertisement\nTheir quandary doesn’t come as a surprise. The GOP’s numbers are tiny in both chambers of the Legislature. With the exception of Scott Brown, they haven’t elected a member of Congress since the Clinton administration. Governor Charlie Baker, by far the most popular Republican in the state, already has the job he wants. The bench is thin.\nAnd it doesn’t help that Warren has become a full-fledged national figure. Her already high profile got an invaluable boost last week when her attempt to Quote: a letter from civil rights icon Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor was shut down by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here Republicans feel pressure to wage a credible campaign against the state’s senior senator. They believe her bare-knuckles approach draws no small share of detractors, even amid an army of admirers. They believe giving her a race is not beyond the realm of plausibility, even if she isn’t likely to lose.\nView Story GOP searches for challenger to Warren Warren, who has emerged as a leading voice against President Trump, is up for re-election next year.\nThere’s just one small problem: The GOP needs a worthy candidate.\nIt isn’t that there aren’t Republicans willing to take Warren on. It’s just that they are, in various ways, problematic. Either they are too closely tied to a president who is deeply unpopular in Massachusetts, or they have tiny name recognition. Or, as in the case of the ubiquitous Schilling, they are, well, unpredictable.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, these categories aren’t mutually exclusive.\nBy conventional standards, the best candidate against Warren might be state Representative Geoffrey Diehl of Whitman. He is a favorite of party conservatives and reportedly hopes to make an issue of Warren’s frequent attacks on Trump and Washington Republicans. That would figure to rally Republicans in a primary fight.\nBut he isn’t likely to have the field to himself. Businessman Rick Green might run. In political circles, he is best known as the money behind the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, a conservative nonprofit. Green chaired John Kasich’s presidential campaign in Massachusetts, which I guess makes him a moderate.\nThere is persistent speculation that voters haven’t seen the last of Gabriel Gomez, the businessman and former Navy SEAL who lost to Ed Markey in 2013. Gabs seemed like a great candidate on paper — military, Latino, successful businessman — but it didn’t translate into real-life politics. My lasting image of Gomez is the video of him getting away from the Globe’s Stephanie Ebbert when she tried to ask him about his inflated claims of job creation. He seems to have become more of a moderate since his race, which could help.\nThe wild card in the race is Schilling. His heroics on the diamond are a matter of record, but his life off he field has hardly been senatorial. He’s been a failed businessman (just Google “38 Studios” and “bailout” for details); a fired broadcaster; a man accused, quite understandably, of being sexist, racist, and homophobic on social media; and a guy who just a few months ago “joked” about lynching journalists.\nYou see why the GOP doesn’t seem ready to coalesce around him.\nThe 2018 race feels a long way off, especially with events in Washington shocking the nation on a daily basis. Heaven knows, we’ve all seen how much can happen in politics in a surprisingly short time.\nBut it is impressive how quickly Warren has solidified her position in Massachusetts politics. Yes, she elicits strong passions on both ends of the political spectrum. But few will say she is likely to lose her seat. Warren is just four years into her Senate career, yet it feels like she’s been there much longer.\nAdrian Walker is a Globe columnist.\nHe can be reached at adrian.walker@globe.com .
