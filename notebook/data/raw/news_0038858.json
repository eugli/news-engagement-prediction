Bradley Beal (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:55 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:55 a.m. ET \nWizards guard Bradley Beal is mystified, and so are others. \nBeal, who's averaging 22.2 points per game for the 34-21 Wiz, won't be among the East All-Stars after Carmelo Anthony of the 23-34 Knicks was selected to replace an injured Kevin Love on the roster. \nMORE: Steve Kerr considers having Durant, Westbrook on floor together \n“I’ll never say a player doesn’t deserve to be on the All-Star team. For one, Carmelo is a great player. Hell, he’s been one of the best offensive threats in the league for years now, and I’m taking absolutely nothing away from him. But the process of it does not make sense. If they reward winning, then I don’t understand how the decision was made,” Beal told The Washington Post . “It was kind of weird to me.” \nNaturally, Beal's agent wasn't happy his client was snubbed. \"... Nobody can question he’s playing not just at an All-Star level but at an elite All-Star level,\" Mark Bartelstein told The Post. \nIt's not like Anthony doesn't have the numbers. He's averaging 23.4 points per game and 6.1 rebounds. Anthony is also replacing a frontcourt player in Love. \nStill, Beal has plenty of supporters making his case. “Bradley Beal should’ve been an All-Star. I can’t believe he’s not.” Kentucky coach John Calipari, who coached Beal's backcourt mate John Wall at UK, told The Post.
