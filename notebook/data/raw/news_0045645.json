And you've got Faletau to come off the bench.\" \nFaletau's second half appearance was his comeback following a knee injury suffered playing for Bath on Christmas Eve. Ross Moriarty and Taulupe Faletau (right) play for clubs in the English Premiership \nCardiff Blues' Warburton, Tipuric of Ospreys and Gloucester's Moriarty also started in Wales' opening Six Nations game - the 33-7 win in Italy. \nWilliams, who won 100 caps for Wales between 1996 and 2012, has been impressed with the form of 22-year-old Moriarty for club and country. \n\"He was simply sensational for the time he was on the park last week,\" Williams told BBC Wales' Scrum V programme. \n\"You can't drop someone like Moriarty. Again on Friday night for Gloucester against Saracens he was outstanding. \n\"If somebody's in that form just keep them going. \n\"There's always been a debate come Warburton and Tipuric playing together and it's been so far so good in this tournament.\" \nWilliams also believes wing Alex Cuthbert responded in style to criticism of his performance in the defeat by England with a try in the Blues' 57-20 win over Treviso. \nCuthbert missed a tackle on Elliot Daly for England's winning try in the Six Nations match and was released back to his region. \nBlues head coach Danny Wilson has urged Welsh fans to back the 26-year-old wing while Williams was impressed with the performance of his former team-mate against Treviso. \n\"It just shows his mental strength,\" Williams said. \n\"He could easily have had the week off and go and hide but he wanted to play and it was the old Alex Cuthbert. \n\"It was good to see him back in form.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:52:27.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
