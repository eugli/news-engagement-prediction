The government also insisted it would choose the CEO, though after a public call. \nJudge Farrugia Sacco was twice recommended for impeachment by the judiciary watchdog – the Commission for the Administration of Justice – on accusations of breaching the judiciary’s code of ethics. An impeachment motion for his removal was moved by former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi which was still pending when there was a change of government in 2013. The Speaker appointed by the new Labour administration, Anġlu Farrugia, ruled that the motion could not be carried from one legislature to the other. \nStill, the judiciary watchdog recommended again that the judge should be impeached, with Prime Minister Joseph Muscat then presenting a new motion. \nThe judge took the matter to court and the government decided to await the outcome before Parliament would proceed with the impeachment process. Eventually, the judge reached retirement age and the impeachment motion fell through. \nThe Chief Justice had relieved the judge from his duties in view of the Prime Minister’s motion. \nThe new CEO, Carlo Mifsud, from Siġġiewi, is known to be new to the field. He was chief officer at the Gaming Authority post-2013. « A cancer patient's experience: ‘I have to give life my best shot’ Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=80986375454&n=47824a84' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=80986375454&n=47824a84' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
