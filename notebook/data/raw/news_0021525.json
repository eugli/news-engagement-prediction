(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson / IndyStar) Buy Photo \nAs someone who grew up near the intersection of 21st Street and Carrollton Avenue, Mike Epps performs stand-up comedy in his hometown on an annual basis. \nThis year, he is bringing familiar names as guests for his Feb. 10 show at Indiana Farmers Coliseum: Rickey Smiley, whose syndicated radio show is heard weekday mornings on WHHH-FM (96.3), and Tony Rock, younger brother of Chris Rock. \nEpps, who had a brief network run last summer as the star of ABC's \"Uncle Buck\" sitcom, talked to IndyStar about his Hoosier roots, Valentine's Day and the status of \"Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?\" — the yet-to-be-made biopic Epps has been attached to star in since August 2014: \nQuestion: Indiana Farmers Coliseum is a big room. Growing up, did you see performances, whether it was a musician or a comedian, that kind of put in your mind, “That’s where I want to be some day”? \nAnswer: I went to the Fresh Fest (at Market Square Arena in 1985) with Run-DMC and Whodini. I was like, “I want to do that.” That was my first big concert. \nQ: I did a little podcast research, and I heard about one of your first jokes. It was about a drive-by shooting on a tractor. Has the town vs. country contrast of Indianapolis and Indiana factored into your comedy over the years? \nA: I live in L.A., where everybody says, “Man you sound like you’re from the South.” “No, I’m from the Midwest.” Because I sound country to everybody else. I love being from Indiana. A lot of people can’t claim that they’re from Indiana. I’m in a room by myself all the time. And I love it. \nQ: Because you’re the only one? \nA: That’s right. \nQ: In your Netflix special “Don’t Take It Personal” you do quite a bit of age-dynamics material. This is how you interact with younger women, this is how older women interact with you, this is how older dudes interact with each other. Why do you find it interesting to cover all those bases? \nA: That’s who we’re dealing with. We’re dealing with older people, we’re dealing with young people, we’re dealing with all different walks of life. So when you talk about something that they can all relate to, that’s when you really get to them. \nQ: Because your Indianapolis show is close to Valentine’s Day, I’ll ask, how’s your love life going? \nA: Uh, you know, I’m in love with the cocoa. \nQ: Any Valentine’s advice? \nA: Ladies, go pick your man up butt-naked with just a trench coat at the airport. \nQ: May I ask for an update on the status of the “Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?” film? \nA: Still waiting. Still waiting in the cut. And when that movie does come out, all the anticipation is going to be like a Dr. Dre album. \nQ: Are you OK with simmering and pacing yourself? You haven’t peaked with your preparation, have you? \nA: I mean, you know, I’m Mike Epps all day, 24/7. That’s who I am, and that’s who I work on. And if they come up with Richard Pryor, I’ll be ready to do it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:39:20.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
