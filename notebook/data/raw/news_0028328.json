Photo: Andrew Meares \nAs the Closing the Gap report again paints a grim picture of disadvantage in Australia, there is universal acknowledgement of ongoing failure and a seemingly genuine spirit of engagement between Indigenous people and government policymakers is taking hold in Canberra. \nAfter the Turnbull government's recent \"refresh\" of its Indigenous advisory council, the Redfern Statement – spearheaded by the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples – was presented to Mr Turnbull on Tuesday morning. \nFirst released last year, the Redfern Statement has struggled to gain traction in Parliament and Congress has previously had a hostile relationship with the Coalition government. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister greeted the Redfern Statement by saying the vision \"aligns with the government's commitment to do things with Indigenous Australians, not do things to them\". \n\"We'll work to ensure that the Closing the Gap initiatives are community-driven and recognise that Indigenous leaders are absolutely central – paramount – to finding the solutions in a way that supports identity and wellbeing,\" Mr Turnbull said. \nBut some of the demands contained in the document face an uphill battle. None more so than the calls for more than $500 million in Abbott-era Indigenous funding cuts to be reversed and the creation of a new Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. \nCongress co-chair Jackie Huggins said: \"In giving [the Closing the Gap report] to Parliament, I expect that you, Prime Minister, and most in this house will be somewhat frustrated and disappointed at the slow pace of change and the continuation of our first people's poor health and wellbeing. How could you not be given the statistics in front of you? The negatives override the positives.\" \nDr Huggins said governments needed to abandon \"cycles of failure\" and embrace the solutions offered by Aboriginal communities and organisation, looking to the \"torches lighting the path to a better future for our people\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:42:23.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
