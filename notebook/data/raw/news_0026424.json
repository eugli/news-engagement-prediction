The NSW Energy Minister had earlier urged residents to go out to the movies or a local shopping centre to escape the heat, in a bid to reduce electricity usage.

Picture: AAP \nLuckily for South Australia relief from the seemingly never-ending heatwave has come at long last, however the state's energy woes are likely to persist with no immediate solution to boosting the reliability of electricity supply. \nAdelaide and most of the state sweltered through another scorcher on Friday with the city hitting 40C and some regional centres pushing above 46C after similar highs on Wednesday and Thursday. \nThe state avoided blackouts for a second day in a row as the Bureau of Meteorology forecast slightly milder conditions for Saturday ahead of a more significant cool change on Sunday. \nHowever, the south-westerly winds that will blow through the state will do nothing to cool the debate over the state's energy crisis. \nThe federal government continues to blame SA's heavy reliance on renewables, which it says has left the electricity network wanting following the closure of the state's last coal-fired power station last year.
