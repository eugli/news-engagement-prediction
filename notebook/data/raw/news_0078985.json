Rickman, also known for the \"Harry Potter\" films, died of cancer in January 2016, aged 69. \nRichard (Curtis) wrote to me and said 'Darling I can't write anything for you because of Alan' and I said 'No, of course you can't, it would be sad, too sad, it's too soon,'\" Thompson told Reuters at the UK launch of Disney's new Beauty and the Beast film on Thursday night. \n\"It's absolutely right, it's supposed to be for Comic Relief and there isn't much comic relief in the loss of our dear friend really only just over a year ago... We thought and thought but it just seemed wrong.\" \nThe 2003 movie is set in the run-up to Christmas, with different stories of romance and love woes, like Rickman's character getting close to a female colleague. In one scene, Thompson's character tears up alone in the bedroom when she discovers a necklace he bought is not for her. \nWhile saying it was \"absolutely the right decision\" to leave her out, Thompson said the idea of the sequel was appealing. \"To revisit the wonderful fun characters of Bill Nighy and Hugh Grant and all of that, that's fantastic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:24:50.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
