Business is quite slow during the school holidays, but Nasir still churns out plenty of apam balik for customers who ply Jalan Air Itam. \nHis apam balik is tasty – not too sweet and with generous filling. The stall opens every day from noon to late evening. \n2 Sweet Potato Balls \nI have fond memories of accompanying my mother to the Batu Lanchang Market and tucking into snacks from the adjacent food complex. My favourite? The fried sweet potato and tapioca balls from Yeoh Bakery (stall No. 35). \nTheir deliciously addictive offerings include the yam rolls, mini curry puffs, doughnuts and cream puffs. \nOwner Richard Yeoh gets everything ready at about 7am from his home and sells the treats at the stall (noon-5pm). \n3 Pisang Goreng \nIt cannot be said often enough that the pisang goreng (banana fritters) at the Tanjung Bungah Pisang Goreng stall is one of the best. Cousins Teh Choon Pin and Lim Thuan Hin operate from a white van near the Maybank branch along Jalan Tanjung Bungah. \nPerfectly ripe Pisang Raja is double dipped in a secret batter and fried to perfection alongside sweet potato, tapioca, kuih bakul (nian gao), cekodok and green bean. \nOpen from 1pm to 6pm, they have been around for over 40 years. Visit their Facebook page: Penang Pisang Goreng. \n4 Samosa \nLittle India in Penang is a destination for food. Be sure to check out the Penang Famous Samosa stall along Lebuh Pasar (Market Street) just across from Queen Street. \nSardine, chicken and vegetarian samosa are fried fresh daily alongside vadai and sweet purees. \nThe samosa are crispy and do not have that undesirable soggy texture. Get a few and head to one of the coffeeshops or restaurants to have your hot cup of tea with them (2pm-6pm). \n5 Omapodi \nThis delicious and spicy snack made from gram and rice flour mixed with spices and peanuts is available in a few shops in Little India, but the ones at Penang Famous Samosa stall are pretty tasty. \nTheir version has delectable flavours of garlic and just the right amount of heat from the chilli powder. You can also find omapodi in Thulasiraman along Lebuh Pasar. \n6 Ginger Tea \nIf you find yourself around Penang Road, try the ginger tea at T.S. Bismi stall along Lebuh Tamil. \nYou cannot miss the fresh aroma of ginger coming from the huge cauldron of boiled ginger. The stall is manned by Abdul Majeed Seeni Mohamad, who took over the business from his grandfather, whom he was named after. \nThe tea leaves are imported from Sri Lanka and Majeed uses cow’ \n7 \nPenang is synonymous with cendol \nYou will notice two stalls – the famous one has a long queue, but the cendol \nWhat makes a good bowl of cendol ? A balanced ratio of coconut milk, gula melaka \nNutmeg, mango, buah salak , guava and papaya – \nThe stalls open as early 7.30am and close at 7pm \nHonestly, this can be consumed for breakfast, lunch, tea or dinner. It’s just versatile, and because it’ \nThe steamed flat rice noodle rolls are kept nestled and warm in the steamer. Once ordered, they are brought out, chopped and drizzled with a sweet sauce, chilli sauce and prawn paste ( hea ko", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:37:20.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
