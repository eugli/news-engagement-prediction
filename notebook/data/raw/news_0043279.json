Donald Trump vs The Media \nA feisty Donald Trump takes on the media during his press conference at the White house. \n\"[His press conference] could have been evidence in a mental competency hearing,\" he told The Washington Post . \"It was really pretty disturbing and terrifying to watch this guy and think: 'What happens when the stakes are higher?'\" \nOn Saturday, The New York Times ' conservative columnist David Brooks wrote in similar language about the press conference: \"President Trump's mental state is like a train that long ago left freewheeling and iconoclastic, has raced through indulgent, chaotic and unnerving, and is now careening past unhinged, unmoored and unglued.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link US President Donald Trump walks up the steps of Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on his way to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Photo: AP \nIt's not just the commentariat in the \"fake press\", on which Trump has upped the ante, denouncing them as \"the enemy of the American people\" . Mental health professionals are weighing in. \nIn a letter to the editor of The New York Times last week , 35 psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers acknowledged they were in breach of professional rules against evaluating public figures, but to remain silent, they wrote, denied journalists and members of Congress the value of their expertise at this critical time. Advertisement \nHere's their diagnosis: \"Mr. Trump's speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behaviour suggest a profound inability to empathise. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists). \n\"In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr Trump's speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Victoria Barette from Jacksonville, Florida, puts her hand on her heart on inauguration day.

But he also had this to say - Trump may be a \"world-class narcissist\".

Another psychologist weighed in last month, telling US News and World Report that Trump displays a malignant narcissism, characterised by grandiosity, sadism and anti-social behaviour. \nTrump biographer Michael D'Antonio observes: \"He lives inside his head, where he runs the same continuous loop of conflict with people he turns into enemies for the purposes of his psychodrama.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link As doubts over Trump mount, eyes will turn to leading Republicans in Congress, such as failed presidential candidate Marco Rubio.

As though he couldn't help himself, he seized the lectern at the end of a first chaotic month that had prompted this assessment from General Tony Thomas, head of the military's Special Operations Command: \"Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon, because we're a nation at war.\" \nIn casting aside the usual filters and talking heads such as Sean Spicer and Kellyanne Conway, Trump signalled an attempted reset. After weeks of leaks, he is determined to rewrite the agenda â€“ he was doing it again at a Boeing factory in South Carolina on Friday and at a campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday.

The Florida rally, she said, was an attempt \"for the President to speak directly to the American people and not have his message filtered through a biased media.\" \nAt the end of last week, one of the few generous assessments of Trump as President was this from his ally and former House speaker Newt Gingrich: \"All new presidents go through a series of resets because the initial transition from campaign to governing is to enormous and complex ... Trump's challenge is compounded because he is a genuine outsider trying to build a new system.\" \nBut it's seemingly impossible for Trump to get out from under the weight of bad news. \nAs he basked in the limelight at Boeing on Friday, Associated Press dropped an exclusive â€“ an internal administration document outlining a plan for the National Guard to be drafted to round up undocumented migrants. Despite its conformity with all that Trump said in the election campaign, the White House claimed it had been discarded. \nAlso on Friday, Trump hit a new low in opinion polls â€“ confirming his standing as the least popular new president in American history, Gallup found that just 38 per cent of Americans approve his performance, against 56 per cent who disapprove. \nAmidst a constant sense of crisis, two emerging patterns work against Trump â€“ the Republican establishment figures who might save his administration are increasingly reluctant to work for him and he is being hemmed in by the checks and balances of the American democratic process. \nAlso working against him is the toxic brew he has concocted in the White House â€“ factions divided by ideology and new hires defeated by their youth and inexperience. \nAfter the debacle of appointing a national security adviser who proved incapable of surviving in the job for a month , Trump is desperately seeking for a replacement. \nHis first pick as a replacement said thanks, but no thanks . And Republican favourites like David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, and Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser, saved Trump from further embarrassment by saying they wouldn't take the job if it was offered to them. \nTrump and those around him are paranoid about loyalty . In the last week, the State Department sacked six senior career staffers who were deemed suspect. And faction wars continue with gusto. \nThe appointment of veteran Republican media strategist Mike Dubke as the new White House communications director is the latest flashpoint, with Trump loyalists mewling about Dubke's GOP establishment credentials. \n\"How does this help serve the President's interests?\" a Trump insider complained. \"It serves the interests of Reince [Priebus] and Sean [Spicer, both seen as party establishment figures], but I don't see how it serves the President's interests.\" \nThe checks and balances that Trump mocks are surprisingly effective. \nDespite his policy adviser Stephen Miller claiming \"the powers of the President to protect our country .â€‰.â€‰. will not be questioned\" or that \"there's no such thing as judicial supremacy\", Trump has been hogtied by the courts on his migration crackdown â€“ and despite all his ranting at \"disgraceful\" judges and their \"political\" decisions, he has acknowledged that he is bound by their rulings. \nThe media are hanging in too. Despite Trump's relentless mockery, they are digging and coming up with the goods â€“ aided by a stream of leaks that shows no sign of abating. \nVoters and Congress are starting to hold up their end, too. \nThat his poll numbers are falling off a cliff will eat at Trump, and after initially signalling a Faustian deal, by which Republicans in Congress were prepared to let Trump dance and prance as he pleased just as long as he signed off on their legislation, they are now showing a bit of spine â€“ referring the whole Russia nonsense to congressional investigations. Senator John McCain has marked himself down as the leader of the opposition, using his speech to the Munich Security Conference in Germany in the weekend to shred the Trump worldview. \nLooking at the divide in America, the Times ' Brooks concludes that Republicans are still not close to abandoning Trump â€“ even if \"when will they impeach\" is the question asked in diners and barrooms up and down the country. \nPredicting a limping administration that likely will hang on despite its moral and political collapse, he sketches the coming years: \"It means an administration that is passive, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. \n\"To get anything done, a President depends on the vast machinery of the US government. But Trump doesn't mesh with that machinery. He is personality-based while it is rule-based. Furthermore, he's declared war on it. \n\"And when you declare war on the establishment, it declares war on you.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:35:46.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
