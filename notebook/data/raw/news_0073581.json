The few modern perks we were expecting, such as shopping centres and swimming pools, were closed for the duration of our visit. \nBut as conservative as Padang was by day, it was a different story by night.

As university students, it didn’t take us long to sniff out bottles of vodka and bourbon from stalls in the backstreets. \nAt around $3.50 a bottle, the questionable liquid was poured into a black plastic bag with a bottle of Coca Cola, tied around the top with a rubber band and a straw popped in. \nYes, the alcohol tasted a little funny, was barely legal, and there was a very good chance it was moonshine, but that didn’t deter us whatsoever. \nIt wasn’t long before a fellow Australian student, who had been living in the city for almost a year by that stage, asked if we’d like to experience the local night-life. \nAnd so we discovered the dark side of Padang. \nEntering the nightclubs, we felt like prudes with culturally-appropriate clothing covering our shoulders and knees. The girls inside donned full-body fishnets that did little to cover the glorified underwear they wore while dancing to Bon Jovi and Robbie Williams. The city was conservative by day, but it was a completely different story by night. Picture: Simone Short Source: Supplied \nOne nightclub in particular was like a rabbit warren. On the way to the bathroom, it wasn’t uncommon to stumble across a hallway of rooms used for “private entertainment”. \nIn the early hours of one particular morning, we rolled out of the club around 2am and headed outside to catch a taxi home. One after another pulled up, but to our confusion, every single one was already occupied by a woman in the front seat. \n“They’re prostitutes,” our expat friend explained. \n“Prostitution is illegal in Padang, so after midnight, they drive around in taxis and pick up men to take to hotels … or they just do it in the back seat while the driver waits.” \nWe didn’t have a choice. Every taxi was taken, and it was a long walk home, so we eventually jumped in with the driver and his passenger; the expat sharing the front seat with her, with myself and two other students in the back. \nIt was one of the wildest rides I have ever experienced. \nSwerving back and forth across the road, the driver was even kind enough to share with us his own black plastic bag of bootleg alcohol, which we happily took turns sipping despite having no idea what it contained. Sorry, Mum. \nIn fact, sharing a taxi with an illegal sex worker didn’t even seem like a big deal. Until we ran into the army, of course.

Picture: Simone Short Source: Supplied \nPractising drills on campus that night, the group of men starting shouting at us and, I’ll admit, I was terrified. I was in a foreign country whose customs I wasn’t completely familiar with and it was clear they were angry. \nMyself and my two friends ran from the taxi through the gates, hiding behind a nearby building. From there we watched the expat exchange fiery, foreign words with the group. \nWere they going to hit him? Punish him? Take him to the police? \nThe answer — none of the above. \nAfter a few minutes, he sauntered through the gates, only to be bombarded with questions from us. Were we in trouble? \n“They wanted to know why we brought a prostitute onto the campus,” he casually told us. \n“I explained and they understood, and then I told them off for running off into the mountains when the earthquake hit. They should have stayed and helped people.” \nThe angry exchange we’d witnessed wasn’t the soldiers yelling at him — in fact, it was the complete opposite. \nDespite being legally considered a “crime against morality”, the sex industry is rife across Indonesia, and we unknowingly came across it more than we knew. \nA restaurant we frequented during our trip, owned by an Australian man, was shut down not long after we left for providing strippers. \nSimone Short is a lifestyle blogger at What Short Thought .
