Audio: Rodger Kerr-Newell explains the proposal of piping water from Lake Argyle south to Flora Valley (ABC News) \nShire chief executive Rodger Kerr-Newell said funds were being sought for a pre-feasibility study into the economics of moving water from the southern end of Argyle to the fertile black soils of Flora Valley. \n\"One thing we know about Flora Valley is there are some very good, high quality soils which were mapped a number of years ago,\" he told ABC Rural. \n\"They have the potential to be very productive, as good as the Ord [Irrigation Scheme]. \n\"The challenge of course in the north of Australia is getting high quality soil and water in the same place at the same time, and so the feasibility study we're looking at and supporting Flora in, is to look at ways of how you could deliver irrigation water into those very high-value soils.\" \nMr Kerr-Newell said the lake was under-utilised and the opportunities for agriculture around Halls Creek could not be ignored. \n\"Lake Argyle is a very large lake and driving past the other day there seems to be a lot of spare water there. \n\"It would be very smart if we could take advantage of the existing infrastructure and figure out ways of getting that water into Flora Valley. \n\"It would create wealth, create exports and most importantly it would create jobs.\" \nIn a shire presentation viewed by ABC Rural, it noted that plans to increase the storage capacity of Lake Argyle by raising the height of the spillway will benefit the Flora Valley project. \nIt also commented on the energy required to deliver water to Flora and how a surplus of hydro-electricity could arise with the pending closure of Rio Tinto's Argyle Diamond mine, which currently draws from Lake Argyle's hydro-power station. \nThe shire's preliminary figures on how much the entire project could cost, estimated $350 million for the pipeline/water delivery from Lake Argyle and up to $270 million for land development and irrigation infrastructure. \nThe Heytesbury Cattle Company, which owns Flora Valley Station, said it had not been properly briefed on the proposal and therefore had no comment.

(ABC Rural: Carl Curtain) Environment group concerned about Halls Creek Shire's irrigation push \nEnvirons Kimberley director Martin Pritchard said his organisation was surprised to see the Flora Valley project listed within Regional Development Australia's (RDA) publication 'The Mid and North Western Australia Investment Portfolio'. \nHe said it was a huge proposal that raised some significant concerns around the environmental impact and financial viability. \n\"This from the get-go looks like a project that's unlikely to get up and would have some very significant environmental hurdles,\" Mr Pritchard said. \n\"One of which being that a pipeline [to Flora Valley] would have to go through the middle of the Purnululu National Park which is a world-heritage listed area. \n\"We're thinking this isn't a particularly good idea, so why waste time and public money on a feasibility study.\" \nSeveral sources have told ABC Rural that the RDA investment portfolio document was filled with \"big-picture\" ideas, which may never happen, but have come about through shires thinking of potential major projects which could stimulate economic development.

(Matt Brann: ABC ) Opportunity to dam Margaret River also listed \nMr Pritchard said the RDA document had also listed the potential to dam the Margaret River in the Fitzroy Valley for irrigated agriculture. \nIt states a \"multi-purpose dam\" would be used to irrigate around 10,000 hectares, as well as be available to potential aquaculture developments, power generation and recreational activities. \nPlans to dam the Margaret River have been around for decades. \nEnvirons Kimberley was established in 1996 by community members who opposed plans to dam the Fitzroy River to develop a cotton industry. \n\"We were very surprised and extremely concerned to see this proposal to dam the Margaret River,\" Mr Pritchard said. \n\"We know 20 years ago there was a big push on [to build dams in the Fitzroy River] that wasn't supported by the government of the day, and we'd be very concerned about any proposal to dam the Margaret or any part of the Fitzroy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:00:14.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
