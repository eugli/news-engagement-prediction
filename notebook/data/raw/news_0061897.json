The former Wichita State University basketball player was hired last summer as a business development specialist with Stoutheart Financial Group. Evan Wessel Kellen Jenkins/ WBJ Now, he’s about to be promoted to a role as an associate financial advisor with the company. The change is effective March 1. Wessel says he’s appreciative of the opportunity. “I’m looking forward to giving back to the community that raised and supported me in my athletics for so long,” he says. “It’s a special opportunity to be able to do something like that, especially in my hometown.” Wessel says he’s applying the competitive mentality fostered through playing sports to the business sector. “My goal now is to apply that driven mindset I’ve carried with me over the years towards helping our clients and the community we serve,” he says. Stoutheart Financial, located at 8621 E. 21st St. North, is the 12th-largest securities brokerage firm in the Wichita area based on local Series-7 registered representatives, according to Wichita Business Journal data. At Wichita State, Wessel’s accolades were many. The Wichita Heights graduate was part of WSU’s 2013 Final Four team, though he sat out much of the latter part of that season due to injury. He battled back and became a regular starter for the Shockers, including all 35 games as a senior. He was part of four regular season Missouri Valley Conference championships and one MVC Tournament championship. WSU participated in five NCAA Tournaments during Wessel’s tenure.
