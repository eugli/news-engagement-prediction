Here's the 1991 animated classic: \nThe film, directed by Bill Condon ( The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ), takes clear advantage of the original fairytale's French Rococo setting in order to deliver sumptuous, romantic production design worthy of one of Disney's most beloved princesses. \nThe film also stars Luke Evans as Gaston, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Josh Gad as LeFou, Stanley Tucci as Cadenza, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Babette, Kevin Kline as Maurice and Audra McDonald as Wardrobe. \nHere's Emma Watson's version, which remains very faithful to the original (sans the book), right down to the white and blue dress that Belle wears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:05:52.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
