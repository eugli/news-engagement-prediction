Photograph: Nigel Roddis/PA View more sharing options Press Association Monday 6 February 2017 11.49 GMT \nA man has admitted pulling a niqab off a woman in a shopping centre and yelling racist abuse at her. \nPeter Scotter, 55, of Roker, Sunderland, appeared at Newcastle crown court to admit racially aggravated assault by beating and a separate charge of racially aggravated harassment. \nBoth offences were based on Scotter’s hostility towards a particular religious group, namely Islam, the court heard. \nTony Hawks, defending, said Scotter had been diagnosed with a serious cancerous tumour under his tongue last week and was due to have an operation next Monday. “I have seen some documentation showing that the diagnosis is pretty bad,” the barrister said. \nThe judge, Stephen Earl, said he would sentence Scotter later, once he had heard more details about the diagnosis. The judge said: “This is a custodial band sentence, given his record and the nature of his actions.” \nA previous hearing at Sunderland magistrates court heard how Scotter left his victim terrified when he attacked her in July. \nLaura Lax, prosecuting, told the hearing the woman was waiting with her nine-year-old son for her husband outside a store in Bridges shopping centre in Sunderland when a man “purposefully” walked towards her and grabbed her niqab. \nThe force he used almost threw her to the ground and the niqab came away from her face, exposing her and causing pain to her neck. \nShe remembered being scared but was so shocked she could not remember what was said, magistrates were told. The niqab was damaged, but she has since repaired it. \nLax told the court the victim said afterwards: “This incident has left me scared to go out and I don’t want to go into town again. \n“I am disgusted my nine-year-old son had to witness this.” \nAnother witness heard Scotter shout: “Here, take that fucking off, you are in our country now, you stupid fucking Muslim.” \nWhen a police officer arrived, Scotter was being spoken to by a security guard and the defendant tried to walk away. \nScotter was heard to say: “Our Britain, you live by our fucking rules,” before coming out with more racist abuse. \nHe continued to make derogatory comments when he was interviewed after his arrest, Lax said. \nWhen he attended previous hearings about the niqab offence, Scotter made a middle finger gesture to photographers outside court. \nHe has 66 previous convictions for 157 offences, including actual bodily harm, breaching a football banning order and racially aggravated criminal damage. \nScotter had been due to stand trial for the niqab offences next month. \nThe judge told Scotter he will be sentenced in three weeks and granted him conditional bail.
