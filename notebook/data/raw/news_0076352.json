and landed in a tangled heap, twisting his ankle.\n\"I didn't see it,\" Mascioli said with a smile. \"Hopefully somebody will show me the video.\"\nMascioli's victory was a highlight of the championship action before a near-capacity crowd in Egg Harbor's cavernous gymnasium.\nThe top four finishers in each weight class advance to the state championships next weekend at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City.\nTimber Creek senior Dominic Augello, the fourth seed, captured the 126-pound title with a 6-2 victory over St. Augustine sophomore Connor Kraus.\nClayton junior Nasir Moore, also a fourth seed, stunned top-seeded Kody Wood of Pennsville by a 5-4 score to grab the crown at 285 pounds.\nKingsway junior Quinn Kinner won his third region title with an 18-7 victory over Matthew Barnett of Southern at 132 pounds.\nGateway junior twins Dante and Antonio Mininno won titles at 106 and 113 pounds, respectively.\nDante Mininno improved his record to 38-0 and won his first region title with a 13-7 victory over scrappy Kingsway freshman McKenzie Bell.\nAntonio Mininno went to 37-1 and captured his second region title with a tense 1-0 win over Woodstown freshman Jack Prendergast.\nDelsea junior Billy Janzer won his second region title with a 53-second pin of Lower Cape May's Mike Yorio at 170 pounds.\nDelsea junior Edison Echevarria also won his second straight title, taking down Williamstown's Shamun Smith with 18 seconds left in overtime for a 6-4 victory.\n\"Confidence, that's the thing,\" Janzer said. \"Coach [Greg Sawyer] tells us to trust our abilities, just go out and wrestle no matter who you are wrestling against.\"\nMascioli's victory was the culmination of a remarkable rise this season by a wrestler who didn't even compete in the sport as a freshman and sophomore.\n\"Right now I'm just thinking about all the hard work I put in this season and how it paid off,\" Mascioli said. \"For me to beat another undefeated kid, that's a big accomplishment.\nMascioli entered the bout with a 35-0 record. Starks was 32-0.\nMascioli was trailing 1-0 after Starks escaped to open the second period. But Mascioli worked inside for a takedown, the only one of the bout.\n\"That's what we said, 'One takedown will do it,'\" Manchio said.\nMascioli said he wrestled \"all my life\" before entering St. Joseph. He didn't wrestle as a freshman and sophomore, focusing instead on weight-lifting in the winter to prepare for football season.\nWhen Manchio, who won three state titles from 1999-2001 at Sterling, was hired as St. Joseph's coach, Mascioli decided to return to the sport.\n\"He's a crazy guy,\" Mascioli said of Manchio. \"But he obviously knows what he's talking about.\"\nAlthough low numbers have limited St. Joseph's team success, Manchio found an apt pupil in Mascioli.\n\"He's listened to everything I've said to him,\" Manchio said.\"Everything I've ask, he's done.\n\"He's the best kid I've ever had and I've been coaching for 10 years. The best person. He's such a great kid and I'm so proud of him.\"\nWhen Mascioli held off Starks' last shot, the St. Joseph senior was ready to celebrate.\nBut Manchio was way ahead of him. One of the most flamboyant wrestlers in South Jersey history, Manchio is an emotional coach who jumps out of his seat, spins around, punches the air in satisfaction when things go his athletes' way.\nSo when Mascioli became Manchio's first wrestler to win a region title, the coach leapt in the air with all his might.\nIn the old days, he always landed on his feet, like a cat.\nThis time was different.\nManchio went limping off the mat, one arm around the shoulders of his champion wrestler.\n\"I was so excited I jumped as high as I could,\" Manchio said. \"And I landed like a ton of bricks.\"\nRegion 8 championship bouts\n152: Dillon Taylor, St. Augustine, d.
