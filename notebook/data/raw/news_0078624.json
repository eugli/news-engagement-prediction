The wheeled bot can travel up to 9 mph, and as you can see in the video, it has no trouble rolling over some light off-road terrain such as patches of grass and flights of stairs. The bot stands 6.5 feet tall when fully extended, though it often crouches to turn or balance. Batteries power the robot's electric and hydraulic actuators, allowing it to crouch down, make sharp turns, and lift objects that weigh at least 100 pounds. Handle has enough battery juice to travel about 15 miles on one charge. Most Popular Oh and one more thing, this rolling bot can leap four feet into the air. It has no trouble jumping over tables and obstacles, and it surly would have little difficulty running down a puny human. The description on Boston Dynamics' video also indicates that the wheels can be swapped out for normal leg stilts, allowing Handle to be easily modified to travel over uneven terrain.
