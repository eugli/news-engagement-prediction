Article continues below \nFor the last 14 years - since his first Major at Wimbledon in 2003 - we've seen some incredible shots from the tennis legend. \nThe way he glides around the court is like something we’ve never seen before, while his backhand is arguably the greatest in the sport’s history. Article continues below \nBut it’s his ‘impossible shots’ that have seen him become one of the greatest. \nThose shots that make the commentator say “How did Federer do that!?” \nThose shots from ridiculous angles that make you think Federer has just defied laws of physics to pull off. \nWell, luckily for us, a video has emerged on YouTube showing Federer’s top 10 most ridiculous angled shots - and it’s brilliant. \nThe compilation features some astounding shots from Federer in recent years and it’s likely to take your breath away. \nHave a look: \nEvery tennis fan wants to see Federer at the top of his game for many years to come but, the truth is, he will be retiring in the next few years. \nQuite when that is, though, is anybody’s guess. One thing is for sure, we’re glad Federer didn’t listen to the temptations of retiring after his success in Australia in January. Retirement plans \nHe’s since admitted that he did contemplate retiring after his Australian Open victory, if only for a brief moment. \n\"I guess in a faraway place it did cross my mind: How could I ever top this?\" he said. \n\"But then again, the joy was so big, and I kept on watching the reaction of my team when I won the match point in Australia and how they were jumping for joy. Unbelievable. \n\"The goal, when I took my break of six months, was doing this for the next couple years, not just for one tournament. I understand people who say, ‘Oh, this would be a perfect moment to go.’ But I feel like I’ve put in so much work, and I love it so much, and I still have so much in the tank.\" \nLet’s hope Federer produces a few more ‘impossible shots’in years to come as we hope to appreciate the end of his incredible career. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
