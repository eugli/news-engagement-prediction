Located within the district of St. Pauli , it is home to one of Europe's biggest red light districts and is a theme park of neon and the harbor city 's seedy (but largely safe ) underbelly. What to Expect at the Reeperbahn \nThe Reeperbahn is the most famous street in Hamburg; you'll find many great bars , restaurants, theatres like the Operettenhaus , and clubs here, along with sex shops, sex museums, erotic theaters, and strip clubs. The place is also overrun with fervent St. Pauli soccer ( Fussball ) fans during home games at Millerntorstadion. \nThis eclectic mix makes the Reeperbahn a fascinating place to visit for travelers and locals alike. The district is the second most popular Hamburg attraction after the harbor and attracts all kinds of visitors, from night owls and students to theatergoers and tourists. Highlights of the Reeperbahn \nThe lively Reeperbahn is the main thoroughfare of Hamburg's entertainment district, but there are some interesting side streets worth visiting: \ncontinue reading below our video Best Road Trip Apps Große Freiheit: \nIn the early 1960s, the Beatles wooed their German audiences in Hamburg and started their career in various music clubs along the street “Große Freiheit” (literally “Great Freedom”). \nSome of these clubs still exist, and if you are a fan of the Fab Four, get up and get down in the Indra Club and the Kaiserkeller . You can also visit the newly built Beatles Square at the street corner of Reeperbahn/Große Freiheit. Spielbudenplatz: \nThe Spielbudenplatz is the historic core of Hamburg's entertainment district, which started out in the 17th century with acrobats, jugglers, magicians, and wooden booths selling refreshments to sailors. Today, this street is home to many great theaters , and you can visit one of the oldest wax figure museums of Germany at Panoptikum . Davidstraße: \nStreet prostitution is legal at certain times of the day on Davidstraße so you might see the \"ladies of the night\" waiting for their customers here. Perhaps not surprisingly, at the corner of Reeperbahn and Davidstraße you can find the most famous police station in Germany. The Davidwache provides highly visible police protection 24 hours, and makes the area one of the safest ones in Hamburg. Herbertstraße: \nThe most notorious and exclusive street of Hamburg's red light district is Herbertstraße. Just like Amsterdam , prostitutes sit in dimly lit windows and display their \"charms\" for customers. If you are worried about your tender eyes (or those of your family), know that Herbertstraße is closed off by a wall and minors and females are somewhat Verboten (forbidden). While they may officially enter this street, it is strongly discouraged by the police. Prostitutes here can be hostile to visitors who just \"want to look\". Trade is actually down from what it once was. Most business happens in the many strip clubs with fewer than 400 working women still on Herbertstraße (down 50% from a decade ago). Interesting Facts About the Reeperbahn The name \"Reeperbahn\" comes from the old German word \"Reep\" meaning \"heavy rope\"; in the 18th century, heavy hempen ropes were produced here for sailing ships in the Hamburg harbor . John Lennon supposedly said: \"I was born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg.\" Tips for your Reeperbahn Visit The Reeperbahn doesn't come to life before the evening hours. A good time to visit is around 8 or 9 p.m. It gets very crowded on the weekends. The area is fairly safe thanks to the high police presence, but you should still be cautious and beware of pickpockets. Most strip clubs charge a cover of €30. If you are lured into a strip club with a free entry, expect to shell out at least €20 for your first drink. For a prostitute's services, prices are negotiable but expect to pay around €50 for 15 minutes.
