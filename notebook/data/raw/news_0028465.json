(Lulama Zenzile, Netwerk24) EFF MPs should be criminally probed for SONA - ANC in Parliament \nCape Town – Parliament has referred the physical removal of Congress of the People MP Willie Madisha and the violent ejection of EFF members to the joint rules committee. \nMadisha was the first to be removed by Parliament’s \"bouncers\" during President Jacob Zuma’s State of the Nation Address on Thursday. \nHis removal was quickly followed by a brawl between EFF members and parliament protection services members when the party refused to let Zuma address the MPs. \nAccording to Parliamentary rules, the removed MPs are suspended for five working days. \nDuring this time, they may not enter the precincts of Parliament until the suspension is completed. \nSpeaker Baleka Mbete and National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise announced the referral in Parliament’s Announcements, Tablings and Committee [ATC] reports, published on Monday. \n“The circumstances of the physical removal of Mr W M Madisha (Cope) and members of the Economic Freedom Fighters from the Joint Sitting during the state-of-the-nation address on Thursday, 09 February 2017, together with the unrevised Hansard, minutes and a video recording of the proceedings in question have been referred to the Joint Rules Committee in terms of Joint Rule 14GA (13) for consideration,” the principals said in the announcement. \nOn Friday, Parliament said eight protection services officials were injured during the scuffle with EFF MPs. \nFollowing the violence, secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana established an inter-divisional committee to investigate various allegations around the incident. \nHe is due to submit a report on the matter to Parliament this week.
