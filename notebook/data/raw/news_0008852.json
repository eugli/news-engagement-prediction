On Saturday , Trump told reporters that his executive order was “working out very nicely”, adding “we’re going to have a very, very strict ban”. Facing growing criticism on Monday , Trump defended his decision not to give travelers any advance warning of the new restrictions ― which he again characterized as a “ban.” If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nThe same day, Spicer told a group of George Washington University students that “ the ban deals with seven countries ”. \nHowever, today he appeared to have changed his tune, insisting the President was merely “using the words the media is using”. This was one exchange: \nReporter: “But those were his words.” \nSpicer: “It can’t be a ban if you’re letting 1 million people, and if 325,000 people from another [Muslim] country can come in, then that is, by nature, not a ban.” \nReporter: “But the president himself called it a ban.” \nSpicer: “I understand that.” \nReporter: “So is he confused, or you confused?” \nSpicer: “I’m not confused. The words being used to describe it derive from what the media is calling this. [The president] has been clear it is ‘extreme vetting.’” \nThe executive order bars travelers from Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Syria from entering the United States, suspends refugee resettlement for 120 days, and suspends the resettlement of refugees from Syria indefinitely.
