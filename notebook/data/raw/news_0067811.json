PHOTO: Andrew H. Walker/Getty \nNancy Reagan was criticized for her splashy, expensive designer clothing, Jackie Kennedy was revered for her style—seemingly ahead of her other accomplishments—and Hillary Clinton was endlessly mocked for her rainbow array of pantsuits , never mind the fact she's been a Senator and Secretary of State. \nIt's always been society's job to obsess over the way women look—that much we know—but while it's one thing to comment on what entertainers wear on the red carpet, fixating on the physical appearance of females in politics is a trickier issue, even if the explanation is as simple as women's clothes matter more. \nWhich is why there's one thing women can take solace in as far as Donald Trump is concerned: how often the President, in just a few short weeks, has been aggressively derided for his clothes , his skin , his hair , and his body. \nTo say critiques of the 70-year-old POTUS' style have been brutal isn't overstating the case, potentially indicating that we're close to reaching a specific gender-equality tipping point: No president in history has gotten as much slack for his top-to-bottom appearance as President Trump, and that’s not a bad thing. If women of power are to be judged on their looks, why do men get a free pass? According to fashion experts, they shouldn't. \n“Men have escaped the criticism, and it’s high time they came under the microscope as well,” said style guru and longtime Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn. \"Elected officials need to get with the semiotics of fashion, because the clothes we wear send a message about how we're perceived, and they have constituents they're serving.\" Facebook PHOTO: Donna Ward \nThat the fashion-based negativity is happening to Mr. Trump is particularly telling: First Lady Melania Trump is a former model, and First Daughter Ivanka has her own fashion line. Logic would dictate an intense, laser-like focus around what these two tall, fit, attractive women are wearing, but instead, the interest is around the President's outdated personal style (that hair, those ill-fitting suits, the ties that are too long and held down by actual tape .) \nWashington, DC-based stylist and author of Style Bible: What to Wear to Work Lauren A. Rothman says Trump's approach to style hasn't gone unnoticed for a reason. “As we know from celebrity coverage, faux-pas are what catch the eye of the public,\" she said. \"In the past you had politicians in the exact same uniform of a dark oversized suit, making the exact same style mistakes. [In the last election] Mitt Romney was the one who stood out because he’s the only one looking slick and well-dressed and that’s what people notice.\" Facebook PHOTO: Andrew H. Walker/Getty \nAccording to Rothman, the President's apparent choice to not look like a politician straight out of central casting is right in line with the platform on which he ran—and won. \"It's hard to miss that colored tie that hangs four-inches too long or that he's taping [it] when he could very well use a tie clip. He's sending the message that he's going to walk to his own beat and do what he wants to do.\" \nTo be sure, a focus on men’s fashion in general is a trend that's been growing in recent years—remember President Obama’s “mom jeans” moment? A a particularly \"uncool\" wardrobe choice that was lost on no one. \n“If you look at something like Women’s Wear Daily , they now regularly rate men,” Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, says. “I think people are looking at men’s clothes now more than they have for a long time.” Facebook PHOTO: MANDEL NGAN \nStill, the judgment President Trump is facing for his clothing choices certainly hasn't been the gentle ribbing Obama got for his off-duty denim. Men's magazine GQ took down the president’s style and provided him an acerbic virtual makeover in a piece entitled: “If Trump Can’t Act Like a President, He Could at Least Dress Like One.” \nAccording to GQ : “From his comically large red tie to his JNCO-capacity baggy pants to his unbearably bad haircut, the president's wardrobe could use a few easy fixes from GQ's style editors.” \nOther recent headlines include: “This Is Still Embarrassing, Donald Trump” from Esquire referring to him taping together his ties, “What Is Up With Trump’s Ill-Fitting Suits” from Jezebel and “Why Donald Trump’s Suits Look Cheap” from Business Insider . \nDogged Trump supporters will predictably counter the media's take on the president's style with comments like \"this is politics not Fashion Week!\" or \"we voted for his brain, not his fancy suits\" but conservative site The Daily Wire had no problem posting a story which stated \"Hillary Breaks Out The Ugliest Outfit In Human History,\" while Republican senator Lindsey Graham mocked former House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s physical appearance during a 2015 fundraiser, quipping that she'd had \"all the surgeries.\" Facebook PHOTO: MANDEL NGAN \nAnd Trump isn’t the only man in the White House facing trial by fashion. Steve Bannon has endured his fair share of the heat, with Vox writer Matthew Yglesias taking to Twitter to call out the Chief Strategist's “I don’t care” fashion sense, writing: “Would it kill Bannon to dress like an adult in the Oval Office” thanks to his uniform of baggy wrinkled khakis and ratty sport jacket. \nSo, to you, President Trump (and every other man in the White House): we aren’t going to let you off the hook for wearing clothes that, for some reason, don’t fit you. If Hillary Clinton were president right now, she'd be maligned left and right for her outfit choices, so—in a backwards kind of way—this is one step toward equality we can cling to during the current administration.
