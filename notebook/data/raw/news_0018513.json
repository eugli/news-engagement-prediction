Coral fossils \nDr Robin Beaman, from Australia's James Cook University, said the researchers located a cluster of hills, or knolls, more than 1,100m beneath the surface. \n\"What we discovered was the smoking gun,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It was quite clear that those knolls were the remains of a very large undersea landslide that had occurred some time ago.\" \nThat time was at least 300,000 years ago, he said, because coral fossils collected from the knolls went back that far, and the landslide would have predated them. \nHe described it as \"catastrophic collapse\" because the knolls - as long as 3.6km (2.2 miles) - were found 30km from their original location. \nOther evidence of the landslide would have been buried over time, he said.

Deep marine life \nThe researchers found deep marine life including cold-water corals, molluscs and barnacles were thriving on the knolls. \nThe corals, unlike their shallow reef counterparts, could survive in 4C temperatures with no sunlight, Dr Beaman said. \nHe said possibilities for future research were exciting. \n\"That really is the next frontier,\" he said. \n\"We probably have a bit of and idea of what's living up to 200m or 300m [deep], but beyond that, very few people have done much work in this area.\" \nThe research was a collaboration between James Cook University, University of Sydney, University of Granada, University of Edinburgh and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.
