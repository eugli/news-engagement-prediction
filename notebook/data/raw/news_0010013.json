The chaos is far from being settled as many are stranded at US airports after President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry to travellers from 7 Muslim countries. A story has been reported about a green card holder who died after being prevented from returning home. Her son, Mike Hager, a former American serviceman, who was born in Iraq and served in Iraq was allowed to take a flight from Iraq to Michigan while his mother has to stay back. Hager and his family members, who were permanent US residents, had travelled to Iraq before the order was implemented. After his mother fell ill, they were on their way back to the US when his mother was turned away. She had lived in the US since 1995 and was a green card holder but only Hager was allowed to board the flight to the US. A day later his mother passed way. \"I was just shocked. I had to put my mom back on the wheelchair and take her back and call the ambulance and she was very, very upset. She knew right there if we send her back to the hospital she's going to pass away-she's not going to make it,\" Hager told Fox 2 Detroit. The family reportedly fled Iraq during the Gulf War and after spending four years in a refugee camp was resettled in the United States. Hager believes his mother would have survived if she had been able to return to her home in the US and seek treatment. \"They destroyed us. I went with my family, I came back by myself. They destroyed our family,\" he told Fox 2 Detroit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:55:57.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
