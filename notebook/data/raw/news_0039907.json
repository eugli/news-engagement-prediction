Collins defines the term as \"the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking offence than previous generations\". \nNow the tradition is under fresh threat from new EU laws which place greater emphasis on “active consent” of subjects, rather than presumed consent. \nUnder the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), due to come into effect in May 2018, students may be required to give explicit permission for their grades to be published. Cambridge University is understood to have sought legal advice on how to proceed. \nMinutes from the General Board Education Committee, seen by the Daily Telegraph, reveal that the university’s concern that the new laws would require a “considerable shift from the current procedures”. ambridge University is understood to have sought legal advice on how to proceed Credit: Peter Barritt / Alamy \nP rofessor Graham Virgo, the university’s Pro Vice Chancellor for Education, told the Committee that it has “recently become apparent that new Data Protection legislation, which would come into force in May 2018, would place greater emphasis on active consent being sought from data subjects for data collection and use, and it had been suggested that moving to an opt-in system for publication of class lists might consequently be necessary. \n“A move to an opt-in system would be a considerable shift from the current procedures that allowed students to opt-out only in certain prescribed circumstances.\" \nThe Information Commissioner’s Office said that the UK’s decision to leave the EU “will not affect the commencement of the GDPR”. \nA Cambridge University spokesman said: “Under new Data Protection legislation, which is due to come into force in May 2018, greater emphasis is placed on an individual’s right to choose how their data is collected and used, and on an organisation’s responsibility to reflect this in its policies and procedures. \n“The University is currently considering the potential effects of this legislation – including the possibility that the public display of class lists may change to an opt-in system – but no decisions have yet been made.” Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:16:50.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
