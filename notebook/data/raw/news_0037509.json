But no city has made bigger moves into Houston than Austin. In the next few months alone, four Austin-based eateries will open Houston-area locations. Just yesterday, Tacodeli announced via release that it will open near Downtown in early March, joining the arrivals of Ramen Tatsu-Ya early next week and gelateria Dolce Neve , which is also expected to open its doors in March. Adding to the parade is the opening of Hopdoddy Burger Bar’s Rice Village location , set to arrive on March 6. Looking ahead, even more Austin eateries are in the works. Chef Paul Qui’s Aqui is set to arrive before Summer 2017 , marking the chef’s first expansion outside of Austin. And the hits just keep on coming, because beloved Austin late-night drunk food spot Kerbey Lane Café has also announced that it is in the very early stages of opening its first restaurant in Houston . Oh, and don’t forget about Chi’Lantro, a Korean fast-casual chain that’s headed here later this year. If you’re having trouble keeping up, that’s because there’s a hell of a lot of Austin exports that are headed to town. One thing is for certain, though: Houston’s culinary reputation just keeps improving, in Texas and beyond.
