President Trump speaks in Washington on Tuesday. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Brian Bennett and Del Quentin Wilber , Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly instructed immigration officers to widen the net and set the stage for hiring thousands more enforcement agents as he moved to implement the executive order on illegal immigration that President Trump signed during his first week in office.\n“The president wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday. \nWith the new guidelines, Trump took a significant step closer to realizing his and top aides' vision for reducing the immigrant population in the U.S. \nThough Kelly emphasized that immigration officers should focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes, his directives nonetheless unleashed deportation officers to conduct more raids in immigrant communities, detain people who don’t have criminal convictions and remove people for minor infractions such as driving without a license. \nDemocratic lawmakers and advocates alarmed by the instructions called them a radical shift in policy and enforcement tactics. \n“No matter how much they deny it, it is clear that the White House is setting in motion their mass deportation plan, directing immigration agents to round up and quickly deport anyone who is undocumented,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \nKelly’s instructions also expand so-called expedited removals, in which someone in the U.S. illegally is thrown out without appearing before an immigration judge. Such deportations, which had been limited to people caught within 100 miles of the border within two weeks of entering the country, will apply to people caught anywhere in the country within two years of arriving illegally. \nImmigration officers now can also charge parents who pay smugglers to bring their children into the country illegally with aiding immigration violations. \nTrump's immigration orders, explained » \nTrump administration officials said they were fulfilling the pledge of the president who promised more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws and were also responding to a surge of illegal border crossings. \n\"A surge of illegal immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,\" Kelly wrote in one of the memos, adding that immigration courts are experiencing \"a historic backlog of removal cases.\" \nIn October and November, the Obama administration apprehended more than 90,000 immigrants along the southern border, an increase of about 42% over the same period in 2015, according to Kelly. \nThe Obama administration, which deported a record number of migrants, took a far less disruptive stance on immigration by focusing on those who were either convicted of a crime, had recently crossed the border or had repeatedly entered the country illegally. \nImmigration officials can act on the new priorities immediately. \nAmong their first targets could be the more than 940,000 people who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and have either refused to leave or were allowed to stay temporarily, often because of the hardship their deportation would cause to family in the U.S. \nOther efforts will take time. Kelly’s guidelines call for hiring 10,000 more immigration enforcement officers and 5,000 Border Patrol agents and for the immediate planning and building of a wall along the southern border, all of which Trump ordered earlier. The Border Patrol has already identified places for building new walls and fencing near El Paso, Tucson and El Centro, Calif., and is studying additional locations. Brian Bennett \nWhen President Trump ordered a vast overhaul of immigration law enforcement during his first week in office, he stripped away most restrictions on who should be deported, opening the door for roundups and detentions on a scale not seen in nearly a decade. \nUp to 8 million people in the country illegally... \nWhen President Trump ordered a vast overhaul of immigration law enforcement during his first week in office, he stripped away most restrictions on who should be deported, opening the door for roundups and detentions on a scale not seen in nearly a decade. \nUp to 8 million people in the country illegally... (Brian Bennett) \nThose steps would require funds from Congress, and it is unclear whether Republican lawmakers will sign off on them. The White House is expected to ask Congress for the money as part of a larger funding request in the weeks ahead. \nKelly’s memos did not specify how the Trump administration plans to deal with 750,000 so-called Dreamers, migrants brought to the country illegally as children and granted work permits under an initiative by President Obama.
