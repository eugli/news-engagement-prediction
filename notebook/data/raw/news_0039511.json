Duplechan is guarded by Folsom’s Alec Andrews during the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I Championship at Sleep Train Arena, Saturday, March 7, 2015, in Sacramento. Randy Pench Sacramento i \nThe four-month regular season now gives way to the second season. \nOr, as coaches and athletes like to say, “the real season.” \nThe Sac-Joaquin Section on Thursday afternoon released its high school basketball playoff schedule with out-bracket games to be played Friday night and the rest of the field starting Tuesday night for the girls and Wednesday for the boys. \nThe section finals will be held March 4-5 at Pacific in Stockton, leading to the Northern California regional tournament and the CIF State finals at Golden 1 Center on March 24-25. \nA crew of seven retired section athletic directors and current section staff crunched the numbers – records, head-to-head matchups, etc. – to complete the brackets for six boys and six girls divisions, spanning small schools to the largest divisions. \nThe Bee’s top-ranked boys teams were seeded first and second in Division I, with unbeaten Delta League champion Sheldon earning the nod over unbeaten Sierra Foothill League titlist Woodcreek. Both schools have 25-2 records and are unbeaten in section play this season, standing as overwhelming favorites to meet in the final. \nSheldon seeks its fifth section title this decade. The Huskies are especially strong in the backcourt with twins Elishja and Isaiah Duplechan, and Drew Cobb, a senior who is perhaps the section’s top on-ball defender. Franklin coach Ken Manfredi, a longtime area coach, deemed this Sheldon team to be the best in program history. Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said the Huskies have the potential to “be great.” \nWoodcreek also has the potential to be special. Timberwolves coach Paul Hayes said he’s never had a team this talented or united, a group anchored by 6-foot-11 national recruit Jordan Brown. The junior is averaging 26.3 points and 15.8 rebounds. Guards Chris Cagle, Jackson Hughes and Tyrell Roberts also have played well. \nNo. 6 Folsom has won four section titles, three in D-I, since 2008 under coach Mike Wall. The Bulldogs, led by center Mason Forbes, open against No. 11 Jesuit, an 11-time section champion dating to the late 1980s. \nModesto Christian, seeded seventh, beat Folsom last year to win the D-I title and has a record 18 championship spanning all divisions. The Crusaders are 65-1 in section play over the past 17 seasons. \nThe D-I field also includes a perennial playoff power, No. 13 Sacramento, which is in the postseason for the 16th consecutive year after moving up from Division II and competing in the prestigious NorCal Open Division last season. The Dragons, led this season by guard Sayvon Hines, won the D-II title last season, beating Whitney, which earned the top seed in D-II this season ahead of No. 2 Burbank. The D-II field also includes No. 3 Rio Linda, No. 4 Grant and No. 5 Inderkum, which has a triple-overtime win over Burbank. \n“I think it’ll be wide open,” Whitney coach Nick French said. \nVanden and Capital Christian are seeded first and second, respectively, in D-III with plenty of darkhorses, including No. 5 Placer, No. 6 Rio Americano, No. 7 Center and No. 8 Christian Brothers. \nIn girls D-I, longtime national power St. Mary’s of Stockton is the top seed. \nThe Rams, besieged by injuries this season, seek their fifth consecutive D-I title and ninth in a row in various divisions. They have a 36-game section-playoff winning streak and are 71-2 against section teams since 1999. \nNo. 2 McClatchy won the CIF State D-I title two years ago, lost to Oak Ridge in the section playoffs last season and enters this tournament top-ranked by The Bee. The Lions beat previous No. 1-ranked Sacramento 65-52 on Wednesday night to create a tie for the Metropolitan Conference championship. The Lions have been sparked by Jordan Cruz’s return after she missed most of the season with a knee strain. She’s a shooter who played a big role in the Lions’ 2015 state title run. \nNo. 3 Oak Ridge, which split with No. 5 Folsom in SFL play, is the playoffs for the 25th consecutive season under coach Steve White. Folsom is paced by Cal-bound guard McKenzie Forbes, a junior. \nNo. 6 seed St. Francis, led by Janae Fairbrook, won the NorCal D-I title last season and is in the postseason for the 14th consecutive season under coach Vic Pitton, The Bee’s Coach of the Year in 2015-16. \nVanden is seeded first in D-II after rolling to the title last season. Modesto Christian is second and Sacramento third. \nThe Dragons have won five section titles, including in D-II in 2013 and 2014. Elk Grove, seeded fourth, beat Sacramento at the buzzer in the NorCal final last season. The Thundering Herd is led by 2015-16 Bee Player of the Year Mira Shulman, a senior guard. \nDefending D-III champion Rio Linda earned the top seed. The Knights are led by coach Jerry Huffhines and his daughter, Brandy, a playmaking guard. Vista del Lago is seeded second. \nWest Campus, the top seed in D-IV, seeks its first championship after reaching the section final in 2012, 2014 and 2016. \nArgonaut is seeded first in D-V and Capital Christian second. Roseville’s Valley Christian, seeking its third title in four seasons, is seeded first in D-VI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:07:14.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
