The masked men barged into a Domino's Pizza outlet in the Sector 29 market, held the employees hostage at gunpoint and cleaned up the cash box. The incident comes close on the heels of the series of robberies at liquor shops in different parts of the city. POlice said the robbers followed a similar modus operandi. Police said the robbery was captured on CCTV cameras installed at the outlet, and raids are on to catch the two criminals. According to employees of the outlet, the two bike-borne men entered the outlet from the back door near the kitchen around 2am on Tuesday. The outlet had closed down by then, and the night-shift manager, Ajay Kumar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, was sitting inside with other employees — Pawan, Rakesh, Kitab Singh and Dev Dutt. The two men — one wearing a helmet, the other a mask — whipped out pistols and held the employees at gunpoint. The employees tried to raise an alarm, but the duo threatened them with dire consequences. The criminals then snatched Rs 1.24 lakh from the cash counter, locked all five employees inside the outlet and sped away on their bike. Acting on the complaint lodged by shift manager Ajay, an FIR was registered under Section 392 (robbery) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act, at Sector 29 police station. \"We have received some vital clues and are trying to identify the criminals. Investigation is on and they will be arrested soon,\" said SHO inspector Vishal Kumar. In another incident, two bike-borne men robbed a gold chain of a woman in Sector 12 on Tuesday. Saroj Bhola was waiting outside her home for her granddaughter to return from school, when two youths on a bike approached her, flashed a pistol and snatched her gold chain. An FIR has been registered at Civil Lines police station.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:54:37.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
