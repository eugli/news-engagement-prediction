On top of all the forgetting about it and whacking he did during his career, Sheeran also claims to have been hired by the mafia to carry out labor leader Jimmy Hoffa's mysterious 1975 \"disappearance.\" \nAnother fun rumor? Al Pacino might end up co-starring. According to one report , \"Al Pacino and other talent are still in negotiations.\" And Joe Pesci seems to be in the same boat. \nDe Niro, Pacino, Pesci, and Scorsese all in one place is a big lineup for Netflix, which is hot off Ava DuVerney 's best documentary nom for 13th , and probably aiming for that best picture mountaintop after Amazon 's success with Manchester by the Sea .
