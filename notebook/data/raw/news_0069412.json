The original tweet has over 75,000 RTs (and counting). @jenevamonique1 @sowahblanket pic.twitter.com/cF416XgDNX \n‚Äî b s t f r n d ‚ò• ü•ë (@bstfrnd__) February 20, 2017 \nThe prize for the best meme of all, though, goes to Chrissy Teigen who absolutely savaged her husband with this meme: John when you tell him he looks like Arthur pic.twitter.com/0NW3NDtAb1 \n‚Äî christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 21, 2017 \nThere is no recovering from that. Chrissy Teigen has officially won at both memes and marriage in one fell swoop. \nAs for John, his main reaction seemed to be utter confusion, tweeting his wife to tell her that he has never even heard of ‚Äúthis Arthur character.‚Äù @chrissyteigen I hadn't even heard of this Arthur character til now. Was he around when I was a kid? \n‚Äî John Legend (@johnlegend) February 21, 2017 \nThe show, which premiered in 1996, would have been too late for the 38-year-old singer‚Äôs childhood cartoon sessions.
