It’s more important to get the car good for the race and making sure that we’re ready for Thursday.” \nThe goal for Harvick, Childers and the No. 4 crew is to make sure the car survives Thursday’s Can-Am Duel (7 p.m. ET, FS1) because they feel confident about their car for the 500. \nLuckily for Childers, their No. 4 car for The Clash at Daytona is similar to their 500 entry. That’s a very good thing, as usually teams take a car that might not be as good and run it in the season-opening exhibition race. \n“We were pretty fortunate this year both cars were pretty identical in the wind tunnel,” Childers said. “They have all the same parts and pieces on them. I feel like they are about as equal as we can make them.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:45:23.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
