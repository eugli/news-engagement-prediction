However, it was unclear how many of those in custody were South Africans and how many foreigners. Phahlane said anyone found to have been inciting violence would be prosecuted. Police disperse the protesters Somalian protesters in Pretoria S'Africa anti-immigrant protesters 1pm' Recall that President Jacob Zuma had called for calm ahead of today's anti-immigrant march. However, many unemployed South Africans accuse foreigners of taking their jobs. The main group behind the protests, Mamelodi Concerned Residents, has blamed foreign nationals for taking jobs and accused them of being involved in prostitution rings and drug cartels, accusations denied by immigrant communities. South Africa experienced its worst outbreak of violence against foreigners in 2008, when more than 60 people died. Two years ago, similar xenophobic unrest in the cities of Johannesburg and Durban claimed seven lives as African immigrants were hunted down and attacked by gangs. 12.50pm' The police are battling hard to keep South Africans and foreigners apart 12.45pm' Foreigners in South Africa's capital, Pretoria have stood their ground against a march by residents. A video shared on Twitter shows one man saying that they do not want to fight but are \"ready to protect our property\". 12.30pm' Reactions have been trickling in following the on-going development. 12pm' Police have started using rubber bullets and stun grenades on a crowd of what looks like about 200 immigrants who were running along Eskia Mphahlele Drive in Pretoria. The group is reported to have been running from town to join their fellow countrymen in an area with shops owned by Somali citizens. Police opened fire on the crowd when it refused to stop with some lifting their hands in surrender while some were holding stones and sticks. 11.55am' Atteridgeville residents in Pretoria have described how protestors have started to block roads with burning tyres ahead of the planned anti-immigrant march which was scheduled for today, February 24. 11.30am' A large group of protesters has left the township on foot and is arriving in the Pretoria CBD. This comes on the heels of violence in Attridegville this morning. Numerous roads have been closed as police confront the demonstrators, firing rubber bullets to disperse them. Hundreds of protesters are expected to march to the Home Affairs Department to hand over a memorandum which outlines grievances against foreigners. Police officers from across Gauteng have been deployed to monitor the anti-immigrant march. March organisers, the 'Mamelodi Concerned Residents', say it’s unfair that the violence is now being blamed on South Africans. 11.00am' Foreign nationals gathered ongoing in Pretoria for the #ForeignerMarch Following approval from the Tshwane Metro Police Department, the Mamelodi Concerned Residents has organized a protest against the illegal immigrants in Pretoria on Friday, February 24. Tshwane Metro Police Department said that after much consideration it had decided to give permission for the #Foreignermarch to go ahead in Pretoria, but with conditions. Xenophobia: Over 1000 protesters take to the streets in S'Africa (LIVE UPDATES) Around 1,000 people are presently gathered on the streets, and the organisers said they are not targeting foreigners but the South African government’s controls over immigration. The march takes place with a backdrop of attacks against foreigners across select sections of Johannesburg and Pretoria. In recent weeks, homes and businesses have been torched and looted in the name of stopping crime committed by foreigners. The actions have been fuelled by both the sentiment that foreigners are committing crime in South Africa and that they have been able to economically prosper where locals have not.
