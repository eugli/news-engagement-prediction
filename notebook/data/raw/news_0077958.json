It was exactly as predicted and as calculated,” said Mr Turnbull. \n“He knew exactly what he was doing and he did it.” \nHe then said, somewhat unconvincingly: “I’m not going to be distracted by that. It’s a fact of life. That’s what’s happened. Back in the spotlight. Picture: Mick Tsikas/AAP Source: AAP Staying focused. Picture: Kym Smith Source: News Corp Australia \n“I’m focused on the jobs of Australians that we are protecting by delivering the leadership.” \nThe Newspoll survey found Mr Turnbull’s satisfaction rating fell from 33 per cent at the start of the month to 29 per cent. The Government’s two-party preferred was stable at an election-losing 45 per cent to Labor’s 55 per cent. \nThe Prime Minister‘s charges of deliberate destabilisation removes all opportunity for the Liberals to depict the Turnbull/Abbott clash as merely a policy disagreement or an intellectual contest over party philosophy. \nIt is now an unadorned conflict between two sizeable egos and could get nastier. Liberal MPs could have little choice but to take sides, and to involve themselves in the brawl. \nMr Turnbull has done himself no favours by retaliating personally rather than allowing surrogates such as Finance Minister Mathias Cormann do the job for him. \nIt is an admission he has had to step in to fight for his job, and his government. And voters want the Prime Minister talking about them, not some annoying colleague. \nAnd some voters will see the comments as an excuse for the poll results when they might want instead an admission of leadership shortfall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:50:53.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
