Turnbull could become more cautious to keep conservatives \nFirst among equals is former prime minister Tony Abbott who, like Labor's Kevin Rudd, has refused to go quietly into the night. \nAlthough most believe Mr Abbott doesn't have the numbers to mount a challenge, his capacity to niggle, wound and distract the Government is undisputed. \nThere is also the possibility others might defect to the Australian Conservatives, or even One Nation. \nThe Government only commands the House of Representatives by a single vote and if a Coalition MP were to move to the crossbench, Mr Turnbull's already significant troubles would multiply. \nAll of this might make an already risk-averse Prime Minister even more cautious. \nRather than pushing him to embrace some of the media's favourite causes — such as a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage and more action on climate change — it could well have the reverse effect. \nWorried that more conservatives might quit the party, Mr Turnbull might opt to tread ever more carefully. \nSenator Bernardi's decision to go also exposes the deep divisions in the Liberal Party, which threaten the future of Robert Menzies' fusion of liberals and conservatives. In the view of one minister, that alliance is \"dying\". \n\"What the Greens did to Labor is now happening to us,\" he told the ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:25:47.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
