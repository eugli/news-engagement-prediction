Players are paid pro-rata based on how many games they play. ANDREW CORNAGA/PHOTOSPORT \nTrent Boult will be all smiles after going for more than $1 million at the IPL auction. \nIt was the second-highest price paid for a New Zealand player in the IPL. Brendon McCullum got 7.5 crore rupees ($1.56m) in 2015 when drafted by the team now known as the Gujarat Lions. Ross Taylor went for 4.6 crore rupees ($950,000) in 2011. \nREAD MORE: \nBoult's Blackcaps team-mate Corey Anderson was the only other Kiwi to be picked up in the early action when sold for his reserve price of $208,000 to the Delhi Daredevils. REUTERS \nCorey Anderson was picked up by the Delhi Daredevils at the IPL auction. \nThe news was not as good for batsmen Martin Guptill and Taylor, who were among the early players in the auction, but failed to attract any bids. Players that aren't initially sold go to a secondary auction, so the pair may get picked up at that point. \nIt was the second year in a row Guptill missed out, although this year was not as surprising as last year when he was in the white ball form of his life. \nThere was no love either for Kiwi legspinner Ish Sodhi. Fourteen other New Zealanders will go under the hammer later in the auction. ANDREW CORNAGA/PHOTOSPORT \nBlackcaps batsman Ross Taylor failed to attract a bid at the Indian Premier League auction. \nEarlier, Englishman Ben Stokes fetched the highest ever price for an overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction. Ad Feedback \nNew Zealand coach Stephen Fleming and his Rising Pune Supergiants team went to 14.5 crore, more than $3 million, for the allrounder, despite the fact he will probably miss the knockout stage of the tournament for England's tour of South Africa. \nHe was just short of the record for a player at the auction. That was Indian star Yuvraj Singh, who went for 16 crore to the Delhi Daredevils in 2015. ANDREW CORNAGA/PHOTOSPORT \nThe Indian Premier League teams passed up in Martin Guptill at the auction. \nAnother Kiwi coach got his wallet out a short time later. Daniel Vettori spent 12 crore rupees ($2.5m) for English paceman Tymal Mills to play for his Royal Challengers Bangalore side in what was thought to be the highest ever price paid for a bowler. \nAt the start of the auction there were just 29 overseas spots remaining, with 125 players, including 19 New Zealanders, vying for those at auction. \nThe eight franchises retained 140 players including five New Zealanders: Kane Williamson (Sunrisers), Brendon McCullum (Gujarat Lions), Southee and Mitchell McClenaghan (Mumbai) and Adam Milne (Bangalore).
