The name makes sense -- it has 3 bedrooms, spa/sauna, gourmet kitchen and a swagged out TV room ... plus killer ocean views. Before ya book, it goes for $12,500 per night. \nWe're told he ordered plenty of room service while partying with his many lady friends and one guy friend you probably know -- Don Julio. 1942 to be exact. \nAs we reported, Scott beelined it for South Beach after a blowout with Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian in Costa Rica. The Lord spares no expense when bouncing back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:24:08.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
