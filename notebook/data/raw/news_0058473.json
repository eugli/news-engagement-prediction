Slot to UMass Links \nMassachusetts Minutemen head coach Mark Whipple has a reputation in the coaching ranks as a keen offensive mind, however the thing he is known most for is his work with quarterbacks. Whipple was famously the quarterbacks coach for Ben Roethlisberger when the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowl XL, and that reputation has helped Whipple and the Minutemen recruit for the quarterback position. Along with quarterbacks coach Scott Woodward , the UMass staff has been able to identify and connect with numerous quality quarterback targets over the past several seasons, and their latest target comes from the Empire State. \nBronx, NY/Fordham Prep quarterback Matt Valecce unofficially visited UMass back on February 14th, and while on campus in Amherst he was extended a scholarship offer. That offers was Valecce’s second collegiate offer, and the first from a team at the FBS level. \nValecce has been on the Minutemen’s radar strongly since the start of the new year following an impressive junior campaign for the Rams where he threw for over 2,600 yards and 27 touchdowns. In three years as a varsity starter, the 6’5” 205-pound Valecce has thrown for 6,694 yards and 71 touchdowns against 15 interceptions. Fight Massachusetts caught up with Valecce to talk about his recruitment and his interest in the University of Massachusetts. \n“I’ve been interested in UMass for a long time because of its academic reputation and its proximity to home,” Valecce said. “Coach Whipple's history of expertise with quarterbacks, as well as the positive conversations I'd had with Coach Woodward, made me really want to go up and get a better feel for the program. Coach Woodward have been talking pretty regularly in the last month.” \nValecce’s other offer to this point is from Coach Whipple’s alma mater Brown, but he is also fielding varying levels of interest from Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Rutgers, Connecticut, and schools across the Ivy and Patriot Leagues. \nValecce and his mother made the three and a half hour trip up I-91 to see Amherst on the 14th, and both were extremely impressed by what they saw. \n“I spent a lot of time talking with Coach Whipple and Coach Woodward individually, and we really clicked,” Valecce said. “Coach Woodward took me on a tour of the great facilities, and after that my Mom and I had a private meeting with Coach Whipple. After speaking to Coach Whipple, I also had a long conversation with Coach Woodward in his meeting room. Coach Woodward has an amazing way about him and an incredible knowledge of the game. Coach Whipple's resumé obviously speaks for itself, and getting to know him better was a great experience. The facilities were amazing, and I can’t wait to get back up there again soon.” \nHonored to have received a full scholarship offer from the University of Massachusetts! #MinutemenUp #UMASS pic.twitter.com/HHsY0c3ldn — Matt Valecce (@mvalech4) February 14, 2017 \nValecce wasn’t necessarily surprised he received an offer while on his visit, but it was something that meant a great deal to him and his mother. \n“It was incredible, my mom and I were both thrilled,” Valecce said. “It was a real special moment for me. I truly believe that I have the talent and work ethic to compete at the FBS level, and for Coach Whipple and Coach Woodward to recognize that means a lot to me.” \nValecce is a big presence in the pocket a 6’5” and already over 200 pounds. He’s got a big frame and an arm to match, and he has the potential to get even bigger. He talked to us about what he brings to the field as the signal caller. \n“I take a lot of pride in my football IQ, and I feel it to be one of my strongest attributes,” Valecce said. “I dedicate a lot of time in my preparation during the week in order to know what progressions and match ups I want to utilize on Saturdays. I feel that my knowledge of coverages and defensive schemes along with my accuracy allows me to compete at a very high level.” \nIt’s just under a year until National Signing Day 2018, so there is a whole lot of time left before Valecce (or any recruit) has to make a final decision. Valecce does know however some of the things he’ll be looking for at the school he ends up signing with next year. \n“I’m certainly looking for a school with great academics, as I take a lot of pride in my academic prowess and work ethic,” Valecce said. “It’s also important for me that the coaching staff I ultimately commit to appreciates the attributes and skills I bring to the table. Lastly, I think it’s obvious that I want to commit at a very high level. At the end of the day I love to compete and feel that I can at the highest level.” \nValecce is a quarterback recruit that has a great deal of potential, and his recruitment is sure to rise as 2017 moves along, particularly once his senior season begins. With this early offer from UMass, he’s likely to be among their top targets at the position for the class of 2018. The Minutemen are likely to take one quarterback in the next class, and the potential for that to be a high school quarterback is high. With four quarterbacks currently on the roster, bringing in a high school player that could redshirt the 2018 season makes a lot of sense. \nValecce is on vacation so he won’t be able to make it to the Minutemen’s upcoming Junior Day on February 26th, but given his interest in UMass and relative proximity to the school, we would expect to see more of him in Amherst as the 2018 recruiting cycle moves along. We’d consider him one to watch closely for UMass. Author ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:46:43.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
