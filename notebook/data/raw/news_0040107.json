If you only have time to visit one, make it Schlenkerla, in Dominikanerstrasse. Authentic rauchbier (made from smoked malt tapped straight from the wooden barrel) is served in this atmospheric 17th-century building in the shadow of Bamberg’s Romanesque cathedral. Drink it with a traditional Bavarian breakfast of weisswurst (white pudding), pretzels and sweet mustard or an afternoon snack of the strangely-named kaese mit musik . The soused onions served with the cheese explains the music that is produced later. ID3586836 Weinstube Kachelofen, Stuttgart \nIf you have ever wondered what the German concept gemütlichkeit means, the Weinstube Kachelofen in Stuttgart’s centre will sum it up for you. The interior is welcoming and cosy, you feel relaxed as soon as you enter. The traditional glazed stove ( kachelofen ) is the main feature of the room. The Weinstube is furnished in gingerbread-house style, with carved wooden chairs and lace tablecloths, but there is nothing kitsch about the breezy service and the delicious food and drink. Try a schwarzbier (black beer) or red trollinger wine with maultaschensuppe (a soup with ravioli-type pasta) for €5 or käesespätzle (Swabian noodles with cheese) for €10. Margaret Aitken Papa Joe’s Jazz Bar, Cologne \nIn the old part of Cologne is an intimate and friendly bar, very atmospheric, playing live traditional jazz most nights. Sometimes the crowd spills out into the street in front due to its small size, but that just adds to the fun. Wood panelled inside, with lots of artifacts hanging on the walls and ceiling, such as trumpets, posters, pictures and dummies. Old game machines and automatic musical instruments from the 1920s are dotted around. Great beer, good food. Service also very good, waitresses serving drinks from traditional wooden trays strapped round their neck. It’s in the Buttermarkt, one street from the river. ID5251973 Capri Bar, Bremen \nBetter known for its brewery and Grimm Brother’s Town Musicians than its bar scene, Bremen still has pockets of nightlife to offer the young bar-goer. Tucked a few streets behind the main drag of the trendy Steintor quarter, hides an unassuming patch of unusual watering-holes. Begin at the Capri Bar , with its cavernous walls and eye-wateringly cheap happy hour. While sipping cocktails inside a cave may be a bit kitsch for some, the sociable beer garden out the front offers the chance to hone your German or simply soak up the northern sun. Then just as the night seems all but over, venture a few doors down to the tiny (yet lively) Heartbreak Hotel . Inside the graffiti-laden walls is a DJ who will be playing even after the keenest of night owls has gone home. kasparwilson ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:10:36.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
