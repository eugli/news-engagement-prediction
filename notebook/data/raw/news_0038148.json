First daughter Ivanka Trump carried on the tradition by wearing his company’s designs during last month’s inauguration festivities.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Clinton did not directly address her presidential election loss to Ivanka’s father, Republican Donald Trump, but she alluded to Trump obliquely in remarks praising immigrants and the U.S. Constitution.\nShe said de la Renta was ‘‘a fitting person to be chosen by our Postal Service — mentioned, by the way, in the Constitution, something we should all read and reread in today’s times.’’\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who joined Clinton, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and others at the ceremony at New York’s Grand Central Terminal, also praised de la Renta as a proud Dominican immigrant.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘Our country is great because we welcome people from around the world. They come here to work hard and build a better future for their families, no matter where they come from,’’ said Bloomberg, a political independent who endorsed the Clinton, a Democrat, for president.\nBloomberg said the U.S. gave de la Renta an opportunity to achieve his dreams and, in return, he helped others achieve theirs.\n‘‘That included him speaking up in support of fixing our broken immigration system so that more people would have a chance to make it in America just the way he did,’’ Bloomberg said.\nThursday also marked a nationwide action called ‘‘A Day Without Immigrants,’’ illustrating immigrants’ contributions to the U.S. economy and way of life.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Fclinton-praises-oscar-renta-proud-immigrant%2F0CFb4GI6Fiew8tGsV8xC9N%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tClinton", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Fclinton-praises-oscar-renta-proud-immigrant%2F0CFb4GI6Fiew8tGsV8xC9N%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Clinton", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Fclinton-praises-oscar-renta-proud-immigrant%2F0CFb4GI6Fiew8tGsV8xC9N%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Clinton", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Fclinton-praises-oscar-renta-proud-immigrant%2F0CFb4GI6Fiew8tGsV8xC9N%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Clinton"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:20:49.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
