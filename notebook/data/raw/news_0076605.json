Wauconda celebrates its second-place finish in Class 2A at Saturday's team state tournament. (Brian O'Mahoney / Lake County News-Sun) Michael Garofola News-Sun Privacy Policy \nBLOOMINGTON, Ill. — Downstate Washington wasn't the only team to enjoy a memorable run at Saturday's Class 2A team state tournament. \nThe Panthers lived up to their No. 1 ranking by IllinoisMatmen.com by scoring three dominant wins, including 58-12 in the final over Wauconda. \nBut it was also a historic day for the Bulldogs, who earned the first state trophy in a boys sport in the school's 102-year history. \n\"We were wrestling for ourselves, but also the community, and that's what makes this trophy so much better,\" said senior 120-pounder Justin Mitchell (43-8), who won the deciding match in Wauconda's 30-21 quarterfinal victory over Oak Forest. \n\"Six of us made it to state, and only one of us (Michael Turzynski, who was sixth at 285) would medal. So the rest of us came down here with a chip on our shoulders, and the chance to redeem ourselves from our weekend in Champaign.\" \nFirst-year Wauconda coach Michael Buhr saw the same fire in his veterans from the onset, but wasn't sure what he would eventually have. \n\"I knew we had eight sectional qualifiers back, but I didn't know where we were technically and what our focus needed to be,\" Buhr said. \"But when you can count on a group of terrific seniors to lead the way, your already starting on the right foot.\" \nThe Bulldogs (24-5) didn't lose to a 2A opponent all season until Saturday's final. After a loss to Lake Zurich on Dec. 21, Wauconda won 10 straight duals en route to their first trip to state. \nOnce here, a hard-fought win over Oak Forest sent them into the semifinals against Cahokia. \n\"We got some big wins against Oak Forest,\" Buhr said. \n\"Nick Schemer got us going at 145, then Devon Parrish (170), Zac Finn (182) and Frank Milella (195) put us in the lead with two close wins, and a pin from Milella.\" \nWith Oak Forest edging closer, Mitchell's second-period reversal against state qualifier Brandon Musselman held up in a 2-1 victory to secure the victory. \nIt was more of the same against Cahokia, with Delon Kanari's technical fall and major decisions from Tyler Husko, Mickey Landvick and Tyler Stankiewicz setting the tone in a 32-23 triumph. \n\"Coach Buhr pulled our room together right from the start, asking us seniors to be leaders, always working us hard, but still having fun while doing it,\" said Husko, who finished at 41-9 in his final high school season. \n\"We were 4-3 at the start,\" said Parrish (40-14), who will wrestle at Wisconsin-Whitewater next season. \"But once we got everyone back, our lineup looked very good, and with the help of coach Buhr, who put a nutritional plan into place to help us keep weight, it all came together for us.\" \n\"To get that first win, and knowing we would go home with a state trophy was surreal, but making it all the way to the finals is a dream,\" Buhr said. \nMichael Garofola is a freelance report for the News-Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:54:05.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
