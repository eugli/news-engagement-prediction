Once considered a statement, music players on the move have evolved into miniscule devices with humungous storage. Little wonder then that in-car audio too has come a long way since bulky sets mounted onto dashboards. And even the current technology may soon become obsolete. \n\nAutomotive giants around the globe are increasingly looking to give drivers and passengers not just a comfortable and luxurious ride but one that is entertaining. In an age of wireless streaming and cloud storage, new-age vehicles are also increasingly becoming 'stay connected' machines. \n\nUSB and Aux ports now come as a standard in cars, with only a handful offering CD player options. \n\n\n\n\n\nSale of aftermarket audio equipment, therefore, has seen a sharp decline as well. \"We have seen a steady fall in people coming in for music players. So, we have reduced stocking these and instead focus on audio enhancers like bass tubes, amplifiers and woofers,\" says Ajit Tokas, owner of a car equipment shop in Delhi's Karol Bagh. \"But even audio enhancers are seeing a fall in demand because not many want to take a chance with a car's electrical which usually come with a warranty,\" adds the 35-year-old. \n\nAlthough sale of a plethora of accessories - alloys, sunshades, customised decals etc - have seen a rise, the rapidly-changing in-car audio technology means the onus of entertainment is now increasingly dependent on manufacturers in factories - Apple CarPlay, Android Auto et all. \n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, the strides are even bigger in terms of car audio players. App-based systems have gradually increased their presence while companies like Ford and Kia have been integrating Sync and UVO to their vehicles, respectively. These are taking the audio gambit to higher levels of turning the dashboard into a complete media hub. Driving distractions? Companies are fast looking to change that as well with text-to speech AI interface for AV control to occupants, speed-determined volume levels, video playback on neutral, and similar features. \n\n\n\n\nMuch like the VCR in home visual entertainment then, the CD and cassette players are largely defunct. Even USB and Aux - and even the relatively new Bluetooth audio - technologies are heading towards extinction at a pace quicker than one would expect. The road ahead in in-car entertainment is ripe with possibilities. And in that lies the future of sound.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:24:37.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
