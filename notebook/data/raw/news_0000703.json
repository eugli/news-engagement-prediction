Shares \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 isn't going to officially be announced this month a MWC 2017 , but that doesn't mean it'll be completely absent. \nSamsung's flagship Android phone for 2017 will be teased on February 26 at the company's Barcelona press conference, according to The Korean Herald . \nThe sneak peak is said to come in the form of a one-minute video clip, which sounds like just enough time to catch a glimpse of the curved phone. \nEven if it's gone in 60 seconds, Samsung is likely hoping the tease is just enough to distract you from that day's LG G6 and BlackBerry Mercury announcements. Op-ed: Why I'm buying the Galaxy S8, even after the Note 7 disaster Here's how it's likely to go down \nExpect a lengthy unveiling of the overdue Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 , the Android tablet that's poised to update the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with better specs. \nAfter that, Samsung may take a page out of Apple's playbook with its own 'One more thing' surprise, ending MWC press conference on a cliffhanger. \nWe anticipate this cliffhanger to feature loud, booming music and playful video of a slowly rotating phone draped in various shadows. What a tease! \nThere may even be a confirmed launch date at the end of this sizzle reel. We've heard about a March 29 event and April 21 release date at last check. \nIt'll be the talk of the convention, especially if we get a clear look at the rumored all-screen Samsung Galaxy S8 display.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:45:08.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
