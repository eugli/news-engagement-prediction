(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Chase Elliott passed another Daytona test on Thursday night. Now he’s on to the final again. It will get harder. But he already knows that. \nMake no mistake, had the 150-mile qualifying race Elliott won at Daytona International Speedway been the actual Daytona 500, Kevin Harvick and Jamie McMurray, former winners of NASCAR’s greatest race, would not have been so civil. Brad Keselowski, who has never won the Daytona 500, would have acted out like he did on the final lap of the non-points Clash exhibition, sending leader Denny Hamlin careening after a poorly timed block attempt. But none of them wanted to wreck fast race cars, just as much as Elliott didn’t want to lose the car that won the pole and will lead the field to green . \nThere had been no doubt that Elliott, 21, had been provided fast cars by Hendrick Motorsports in his first two attempts at the Daytona 500. He won the pole both times. But after finishing sixth in his qualifying race and leading just two laps last season, the prodigy wrecked his speedy No. 24 Chevrolet sufficiently to relegate himself to a 37th-place finish in last year's race. \nMORE NASCAR: Danica Patrick on NASCAR future: 'I don't need an exit strategy' \nAnother year, another pole, and another chance to prove himself in the prestige season opener of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season. Winning on Thursday is no assurance of success on Sunday in the race that matters most. But in recovering from an early attack by the mob to regain the lead from Keselowski on Lap 35 of 60, then defending it with vigorous blocking, Elliott suggested the flair and the calculation required to succeed in the odd exercise that is restrictor-plate racing. \nDaytona’s demands on finding the proper balance for a car remain patently evident for Elliott, as he and teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. slid off Turn 4 in the Daytona 500 last season. He mastered it Thursday, but even racing conditions will be different Sunday with a day start and a warmer, slicker track. \nPHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Chase Elliott Facebook   Chase Elliott, the son of NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, was born Nov. 28, 1995.

Elliott, therefore, had questions to answer after plowing through the grass on Lap 18 and finishing 37th with his damaged car last year. \nOn Thursday, Elliott held the lead twice for 25 laps. Early on, he was consumed by a pack filled with drivers with allegiances to other manufacturers, notably the entire four-car Joe Gibbs Racing contingent of Toyotas. \nRunner-up McMurray said Elliott did “a really good job,” in his estimation. “Awesome,” in fact. And even with the win, much of the field considers Team Penske’s Keselowski and former 500 winner Joey Logano the favorites. \nBut Elliott made his case. Now he has to go make it again. \nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames \nPHOTOS: History of the Daytona 500 Facebook   The Daytona 500, the premier race in NASCAR, has been held annually since 1959.
