Bridgeport Police Detective Walberto Cotto Jr. later questioned Yovino after other students said it appeared Yovino went into the bathroom willingly with the two men.\nOne student, according to the arrest warrant affidavit, said he overheard Yovino telling the men she wanted to have sex with them.\n‘She admitted that she made up the allegation of sexual assault against (the football players) because it was the first thing that came to mind’ Source: Supplied \n“She admitted that she made up the allegation of sexual assault against (the football players) because it was the first thing that came to mind and she didn’t want to lose (another male student) as a friend and potential boyfriend. She stated that she believed when (the other male student) heard the allegation it would make him angry and sympathetic to her,” according to the affidavit.\nMark Sherman, Yovino’s lawyer, said he had not yet been provided with police reports and video footage pertaining to the case, but told The Post he expects Yovino to plead not guilty at her arraignment on March 3.\n“The details of what happened here will come out at the appropriate time during the court process,” Sherman wrote in an email.\nYovino, who was released after posting $5000 bond, faces up to five years in prison if convicted on the tampering charge, a felony, the Connecticut Post reports.\nSacred Heart officials declined to provide information about specific students, including the identities of the two former football players and whether they will be reinstated by the university, citing federal privacy laws, in a statement to The Post.\n“However, I can say that the facts as presented in the Connecticut Post article you are referencing are not entirely accurate,” university spokeswoman Deborah Noack wrote in an email. “Whenever there is any kind of incident at Sacred Heart University, we go to great lengths to ensure due process for all parties involved. The way that this particular case is playing out certainly demonstrates the validity of our procedures.”\nNoack also declined to indicate whether Yovino was a current or former student at the university. Her Facebook page identifies her as a psychology and pre-med student at Sacred Heart University and Suffolk County Community College.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:09:26.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
