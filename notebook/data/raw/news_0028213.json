This is an elusive slot receiver that does a good job of sticking his foot in the ground and winning those one-on-one battles in the open field. \nMoorer shows that field-stretching speed when dissecting his film, but it's his quickness and slippery style of play that catches your attention in a hurry. He does a nice job of stopping on a dime and creating space between him and the defender. \nSize is not on Moorer's side, but he certainly takes advantage of his strengths once the ball is tossed his way. \nPrograms Mentioned in Video:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:29:27.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
