More than 230 people have died in a series of assaults since the beginning of 2015 and the country has been under state of emergency rules since November the same year. \n(Reporting by French service, writing by Andrew Callus, Editing by Leigh Thomas) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:23:40.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
