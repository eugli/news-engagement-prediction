It would be the first electric line under the SRT. \nAccording to Mr Peerapol, the SRT has also asked Japanese officials to conduct a feasibility study into a high-speed train project from Bangkok to the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. \nTransport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith will hold talks with his Malaysian counterparts next month to seek cooperation over the project, he said. \n\"The SRT and Malaysia's authorities need to discuss the framework of the project study, while Japan must say whether it can offer help,\" said Mr Peerapol. \nIf an agreement is reached, the feasibility study could start by this year, the deputy permanent secretary said. \nIt could take more than one year to complete the study given that this is a substantial project with a high investment, he noted. \nReferring to the 193.5km high-speed train project from Bangkok to Rayong, Mr Peerapol said the ministry is gathering more information on land development for commercial purposes to make the project more economically viable. \nThe OTP is expected to forward the 153-billion-baht project to the ministry for consideration by this month, he said. \nAs for the 211km high-speed train project between Bangkok and Hua Hin, Mr Peerapol said the 95-billion-baht scheme is under consideration by the State Enterprise Policy Office and no decision has been reached. \nMeanwhile, SRT deputy governor Thanongsak Pongprasert said bid envelopes for the SRT's procurement of 50 diesel locomotives at a cost of 14.2 billion baht are expected to be sold in the middle of next month.
