Never bet against (Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady,” she tweeted. Omg…last night really happened… pic.twitter.com/WVxdKPYV68 \n— Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nOn Monday, Bouchard said she would “stay true to my word” and go on the date with her fan, who says he is from Chicago and is studying in Missouri. \nBouchard, 22, was a rising star in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final, but has slipped to 45th in the latest women’s rankings. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:16:00.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
