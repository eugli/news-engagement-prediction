One has been detained by the Malaysian police, four are believed to have fled to North Korea, while two others are still in Malaysia. \nKim Jong-nam was murdered on Feb 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 by VX nerve agent, classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, Malaysian police said on Friday. \nTwo women - one Indonesian and one Vietnamese - have also been detained. Police had said on Friday that one of them had suffered from the effects of VX and had been vomiting. \nSamah also confirmed that authorities raided an apartment in an upscale Kuala Lumpur suburb on Wednesday in connection with the killing. \nInvestigators were still looking for any traces of chemicals in the apartment, he added. - Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:51:41.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
