From super heroes like Nagraj, Super Commando Dhruv, Doga, Parmanu to supernatural characters like Tausi (a shape shifting snake), Jambu (a super genius robot), to closer-to-life characters Chacha Chaudhari, Pinki, Billu, Raman, there was something about this magical world that reduced the everyday stress of a student. \nNow that these comics are out of demand, it is a good idea to convert them into TV series, so that these amazing characters continue to live. \nWe pick 5 characters: \n1. NAGRAJ: A shape shifting snake king, Nagraj, is extremely vemonous and has thousands of sevak snakes residing inside his body. Whenever needed, the snakes come out of his wrists and act as his sena and also his weapon. \nOther important characters: Visarpi, Saudangi, Baba Gorakhnath \nVillains: Professor Naagmani, Thodanga, Nagina \nSuggested actor to play the role: Gaurav Chopra (because of his intense eyes and killer looks) \nGenre: Super-hero \n2. SUPER COMMANDO DHRUV: Dhruv is the captain of his Commando Force which has three cadets--Peter, Renu and Karim who help him fight the crime in Rajnagar. His father I.G. Rajan is a police officer. He has a sister Shweta who adopts an alter ego of Chandika and often comes to her brother's rescue. Dhruv doesn't know that Chandika is his sister Shweta. Dhruv mostly uses star blades, star line, which is placed in his utility belt, as his tools. He has also got the ability to interact with birds and animals. It is often the non-humans that inform him about a crime. \nOther important characters: Shweta/Chandika, Natasha, Dhananjay \nVillains: Grand Master Robo, Samri, Nostredamas \nSuggested actor: Super Commando Dhruv is someone who is extremely good looking apart from having a sharp brain. We feel, Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi actor Shaheer Sheikh is a perfect cast. \nGenre: Action-thriller \n3. PINKI : 5-year-old girl Pinki is a chirpy little girl who's the lifeline of her colony. However, she ends up troubling a lot of people, especially her neighbour Jhapatji who she intends to help. She has a pet squirrel Kutkut who often comes to her rescue, and is equally naughty. \nOther important characters: Jhapatji, Bhiku, Champu \nSuggested actors: We feel Saloni Daini, the young comic star resembles Pinki a lot. What do you think? \nGenre: Sitcom \n4. DOGA: Suraj, an orphan, is found in a rubbish can by Daku Halkan Singh, and is mistreated by him. He escapes his clutches and finds a mentor in Adrak Chacha and his brothers. After getting a training in martial arts and acquiring a muscular body, he is ready to fight the crime. He wears a Dog mask and adopts the alter ego of Doga. \nOther important characters: Adrak chacha, Dhania chacha, Haldi chacha, Kali Mirchi chacha \nVillains: Kaal Paheliya, Janine Chatterjee, Bull Dog \nSuggested actor: Mohammad Nazim--We would like to see the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya actor for the simple reason that he's a fitness freak and has a muscular body. \nGenre: Action-thriller \n5. RAMAN: An aam aadmi, this Pran character is still relevant in today's times. We feel it will make for a compelling watch and it can be an episodic. The comics often brought up everyday's issues affecting a common man. \nOther important characters: Khalifa, Kamli, Moga Singh \nSuggested actor: Dilip Joshi aka Jethalal perfectly fits the bill, complete with the moustache \nGenre: Sitcom For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
