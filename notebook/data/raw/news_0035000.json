He was later reinstated.

He said the woman lodged a complaint only when the minister tried to molest her minor daughter. \nHer complaint to the DGP was sent in October 2016 but no FIR was lodged. She subsequently moved the apex court seeking justice, he said. On the first date of hearing, the top court had asked Delhi Police to provide security to the petitioner.
