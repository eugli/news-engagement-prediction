It is not a registered political party but is said to have 50,000 members. \nThere is a substantial constituency potentially available. A Newspoll today revealed Pauline Hanson’s One Nation had eight per cent of primary votes. This could be as much as 10 per cent given some phone supporters are shy about admitting it to pollsters. \nA rebel Bernardi party could attract discontented voters who have problems with Senator Hanson or her policies. \nHis latest inspiration has been President Donald Trump. \nSenator Bernardi spent three months from September in New York as an observer at the United Nations for the Parliament. His job was to improve links with the UN, a body he has criticised as unelected and unaccountable. \nDuring his three months he became. Trump fanboi and spent a significant amount of time tweeting his support girl the then presidential candidate. \nAs soon as he returned to Australia from the taxpayer-funded trip speculation began he would break from the Liberals. \nHe is a social conservative on marriage, abortion and families. \nSenator Bernardi has not been on the Coalition front bench since 2012 when he quit as shadow parliamentary secretary for family support after arguing gay marriage could lead to approval of bestiality. Malcolm Turnbull has long had an uncomfortable relationship with Cory Bernardi, pictured here with Bruce Baird after the Press Gallery v Federal politicians swimming relay race at Parliament House pool in Canberra in 2007.
