She returned to the country David last year so he could receive his tribal name. \nShe adopted Mercy three years later. \nMadonna recently spoke about her love for Malawi in an interview with Billboard, saying: \"I’ve been working in Malawi for over a decade. I have a huge commitment and love for the country and I will never desert them. I adopted my two children that I’m so lucky to have living in my house right now.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:45:59.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
