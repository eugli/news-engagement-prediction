He said: “ I just spoke to the president’s personal doctor, and he told me President Buhari is not in any serious condition as to worry about.” “He is not in hospital. He is in the residence at the Nigerian High Commission.” He said Buhari was getting ready to return to Nigeria but some test results made him wait. “He and his delegation were ready to come home today but for the delayed test result which came in today which necessitated that he delays his return. “There is nothing to worry about as far as his condition is concerned.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:35:15.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
