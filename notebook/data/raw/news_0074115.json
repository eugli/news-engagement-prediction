Twitter Sue Howarth was tortured and murdered at her South African home Twitter 5 Sue was pictured in hospital after her sickening ordeal. She died soon after this was taken \nPolice said they were put through a horrific ordeal lasting several hours in which they were savagely beaten around the head, burned, and cut with a knife. \nEventually the three men bundled the married couple into their own pickup truck. \nSue, originally from Southsea in Hampshire, had a plastic bag jammed down her throat and Robert had a bag tied round his neck in an effort to strangle him. \nThey were driven to a mountain pass where Sue was shot twice in the head and Robert once in the neck.

Twitter 5 The couple’s home in a remote part of South Africa \nDistraught Robert has been discharged from hospital and returned to their farm and told his local paper the Middleburg Observer he had to “face the demons”. \nHe said: “I have to come to terms with losing my best friend. \n“I woke up because the dogs were barking and there was a racket at the bedroom window. After I stood up, I heard glass breaking. \n“I suppose that is when they started shooting at us. I assumed they missed. They were wearing balaclavas and attacked us”. \nMr Lynn was pistol whipped with a gun and ordered to lie down. \nHe said: “They kept on asking where the money is. I told them that we don’t keep money but they would not believe me.” Twitter 5 The gang are believed to have broken in through a window \nMr Lynn gave them a couple of hundred Rand he had in a money clip and his bank cards telling his attackers that they will be able to withdraw R1000 per day from it. \nMr Lynn was taken to the living room and was covered with a blanket. \nShortly after his attackers started burning him with a blow torch on his chest and legs. \nHis hands were tied with twine and robbers then started cutting him with a knife in order to get him to confess to keeping more money or a gun safe somewhere. \nHe said:“They were looking for things we just don’t have. \n“I said to them that whoever gave them their information, gave them the wrong information. One of them replied with ‘No they didn’t’.’” \nMr Lynn kept on calling to his wife in the bedroom who he last saw lying in a sleeping position but said she did not answer. \nHe said:“The small dark one, who seemed to be the leader, smacked me over the head with his gun and told me to shut up.” \nMr Lynn was put in the back of their Nissan pickup and his attackers pulled a black bag over his head. CEN 5 South African police are investigating the horrific crime. File picture \nHe said:“I suppose they wanted to suffocate me but I managed to bite a tiny hole through the bag through which I could breathe.” \nHe heard his wife moaning as she was thrown into the back of the pickup. \nThe attackers struggled for a while to reverse the vehicle out of the parking. \nHe said:“I thought we were going to Dullstroom to withdraw money. But then they turned towards Belfast.” \nThe attackers drove on back roads through Belfast and Siyathuthuka and onto the road towards Stoffberg. \nHe said: “They kept on stopping and going and when they stopped for good they pulled me out of the vehicle by my hair.” \nThe robbers walked with him into the field where he had to crawl through a barbed wire fence and was ordered to get on his knees. \nHe said:“That was the last thing I remember. I thought I was dead after that until I looked up and saw the stars.” \nIt took Mr Lynn some time to free his hands, after he crawled back to the road. \nHe said:“When I got to the road, something told me to turn right. But left made more sense because it was downhill. I turned right. \n“I was not steady on my feet so I crawled most of the way. I thought I heard a cow mooing. Later I realised that it was Susan moaning. \n“I crossed the road, crawling most of the way. On the other side I saw Susan, lying in a ditch. Her hands tied behind her back. She was bleeding from her head.” \n“I didn’t know what to do. I could see that she was in a very bad state. I could sit with her but the best thing would be to try and get help. \n“So I stood next to the road. Five trucks and two cars passed me hooting their horns as they did but they did not stop”. \nHis saviours were two friends who drove by as dawn broke. \nDevestated Mr Lynn said:“Susan was a great girl. She had a great life just to end up in a ditch with her hands tied behind her back.” \nIt was the third violent farm attack in the province this month. \nBorder collie lover Sue was extremely well known in sheepdog trial circles and had three rescue collie dogs of her own. \nThey are believed to have lived in the area for over 20 years and although they have different surnames were married. \nProvincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathis said: “They were sleeping on Sunday when they were attacked by three men. This was a violent and horrific attack and we are searching for those responsible.” \nHi-Tech Security Highlands manager Mr Johan Pierterse said the gang broke in through a window and tied up the couple and demanded cash. \n“They demanded money but could not find any in the house” he said. \nHe said the attackers then forced the couple into their own pickup truck and drove them to a point on the R37 between Belfast and Stoffberg. \nA Hi-Tech Security vehicle rushed to the scene and an officer Mr Johan Bezuidenhout removed the bag from her throat. \nHe said: “We arranged for an ambulance and notified the police. Howarth was already in a coma and Lynn was in a state of shock and badly injured.” \nThe couple was taken to a local hospital in Belfast and then transported to MidMed Hospital in Middelburg. \nTheir blue Nissan pickup truck was found abandoned in Middleburg. \nSusan moved to Dullstroom in 1996 and started the Dullstroom Stables before the farm Marchlands where she was attacked became her home. \nShe passed away in the Midmed Hospital on Tuesday morning never regaining consciousness after the attack. \nThe post-mortem will have to determine exactly what the extent of her injuries were. \nHer ashes will be flown to Southsea in England where she will be buried with her parents. She was an only child. \nMeanwhile Robert Lynn says he will try to pick up the pieces in Dullstroom. \nHe said: “I am amazed how good people have been to me. But I will never be able to forget what evil people are capable of.” \nClose friend Claire Taylor invited local paper the Middleburg Observer into the hospital to photograph Sue in bed to show the full horror of what local farmers are going through. \nShe said at the time: “Sue is such a powerful person. She is so strong. She is straight shooter. \n“She would have wanted the world to see what happened to her. What they did to her.” \nBefore settling in Dullstroom, Sue was at the head of a pharmaceutical company in Johannesburg. She kept her maiden hame after marrying Robert who was an electrical engineer for Eskom. \nA reward is being put together by friends of the couple to try and track down their evil attackers. \nA spokesman for the Democratic Alliance said yesterday: “Sue and husband Robert were overpowered and tortured and left left for dead. \n“We simply cannot allow these horrendous acts to continue and or our rural communities to live in fear. \n“We call on the Government to employ rural safety units to protect rural communities from rural crime.” \nA close friend of Sue’s told a local paper: “She had a heart of gold who made a strong impression on people wherever she went. \n“Robert will be devastated at her loss. This is just horrific and it what happened was just pure and hateful and pointless torture.” \nCol. Phela Mahlangu, head of the detectives at the Middelburg Cluster, said that a task team has been established to work on the case around the clock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:40:30.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
