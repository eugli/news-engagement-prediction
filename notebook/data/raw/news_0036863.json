A good result because I know how difficult it is to play over there.\n\"They have a fantastic crowd, fantastic support, and the stadium is very nice, so the guys will see it when we go there. It was important today to get a good result.\n\"It is a good team. They always make it difficult for every team they play against and when I was at PSG the same thing.
