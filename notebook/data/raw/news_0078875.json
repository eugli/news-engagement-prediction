Tied to Steelers through 2021. 2/27/2017, 10:32:37 PM It's not as if Brown's future was ever in major doubt. He still had one year left on his previous deal, which would have paid him a little over $13.6 million in 2017, and neither the Steelers nor Brown had much reason to want a separation. Brown was named to his fourth straight Pro Bowl in 2016, and he earned first-team All-Pro honors for the third year in a row. By his incredibly high standards, the 28-year-old had a somewhat disappointing 2016 campaign. His 106 receptions and 1,284 receiving yards were his lowest totals since 2012, but his 12 touchdowns marked the second-highest tally of his career. Football Outsiders ranked Brown as the No. 7 wideout in defense-adjusted yards above replacement in 2016, and Pro Football Focus graded him third at the position. Since entering the league as a sixth-round draft pick out of Central Michigan in 2010, Brown has gone from relative obscurity to one of the league's best wideouts.
