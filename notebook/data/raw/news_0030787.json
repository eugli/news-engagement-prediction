Credit NBC If President Trump’s shock and awe attack on truth, decorum and liberal sensibilities is designed to bludgeon his opponents into submission, “Saturday Night Live” felt like his latest victim this weekend. Not that the show, which has been one of his most outspoken and popular antagonists, didn’t remain on the attack. Melissa McCarthy reprised her savage impersonation of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, and Alec Baldwin (in his 17th appearance as host) donned his flaxen wig and prosthetic jowls to play Mr. Trump in a “People’s Court” sketch mocking the president’s attempts to have his travel ban reinstated. Kate McKinnon — who, in a Tatiana Maslany-style tour de force, also appeared as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senator Elizabeth Warren — played the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway trying to seduce her way onto CNN in a “Fatal Attraction” spoof. But there was a sense of exhaustion — of “how long can we keep this up?” — that was made explicit in the court sketch when Cecily Strong, as the presiding judge, said to Mr. Baldwin’s Trump: “You’re doing too much. I want one day without a CNN alert that scares the hell out of me.” It was delivered plaintively, not as a laugh line but as a weary, nervous plea. Ms. McCarthy opened the show as Spicer for the second week in a row, and the press-briefing sketch was again the high point. Its simple premise — take the thin-skinned venom and brazen duplicity the Trump administration has exhibited and render it as naked, schoolyard-bully aggression — was still effective, coupled with Ms. McCarthy’s absolute commitment. But it was even more underwritten than before, name-checking controversies rather than illuminating them, which has been true of most of the show’s Trump-related material. In the absence of new ideas, old ones recycled from last week’s sketch were simply amped up — the wad of chewing gum was bigger, the weaponized rostrum was now motorized. The physical attacks on reporters now included an assault with a leaf blower, which was jolting and kind of fascinating when the machine was pointed at the face of a reporter played by Ms. Strong, but not so funny when it was used to blow her skirt up over her head.
