Image copyright Facebook Image caption Facebook had told Mrs Allen that the profile that posted the images had been removed \nHowever, it was soon back online without explanation. \nThe profile also features posts with identical text that show images of other children, and in one case a bearded youth - despite the words referring to a \"little baby [that] has cancer\". \nOther posts from the account - which claims to belong to Pooran Singh - show images of children in hospital claiming the viewer will experience years of bad luck if they scroll down without liking and sharing. \n\"What's so disgusting [is] it's not just Jasper's pictures but [about] 100 of other people's families as well,\" Mrs Allen explained. \n\"Facebook needs to take action. I was told it was removed but within 24 hours it was back again.\" Image copyright Mercury Press Image caption Jasper Allen was two when the photos were taken - he has since recovered \nThe owner of the account did not respond to a request to explain his or her actions. \nBut one security blogger said this appeared to be a case of \"link farming\", in which scammers seek to make people interact with a Facebook post so they can either direct further messages to them or sell on the profile and all its contacts. \n\"There are a lot of scams that use these kind of emotional images - oftentimes it's done to make money,\" Graham Cluley explained. \n\"They may later post something that claims you've won a prize and try and get you to enter your mobile phone number and then sign you up for a premium rate service, or ask for other personal information. \n\"The problem is that people just believe things that are posted online, and they need to be a lot more careful about what they like and share.\" \nFacebook is currently reviewing the case with its complaints team and declined to comment further until this process had been completed.
