PUBLISHED: 09:31, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 10:53, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 GETTY Economists have claimed the eurozone collapse could lead to the end of the EU \nBureaucrats in Brussels are so obsession with sticking to their rigid model, and creating even closer unions, they are “missing the chance” to save themselves, it is claimed. \nEconomists in Finland have warned the euro may be past the point of saving, and one expert has predicted if it falls, the entire bloc could come down with it unless leaders finally admit the flaws in the European project. \nAccording to economist Dr Tuomas Malinen, a CEO of GnS Economics and the Vice Chairman of EuroThinkTank, the whole of Europe could be rocked by a recession which will see the weaker countries suffer if drastic changes are not made. \nDr Malinen said: “There will be a downturn at some point and a recession at which point everything starts all over again. \n“Weaker countries will suffer mass unemployment and a fall in GDP and then we have to make a decision whether or not to take another hit and go through long period of depression and internal devaluations and austerity again. \n“I think the euro has until the next recession. When it hits some countries will leave, if not the whole structure will break down, but that is very difficult to predict. \n“If you stick with the euro in its current form, it is more than likely to take the European Union with it. \n“That’s the biggest worry here.” GETTY Thousands protest in Italy against the EU Bolkestein directive to bring services single market \nThe problem, according to the economist, is the Euro was created decades too soon. \nBureaucrats in Brussels want to bring nations into line on economic policy, and are insisting all members should be fast tracked onto taking the euro, if they have not already. \nYet all eventualities were not considered in the hurry to create a union with a single currency - and countries like Greece are now struggling in a big way. \nDr Malinen said: “The EU is much more important than the euro and the euro was created 50 years before it should have been. \n“A political union is needed to back a currency union. \n“Two-hundred years of history of currency unions taught us that.” GETTY Riot police in Greece as voters take to the streets over economic meltdown \nAccording to the economist the way to save the eurozone, and ultimately the union, would be to set up a system under which countries can leave the eurozone. \nHe said: “Greece, I think they should have left in the beginning. They should have left in 2015. \n“We need to have support in the form of income transfers from strong countries to the weaker countries. Or, you need to allow weaker countries to leave. \n“I am not a political scientist, I don’t know about law so much but what we have devised in the EuroThinkTank - and this is also my personal thinking - is you should bring upon a transfer union and change treaties of the EU. \n“If every country has a referendum on a political union, if they accept, they go into a tighter union, if you say no - then you can leave.” \nThe economist believes the Union had the chance to address its problems with the British membership referendum - but leaders refused.
