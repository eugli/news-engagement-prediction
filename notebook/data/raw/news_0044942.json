There's growing speculation Grace is being groomed to succeed her husband. The president told interviewer Tazzen Mandizvidza that Grace was \"very much accepted by the people\". \nFor the first 15 minutes Mugabe spoke extremely quietly - perhaps not in a mutter, but certainly in a very tired voice. As the interview wore on, there were moments where he spoke more strongly. But there were long pauses as his voice fizzled out. \nHe said: \"I have been at it [as leader] for a longer period than anyone else and leaders will have to be you know, as it were, given time to develop.\" \nMugabe has been in power in Zimbabwe for nearly 37 years. Recently, there have been frequent questions about his physical fitness to lead Zimbabwe, given a notable stumble on the red carpet in 2015 and other times when he has appeared less than steady on his feet. \nThis interview will only intensify those questions. \nWatch the video below. \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
