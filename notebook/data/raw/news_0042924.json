Family celebration \nResidents said the man was a member of a family who live close to the scene of the shooting. \nThey said relatives had been gathering for a celebration when the attack occurred. \nMany came out of the house to try to help him after hearing the shot, neighbours said. Image copyright PA Image caption The victim was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries. \nThere have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, although all the previous incidents have been in the north of the city and not close to the Upperthorpe area. \nOn Monday, a 25-year-old man was seriously injured when he was shot in the street in the Shiregreen area. \nEarlier this month, shots were fired through the living room window of an elderly couple's home in the Southey Green area - an incident police believe was a case of mistaken identity. \nIn January shots were fired at houses in two separate incidents in the same street in High Green.
