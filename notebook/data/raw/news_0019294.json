My job is to tell the truth, deliver the facts and hold people accountable.\" 02/09/2017 05:07 am ET Rebecca Shapiro Senior   \nCNN’s Jake Tapper doesn’t seem to care that President Donald Trump actively dislikes his network. And the news anchor doesn’t think anyone else at CNN has a problem with it, either. \nIn an interview with “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert Wednesday, Tapper talked about CNN’s contentious relationship with the White House. Last week, Politico reported the Trump administration was “icing out” the network by refusing to send officials and spokespersons for interviews. On Tuesday night, Tapper had a fiery exchange with Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway in which he called out the White House for repeatedly calling CNN “fake news.” \n“What’s it like in the halls over there knowing that the president actively doesn’t like your network?” Colbert asked. “How do people feel over there?” \n“I don’t think anybody cares,” Tapper responded to applause. \nThe journalist said he didn’t think former President Barack Obama was a particular fan of his, either. \n“The job is to not be liked,” Tapper said. “My job is to tell the truth, deliver the facts and hold people accountable.” \nWatch Tapper’s full interview in the video below.
