While Hollis doesn’t anticipate any real shockers – “I don’t think anybody’s going to be really blown away with who the 16 are” – any tournament pecking order will bring scrutiny, and guaranteed hype. \n“The hype comes from criticizing 10 individuals who are on the committee, and I think that’s what it’s going to create,” Hollis said. “A hype of, `Boy, the committee got this wrong or that wrong.’ I guess that’s part of our job description. To absorb that criticism.” \nFrom where? \n“Coaches, media, wives, kids.” \n“I don’t think you put something out there for 100 percent acceptance. You understand there’s going to be criticism and differences of opinion, and that’s OK. At the end of the day, hopefully all the committee members will listen to what I call feedback, not criticism. And if there’s something there that’s helpful, they use it in their toolbox as they’re approaching March and the process that really matters. \nRELATED: When is Selection Sunday? | March Madness dates \n“Coaches will say things. Media will say things. Bracketologists will say things. While you don’t let them put their hand on the rudder, it’s OK to let them put some wind in your sail and kind of guide you in a direction maybe you didn’t think through.” \nSo what could possibly go wrong? \nWell, Hollis said, it’s important that everybody see what this is, and what it isn’t. Everything to come out Saturday is in erasable pencil. \n“The natural response in March will be, `Yeah, but back in February you said this.’ Well, the circumstances were different in February, and people need to understand that. This is a practice run based on the data we have. We’re not going to make any guesses, we’re not going to make any forecasts. Things are going to change by March, and there’s going to be different factors that come into play. \n“If you take a couple of weekends like we’ve had, it’s going to look dramatically different this weekend than it looked last weekend.” — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) February 6, 2017 \nNo, the NCAA won’t be releasing something every week like the College Football Playoff committee. “A lot more teams a lot more moving parts, a heck of a lot more games,” Hollis said. \nAnd no, there is no appetite to do the entire bracket. “It’d put us in a position where we’d have to almost become bracketologists and guess who’s going to win (conference) championships, and that’s not what we do.” \nAnd yes, Hollis appreciates that no past chair has ever been in this position. They’re all used to taking fire the second Sunday of March. But the second Saturday of February? \n“Joe Castiglione reminded me of that in a text yesterday,” Hollis said, of last year’s committee chair. \n“If it’s taking a little bit of heat to make the process a little better in the long-term, I think it’s well worth it. This is my last year on the committee. I can apply the heat next year.” Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:00:41.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
