Article continues below \nThe problem allegedly stems from the second year of the deal on offer, which Marca claim has been made optional by Real, as they are unsure whether he will be able to keep playing at his current level for that long. \nAnd because of this, the 33-year-old began hearing out other offers from the start of the season.
