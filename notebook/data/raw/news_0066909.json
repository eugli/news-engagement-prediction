Am I surprised that things like this can happen? No,' said Klopp. 'It is not only football. For me there have been a few strange decisions in 16-17: Brexit, Trump, Ranieri. Do I have to understand it all the time – obviously not. 'I have no idea why Leicester did this. Everyone could see the situation in the league, the situation in the Champions League – which we are not in. He is a really special person in this business, a really nice guy. I met him before when he visited me at Dortmund and we had a nice talk. 'He is a wonderful person. Maybe you have to go to Leicester and ask them why they did it. Does it change a lot for us? Not sure, we will see. I told the players at the beginning of the week Leicester now know exactly what the problem is and we should expect the best Leicester City. 'You saw the Champions League game and the reaction after they scored: it was like two different games before and after they scored. Obviously they needed this goal to get confidence back. We have to think about this side and that is difficult enough.' Klopp is preparing his players to face Leicester in the Premier League on Monday evening There have been stories of disharmony in Leicester's dressing room and Klopp has questioned whether those players still have the same hunger after defying odds of 5000-1 last season; how they respond against Liverpool, then, will be intriguing to watch. Klopp is aware there could be a backlash but he is more concerned on plotting Liverpool's route to a top four finish and having been refreshed by a training camp in La Manga, he wants to see his squad carry on from their dismantling of Tottenham on February 11. 'It depends on the players,' said Klopp. 'If I think back to 2011 we (Borussia Dortmund) became champions and we had not the best start in the next season. No I don't think so but it depends on the players. I am pretty sure Ranieri didn't change. He is too experienced for this. 'He found a perfect clue for this team last year - how to give them a plan - but I can't say what happened there. Probably the players have to show a few things and they want to, it is obvious to not let them. Things I have no influence on I cannot really think about. 'If we play our best we will be difficult to play against whoever. I saw their Champions League game and it was unbelievable the change in this one second when they scored a goal. 'Maybe they can keep this and then they have to make it not too easy for them to bring it on the pitch or to not let their confidence grow. We have to play our best football - that's what we have been working on for 15 days.'
