I felt immediately like I had aged.\" Image copyright Peanut Image caption Peanut connects parents like dates. \nPeanut is free to use and for the moment the focus is on building a community rather than accepting advertising - but that is not being ruled out in the future. \nMothers upload a profile and choose three badges which best describes them - including 'single mum', 'sleep deprived' and 'spiritual gangsta'. But the platform uses machine learning to work out what else mothers have in common with each other and what is a priority for them in order to match them. \nMs Kennedy says many women are already familiar with the dating format. \n\"There's this entire generation of women who met their partner on a dating app,\" she says. \n\"The tech is there - why hasn't it been accessible to us to use?\" \nThere is a growing market place for this type of introductory platform for parents, such as the Bubble app which hooks up parents with recommended babysitters, and Koru Kids which connects those seeking to share a nanny with those who have a nanny to share. Image copyright Mat Smith Image caption Sarah Hesz and Katie Massie-Taylor founded the parent connection app Mush in April 2016 \nSarah Hesz and Katie Massie-Taylor founded the mums' platform Mush in April 2016, and the app has so far had around 60,000 downloads and been used one million times, they say. \nBut it does not have a swipe format. \n\"It's more about browsing local mums based on your interests,\" said Ms Hesz. \n\"It's not about rejecting people.\" \nMush is also free to use but they have worked with \"brand partners\" including Johnson & Johnson and Unilever. \n\"We don't have a tech background - we've learned not to be afraid of that, we can manage a team of developers,\" said Ms Hesz, who said she met Ms Massie-Taylor in a playground and exchanged numbers with her because she was \"desperate for adult conversation\". \nParenthood, especially in the early days, can be a very lonely experience, she said, \n\"Mums are not very good at being open about the fact that we need friends,\" she added. \n\"Some of our users are making friends for life, others are just trying to make the day better.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:21:04.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
