She came out in the third quarter and played like a true champ scoring eight more points helping her team to a stunning 60-47 lead after the third quarter. \nNotre Dame rallied in the quarter but the Devils’ defense held while they shot 9-for-13 in the quarter as freshman sensation put up 13 of her team high 25 points and kept the Irish somewhat close. \nThe fourth quarter turned into a nail-biter after the Irish pressure defense started to rattle the winner causing them to turn the ball over five times causing the game to tighten. ND closed the gap to 71-66 on a long three ball by Leah Johnson, but it wouldn’t be enough as the Devils canned their free throws in the waning seconds of the contest to preserve possibly the biggest win in years for the Blue Devils. \n“My mom was fixing me up today so I could play tonight because I really needed to be here for my team,” said Grimes. “Actually, no I’ve never played that well against a bigger center like I did tonight. \n“I’m starting to get my handle up a little bit and my mid-range shots starting to fall, so hopefully if I keep dribbling like I have been I’ll able to play like this every game.” \nGrimes downplayed the baettle between herself and Porter. “I never thought of it as a battle between me and her; not at all. She’s a very good player and she’s going to be great only being a freshman. \n“This is the first time in beating them in a long time (actually it’s been since Dec. 22, 2011),” added Grimes. “It’s been a long, long time. But, we played great as a team and I’m really proud of my team. This feels really great that my teammates and I were able to win this one. It’s special.” \nThe first half started out with Ewing’s Mya Grimes going off for 10 points in the opening quarter and teammate Chibuzo Amano added six more leading the Blue Devils to a 22-16 in a game that started out being played at warped speed with nonstop action. \nNotre Dame point guard Hailee Jantorno helped keep pace for the Irish scoring six points followed by freshman Erika Porter’s four. \nThe second quarter was a tad more subdued as both defenses went to work. Still it was the home Devils who set the tone jumping out to a 33-22 lead with 4:10 left in the half when MyAsia Jackson made the move of the games in the pivot making the Ewing crowd come to their feet. \nNotre Dame fought back and went on a mini run closing out the half with Kayla Burnett hitting a long jumper, then forward Trinity Holmes nailed a long trey but Ewing still held on to a 37-28 lead at the break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:02:15.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
