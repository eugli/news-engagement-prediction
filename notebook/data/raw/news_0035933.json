He had sustained 117 separate injuries.\nHe had been attacked with weapons including two knives and a screwdriver, and had also been punched and kicked.\nMoss and Webster had been drinking and taking drugs at the house before they were joined by Mr Wild and an argument erupted.\nWebster and Moss are two violent, sickening individuals who have shown absolutely no remorse for what they did to Mr Wild...\nThe pair made every attempt to hide what they had done and I’m pleased that they have had their freedom taken away and will be behind bars for what will hopefully be the rest of their lives.\n– Detective Chief Inspector Dave Stopford, South Yorkshire Police Last updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Sheffield", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:34:25.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
