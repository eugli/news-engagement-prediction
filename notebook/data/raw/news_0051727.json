We need to escalate this problem and engage our government and encourage all citizens to unite and strongly condemn these killings,” George said. \nThis sentiment was echoed by Saptu’s leadership: “It is Saptu's submission that the safety situation on farms has now become a national priority and that all role-players, including government, must now act to avoid an extremely explosive situation and to stop the infringement of the right of life of farmers,” Saptu general secretary Ben van der Walt said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:18:28.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
