They ask me what I can tell them or what I can remember. But I don't remember anything.\n\"If you see how many people are here and I punch all their coupons, how can I remember them? It's not that I don't want to help,\" said the usher, who has only been working at KLIA2 for about three weeks.\nAccording to reports,   dictator Kim Jong-un, was attacked in the shopping concourse of the airport by two women who reportedly used a chemical spray to poison him.\nAt least one of them, a fair-skinned woman in a white top and blue denim skirt, was then seen getting into a taxi and being driven off.\nPolice are hunting for the two women.\nAt the airport Wednesday, Malaysian, South Korean and Japanese journalists swarmed the information counter on the third level departure gate, where Jong-nam reportedly collapsed after trying to seek help.\nStore tenants near the counter claim they did not notice anything amiss during the 8am incident.\nDirectly behind the counter, a Visit Malacca tourism exhibition booth was gearing up for a dance performance about an hour after Jong-nam reportedly collapsed.\nA tourism officer, who only gave his name as Ramlan, said he wouldn't have known that a man had been assassinated just a few feet from him if he had not read the news on Tuesday.\n\"On Monday, everything was normal. There were few people because it was early in the morning and no one seemed like they had just seen a man die.\n\"It was only around evening when I saw some police officers behind the counter, but I didn't think it was anything,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB) confirmed that \"an incident\" occurred at KLIA2 on Monday, but said it could not comment further as the matter is being investigated by police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:38:26.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
