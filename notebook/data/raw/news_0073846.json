I don’t know what happened.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/FS11XVo11y \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 Whatever behind-the-scenes mix-up led to that Moonlight-La La Land shake-up – in which Warren Beatty was somehow given a Best Actress envelope that had Emma Stone’s name on it and took that to mean her film La La Land won Best Picture over actual winner Moonlight – Emma Stone says her Best Actress card isn’t to blame. After rumors that presenter Leonardo DiCaprio placed her card back in the Best Actress envelope contributed to the confusion , Stone said after the ceremony that she was holding onto her card through the massive error (it also appears that PWC keeps two separate envelopes containing the name of each winner). “I was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time,” Stone told the press pool. “I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was — I had that card.”\nTags: awards season oscars 2017 emma stone moonlight la la land best picture More Emma Stone Says Her Best Actress Envelope Wasn’t To Blame   3 mins ago WATCH: Two Oscar Winners Missed the Ceremony Because of Trump’s Travel Ban Iranian director Asghar Farhadi and Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khateeb did not attend.\n11 mins ago Emma Stone Says Her Best Actress Envelope Not to Blame for Best Picture Shocker “I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was — I had that card.”\n21 mins ago WATCH: The Oscars Got Political Okay, it was mostly Jimmy Kimmel.\n30 mins ago The Moonlight Mix-Up, Plus Other Highs, Lows, and Whoas of the 2017 Oscars You’ll always remember where you were when Faye Dunaway said “La La Land.”\n1:09 a.m. Amazon and Netflix Just Won the First of What’s Sure to Be Many Oscars Both streaming services picked up wins Sunday night.\n1:06 a.m. Celebrities Reactions to Moonlight ’s Surprise Best Picture Oscars Win Moonlight was declared the Best Picture winner only after favorite La La Land was first announced.\n12:35 a.m. Moonlight  \nYesterday at 10:11 p.m. Watch Viola Davis, Inventor of Acting, Give an Impassioned Oscars Speech “So here’s to August Wilson who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.”\nYesterday at 10:09 p.m. The Walking Dead Recap: Welcome Home, Haircut Whether he’s truly turning into Dr. Evil or not, Eugene is finally worth watching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:46:59.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
