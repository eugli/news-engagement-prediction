Facebook removed the page late Thursday after dozens of members of the Montreal group Salam Alaikom flagged graphic content on Pégida’s site. \nLast week, just hours after the mosque shooting, another controversial anti-radical-Islam group took its page offline. \n“I can not live knowing that I may have involuntarily contributed to radicalizing someone,” wrote the administrator of Pas d’Islam radical et de charia au Québec. “Never will I forgive myself for having directly or indirectly contributed to the death of one or many human beings.” \nAlexandre Bissonnette — accused of murdering six men dead and wounding 19 — frequented right wing, anti-immigrant and white nationalist online forums. The mosque attack has raised questions about the role of social media in giving a platform for hate speech and extremism. \n“Pégida’s goal is to radicalize people and then wash their hands of it,” said Coraline Le Moyne, Salam Alaikom’s administrator. “These sites have an impact on people who, sadly, aren’t very educated and not particularly interested in learning about Islam. … They would post pictures of women with their throats cut, mosques burning and that sort of thing. It’s extreme. It’s hateful. \n“Having this site taken down isn’t a victory because another one will just pop back up. These people don’t understand the impact they have.” \nSalam Alaikom is a page dedicated to snuffing out Islamophobia online and Le Moyne says that fight has brought her face to face with members of nationalist groups. Last October, she attended a protest against a rally of far-right organizations like La Meute, Soldiers of Odin and Pégida. \n“I stood there face to face with them — these people who are so tough behind their keyboards — and I confronted them,” said Le Moyne, a practicing Muslim. “They told me to ‘go back to my country’ and to ‘take off my veil’ but I told them I was born here and I wasn’t going anywhere. Then they ran away.” \nSalam Alaikom has campaigned to have the Pégida page taken down for more than a year. But Le Moyne says Facebook’s rules against hate speech are too lenient. \nA Facebook spokesperson told the Montreal Gazette that the company won’t comment on this particular case. \n“There is no place for hate speech on Facebook,” the spokesperson said. “If someone reports hate speech on Facebook, we will review the report and remove the content if it violates our (community standards).” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:13:07.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
