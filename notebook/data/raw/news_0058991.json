The Owaisi brothers addressed two rallies in Pune prior to the election. \nThe Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had both fielded strong Muslim candidates in certain areas, keeping in mind likely threats from the party. \nThe party, however, failed to impress voters in Muslim-dominated areas, with the Congress retaining its traditional vote bank. \nThe Congress’ victory is considered significant as the Owaisi brothers had severely criticised Congress leaders for neglecting Muslims. \nPoll results indicate that Muslims voted either for the Congress or the NCP instead of the AIMIM. \nThe party made spectacular gains in Solapur, once a bastion of former Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde. The AIMIM had four members in the dissolved houses. The Owaisi brother have been frequent visitors to Solapur, which has a large population of Muslims. \nThe party also benefitted from the region’s geographical proximity to Andhra Pradesh, from where many Muslims migrate to the city. \nThe party’s victory in Vidarbha and Marathwada during the municipal council elections held two months ago was remarkable. \nREAD ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:07.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
