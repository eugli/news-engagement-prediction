Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Whether it is their speed as they scuttle across the floor, their furry legs or just the thought of being crawled over, spiders can strike fear into our hearts like few other things.\nBut don’t lose hope.\nThere are lots of things you can do to ensure your eight-legged housemates don’t send you screaming from your home. Here are 10 tips to prevent, manage and maybe even cure a fear of spiders...\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Share this video Watch Next 1. Don’t scare the children Next time you decide to pull a prank on a child with a plastic spider (or the real thing) just remember you might be instilling a fear that will haunt the rest of their lives.\nExperts believe some kind of spider-related trauma in childhood is the root cause of many an adult dislike of creatures which are largely harmless.\nAnd even though their rational brain knows there’s really nothing to be afraid of, that awful memory remains locked away in their heads.\nSo it’s best not to put it there in the first place.\nNo worries: Spider 2. Don’t watch horror movies Images of victims impaled on giant arachnid claws in sci-fi flicks like 1997’s Starship Troopers and armies of aggressive poisonous spiders in 1990’s Arachnophobia really don’t help matters.\nIf you didn’t have a phobia before these movies you may have one by the closing credits, and any existing fears will be even worse.\nEver since B-movies in the 1950s, film-makers have wanted us to think those little things scurrying across the carpet actually want to wipe out humanity.\nBut guess what? They don’t.\nGarden spider (Photo: Ervins Strauhmanis/Flickr) 3. Be at one with nature We really need to get out more, especially into the fields , woods and riversides that are teeming with our eight-legged friends. Previous generations would bump into spiders in all these places plus gardens and parks and get used to their presence in the process.\nBut thanks to our modern dependence on computers, TV, and our busy lives, we’re increasingly stuck indoors.\nThis problem even has its own name: Nature Deficit Disorder. It should be avoided at all costs.\nDon't worry: House spider 4. Logical thinking They ain’t the prettiest looking things, but the vast majority of spiders in Britain are totally harmless. So if you do have mild arachnophobia then just a little common sense could be the cure.\n“The vast majority of spiders in the UK have fangs which are only designed to kill insects,” says arachnid expert Lawrence Bee.\n“They aren’t strong enough to puncture human skin, let alone inject harmful venom into them.”\nSo remember this. A spider in your bedroom is not interested in nibbling your toes while you’re asleep. All it wants to do is eat and breed – though that second plan is not music to your ears.\nThink: Nothing to fear (Photo: Facebook) 5. Are you feeling sleepy? Hypnotherapy can have an astonishing effect on phobias and has converted devout arachnophobes into people who can handle a tarantula without flinching in as little as an hour or two.\nExperts in places like London Zoo can easily help you overcome the threat of spiders, which is usually more perceived than real. You’ll have to pay, but it’s a worthwhile investment.\nHarmless: Garden Spider 6. Rewire your brain Don’t worry, no surgery required but Neuro-Linguistic Programming is a tried and tested method for curing phobias.\nBy talking through and breaking down the reason spiders fill you with terror, therapists can help to retrain your brain and help you rethink those irrational fears.\nTiny: False black widow spider 7. The Phobia App Who knew? But all spider-haters should check out the Phobia Free App. It teaches arachnophobes how to use relaxation techniques, includes helpful gameplaying. It also makes you confront of images of spiders, from “cuddly” little ones right up to the most terrifying..\nThe result? A potential cure which is so effective the NHS has even approved it. See virtually-free.com\nUnusual: Lace Web Spider 8. In at the deep end... Gradual exposure to spiders is one answer, another is facing your fears head-on like Cassandra Tainsh of Leeds. When her local garden centre gave visitors the chance to get up close and personal with a tarantula, she volunteered.\nNow the former arachnophobe owns her own tarantula called Pandora and she’s happy for it to crawl all over her face. Cassandra has even built miniature furniture, including a TV stand, cooker and a dining room set to make Pandora feel at home.\nSometimes she even dresses her up in bows for photoshoots.\n“A lot of people I’ve shown the pictures to have said they used to be afraid like I was,” she says.\n“But the pictures I’ve taken have made them laugh and made spiders seem much less scary.”\nBrave: Cassandra Tainsh (Photo: Ross Parry / Yorkshire Evening Post) 9. Try eating them Seriously! You may have to travel a little but in places such as Cambodia, Venezuela and Papua New Guinea, where spiders are often on the menu, arachnophobia is rare.\nIn one area of Cambodia they even breed them in holes in the ground just so they can serve them up fried.\nIt’s in Europe and North America, where eight-legged meals are pretty rare, that we’re scared o the little critters.\nNothing makes you feel you have the upper hand like frying your nemesis and devouring it.\nTatt’s the way to do it...\nIf all else fails, there’s one last drastic option. Eric Rico Oritz, 24, of Florida really faced his fears this year when he cured his arachnophobia by having the image of a black widow spider tattooed on his face.\nHe explained his thinking: “It was just to, like, make me know, that that’s what I fear, but not to fear it. You know what I’m saying?”\nEr, not really and although this worked for Eric.... we really recommend you try Nos 1-9 first !\npoll loading Are you scared of spiders? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Read More Spiders A guide to common house spiders Where in the UK are the scariest ones?
