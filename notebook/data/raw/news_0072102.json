Five days ago, a Bengali family migrated to the city in search of employment. But the grandmother Hasinabibi and her granddaughter Sonali got separated from the family and lost their way, unknown to the other family members. Since the missing members could not speak any language other than Bengali, Ahmendabad police had a hard time locating them. However, a women's helpline informed the police that the grandmother and granddaughter were spotted wandering in the Ellisbridge area. After receiving the tip, PSI JS Kandoria's team reached Ellisbridge and with the help of an interpreter broke the language barrier to communicate with Hasinabibi and Sonali. The lost duo was then taken to Nawabnagar in Chandola area as it is home to a large number of Bengali migrant families. Their leader Hamidbhai Sheikh led police to Danilimda Sewage Farm, where Munirbhai Siddiqui, a worker at a scrap shop identified both Hasinabibi and Sonali. Rafiabibi also identified Hasinabibi as her mother-in-law and Sonali as her daughter. Family members informed that Jontumulla Mirzamulla had gone to the Vejalpur police station to file an FIR about his missing mother and daughter. But the family was reunited without any mishap, even before the FIR could be registered.
