SHARE Share on Twitter Link The front page of the New Straits Times showing an image purportedly of Kim Jong-nam moments after the attack. Photo: Supplied/New Straits Times \nPolice have not confirmed the authenticity of the footage. \nThe New Straits Times has also published a story on the video on YouTube. \nThe Star and the New Straits Times are two of is one of Malaysia's main media outlets which is government controlled. \nThe Star published the footage on Monday under the headline: \"Video clip, allegedly of Jong-nam's murder, appears on YouTube.\" \nMalaysian police have released only scant details of the attack on Mr Kim last Monday which has sparked a flurry of rumours, international intrigue and a diplomatic spat between Malaysia and North Korea, an isolated state under global sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs. \nMr Kim, who was about to fly to Macau, where he lived with a second wife and a son, suffered a seizure and died on the way to a hospital. \nPolice revealed on Sunday that four North Korean suspects in the assassination flew out of Malaysia within hours of the attack. \nPolice also want to question a fifth North Korean man they believe is still in Malaysia in a case that has sparked tensions between North Korea and Malaysia. \nAlready arrested is 47 year-old North Korean Ri Jong-chol, who has been identified in Malaysian media as a chemical expert employed by an IT company in Kuala Lumpur. \nTwo women, one from Indonesia and the other Vietnam, who allegedly sprayed fast-acting poison on Mr Kim at Kuala Lumpur airport, are also in custody, pending further investigations. \nThey have claimed they were duped into believing they were taking part in a television prank show, according to Indonesian police, citing information from Malaysia. \nPolice are also looking for two other people who are not suspects but who they believe can help with their inquiries. \nThe identification of five North Korean suspects strengthens suspicions of a long planned and well funded assassination plot by North Korea's spy agency. \nMr Kim had spoken out publicly about his family's dynastic rule of his isolated and nuclear-armed nation. \nSouth Korea claims that Kim Jong-un, the north's tyrant leader, had issued a \"standing order\" five years ago to kill his sibling who was a frequent visitor to Malaysia. \nOn Sunday, Malaysia's deputy national police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim showed reporters photographs of the four suspects aged 33, 34, 55 and 57 who had left Malaysia on regular – not diplomatic – passports last Monday. \n\"I am not going to disclose where they are,\" Mr Noor Rashid told reporters at a packed news conference. \n\"[The] next plan is to get them. We of course have international cooperation, especially with Interpol, bilateral involvement with the country involved… We will go through those avenues to get the people involved,\" he said. \nThe four men flew to Jakarta immediately after the attack and from there caught planes to Pyongyang via Dubai and Vladivostok, according to sources quoted in the Star Online. \nThe Star quoted the sources saying they appear to have taken a long route to shake-off authorities. \nHowever, if the suspects have reached North Korea, there appears little chance of them being brought to justice in Malaysia. \nNorth Korean officials have refused to confirm the identity of Mr Kim but have demanded the body be handed over, claiming it should have diplomatic immunity, and insisting there should be no autopsy or forensic tests carried out. \nThe New Straits Times has reported that the masterminds of the attack had been tracking 46-year-old Mr Kim's movements for about a year to establish his travel patterns. The report is unconfirmed. \nEarlier, Indonesian police, citing information from Malaysia, said one of two women arrested over the murder, Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian, believed she was taking part in a reality TV show prank. \nA Vietnamese woman Doan Thi Huong, Ms Siti and a man police said was Ms Siti's boyfriend are also being held in custody over the assassination. \nInvestigators have established that Ms Doan, who was wearing a white shirt emblazoned with \"LOL\", stayed in cheap hotels, carried a wad of cash and cut her hair in the days before the attack. \nMeanwhile, North Korea has said it will not accept the findings of any autopsy carried out on Mr Kim's body and accused Malaysia of \"colluding with outside forces\", a veiled reference to South Korea. \nMalaysia is insisting it must follow normal procedures in a murder investigation despite North Korea claiming the body should have the status of diplomatic immunity. \nThe first autopsy carried out over North Korea's objection proved inconclusive. \nA second was expected to be carried out on the weekend but no results have been made public. \nA toxicology report on Mr Kim's body could take up to two weeks, according to Malaysian Health Minister S Subramaniam. \n\"Normally it will take about two weeks to find out what was the cause of death ... Until we find something conclusive we will not be able to release the report,\" he said. \nPolice said the four North Korean suspects who had left Malaysia are: \nRhi Ji Hyon, 33, arrived in Malaysia on February 4, \nHong Song Hac, 34, arrived on January 31, \nO Jong Gil, 55, arrived on February 7, \nRi Jae Nam, 57, arrived on February 1. \n﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:13:36.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
