Bakerloo line: the extension will connect south east London with central \nWhere would the new stations be? \nThe plan for the extension includes four new Underground stations as well as improvements to Elephant and Castle. \nThere will be two new stations on Old Kent Road and two new interchanges. \nThe interchanges will be at New Cross Gate, already a London Overground and rail station, and Lewisham, which currently runs rail and DLR services. \nOld Kent Road \nTfL is proposing that one of the Old Kent Road stations (titled OId Kent Road 1 on the consultation) is positioned either on the junction of Mandela Way and Dunton Road or the junction of Old Kent Road and Dunton Road. Bakerloo Line Extension: Old Kent Road proposals Bakerloo Line Extension: Old Kent Road proposals 1/4 Old Kent Road 1 \nOption A: The station is on the junction of Dunton Road and Mandela Way (the red line indicated the work site). TfL 2/4 Old Kent Road 1 \nOption B: The station is on the junction of Old Kent Road and Dunton Road (the red line indicated the work site). TfL 3/4 Old Kent Road 2 \nOption A: The station is on the junction of Old Kent Road and St James' Road (the red line indicated the work site). TfL 4/4 Old Kent Road 2 \nOption B: The station is on the junction of Asylum Road and Old Kent Road (the red line indicated the work site). TfL \nThe consultation suggests the second station (titled Old Kent Road 2) should be either at the junction of Old Kent Road and St James’ Road or the interchange of Asylum Road and Old Kent Road. \nNew Cross Gate \nTube bosses are proposing to build a new Underground station at New Cross Gate, on the left of the existing station on New Cross Road. Proposals: The consultation sets out plans for adding an underground station to New Cross Gate (TfL) \nThe plans also include a shaft – which allows ventilation into the tunnels as well as an evacuation route – off Lewisham Way. \nLewisham \nThe Bakerloo line station at Lewisham is proposed to be built on Thurston Road – south west of the existing rail station. Lewisham: The proposed Underground station and work site (TfL) \nThere is also set to be a shaft built off Wearside Road which will accommodate for an overrun tunnel where trains will be parked. \nElephant and Castle \nThe plans also propose changes at Elephant and Castle station to “improve all journeys for customers” and reduce overcrowding during peak travel times. Public consultation: Proposed areas for a work site for Elephant and Castle ticket hall improvements (TfL) \nThese proposals include a larger ticket hall, wider Bakerloo line platforms and improved connections with the Northern line – as well as existing plans to upgrade the Northern line ticket hall. \nThe current consultation asks customers to choose between using existing infrastructure for the improvements or a new site. \nHow much will it cost? \nTfL has announced the expected cost of the project to be £3.1 billion. \nThere remained doubts over how the project would be paid for as, although it is set out as a capital scheme in the most recent TfL business plan, funding is not yet in place. The Northern line is also set to be extended \nTfL is expected to ask developers along the route to contribute and to lobby Government to keep more of the revenue raised through stamp duty and business rates. \nHow long will it take? \nTfL have announced the construction could commence in 2023 if funding is secured. Extension: The Bakerloo line will be extended as part of the new proposals (Shutterstock / littleny) \nAnd the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has committed that the date of completion will be 2028/2029 – rather than the initial date of 2030. \nThe consultation is open until March 21.
