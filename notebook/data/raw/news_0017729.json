And it extends, in some respects, the constitutional rights of Americans, that only Americans are persons in the United States, to the world.” And that the court “overreached.”\nCallan said, “I think what has surprised all the lawyers who have looked at this decision is that what the court said here is that the state of Washington, because it brings students into its universities, it brings customers into its restaurants, is the representative of virtually anybody across the world who’s not an American citizen. And it extends, in some respects, the constitutional rights of Americans, that only Americans are persons in the United States, to the world. … Why would they have standing to appear in our federal court, and argue that the US Constitution protects their rights? I think the court overreached.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n Breitbart TV , Immigration , 9th Donald Trump , Paul Callan", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/IanHanchett", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fcnns-callan-9th-circuit-overreached-and-applied-constitutional-rights-to-the-world%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=CNN%E2%80%99s+Callan%3A+9th+Circuit+%E2%80%98Overreached%E2%80%99+and+Applied+Constitutional+Rights+%E2%80%98To+the+World%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fcnns-callan-9th-circuit-overreached-and-applied-constitutional-rights-to-the-world%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=CNN%E2%80%99s+Callan%3A+9th+Circuit+%E2%80%98Overreached%E2%80%99+and+Applied+Constitutional+Rights+%E2%80%98To+the+World%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F09%2Fcnns-callan-9th-circuit-overreached-and-applied-constitutional-rights-to-the-world%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=CNN%E2%80%99s+Callan%3A+9th+Circuit+%E2%80%98Overreached%E2%80%99+and+Applied+Constitutional+Rights+%E2%80%98To+the+World%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:57:48.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
