Top researchers discovered the Moon is showered in oxygen ions \nNASA believes aliens would need liquid water, energy and organic material to live like mankind. \nLife on the Moon was ruled impossible because of its barren state – until now, science boffins claim. \nTop researchers discovered the Moon is showered in oxygen ions blasted from Earth during a five-day period each month. \nSolar winds coated the Moon in oxygen ions when it passes the Earth's magnetic shield. 13 signs of alien life Tuesday, 15th November 2016 Daily Star Pictures brings you 13 mind-blowing signs that aliens exist. 1 / 13 More than 40,000 Americans have taken out insurance against being abducted by aliens. \nGETTY SECRET: NASA believes aliens would need water and organic material to live “Earth's upper atmosphere consists of oxygen ions that are easily picked up by the solar wind and transported to the Moon” Terada \nAstrophysicist Kentaro Terada, from Osaka University in Japan, told EOS: \"Our new finding suggests that the Earth-Moon system co-evolves not only physically but also chemically.” \nWhen lunar rocks were studied in 2006, the oxygen levels were not consistent with the needs of life. \nBut now scientists propose oxygen ions from Earth could explain the chemical imbalance. \nTerada told the Atlantic: \"Earth's upper atmosphere consists of oxygen ions that are easily picked up by the solar wind and transported to the Moon. \nGETTY REVEALED: Oxygen levels were not consistent with the needs of life in 2006 \n\"Maybe some portion is implanted on the Moon, and some portion is lost into interplanetary space.\" \nThis comes as top scientists revealed dark streaks in the clouds could suggest life on Venus .
