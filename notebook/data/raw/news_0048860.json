The Netherlands - where people openly smoke marijuana \nTuesday's bill was put forward by an MP for the liberal party, D66, which has long supported a relaxation in the law. It passed with 77 votes to 72. \nBut it is thought unlikely to get through the Senate, or First Chamber, if the vote goes along the same party lines. \nDespite the bill's uncertain future, those working within the industry have welcomed it as a positive step. \n\"It is good news for the coffee shop industry because it will finally - if it passes the First Chamber - put an end to a lot of stuff we can't organise in a normal and transparent way,\" Joachim Helms, chairman of the Coffee Shop Union, told the Associated Press news agency.
