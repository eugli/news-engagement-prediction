A massive manhunt has been launched for the culprits. All scrap dealers and local criminals from the area have been detained. \nCrime and forensic teams have lifted fingerprints and other evidences from the spot, cops said. \nThe incident has instilled fear in the minds of local residents as Satyarthi's house is located in south Delhi's posh Alakannda area. \nKailash Satyarthi is a renowned Indian child rights activist and the winner of Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. \nHe is the founder of the 'Bachpan Bachao Andolan' (BBA), an organization dedicated towards the eradication of child labor and rehabilitation of the rescued former child workers. \nHe is believed to be in USA at present.
