Cranbrook and Castlegar also both broke snowfall records two days in a row.\n\"A lot of areas are getting hit pretty hard,\" said Jennifer Hay, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.\n\"It's going to go on for the next few days. We'll definitely have a few breaks in there, but we won't see a change in the pattern until probably Friday.\"\nMore snow, cold temperatures ahead for week Canada Post mail delivery slowed, stopped in parts of B.C. due to snow 'Never seen anything like it' The heavy snowfall has resulted in numerous highway warnings and closures.\nThe Kootenay Pass remains closed due to heavy snowfall — it isn't expected to reopen until 8 p.m. PT. Snow also prompted closures or travel advisories for Highways 1, 31, 95A, 97 and 99.\nHighway 3 is closed in both directions in several parts of the Kootenays, as of mid-day Monday, including Kootenay Pass. (Bob Keating/CBC)\nAnthony Arnold in Riondel on the east shore of Kootenay Lake describes it as \"tons and tons and tons\" of snow.\n\"I moved here in 1969 ... I've never seen anything like it,\" he said.\n\"I can't see out the window. All I see is snow. I just measured on the carport roof and it's 21 inches.\"\nNo mail, no school, multiple avalanche warnings Avalanche Canada has issued an extreme danger rating — the highest possible level — for the South Rockies. The danger rating for the Kootenays and Columbias remains at considerable and high.\nCanada Post has also suspended mail service to the Kootenay Pass , saying it is not safe to send people out to deliver mail.\nThe heavy snow also resulted in multiple school closures in the Kootenay region, including in Nelson, Rossland, Cranbrook and Castlegar.\nEnvironment Canada said most communities should expect more snow to fall before the system passes.\n\"Be prepared — maybe 10 centimetres per day in some regions. It's going to vary wildly, some areas will get just a trace and some areas will be seeing 20 centimetres or more,\" said Hay.\nWith files from Daybreak South .\nDaybreak South - CBC Kelowna", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/daybreaksouth"], "published": "2017-02-06T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:09:13.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
