He’s seductive. He smokes. \nAnd he might troll you on Twitter. \nTo draw more audiences to the less-than-pious new series about Pius, French network Canal+ launched “AiMEN.” Short for “Papal Artificial Intelligence,” this super-powered pope bot doesn’t just know all the verses in the Bible; it trots them out on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Dailymotion—whenever people need a little righteous reminding. \nThere’s plenty of conflict in The Young Pope, but most of it revolves around the character played by Law, an unusually young pope who may or may not succeed at modernizing Catholicism. \n“The Young Pope is portrayed as a modern and different kind of pope, so it felt appropriate to give him an online tool that would put him in touch with the public in a real-time and contextual way,” BETC Paris co-creative director Arnaud Assouline tells AdFreak. \nAnd the AI aspect of AiMEN is no joke. It’s powered by the same artificial intelligence that kicked Ken Jennings’ ass on Jeopardy. \n“Given our ambition to monitor 1 million online comments, IBM and Watson were perfect ‘partners’ for a project of this size,” says co-creative director Benjamin Le Breton. “That partnership allowed us to develop AiMEN, a powerful bespoke tool.” \n“We tried to figure out how [Pope Pius XIII’s] vision of the world, and his message, could fit into people’s lives,” adds Le Breton. “The end result allowed us to see how the AI reacted to real-time events, such as [soccer] games or political debates, when opinions can get heated.” \nIn addition to soccer and politics, the Pope even weighed in on a lady just trying to enjoy her pizza: \nTalk about a holy buzzkill. \n“AiMEN’s answers were increasingly relevant day after day,” Assouline says. “We programmed the AI this way to see if a machine could feel compassion, like a human. And even more, like a pope.” \nAccording to both creative directors, AiMEN benefits from a natural language classifier powered with machine-learning algorithms, combined with a tone analyzer that uses linguistic analysis to understand the emotional context of conversations. \n“It was also funny to see how a 2,500-year-old text, the Holy Bible, could still be relevant in our modern and hyperconnected world, and show its timelessness in contemporary issues,” Le Breton observes. \nPer Canal+, “AiMEN” produced 1 million replies on social and reached 4 million people. The channel boasts that this is the best launch ever for a series in France. \nFor those with a healthy skepticism of the “Results” portion of a case study, don’t worry—Pope Pius XIII came to the rescue one last time. \nCREDITS Brand Managers: Audrey Brugere, Jordane De Villaret, Christopher Marchand Agency: BETC Agency Managers: Guillaume Espinet, Elsa Magadoux, Alexis Delwasse, Peter Feurmour Executive Creative Director: Stephane Xiberras Creative Directors: Benjamin Le Breton, Arnaud Assouline Art Director: Julien Vergne Lead Producer: Bao Tu Ngoc Assistant Producer: Josselin Bondoin Lead Producer: Bao Tu Ngoc Head of Activation Strategy: Julien Leveque Production Company: Make Me Pulse Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:08:25.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
