I loved it . . .” \nWolters has excelled as a catcher due in part to the athleticism that made him a middle-infield prospect in the Indians organization. But instead of flashing leather up the middle, Wolters is using his quick hands to help the Rockies pitching staff. \n“His hands are unbelievable,” starter Tyler Chatwood said. “You throw him a pitch, and his hands are so quick that you can’t tell if you barely missed (the strike zone). It’s fun throwing to him.” \nWith so much still to learn at a position with such large responsibility, Wolters is trying to keep things simple. \n“I just worry about catching it and making it look good, that’s my motto,” Wolters said. “I try to prepare myself and help the pitcher out. They already have such a tough job, so I just try to make their job a little easier.” \nIf Wolters is to put his imprint on the Rockies, which he believes he will, it won’t be due to his offense or even his impressive defense. It will be because of his willingness to embrace the position change. \n“A lot of times when you take position players and you change positions, there’s not a complete buy-in,” Black said. “But he has bought in on this, and he has ran with it with a full head of steam. \n“It’s been great to see, in a short period of time, him become the receiver, the blocker and just (show) the feel he has behind the plate . . . He looks like he’s been catching his whole life. It’s great to see, and he’s going to continue to get better.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:45:49.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
