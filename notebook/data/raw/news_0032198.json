The Playboy problem: has the brand ever endangered women? Read more \n“Today we’re taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.” \nPlayboy scrapped nudes for the January/February 2016 issue, which featured Pamela Anderson on its cover. “The question everyone will likely be asking is, ‘Why?’” a statement in October said , announcing the change. “Playboy has been a friend to nudity, and nudity has been a friend to Playboy, for decades. The short answer is: times change.” \nThe publisher decided to return to business as usual after finding that while “no nudes” permitted greater ability to display the magazine on newsstands, it did not offset a fall in subscription sales. \n“I said when they dropped the nude spreads it would be a big mistake,” said industry analyst Samir “Mr Magazine” Husni. \n“Nudes were the brand, so if one day you remove them, then you technically kill the brand image. Playboy with no nudes was an oxymoron. So this is a step in the right direction.” \nUsing the marketing headline “Naked is normal”, Hefner called the return of naked women a “remarkably special moment personally and professionally”. \nIn an essay titled The Playboy Philosophy, Hefner insisted many had missed his father’s original intention – “to promote a healthy conversation about sex while also encouraging dialogue on social, philosophical and religious opinions”. \nHe claimed that “many misinterpreted that message or missed it entirely”. Under his new Playboy philosophy , the magazine would be “swinging back to tradition”.

No it cannot. It needs innovation not renovation. With Hugh on the way out, and under the creative leadership of Cooper, it will have a better chance to succeed, and to introduce an new idea of what it could be.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:50:40.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
