Chuck Schumer spoke out against President Trump’s executive order on immigration and called it “mean spirited and un-American”? And the tears. Who could forget those crocodile tears? \nPresident Trump questioned the validity of Schumer’s tears, and so did I. After all, Schumer actually suggested pausing the flow of Syrian refugees after the Paris massacre in 2015. He didn’t shed a tear then. I kid you not. Here’s the original report from The Hill :  0'); }); \nSen. Charles Schumer (N.Y.), the third ranking member of the Senate Democratic leadership, on Tuesday said it may be necessary to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nRepublicans immediately seized on Schumer’s comment, which breaks with other Democrats who have argued against halting the program.  1'); }); \nSchumer, however, declined to take the option off the table ahead of a special briefing scheduled for Wednesday afternoon on the process that is now used to vet refugees entering the United States. \n“We’re waiting for the briefing tomorrow, a pause may be necessary. We’re going to look at it,” he said. \nThat’s how I know those tears were fake. \nMoving on. Schumer recently spoke to the cackling women of “The View” and swore his “fake tears” were real. They were totally real. He cried during “Free Willy” too! googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); });  2'); }); \"I care about immigrants.\" @SenSchumer responds to Pres.

Tears of joy. \nOn a serious note, I hate how Schumer constantly implies that his political opponents don’t care about immigrants. That’s not true. Asking them to come here legally is NOT hateful, and keeping terrorists out of this country isn’t anti-immigrant.
