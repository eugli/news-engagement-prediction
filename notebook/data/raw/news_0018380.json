It also announced an opening date of summer 2017. Sandra Pedicini ’s Avatar land at Disney’s Animal Kingdom will open May 27, and the Star Wars land under construction will open at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in 2019.\nChief Executive Officer Bob Iger told analysts today that Pandora: The World of Avatar at Disney’s Animal Kingdom has “an extremely unique design and architecture. It really does make you feel you’re in Pandora.” \nIt is “the biggest new land we’ve opened in Florida in a very long time. I think that’s good for the whole business down there…. We really believe in the coming years the interest in Avatar is only going to grow as those movies enter the marketplace. We can’t quantify it but we think this is big potential.” \nDisney released the news at the same time it reported its theme parks brought in fewer people during the quarter ending Dec. 31 compared with the previous year. \nParks and resorts revenues still increased 6 percent because of visitors spending more on tickets, food, and hotel rooms. Operating income growth increased 13 percent \nDisney said attendance reflected the prior-year benefit of Disneyland’s 60th anniversary celebration and the impact of Hurricane Matthew, which forced Walt Disney World to close for a day. \nOverall, The Walt Disney Co. reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55, a 5 percent decrease from the previous year. Disney’s revenue of $xx missed analysts’ expectations. \nAnalysts expected fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.49 per share on $15.26 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. \nWhile revenue was up for the theme parks, it was down in other segments including media networks, consumer products and studio entertainment. \n\n\nspedicini@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5240; Twitter @SandraPedicini \nNew renderings of the \"Star Wars\"-themed lands coming to both Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland debuted on ABC's Disneyland 60th anniversary special Feb. 21, 2016.
