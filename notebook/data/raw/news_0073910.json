The Lady Spikers upped their mark to 5-1 while also extending the Lady Warriors’ losing streak to six for a 0-6 slate. Lady Spikers head coach Ramil De Jesus said his team has a newfound mean streak during their unbeaten run as they have not dropped a set for the past three games. ADVERTISEMENT “They want to win more than ever, because it would be really difficult to come back if you give your opponent any ounce of confidence,” said De Jesus, whose team’s last loss was against league-leader University of the Philippines. “It’s difficult to matchup against a confident opponent.” Kim Dy, who has been La Salle’s leading scorer this tournament, led her squad once again with 12 points while Tin Tiamzon had 11. Mary Anne Fernandez had nine points to lead UE. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:59:19.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
