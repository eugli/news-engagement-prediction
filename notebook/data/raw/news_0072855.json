The site’s motto reads: “News from the real America, where the majority rules.” \nWhile conservatives have condemned the “Hillary Beat Trump” site as “fake news,” the site’s founder told The Washington Post on Saturday that the site is satire, deliberately intended to get under the skin of Trump supporters who do not enjoy being reminded of the fact that Clinton defeated Trump in the popular vote by a record 2.8 million — most ever for a candidate who did not win the presidency. Trump, of course, captured the White House by winning enough states, some by margins of under one percent, to take a majority of Electoral College votes.

But she did share a sampling of emails that she has received from Trump supporters who apparently cannot stop clicking on the satirical “alternate reality” site whose online mission statement declares , In the midst of a Constitutional crisis, this is our response. Long live the true president, Hillary Rodham Clinton.” \n“You can always find your paradise in heaven,” one email revealed to The Post read. “Its (sic) just one bullet away.” \n“Your dad must have abused you while mom watched, right? YES Liberalism IS A METAL DISORDER and YOU ARE POOF!” another Trump fan wrote. \n“I know in your fake world she won but in the real world she did not. To the people who made this Web page go get a real job like the rest of real Americans,” said a third email turned over by the site’s founder.
