Remember‚ Palacios has loved this team with his whole heart. So for him to get six goals won’t sit well with him \n“He has been here for years now‚ so he was not feeling well at all‚” Mhlongo said‚ explaining Palacios’s absence from the field for the final eight minutes of the game once play resumed. \nMhlongo refused to blame Pirates’s players for the thrashing. \n“Look we can’t blame the boys. Sundowns were good on the day and they deserved to win.” \nAsked what Bucs could say to their fans‚ Mhlongo replied: “To say sorry – what else can you say. And we can say sorry with the mouth‚ but the next game should say sorry to them by winning it. \nOn how Pirates‚ now firmly entrenched in the bottom half of the table in 10th place‚ can somehow rescue their season‚ Mhlongo said: “Look when you’re down‚ you can’t fall any more. The only thing you can do is to stand up and move forward. \n“Six goals in one game is not acceptable‚ never mind two. But what can you do? All you can do is move forward for our supporters‚ to say sorry. \n“If your house is burnt down you must use cement and rebuild it.” \nBucs gave debuts in defence to left-back Marc van Heerden and centreback James Okwuosa. The latter particularly had a torrid first game in a Bucs jersey. \n“We thought Van Heerden has more quality than [Thembela] Sikhakhane‚” Mhlongo said of the decision to field the new players. \n“Obviously today they didn’t play that well. But we acquired them because we believe in them.” \nMhlongo said Pirates showed character coming back for the final eight minutes and pushing to score a consolation goal. \n“It shows humbleness and courage and being apologetic to the supporters to come out and still try at least to get a goal back. \n“For me‚ I’m proud of the boys to have come back out after such a tragic moment where we had supporters fighting‚ and trailing by six goals. \n“So credit to them. At least they are man enough to stand up for what’s happening.” \nBucs will surely face a heavy fine from the PSL for the conduct of their fans at Loftus. \n- TMG Digital/TMG Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:26:20.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
