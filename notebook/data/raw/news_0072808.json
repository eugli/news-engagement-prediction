No matter what spiritual path you have chosen to walk, in order to be more spiritually aware, set aside time to strip away the unnecessary tradition or dogma and in an ultimate distillation the truth will be found. You know all things, each of you holds the answers and yet the fragmentation of yourself erects barriers to becoming whole and to being. It is this fragmentation that separates us from spirit and raises these kind of spiritual questions. Who am I? Why do I feel something is missing in my life? Is this all there is? Isn't there something better? \nSpiritual awareness or spiritual awakening is the process by which we begin to explore our own being in order to become whole and reunite our spirits with our physical bodies in a commonality of purpose. Being on the Spiritual Path \nNo matter whether you are just starting on your search or have been an invertebrate traveler on the spiritual awareness path, the answers you seek have always been with you. Perhaps in your seeking spiritual awareness you have been seduced by a process and simply not allowed yourself time to become aware. Put aside all restrictions and limitations and allow yourself to simply be. In this moment now look neither back nor forward and allow yourself to see your spirit. It is you, there, awaiting your rediscovery. \nSpirit is always within us yearning to be once again given freedom to be and to become a whole part of each of us. It is not necessary to struggle, neither physically nor spiritually. It is your struggle that leaves you confused and alone. Your purpose, that which you seek, is there for you now and there are many paths to help you become whole. Becoming Whole \nBecoming whole is simple, unique to you, and yet others have trodden similar paths and may be of assistance to you as you travel just as you will be of assistance to them. \nOften by participation in a spiritual awareness retreat you can remove yourself from the mundane, your everyday and allocate the time for yourself in which you may really be still . \nIn a still environment you are freed to look at your signposts and perhaps take a look in perspective at the road maps to awareness others have developed. You may choose to take the direction, listen to your own signs and those of people who have gone before, helping you discover your truths, or continue to struggle and repeat the lessons endlessly. Listen to Your Heart \nStop! Be still! Listen to your heart and the love you have for self and others and know your truth. Put aside the seduction of mind and the glamour of this or that option and truly listen to you, yourself. You will know the essence of truth when you allow your spirit to be. \nTake time now to meditate , for in meditation you empower your spirit to be. As thoughts arise, acknowledge them and put them aside but allow them no energy. Sit and observe that you are spirit, you are mind, and you are physicality. Observe your mind, separate, observe your body, separate, and observe your spirit, your essence and your essential being. You have the answers within and they may not fulfill your expectations. Put aside expectations and your spirit will fill you with love beyond all previous understanding. You will be free. \nHow? That's not easy I hear you say. Not true, it is as easy as you are willing to allow it to be and as hard as your clutch to the known and familiar will make it. \nMind and physicality will not easily surrender to your spirit just because you have chosen to increase your spiritual awareness. Others have trodden this path, some, a few, have seen the clarity of truth that is a distillation of the essential you. Seek them out wherever you might find them and use their knowledge to help you light the way of your own path. \nYou are your spirit ; it is only your mind that is holding you back in fulfilling your truth and becoming all you want to be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:24.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
