Speculation was rife about whether the Sena would team up with the Congress (31) to reach the magic mark of 114 in the 227-member civic body. \n\nState Congress president Ashok Chavan was non-committal, but a former Congress MP told TOI the Congress would not hesitate to support the Sena in the mayoral poll if it withdrew from the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. \n\nThe ex-MP said the Sena had approached senior Cong ress leaders in New Delhi. But some Congressmen feel it will not be a simple decision given the ideological differences. Even as Shiv Sena insisted on its nominee for the Mumbai mayor's post, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari said while both sides had no alternative but to work out a power-sharing arrangement, the relationship must reflect mutual respect. \n\nA day after BJP finished two seats behind Sena, the \"frenemies\" circled each other warily as the result left both well short of numbers to stake claim to the mayor's post. But the dilemma is particularly acute for Sena, which is under pressure to ensure that it heads the corporation. \n\nGadkari suggested the two sides needed to reach an understanding, but made it clear that the terms of the relationship must be clear and Sena's penchant for attacking PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah was unacceptable. \"If there has to be friendship with us (BJP), there has to be a check on writings in Saamna. How will there be friendship when Saamna daily writes insulting things about the PM and our party president?\" the road transport and highways minister said. Sena sources claimed there were informal approaches from BJP to initiate dialogue to explore a power-sharing arrangement. BJP sources said it was necessary to work out terms of governance in view of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis 's poll pledge to ensure enhanced transparency in the corporation's functioning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:45:55.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
