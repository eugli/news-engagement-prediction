On Sunday night, yet another Disney song is in the running for an Oscar. If it wins, the guy who wrote it will have accomplished a feat only 12 other people have: an EGOT (an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony). \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda is nominated for writing \"How Far I'll Go,\" from the Disney animated film \"Moana,\" about a young Polynesian princess. For Miranda, this Oscar stuff is his childhood dream come true. Related: How 'Moonlight' became the little film that could and made it to the Oscars \"I'm a movie dork, and I'm a big Oscar dork too,\" he tells ABC News. \"I was the very specific kind of nerd that would memorize Billy Crystal 's musical monologues...so, to be a part of that rigamarole is a thrill, and then also to bring my mom as my date -- we used to watch the Oscars every year together.\" \"How Far I'll Go\" represents Moana's desire to pursue her dreams, even if danger lies ahead. To gain inspiration, Lin-Manuel said he had to revisit his past. \"I actually went to my parent's house [in New York City], locked myself there overnight and wrote the song,\" he says. \"I wanted to get in touch with that 16-year-old me, who wanted a life in the movies and in theater,\" he explains. \"And the distance between 200th St. and that is so impossibly far -- it's about as far as Moana from her ultimate goals.\" Miranda's competition includes Justin Timberlake , Sting and the team who wrote the songs for \"La La Land.\" Tune into ABC on Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST to see if Miranda gets that EGOT.
