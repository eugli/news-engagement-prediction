His Dallas-based company Alterra International is developing what could be the first Scion hotel to launch in the country in 2019. \"Now it's an honor and privilege to work with his organization.\" \nThe Trump Organization announced plans for the new Scion brand last fall before Donald Trump was elected president. The new hotels will charge a lower room rate than the signature brand. \nThe $50 million project will be funded by overseas financiers, Sarimsakci said, including partners in Turkey, Kazakhstan and Qatar. \nHe added that he could not yet disclose more information about those investors. \nSarimsakci told CNNMoney that he's been working with the Trump Organization for a year and a half to bring a Scion hotel to market. Renderings for the proposed Scion hotel, an offshoot of the Trump Hotels brand, in Dallas, Texas. Developers hope to complete the project by 2019. \nThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment about the new development Thursday. \nLast week, Trump Hotel CEO Eric Dazinger told the Wall Street Journal that the company had signed 17 letters of intent with potential Scion hotel owners across the United States. Dallas was mentioned as one of those projects. \nSarimsakci said he had spoken with the Trump Organization about potential Scion projects in Turkey, Georgia and Iraqi Kurdistan. \nBut the international plans were scuttled after Trump became president and the company announced a moratorium on overseas deals because of conflict of interest concerns. \n\"I have people banging on my door, and I have to tell them it can't happen,\" Sarimsakci said. \"I am bummed.\" \nRelated: Trump's tangled web of businesses \nAlterra struck a deal to develop the property on a 40,000-square-fooot parking lot in downtown Dallas, which it is buying from Hamilton Properties, a local developer. \nLarry Hamilton, the founder and CEO of that company, said the closing is scheduled to happen at the end of the summer. \nSarimsakci said he never spoke with Donald Trump during the process. The president pledged last month to give his adult sons control of his company, though he would not sell his ownership stake. \nThe Trump Organization also hired an ethics adviser to review any decisions that could pose a conflict with Trump's role as president. \nThat adviser, Washington lawyer Bobby Burchfield, did not respond to a request for comment from CNNMoney.   4:28 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:34:28.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
