He said Conway made a “clear violation” of ethics rules by pushing the brand during her interview, which took place from the White House briefing room, making it of \"official capacity.\" \nThe letter notes lawyers for the White House and OGE spoke on Feb. 9 — the day of Conway's interview — and that the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Oversight Committee asked OGE to follow up. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that Conway has been \"counseled,\" but the OGE said it has yet to receive any guidance on what if anything happened as a corrective action. The OGE is requesting that White House lawyers tell them in writing by Feb. 28 what they've done about the matter. \nOn Feb. 9, Conway encouraged viewers watching Fox News to purchase Ivanka Trump's fashion collection, saying, \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff.\" \nShe added, \"I'm going to give it a free commercial here, go buy it today.\" \nHer comments came one day after President Donald Trump tweeted that his daughter \"has been treated so unfairly\" by Nordstrom, after the retailer said it would stop carrying her brand beginning in the fall, citing declining sales. #BREAKING : U.S. Office of Government Ethics Calls on White House to Discipline #KellyanneConway pic.twitter.com/nixmDhMc6Q ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:49:19.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
