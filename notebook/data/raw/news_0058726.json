The absence of this feature, long held as sacred by the community, caused a great deal of ire to be aimed at Microsoft and developer 343 Industries. But that won't happen again, because Halo 6 and every other 343-developed game will have splitscreen going forward. \nStudio head Bonnie Ross confirmed the news today at DICE (Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) 2017. She called the decision to leave out splitscreen from Halo 5 \"painful\" for the company. \"It erodes trust with the community,\" she said. \"[Weâ€™ve had a] lot of learnings from that, and I would say for any FPS going out forward we will always have split screen going forward.\" \nHuzzahs all around, says I. Now if we can do something about these AI squadmates - seriously Linda, I gave you a Sniper Rifle, why are you running toward the bad guys - then we'll be all set for Halo 6 or whatever it ends up being called when it's officially announced. \nSeen something newsworthy? !
