I’ve learned that through the year and why these guys are in so many positions like this. They treat them as opportunities. We treat them as opportunities. You can’t take them for granted and I think that’s why we’re here. We’ve earned that.” \nPatriots coach Bill Belichick compared Long to Randy Moss, Corey Dillon, Bryan Cox and other players who have left bad teams and welcomed the change in New England. Long is one game away from vindicating his decision to go to New England.
