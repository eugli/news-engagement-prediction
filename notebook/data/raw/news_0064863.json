And now we have some more details about the phone. According to a new report, the re-imagined 3310 will have broadly the same design but will be slimmer and lighter. \nThe report also confirms that the handset will remain a featurephone with physical keyboard (size of the keys will be adjusted though), adding that it will sport a larger color display compared to the 84 x 84 monochromatic unit that was there on the original model. \nNo word on whether or not the battery will be removable. Color options for the new Nokia 3310 will include red, green, and yellow.
