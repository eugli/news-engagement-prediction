The owner does not want you here. It’s against the law,’” sheriff’s spokesman Rob Keller said. “We said, ‘It’s your responsibility now. We have warned you.’” \nMost were being charged with criminal trespassing. They were still being booked Wednesday evening and being shipped to jails around the state, Keller said. \nThe new camp, which protesters called “Last Child Camp,” is near Oceti Sakowin camp, the largest settlement of pipeline opponents. That encampment, however, is on federal land. \nThe Standing Rock Sioux, which for months encouraged supporters to join the fight against the 1,172-mile pipeline, asked campers to leave to avoid spring flooding and offered those who stayed an alternate location on their reservation. \nThe tribe has argued that the $3.7-billion pipeline, which is nearly complete, threatens drinking water and violates tribal rights established under an 1857 treaty.

Photos showed a snowy landscape with protesters, or “water protectors” as many prefer to be called, squaring off against officers in riot gear.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has v owed to challenge Trump in court.
