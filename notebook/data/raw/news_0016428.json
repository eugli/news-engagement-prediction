(Ian Harte)\nIn the Louisbourg area, the long-eared owl made an appearance, captured on camera by resident Ian Harte.\nThough the owls are found in Nova Scotia year-round, they are scarcely seen, said Dave Harris, a retired wildlife biologist.\n\"I can sometimes go a year or two without seeing one,\" he said, adding the species is smaller than a barred or great horned owl.\nAnother unusual sighting — especially for this time of year — was enjoyed by Rod Gale of South Bar and Joan Mills of Prime Brook, who said they each spotted a pine warbler.\nTwo people in the Sydney, N.S., area have recently seen this type of bird, known as the pine warbler. (CBC/Shift)\nIn both cases, they caught sight of the little yellow bird in a group of chickadees they were feeding.\nPine warblers are permanent residents of the southern U.S., according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, but breed in southeastern Canada in the warmer summer months.\nThe Bird Hour is heard the first Monday of every month on CBC Radio in Cape Breton.\nwith files from Information Morning Cape Breton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:05:14.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
