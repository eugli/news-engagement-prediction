It is something that of course we don’t have enough. \n“And the ones with a history of success where that belongs to their natural habitat – [Wayne] Rooney, [Michael] Carrick, who else? Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], but [not] in our club. Antonio Valencia and not much more.” Mourinho has also conceded defeat in the race for the title \nM ourinho’s point is slightly disingenuous. After all, club captain Rooney alone has won five league titles – all with United – while Ibrahimovic has won the league in 13 of his past 15 seasons with six different elite clubs, across four countries. \nBut while the Swedish international has enjoyed unbridled success in Holland, Italy, Spain and France, Mourinho points out that the Premier League differs hugely in one key area – an area which goes some way to explaining why Mourinho, and David Moyes and Louis van Gaal before him, have struggled to continue the success enjoyed by Sir Alex Ferguson. \n“That is the new football,” said Mourinho. “When previously you were speaking about Sir Alex’s time, this is not Germany. Pick your Man Utd team to play Leicester \n“In Germany, Bayern Munich starts winning the league in the summer. They go to Borussia [Dortmund] every year and buy their best player. One day they go there and [Robert] Lewandowski. The next year, they go there, Mario Götze. The next year they go there, [Mats] Hummels. So they win the league in the summer. \n“Do you think I can go to Tottenham and bring two Tottenham players to kill Tottenham? I can’t. I cannot go to Arsenal and bring the two best Arsenal players. I cannot go to Chelsea and bring two of the players that I love very very much. That time is over. \n“That time is over so the situation of starting being champion by attacking your direct opponents in this country is over. It is over and if you get a player from these clubs, you get a player that club doesn’t want to keep. You cannot hurt any more your direct opponents. \n“We are growing up this season in relation to last season. Do you know what is the problem? The problem is the others are also getting stronger because previously when one of the big clubs is getting stronger, one of the other big clubs is getting weaker. \n“In this moment, we get stronger but the others, they get stronger and get stronger and get stronger and they are powerful to keep their strength. You cannot attack your rivals any more. \n“Obviously Real Madrid sells what they want to sell, Barcelona sells what they want to sell, Bayern Munich sells what they want to sell, Paris St-Germain sell what they want to sell. So then it is more difficult to have a very good market and it is very good to feel we are improving and the other ones are going down. We are improving but the other ones are also improving so it makes it more difficult for the ones who are behind to grow up again. It is difficult, it takes more time.” \nF or all the challenges described by Mourinho, he still has one advantage over his five peers above him in the Premier League table this morning, as the only manager in the country still active in four competitions. Mourinho can smile about the fact he is the only manager still active in four competitions \nT he league, in which they entered the weekend 14 points behind leaders Chelsea and four points behind a Champions League place, is beyond him but, given his pedigree, it would take a bold man to bet against Mourinho ending his first season with United by winning one of the three cup competitions in which he is involved. \n“We have to try despite everything, we have to try,” he said. “We cannot win the Premier League, that is very obvious. I don’t know how many points or matches Chelsea have to lose or victories we have to make in a row, but in another three competitions we can win. We are there. \n“We have a 50 per cent chance of winning the League Cup, we won the Community Shield and we are in the last 16 [of the FA Cup] and last 32 of the Europa League. We have to fight for these competitions, yes.” \nAs for United’s eventual league standing, Mourinho was not of a mind to place pressure on himself by stating that a top-four finish would be a measure of success. Rather the United manager believes the five rivals above him in the league table form a clique against whom he will compare his own club and measure their development. The 20 best Premier League forwards of the season so far \n“No. Arsenal has to be, Tottenham has to be, Chelsea has to be, Manchester City has to be, Liverpool has to be,” said Mourinho when asked whether league position will be a measure of his team at season’s end. \n“I honestly think six teams have to be and some are better prepared than others, with more consistent work over the past years. So I don’t think you can even measure it by that. \n“I want to have that feeling and I want the players to have that feeling. The feeling that I wanted is that we have to be champion and play with that in mind, even if we don’t have many chances. \n“It is evolution in the mentality for those guys who don’t have that for a few years, they are in a different zone of the relation between the dimension of the club and what they feel they can achieve. There is an empty space there and I have to fill that space with lots of work, with another transfer window in the summer. Step by step we have to fill that space.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:26:01.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
