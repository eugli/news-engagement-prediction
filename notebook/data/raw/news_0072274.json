He doesn’t appear to know the shark is approaching. \nWhen the surfer starts kicking his right foot in preparation to catch the wave, the sudden movement scares off the great white shark. \nRELATED: Great white shark breaches behind surfer riding wave in amazing photo \nIt isn’t clear how the warning system works once a shark is spotted by a drone, or whether those riding waves in this video were made aware of the shark’s presence. But hopefully the system works. \nNew South Wales has experienced a sharp increase in shark attacks, prompting officials to try various methods to prevent them. In the past two years, there’s been 27 shark attacks with one fatality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:26:45.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
