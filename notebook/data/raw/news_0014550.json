The specifications sheet of the hatchback was earlier revealed, which shows that Baleno RS will be powered by the 1.0 litre Boosterjet engine. Once launched, the Baleno RS will compete with the likes of the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI and Punto Abarth and like the standard Baleno, the RS version would be sold only through the Nexa Dealership. Here are the most important things to know about the upcoming performance hatchback \nEngine The Baleno RS will be powered by a 1.0 litre three cylinder Boosterjet petrol engine unit that will produce 100 hp of power at 5,500 rpm and 150 Nm of torque between 1,700 and 4,500 rpm. The engine will be mated to a 5-speed manual transmission and this is the company's first turbocharged petrol engine in India. In comparison, the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI is powered by a 1.2 litre turbocharged petrol engine that produces 104 hp of power and 175 Nm of torque. The unit is mated to 7-speed DSG automatic gearbox. Although, there won't be an automatic transmission in the Baleno RS immediately, the company may offer one later. \nDesign The Baleno RS will carry the same design language like the standard versions of the Baleno, however, there will be some cosmetic changes. These changes may also include projector headlamps with LED daytime running lamps, LED tail lamps, integrated turn indicators on ORVMs (Outside rear View Mirrors) and 16 inch alloy wheels. In addition, the hatchback will get the revised bumpers and rain sensing wipers, automatic climate control, reverse parking sensors with camera. \nDimensions The Baleno RS will measure 3,995 mm in length, 1,745 mm in width, 1,510mm in height, 2,520 mm wheel base, 114 mm ground clearance and fuel capacity of 37 litres. The kerb weight Baleno RS will be 950 kg, which will be lighter than the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI that stands at 1109 kg. Stopping power on the Baleno RS will be taken care by disc brakes at all wheels. \nExpected Price It is expected that Maruti Suzuki might bring Baleno RS at a price tag around Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and may undercut the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI which is available at a price of Rs 10 lakh , ex-showroom, Delhi.
