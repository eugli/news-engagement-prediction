February 24th 2017 37 minutes ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ A new test will be introduced this year to detect cervical cancer and replace the current pap smear test. New cervical cancer test will be introduced to replace pap smear Jamie-Leigh Mason, Quest Newspapers February 24, 2017 12:59pm THE current pap smear tests will soon be a thing of the past, with a new test being introduced in Queensland that is done less frequently and promises to be more effective. Research shows only about half of all eligible women in Queensland currently get regular Pap smears — the second lowest rate in the country. A pap smear can detect if a woman has cervical cancer or suspicious cells that may develop into cervical cancer. In most cases cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted infection called human papillomavirus (HPV). \nAbout 200 women in Queensland are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, and about 60 die from the disease. \nCancer Council Queensland spokeswoman Katie Clift said the new cervical screening test would be introduced in late 2017 and hoped it would increase the number of women having regular tests, given the new test would only need to be done every five years instead of the pap smear every two years. \nShe said the HPV test would be more effective than a pap smear and was just as safe. media_camera Katie Clift from Cancer Council Queensland. Picture: Steve Pohlner \n“The new test will detect HPV before abnormal cell changes occur, helping to prevent cases of cervical cancer and increase survival rates,” Ms Clift said. \n“We hope this change in the screening program will encourage more eligible women to take the test, giving themselves the best possible chance of detecting cancer early. \n“The test will be available for women aged 25 — 74, based on evidence that screening is much less effective in women under the age of 25 years.” \nMs Clift said Cancer Council was involved in the scientific review that guided the release of the new cervical screening program and commended the Federal Government for expanding the screening program. \nCancer Council Queensland urged eligible women to continue participating in the current pap smear screening program until the new test became available. \n“Regular Pap smears currently remain the best protection against cervical cancer,” Ms Clift said. \n“It’s crucial that all eligible Queensland women prioritise regular Pap smears and get screened every two years, until the new screening program becomes available. \n“Participation leads to fewer cases of cervical cancer, and fewer women dying from this disease.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:18:34.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
