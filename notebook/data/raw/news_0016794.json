Created by Kenny W., a developer who regularly shares his AR-based projects on YouTube , the video shows you what it’s like to play the classic puzzle adventure in mixed reality.\nThe demo comes complete with a Companion Cube that you, thankfully, do not have to toss in an incinerator. Rather, you can shoot orange-and-blue portals on any surface, drop the cube into them, and watch as it teleports around your house. The cube even recognizes a flight of stairs and falls down appropriately.\nUnfortunately, the demo stops shy of allowing you to walk through walls or jump through ceilings. I certainly wouldn’t be mad if Valve is inspired to remake Portal in AR — just give me some time to find a cool $3,000 to get myself some HoloLens first .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:49:34.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
