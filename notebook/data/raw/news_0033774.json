By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 14, 2017 9:23 pm (Source: Autumn Gairaud/Twitter) \nJust how far will you go to declare your love? With Valentine’s Day here, it is inevitable there will be lovestruck couples around us exchanging little notes and romantic cards. But how legit is it declare your feelings at the expense of one of the gravest tragedies humanity has ever witnessed — the Holocaust? As unbelievable as that might sound to you right now, this really happened. \nAt Central Michigan University, in Mount Pleasant, USA, a student Madison Rodriguez Eberth spotted a ‘Valentine’s card’ that read “my love 4 u burns like 6,000 jews” with a picture of Hitler on it recently. She posted pictures of the card on the Internet, which then spread like wildfire. Reportedly, the card was given to a member of the Organization of Women Leaders. \nAs though making a joke on the Holocaust episode wasn’t enough in itself, the card even misstates the fact that six million Jews were killed. According to BuzzFeed News, the card, which was signed by a certain Courtney, was inside a goody bag that was exchanged during a College Republicans Valentine’s Day party. Although it hasn’t been identified as to who exactly Courtney is, the incident sparked widespread outrage, especially after Eberth shared the pictures online. \nThis is the card.
