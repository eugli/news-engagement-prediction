As such, Coloradans should understand the facts about legislation in our state and resist misinformation. \nCurrently, the Colorado Senate is considering Senate Bill 61, a measure that would divert some local school funding passed by voters in mill-levy overrides away from traditional public schools. While proponents say the bill will promote parity in school funding, they purposefully ignore that charter schools don’t play by the same rules as traditional public schools. Until this changes, neither should their respective share of public funding. \nGreater transparency in charter school operation is necessary. Charters have un-elected school boards not held to the same standard of accountability to their communities. Unlike traditional public schools that rely on public funds, charters can raise outside money that is not required to be reported to the state. Sometimes, this money ends up in the pockets of for-profit companies, like those supported by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, instead of making a difference for students in the classroom. \nAccountability for an educator’s capabilities, performance and working conditions must be strengthened in charter schools. Charter teachers and principals are not required to hold Colorado licenses, nor are they required to be held accountable for their performance under the state’s educator effectiveness law. \nFor all the lack of transparency surrounding SB 61, one thing is clear: this is the first step toward bringing the Trump-DeVos agenda to Colorado. Legislators should not support this agenda, as it does not promote the opportunity, transparency or accountability we expect. \nColoradans rejected this agenda on Election Day 2016. We rejected it again when thousands of constituents spoke out against the nomination of DeVos for education secretary. And we reject it now by urging the legislature to vote “no” on SB 61. Our kids deserve better. \nKerrie Dallman is president of the Colorado Education Association. \nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.
