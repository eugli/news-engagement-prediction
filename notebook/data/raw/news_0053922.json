The 14-time major champion dropped out of the Genesis Open and Honda Classic due to back issues. Tiger’s comeback is seriously in doubt . \nOne PGA golfer has already given up on Woods. Pat Perez, the world’s No. 67-ranked golfer, said on Thursday that Tiger is done and even Tiger himself knows it. \nSpeaking with SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio , Perez ripped Woods and mocked everything from Woods’ injuries to new endorsement deals. \nHe said: \n“He knows he can’t beat anybody. He’s got this new corporation that he started, so he has to keep his name relevant to keep the corporation going. So he’s going to show up to a few events, he’s going to try to play … He’s going to show the Monster bag. He’s going to show the TaylorMade driver. He’s gonna get on TV. He’s got the Nike clothes — he’s gotta keep that stuff relevant. \n“But the bottom line is he knows he can’t beat anybody. He knows it. The guy shot 77. That guy can’t shoot 77. What does he do the next day? ‘Ah, my back’s gone.’ He knows he can’t beat anybody.” \nPerez continued: \n“If he doesn’t play Augusta then it’s over. I can tell you that right now … Personally, I don’t think you’ll see him again this year.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:01:52.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
