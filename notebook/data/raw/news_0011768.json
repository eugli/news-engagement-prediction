First up make the base by blitzing the almonds in a food processor until they have broken down into a fine consistency, almost like almond flour. Add the dates, melted coconut oil, cocoa powder and vanilla extract and continue to blitz until the dates have been finely chopped and everything is well combined. 2. Press the mixture into a springform tin or tart dish and place in the fridge for an hour to set. If you don't have much time then you can put it in the freezer for 15 - 20 minutes. 3. Make the filling by mixing the cream cheese, greek yogurt, orange juice and zest and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Now spread this mixture onto the top of the pizza base and then decorate with the fruit topping of your choice. 4. Serve immediately or store in the fridge for a couple of hours until you are ready to eat it! BEST GO-TO RECIPE The Londoner's recipe for Travelling Noodles - a one pot noodle soup recipe designed for an al desko lunch - won in the best 'go-to' recipe category A go-to recipe is one that we go back to time and time again because we know it works. It could be considered the highest honour in food, then, to win the award for best go-to recipe. The accolade this year went to The Londoner for its Travelling Noodles recipe - perfect for al desko lunches - beating Nigella Lawson and her red prawn and mango curry recipe into second place. TRAVELLING NOODLES Makes one pot Ingredients: 1 handful of dried noodles (try zero cal noodles if you want to be really good!) 1 handful of mixed asian veg 1 handful of left-over cooked chicken / cooked prawns / tofu Half handful of bean sprouts 1 spring onion 1tsp fresh or dried coriander 1tsp hot sauce (I like Sriracha) 1tsp miso paste 1tsp bouillon/stock powder (make sure it has no MSG) 1tsp tom yum paste (optional) 1tbsp soy sauce Method: 1. Cook your noodles according to the package. When they’re done, pop them into the bottom of your pot. Flatten them in and make sure they’re nicely spread out. Leave to cool. 2. While the noodles cool, make your taste paste. In a small bowl mix together your miso, bouillon, soy, tom yum paste, as much hot sauce as you fancy. Even if you don’t like spicy stuff, just add a little. It gives the soup a great bite and boots your metabolism up a gear. When your pots are nice and chilled, add your sauce. 3. Pile in your chosen meat. Use whatever you fancy, but make sure it’s cooked. 4. Pack in a handful of sliced veg and bean sprouts. Top with sliced spring onion. Sprinkle in your coriander, I didn’t have any fresh so used dried. 5. Then they're done! They keep for a few days, so you could always make a batch of them for the week ahead. When you’re ready to chow, boil the kettle and pop open your pot. Pour boiling water in, until the top veggies are swimming. Seal the pot and leave it for a couple of minutes. Mix and eat!
