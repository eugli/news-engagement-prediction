So what's in a name? \nThe dark cloud of the Vietnam War was looming over Ali, the reigning world heavyweight champion. The stance he bravely took against the conflict - \"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong\" - is today admired as his defining act of political activism, as significant as his sporting accomplishments, but in 1967 society viewed him differently. \nHis insistence on being called Muhammad Ali was widely dismissed by media on both sides of the Atlantic, who referred to him by his birth name. Fifty years ago Ernie Terrell, one of the 1960s' leading heavyweights, paid the ultimate price for failing to recognise Ali's evolution and his beliefs. \nWhat ensued was a cruel, callous annihilation from Ali - taunting his bloodied rival midway through their 15 rounds - that did nothing for the public image of the champion who refused to go to war. Looking back, Ali's fight against Terrell was arguably the legend at his peak displaying footwork that he would never be able to duplicate, while simultaneously spreading his political message every time he snarled: \"What's my name?\" Tale of the tape ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:00:03.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
