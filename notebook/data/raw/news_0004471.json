Ten futuristic football stadiums we cant wait to see \nO nly one of Frankfurt or Stuttgart will be able to go forward to the final vote by Uefa’s executive committee in September. \nThere were 10 bids for the Super Cup, including one from Belfast’s Windsor Park, before last Friday’s deadline for expressions of interest from national associations. A video posted by Atlético de Madrid (@atleticodemadrid) on Oct 5, 2016 at 9:35am PDT \nU efa said final proposals and bid dossiers would need to be delivered by June 6. \nEuropean football’s governing body decided last year to launch a formal competition for its major finals, having previously awarded them by patronage, including this year’s Champions League final at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium and next year’s in Kiev. \nAll stadia to have submitted bids for the 2019 Europa League final boast capacities in excess of 40,000 following controversy over the decision to award last year’s final between Liverpool and Sevilla to FC Basel’s smaller St Jakob Park.
