Both the Czech president and the Hungarian government have welcomed him as an ally in a broader struggle against “EU elites” who put pro-migration ideology ahead of “the safety of [their] citizens”.\n Border , Breitbart London , Immigration , EU , Europe , European Union , immigration , Law and Justice , Mariusz Błaszczak , Migrant crisis , Migrants , migration , PiS , Poland , Visegrad", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3573384/Hungary-accuses-EU-blackmail-introducing-fines-250-000-MIGRANT-countries-not-quota-refugees.html", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fpolands-conservative-government-promises-to-seal-the-borders%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Poland%E2%80%99s+Conservative+Government+Promises+to+%E2%80%98Seal+the+Borders%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://news.sky.com/story/germany-no-limit-to-refugees-well-take-in-10347281", "http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fpolands-conservative-government-promises-to-seal-the-borders%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Poland%E2%80%99s+Conservative+Government+Promises+to+%E2%80%98Seal+the+Borders%E2%80%99", "http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/291255,Changes-in-migration-laws-will-%E2%80%98seal-Polish-border%E2%80%99-Interior-Minister", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fpolands-conservative-government-promises-to-seal-the-borders%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Poland%E2%80%99s+Conservative+Government+Promises+to+%E2%80%98Seal+the+Borders%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:42:07.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
