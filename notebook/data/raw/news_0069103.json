The country, which has until now been one of the few nations to maintain friendly ties with the isolated North, could close its embassy in Pyongyang, or end visa-free travel for North Koreans entering Malaysia. \nIf the criticism from North Korea did not stop, all diplomatic and trade ties could be cut, the source added. \nThe Malaysian foreign ministry did not answer phone calls seeking comment. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said earlier his week that the ambassador's comments casting doubt over Malaysia's investigation were \"diplomatically rude\". \"The statement by the ambassador was totally uncalled for ... But Malaysia will stand firm,\" Najib told reporters on Tuesday. \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:34:52.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
