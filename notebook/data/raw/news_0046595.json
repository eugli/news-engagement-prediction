Ludwig, USA TODAY Sports) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith free agency starting on March 9, USA TODAY Sports is taking a look at all eight NFL divisions and what could be in store for teams this offseason, as well as the moves they should make. Next up, the AFC East ... \nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS \nProminent free agents : LB Dont’a Hightower, CB Malcolm Butler, TE Martellus Bennett, RB LeGarrette Blount, CB Logan Ryan, DT Alan Branch, DE Chris Long, DE Jabaal Sheard, S Duron Harmon \nCap situation : $61.1 million in cap space, according to overthecap.com \nPrimary issues for 2017 : When you’re the defending champs, primary issues aren’t as bad. But New England needs to figure out how to keep key starters like Hightower, Butler, Blount, and Ryan – or at least find replacements who wouldn’t be serious downgrades. The Pats also need to determine whether backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has a future with the team (he only has one year remaining on his rookie contract), or whether his trade value would be too good to pass up. \nOur advice : This is where Bill Belichick does his best work. He needs to convince players like Hightower and Butler to potentially consider taking hometown discounts to return to the Patriots to allow New England to fill its other spots. And if one of those key contributors tests the market and leaves, replacing them in the draft should become a priority. As far as Garoppolo, the Patriots should field calls and interest on the QB. If there’s a package that blows them away – likely with a first-round draft pick attached to it – New England shouldn’t be afraid to ship Garoppolo away, especially since Tom Brady has repeatedly said he wants to play for several more years. \nMORE COVERAGE: \nProminent free agents : QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB Geno Smith, LT Ben Ijalana \nCap situation : $1.49 million in cap space, according to overthecap.com \nPrimary issues for 2017 : Without question, the biggest need starts at quarterback. The defense, one of head coach Todd Bowles’ specialties, requires significant improvement, most notably with the pass rush, which ranked 29th in the 2016 regular season in sacks (27). The also Jets have to get more athletic and younger at several positions on their depth chart. \nOur advice: As Bryce Petty's inconsistencies showed and Christian Hackenberg's inability to get a game uniform in 2016 reinforced, if the Jets want to win now, they need a more reliable passer. Since Washington's Kirk Cousins is likely to be franchised and will almost certainly not hit the market, free agency — at best — gives the Jets another bridge QB option in players like Mike Glennon, Brian Hoyer or Josh McCown. If the price is right, however, a short-term deal with either provides an upgrade, but it should not be for more than two years. The draft is the solution for the future. With the No. 6 overall draft pick, the Jets should look at acquiring a sure-fire playmaker at one of four positions: QB, RB, CB, or edge rusher. If New York whiffs here, jobs could be on the line. So if someone like North Carolina’s Mitch Trubisky is around, the Jets need to turn in the draft card without hesitating. With Darrelle Revis’ legal issues surfacing after he was charged for an altercation in Pittsburgh, the Jets should focus on restructuring his contract or cutting him altogether. \nMIAMI DOLPHINS \nProminent free agents : LB Jelani Jenkins, WR Kenny Stills, TE Dion Sims, TE Jordan Cameron, FS Michael Thomas, DE Andre Branch \nCap situation : $42.4 million, according to overthecap.com \nPrimary issues for 2017 : The Dolphins found their workhorse running back in 2016 with Jay Ajayi, so the shift now goes to uncover role players on the offensive line and an edge rusher after the Mario Williams experiment failed to help take some of the pressure off Cameron Wake. Interior linebacker is another spot that could use some more depth. \nOur advice : With Branden Albert looking to be on the way out, Laremy Tunsil – fresh off of a solid rookie campaign – will slide right in. But the Dolphins are going to have to add a guard – probably in the mid-to-late rounds of the draft – to make sure Ryan Tannehill stays upright. The Dolphins do have some cap space, but after spending big in free agency in consecutive years, it may be wise for Miami to play it cautious. That’s why we’d be thinking pass rush with their first-round draft pick, No. 22 overall. \nBUFFALO BILLS \nProminent free agents : CB Stephon Gilmore, DT Corbin Bryant, WR Percy Harvin, LB Lorenzo Alexander, FB Jerome Felton, WR Robert Woods \nCap situation : $19.9 million in cap space, according to overthecap.com \nPrimary issues for 2017 : With a March 11 deadline looming for Buffalo on Tyrod Taylor, the Bills must decide whether to exercise his option (which would pay him $27.5 million in 2017) or move on. But it’s up to new coach Sean McDermott and general manager Doug Whaley to determine how Taylor fits in the team's future, if he does at all. On the other side of the ball, it’s going to take some time for McDermott’s system to be implemented on defense, and the Bills need a smooth transition there after Ryan’s complex schemes often fell flat with his former players. \nOur advice : The Bills should ride it out for at least one more year with Taylor and focus on other needs. Re-signing Stephon Gilmore would normally be a priority, but McDermott came from a system in Carolina that placed more emphasis on the front seven than on the secondary. Lorenzo Alexander ranked third in the NFL in sacks, but he’ll be 34 in May, so there's no need to break the bank on him. \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoReyes . \nPHOTOS: Best potential NFL free agents Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:49:28.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
