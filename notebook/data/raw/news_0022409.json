They released veteran running back James Starks after seven seasons with the team, multiple outlets report. The #Packers have cut RB James Starks, per the transaction wire. It's with a non-football injury designation. But going forward he's healthy \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 7, 2017 \nWith Eddie Lacy set to be a free agent and Ty Montgomery not exactly a three-down back, the Packers are entering the offseason especially thin at the position. Starks was a versatile back but never had a large role with the Packers. \nThis season, the 30-year-old was injured for much of the season and rushed for just 145 yards in nine games. Starks also averaged just 2.3 yards per carry in 2016. \nThe Packers will have to add at least one running back if they don’t re-sign Lacy, which they’re not expected to do. Starks was due to make $3 million in 2017, so it’s possible the Packers could be looking to bring him back on a cheaper deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:19:41.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
