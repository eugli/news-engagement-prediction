Wandering around the ancient city is like stepping back thousands of years in time. That’s what I love about this photo: it evokes the feeling of an old painting. Hamish Scott-Brown A goatherd in Rajasthan watches me cautiously as I discover him on the edge of the Thar desert. Donal Murphy I was taking a picture of the contrasting blues in the medina at Chefchaouen, Morocco, when I heard steps rushing my way. I focused, and was very happy to capture this young girl in full flight. Les Gibbons A tobacco farmer in the Viñales valley, Cuba. I had visited his farm 10 years previously and it was good to go back. Although tourism has increased drastically in the town, nothing has really changed on the farm and little money was reaching the locals. Jony Russell I went down to the river in Hampi, southern India, early to see the morning ablutions. It turns out that the whole world was there washing clothes, bodies, elephants and saris – the latter were then laid out on the warm rocks to dry or simply waved about photogenically in the sunshine for a few moments. Michael Sutherland Tourists catching a break, and some much needed shade, from a steaming hot afternoon at Bondi Beach, Sydney. The colours and the interaction between art and life caught my eye. I was quite envious of their nice, refreshing resting spot too. Stephen McDonald Floating village of Kompong Phluk, Cambodia. The smaller boats take tourists through the trees; along the way drinks and snacks can be purchased from floating stalls. The small boats all seemed to be operated by women, some with their children helping out. Ashley Ezrachie I was in St James’s Park, London, and this robin just stood in my hand singing. I didn’t even have to feed it. I was pleased with the result, particularly as it captures the little guy mid-song. At the Taj Mahal but away from the crowds with a local boatman at sunset. We paid to go on his boat three times, it was that stunning. This man has been running trips on the river with his friend for many years, one of very few people with a licence to do so. Ross Pichler, runner-up This shot was taken during the early hours of Christmas Day at the majestic Lake Te Anau. It was a fitting end to our wonderful trip to New Zealand. PAUL GOLDSTEIN, JUDGE: So it is a bit cliched but so what? A cliche is fine if it is a good one and this nighttime effort is first class. It is both pretty and serene and apart from the horizon being right in the middle of the shot, it really works. Colour exposure and composition are right on the money, and as this is a long exposure I’ve no idea how the photographer got the protagonist to sit absolutely still for so long. Colin Rothbart, runner-up Burmese girl with parasols. PAUL GOLDSTEIN, JUDGE: I agonised over which image to pick for the winner – and this has just been pipped. Although I am familiar with this sort of kaleidoscope shot, I have seldom found one executed as well. It would have won had it been taken just a fraction lower and to the left, to cut out the plastic stool and ground. Outstanding work: sensitive, artistic and would make a brilliant jigsaw for someone you really don’t like. Photograph: Colin Rothbart/GuardianWitness Nick Board, winner Christmas Eve in Argentinian Patagonia and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get close to the Perito Moreno glacier. To cap it all, a glass of whisky with the purest ice on Earth. I liked the tiny figures, giving a sense of scale, and the sheer power of nature. PAUL GOLDSTEIN, JUDGE: As an almost spookily effective piece of composition it is close to A+; the eye is led through the scree to the literal teeth of the image, the people almost, but not quite, superfluous. Both first and second place had me gazing at them for a while, the principle tenet of a blinding photograph.
