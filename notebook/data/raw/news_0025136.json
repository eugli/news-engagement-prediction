Irfan has been questioned by the PCB over suspected contact with the bookies during PSL, but is not facing any immediate suspension, PSL Chairman Najam Sethi tweeted earlier today. \nSharjeel and Latif were sent back home on Friday after the PCB Anti-Corruption Unit, supported by ICC’s international investigators, found them in violation of the PCB’s Anti-Corruption Code as part of an ongoing investigation into an international syndicate which reportedly contacted a number of players during the ongoing PSL. \nIslamabad United won the opening match of PSL 2017 against Peshawar Zalmi on Thursday by 7 wickets (with 2 balls remaining, according to D/L method). \nLahore Qalandars lost their first match of this PSL on Friday against Quetta Gladiators. The Qalandars, led by former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum this time, fell short by 8 runs in a low-scoring thriller. Head to head \nLahore Qalandars and Islamabad United faced off twice in last year’s season. Both the encounters were won by United – the first by 8 wickets and the second by 5 wickets. In the spotlight \nBrendon McCullum, who has been the most prominent player this season, has a lot of expectations riding on him. He played a quick-fire innings of 20 off 11 deliveries, setting the team on an explosive start along with England opener Jason Roy, but it wasn’t enough to take the team to victory. \nYoung Qalandar Mohammad Irfan Jr impressed with his bowling against Quetta Gladiators. He bagged 3 wickets, including crucial wickets of Kevin Pietersen and Rilee Rossouw. \nIslamabad United will be relying on another brilliant batting display by opener Dwayne Smith and wicket-keeper batsman Brad Haddin and the all-round skills of veteran Shane Watson, who proved useful with both the bat and ball in the last match.
