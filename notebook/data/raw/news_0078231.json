It is hard to understand why, in this safety-conscious age, the installation of defibrillators is not already mandated on the rail carriages that so many people pass through each day. We want to change that in Lucy's memory. \n“She was a talented linguist who was awarded three A grades at A-level and would now be studying French and Spanish at university with unlimited possibilities ahead of her. Her loss is a tragedy with which we, Lucy’s family, are still struggling to come to terms with but which we are determined there should be some positive outcome.” Lucy was a pupil at the independent Withington Girls School in Manchester (Photo: Cavendish Press) \nThe Manchester hearing was told Lucy had suffered with mild asthma since the age of ten but had always managed to keep her condition under control using inhalers provided by her GP. \nMr Goldstone told the inquest: ''She was very good with dealing with it and being sensible. \n\"I had never known her to have anything resembling an asthma attack until after her death when I found out that she had a few episodes with asthma. One when she was skiing and she had an asthma attack after climbing a significant way, but this was under control as soon as she took her inhaler.

She was sending WhatsApp messages expressing concerns about her breathing.'' \nDuring the hearing Dr Kirstin Ballantyne from Manchester Royal Infirmary said: \"I have seen cases where people at train stations have had a heart attack and been bought to back to life with the use of a defibrillator. \n\"But in Lucy's case when we got to her heart rhythm was not shockable and there is no way of knowing whether Lucy would have ever been in a stage where her rhythm was shockable.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:47:40.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
