But this collaboration is about more than looks; S'well bottles are designed to keep cold drinks cold for 24 hours and hot ones piping for 12, making them perfect for hot lattes now and iced cold brew come spring.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below \"Collaborating with highly coveted brands is part of what makes S'well a unique company,\" said founder Sarah Kauss in a statement. \"Wrapping Lilly Pulitzer prints on our bottles instantly transported us to summer days and had us itching to head to the beach with a bottle full of Starbucks Cold Brew. S'well is thrilled to have created the perfect accessory for warm, sunny days or for daydreaming about them in the middle of winter.\"\nStarting today, the bottles will be available for purchase at Starbucks locations throughout the U.S. for $40 each, but you'll want to shop quickly. They're available for purchase for a limited time only, and if previous Lilly collaborations are any indication, these won't last long.\nFor more information, visit LillyPulitzer.com .\nFrom: Town & Country\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/news/a9592/lilly-pulitzer-water-bottles/", "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.lillypulitzer.com_resort365_lilly-2Dpulitzer-2Dswell_2888-3Futm-5Fsource-3DStarbucks-26utm-5Fmedium-3Dreferral-26utm-5Fterm-3DFeb-5F13-26utm-5Fcampaign-3DPR&d=DwMF-g&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=a01O9QqtYwkBhERK3zjeACzdWyzF0S18P8yb6uBevAo&m=hHqHFuFjZCFE9UB8q3jYfAuW7zCkq2bHaqGip0QtaGE&s=vQWTrx9G8_Lr5TEFMwekW0S6RU9MVy2TSrAfZ_sQ0Ds&e="], "published": "2017-02-16T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:53:38.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
