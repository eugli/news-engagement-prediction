SEE ALSO: Everything we know about Disney's secretive Star Wars Land \nNo one was hurt and Ford safely landed his single-engine Husky — a modern, American-made backcountry flier — in the Monday afternoon incident. He could, however, have his pilot's license suspended after the Federal Aviation Administration completes its investigation. \nAccording to NBC News, the 74-year-old had been properly told to land on runway 20-L at John Wayne Airport, but mistakenly aimed for a taxiway. Along the way he buzzed over a parked American Airlines 737, which was carrying 116 souls and departed safely just a few minutes later. \nFord was heard saying \"Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?\" on recordings captured by air traffic controllers, who then told him of his mistake. Honest mix-up or not, landing on a taxiway is a violation of FAA rules. \nFord may very well get away with just a warning here, but whatever the consequences, he made off far better than on March 5, 2015, when his World War II-era training aircraft lost power. \nWhat was left of Harrison Ford's single-engine plan after he plowed it into a Santa Monica golf course in March 2015. \nImage: Rich Polk/Getty ImagesGetty Images \nAn experienced and highly regarded pilot who collects vintage planes, Ford was able to put that single-engine plane down on the fairway of a municipal golf course — a move that won him hero's status for avoiding the dense residential areas all around — breaking his arm and suffering minor head injuries in the process. \nA rep for Ford did not immediately return a request for comment.
