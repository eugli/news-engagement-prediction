The area has been cordoned off and army bomb experts are examining the object. \nDebbie Watters, vice-chairwoman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, said the officer had a \"very lucky escape\". \n\"I am grateful that the evil intent of those responsible for leaving this device did not succeed,\" she said. \n\"This officer has had a very lucky escape but such activity reinforces the continuing threat that exists for our police officers both on and off duty. \n\"As a community, it is our responsibility to ensure those behind such activity are brought to justice.\" \nMeanwhile, in a separate incident, homes have been evacuated in County Tyrone after the discovery of a suspicious object at Sion Mills. \nPolice have not linked the two incidents.
