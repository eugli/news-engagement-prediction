The restaurant features eclectic fare and views of the downtown sculpture garden. Photo by Sid Hastings \nKaldi's Coffee Roasting Co. announced on Monday that it will open a cafe in the restaurant space at Citygarden sculpture park downtown. This will be the fourth venture to occupy the space at 808 Chestnut Street, following the Terrace View, Joe's Chili Bowl and, most recently, Death in the Afternoon, which closed in November . \nRepresentatives for Kaldi's did not immediately return a call for comment. In a statement posted on the Kaldi's blog , owner Tricia Zimmer Ferguson said, \"We are proud to call St. Louis home and have looked for a downtown space for a few years to really cement that relationship. We were ecstatic to hear from the Gateway Foundation about putting a Kaldi’s into the park.\" \nThe Citygarden location is slated to open in March. \nAlso on Monday, Kaldi's announced plans to open a cafe later this year inside the Euclid, the mixed-use Central West End development currently under construction that will include the first St. Louis location of Shake Shack. \nThese newly announced locations add to what is already a busy 2017 for the coffee roaster. Kaldi's opened a cafe this weekend in the Gerhart building at 3900 Laclede Avenue, which is just across South Vandeventer Avenue from the Saint Louis University campus. In April, Kaldi's will open a location inside the Mid Campus Center at the Washington University School of Medicine. \nMore as Off the Menu learns it.
