Rest assured, there are always some takeaways, and autumn/winter 2017 is no different. Here are the trends that will make it to your wardrobe next autumn.\nThe continued polo neck \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emilia Wickstead, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock \nYes, I know, we’re wanging on about polo necks again. Don’t fight it. You might be bored to death of that jumper you’ve been wearing all winter, but get ready to get it out again in a few months – the polo neck was in collections from Emilia Wickstead to Topshop . Face it: necks are not going to be fashionable again for a while.\nSocks and sandals \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mulberry, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock \nA favourite of Miuccia Prada, the sock and sandal combo has crossed from Milan to London this week, at Anya Hindmarch and Mulberry. Versus basically gave the sports sock a style upgrade – by printing the brand’s logo around the top of the sock, where the ones you buy in packs of five typically have stripes. Clever.\nDeconstructed florals \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images \nTo paraphrase Miranda Priestly , florals for spring are hardly groundbreaking. They are a little edgier for winter – especially when they have a punky deconstructed feel, the kind of thing that might provoke whispers, rather than approving glances, at the village fete. Preen are becoming experts at this – their lovely collection had loads of flowers but was never cutesy. Erdem, meanwhile, added velvet textures.\nA very big and long chunky jumper over a flowy skirt \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Topshop Unique, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock \nThis is one you can probably trial now, should you have a big jumper and a slipdress to hand – it works well for weather that is almost but not quite springlike. It was a look that got played both on (Topshop, Peter Pilotto) and off the catwalk (among fashion editors) – a sure sign you will be wearing it sometime soon.\nChainmail for going out-out \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest JW Anderson, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock \nBack in nightclubs of the 90s, you couldn’t move for girls in chainmail tops. Get ready to relive that moment – metallics were big this season, with chainmail the alpha take on partywear. JW Anderson’s floral dress with feather skirt and chainmail cloak was wonderfully eclectic – and would cause some quizzical looks at Ministry of Sound.\nBig earrings \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Kane earrings, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock \nIt was a lobe-in on the front row, with every alpha editor trying out can’t-miss-them earrings by brands from Céline to Loewe. “The bigger the better” was the general rule of thumb. And, judging by the catwalk, ears will continue to be the place to make fashion statements​. Earrings were big at Christopher Kane, Emilia Wickstead and Topshop. Excellent news when you realise a jazzy earring means you can wear the most boring outfit ever and it can still be totally Fashion.\nShirt tails poking out under a jumper \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burberry, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock \nBurberry mastered this Suitable for Work look – with a longer shirt worn under cropped knitwear, by both men and women in the brand’s show. Similar ideas were also seen at Sharon Wauchob and Pringle of Scotland. The kind of trend that you’ll be thankful for when you’re getting dressed for work in the dark at 7am next November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:17:17.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
