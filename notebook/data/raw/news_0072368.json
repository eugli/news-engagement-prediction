This is due to loss of productivity, ‘often as a result of sufferers being unable to function at work or cope with daily life’. milos-kreckovic via Getty Images \n“Depression is the single largest contributor to years lived with disability. So it’s the top cause of disability in the world today,” Dr Dan Chisholm from WHO’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse said in a news briefing. \nThe organisation’s latest body of research found that depression is 1.5 times more common among women than men. \nAcross the globe, 250 million people suffer anxiety disorders, including phobias, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. \nAround 80% of those with mental illness live in low and middle-income countries. \nDiscussing the three groups of people who are particularly vulnerable to depression, Dr Chisholm said: “The pressures on today’s youth are like no other generation perhaps. \n“Another target group is women who are pregnant or have just given birth. Depression around that period is actually extremely common, around 15% of women will suffer not just ‘the blues’, but a diagnosable case of depression.” SEE ALSO:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:00:15.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
