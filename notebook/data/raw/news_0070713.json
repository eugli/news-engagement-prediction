Instagram user Eric Cameron managed to snag a photo of some promo art featuring the character’s costume while he was at the event: \n3/4: New York Toy Fair 2017 was a blast! Thanks to @firstordertransmissions and @makingstarwars, I was lucky enough to attend @Hasbro's off-site event today, and was blown away! This is Hasbro's best year for Toy Fair by far, and all of the Hasbro staff members were a class act! They held an amazing theater presentation talking about everything that they have in store for the next few months. We got sneak peeks at all sorts of toys including new 40th Anniversary Star Wars figures, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 figures, and of course, Spider-Man Homecoming figures! We even got our first look at what Shocker will look like in Spider-Man Homecoming! Once I got to the show floor, my jaw literally dropped to the floor when I saw how amazing all of these figures look, especially @TomHolland2013's 6\" Marvel Legends Spidey figure with Peter's head. It looks exactly like Tom! When the event was over, Hasbro was kind enough to send everyone home with a gift bag with some toys including Star Wars Black Series Figures and Marvel Legends figures! I was fortunate enough to receive a Black Series Baze Malbus, and a new Marvel Legends Green Goblin! They look absolutely spectacular! Hasbro has really stepped up their game over the past few years, and I am so grateful to @firstordertransmissions and @makingstarwars for giving me the opportunity to attend this year! Thanks again Hasbro for making this an incredible Toy Fair! I can't wait to get my hands on all of the Star Wars 40th Anniversary figures, the Guardians Volume 2 figures, The Last Jedi figures, and of course, the Spider-Man Homecoming figures! #HasbroToyFair #NYTF2017 #GotGVol2 #SpiderManHomecoming \nA photo posted by @ericcameronfilms on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:19pm PST \nThe Shocker photo is part of a larger collage, but if you look in the top left of the photo above, you can make out the new look at the costume. It appears to be aiming for some accuracy to the comics with that yellow quilt designed to insulate the character from his powerful blast vibrations, but it looks a little more cartoonish than previous hints we’ve gotten about what the character may look like in the film. Contrast the image above with this screencap of Woodbine from the film’s trailer: \nThat shot looks way more realistic than the new promo art, which has the unfortunate side effect of making Shocker look like a giant yellow oven mitt. It’s not exactly a costume that will strike fear into the hearts of his enemies… but if he does end up wearing it in the movie, at least it should give Spidey something fun to quip about. \nThere’s also the matter of Prometheus star Logan Marshall-Green, who was cast as a mysterious villain months ago. The studio hasn’t officially commented on who he’ll be playing, but based on this screenshot from the trailer, that yellow quilted material he’s wearing lends credence to speculation that he might be playing an entirely different incarnation of Shocker in this film. That might explain the differences in the costumes: Marshall-Green could have a more lived-in, realistic version, while Woodbine could end up using a more over-the-top, comic-style costume. \nSpider-Man: Homecoming is one of my most anticipated superhero movies of the year, but one of the things I’m just the tiniest bit hesitant about is the number of characters involved. This franchise doesn’t have the best history with cramming multiple villains into its movies (see: Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man films), so seeing Woodbine’s Shocker, Michael Keaton’s Vulture, Marshall-Green’s character, and potentially even Donald Glover’s character (who may also be a villain) together in the same movie has me hoping the writers know what they’re doing. Things are about to get pretty crowded for our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler. \nDirected by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei, Bokeem Woodbine, and Donald Glover, Spider-Man: Homecoming arrives in theaters on July 7, 2017. \nImages: Marvel/Sony, Instagram Ben Pearson Ben is an entertainment journalist who has written about movies online for nearly a decade.
