At the time, the kinescope tube was sorely needed for television and Zworykin was one of the first to demonstrate a television system with all the features of modern picture tubes. Philo T. Farnsworth - Electronic \nIn 1927, American Inventor Philo Farnsworth was the first inventor to transmit a television image comprised of 60 horizontal lines. The image transmitted was a dollar sign. Farnsworth developed the dissector tube, the basis of all current electronic televisions. He filed for his first television patent (patent #1,773,980) in 1927. \nLouis Parker invented the modern changeable television receiver. The patent was issued to Louis Parker in 1948. Louis W. Parker's \"intercarrier sound system\" is now used in all television receivers in the world. Rabbit Ears Antennae \nMarvin Middlemark invented \"rabbit ears\", the \"V\" shaped TV antennae in 1953. Among Middlemark's other inventions were a water-powered potato peeler and rejuvenating tennis ball machine. Color Television \nOne of the earliest proposals for a color TV system was filed in 1880. And in 1925, Russian TV pioneer Vladimir Zworykin filed a patent disclosure for an all-electronic color television system. A successful color television system began commercial broadcasting, first authorized by the FCC on December 17, 1953 based on a system invented by RCA. History of Cable TV \nCable television, formerly known as Community Antenna Television or CATV, was born in the mountains of Pennsylvania in the late 1940's. The first successful color television system began commercial broadcasting on December 17, 1953 based on a system designed by RCA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:46:36.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
