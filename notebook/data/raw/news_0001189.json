Dad refused wine in Aldi because he was with daughter Daniel Maddison, 53, was stopped from buying wine over fears he was buying for his daughter - and his experience is all because of supermarket policy to sell alcohol responsibly Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA dad has vowed to boycott Aldi after being refused alcohol by checkout staff because he was with his teenage daughter. \nBut it appears Daniel Maddison's experience could happen to others, as supermarkets have revealed they have specific policies in place to ensure adults are not buying alcohol for those who are too young to drink it. \nWe explore how these policies can affect people who go shopping for alcohol with their children. \nMr Maddison, from Yarm in North Yorkshire, went to his local Aldi store after picking his daughter up from school. \nAs well as some vegetables and milk that were in his basket, he also picked up a bottle of wine. \nBut to his shock, when he arrived at the till, the store manager came over to tell him he was not allowed. \n“It was embarrassing,” he told Gazette Live . The father says he won't be shopping at Aldi again following the incident (Photo: Evening Gazette) \n“Other people in the queue couldn’t believe it. They started saying how ridiculous it was. \n“But the manager just kept saying it was Aldi policy. \n“I applaud the idea of stopping people buying alcohol for kids but I was stunned that they thought I was doing that for my own daughter. \n“It was really uncomfortable and has put me off going to back in there.” Read More \nHe added: “If this is going to happen now, people need to know. \n“Many parents go to the supermarket after picking their children up from school - just like I did.” \nAn Aldi spokesman said they had apologised for the inconvenience, and added: “Mr Maddison should have been able to purchase the bottle of wine. \nBut following the refusal, Gazette Live approached five other major supermarket chains to find out what parents' rights are when buying alcohol with their children in tow. \nA spokesperson for Asda said: “We have a Challenge 25 policy which we put into practice in all of our stores and where there is any element of doubt we support our colleagues to make the right decision. \n“We’d never intentionally upset a customer but we’re committed to selling alcohol responsibly.” Read More Angry mum slams supermarket after three-year-old son slips on fruit and veg bag and shatters his leg \nA spokesman for Lidl said stores operate the Challenge 25 policy. \nThe chain also implements ‘proxy sales’ awareness when it is believed an adult is buying alcohol for a minor rather than for themselves. \nA spokesperson for Tesco said the chain also operated a Think 25 policy for selling alcohol, where they need to be convinced those purchasing the alcohol are over 25. \n“There is no policy in place for refusing to sell alcohol to customers who have their children with them,” they added. \nA spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said they operate the same Think 25 policy. \nThey added: “If there is reason to believe that an age-restricted product is being purchased by an adult for an under-age person, then colleagues will refuse to sell it.” \nAccording to Morrisons' website, “staff will ask anyone attempting to buy alcohol who looks under 25 to prove their age.” \nThe chain is yet to respond to a request for clarification on shopping with children.
