The show kicked off on Saturday night with the introduction of the BlackBerry KeyOne, a full-on Android-powered keyboard phone (produced by China's TCL) that recalls company's pre-iPhone glory days. Get a close look at the rebooted Nokia 3310 \nNot to be outdone, old-timer Nokia (or, at least, licensee HMD Global) showed off three Android phones of its own. More enticing, however, was its 3310 \"feature phone,\" a non-smartphone based on a 1990s classic that makes phone calls and sends texts -- and not very much else.
