EPF has not lost a single sen in them,\" he stressed. \nAdditionally, EPF's remaining RM200 million exposure to 1MDB's government guaranteed sukuk was just 0.027 percent of its total assets of RM731 billion, he said. \nTherefore, for the three opposition leaders to claim that EPF was in financial difficulties or that 1MDB had caused losses to EPF was wrong and malicious, Abdul Rahman lashed out. \n\"As current or former MPs, the three opposition leaders had failed their sworn duties to be honest to the people when they made such ridiculous claims in their joint statement. \n\"They must not repeat this in future,\" he warned. \nHe said given historical dividends since 2000, the current global and regional economic situation and the performance of other provident funds and mutual funds in the region, EPF's 5.7 percent dividend for 2016 was commendable. \nFor the nine years from 2000 to 2008, EPF had recorded an average annual dividend rate of 4.99 percent whereas from 2009 to 2016, this average had increased to 6.1 percent, he said. \n\"I am confident that with the accelerating gross domestic product growth in the previous two quarters and the recent sharp increases in the Bursa Malaysia index, God willing, EPF will perform even better for 2017,\" he said. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:23:35.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
