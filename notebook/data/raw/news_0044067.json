A copy of the Article 50 Bill Credit: PA \nOnce the Bill passes Parliament and Article 50 is subsequently triggered, a two-year countdown will begin until Britain formally leaves the European Union. \nNegotiations with the EU will be able to commence at this stage, but European ministers have warned these will not be straightforward. \nSpeaking to The Guardian, Czech minister Tomas Prouza said: \"There is a real danger that British politics, with all its whipped-up resentments of Europe, will mean British negotiators are unable to compromise, and we will head for a crash landing.\" \nSenior German MEP Elmar Brok, an ally of Angela Merkel, told the newspaper: \"The British government tries to divide and rule. They believe they can take members of parliament out of certain nations ... to win support by dividing us. \n\"If they try to negotiate while trying to interfere in our side then we can do that too. We can make a big fuss over Scotland. Or Northern Ireland.\" Czech minister Tomas Prouza says compromise will be essential Credit: PA \nThe Financial Times has reported that talks on a future trade deal with the EU may not be able to begin until after Christmas because Brussels officials want to make progress on the process of separation first. \nThis would include talks on an exit fee, expected to be up to Â£51 billion, and the rights of expatriate citizens, something Mrs May is also keen for early progress on. \nThe UK, however, wants to discuss trade talks in parallel with the so-called divorce settlement, and hopes to conclude both elements within two years after triggering Article 50.
