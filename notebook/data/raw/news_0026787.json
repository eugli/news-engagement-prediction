The results are devastating, and remind us exactly how much we have to lose if the repeal takes place.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Take the time to read all of them, and then call your lawmakers about not taking away something so vital to so many of us with no plans on a replacement. Do it for Jasmine! (And also for all of the real life women who will be screwed without insurance.)\nPreviously, we saw Aladdin & Jasmine happy & ready to start their family. This year, however, it's taken a dark tone. Why? Because Trump just nominated former U.S. Senator from Indiana Dan Coats for Director of National Intelligence and he‚Äôs just one of many Republicans who back strenuous measures against Planned Parenthood and restricting a women‚Äôs right to choose. Indiana is a state along with Louisiana and Texas that have been trying to sign into law a mandate that would essentially force women to provide funeral services for aborted tissue and miscarriages. So today‚Äôs illustration has to do with family planning and how we‚Äôre afraid it could be affected by this new administration, based on people like Mike Pence, Dan Coats, and honestly the entirety of the Texas GOP. Also considering that it‚Äôs Jasmine and Aladdin looking for some family planning? Here‚Äôs hoping they don‚Äôt have to deal with Trump‚Äôs Muslim registry first. . .

This is not to be had. This is not to be tolerated. Millions of Americans like you & I depend on the ACA. Today, the New York Quote: : \"Republican leaders say they will work closely with Mr. Trump developing legislation to repeal and replace the health care law, but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort.\" We, as a nation, can not afford to lose the most accessible health care plan that we as a country have ever seen. We can't afford to see what Donald Trump's \"plan\" will be. Please call your representatives. Don't sit on the sidelines. #plannedparenthood #standwithpp #aca #illustration #maritzalugoart #disney #princesses #ariel #thelittlemermaid #artwork #art #disneyprincesses #fuckmitchmcconnell\nA photo posted by Maritza Lugo (@mindsaymohan) on Jan 12, 2017 at 1:27pm PST\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Belle was super happy to get birth control. As someone who was dependent on it, finding out she was denied her refill will only make Belle's life a little harder. Birth control helps women in so many ways and it isn't just for preventing pregnancy. Representative Kirsten Gillibrand was working hard to protect birth control while the GOP was trying to overturn #ACA. Slate published an article on this yesterday. The Senate voted to leave 55 million women without affordable birth control. No-copay birth control was a hallmark of ACA, allowing 55 million women to have more control over their bodies. Now insurance companies would no longer be required to cover contraceptives, and pregnancy would be considered a ‚Äúpre-existing condition.‚Äù #standwithpp #plannedparenthood #beautyandthebeast #disney #disneyprincesses #illustration #socialjustice #maritzalugoart #artwork #belle #fucktrump\nA photo posted by Maritza Lugo (@mindsaymohan) on Jan 13, 2017 at 1:18pm PST\nThe animated Pocahontas film without a doubt presents an erroneous romanticized view of colonialism, kidnapping and sexual appropriation. And last summer Donald Trump kept condescendingly referring to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas because the Republicans demanded proof of her claimed Native American heritage. It's about time we talked about Native Americans and how they could be affected under a Trump presidency. All of Trump‚Äôs talk about immigrants and who belongs in this country would be comical if it wasn‚Äôt so tragic considering blemishes on American history like the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Beyond the troubling issue of what the future holds for the pipeline is healthcare overall for Native American groups. Did you know that they are not allocated the same level of federal health care as other people? But it‚Äôs likely to expect that Trump will parade into this unique area of healthcare like John Smith, plundering and damaging all the way through. After all, records indicate that John Smith described pre-teen Pocahontas as ‚Äúnubile and sexy‚Äù which sounds like the 17th century version of ‚Äúgrab them by the pussy.‚Äù Words by the brilliant @daniellesep üôåüèΩüíª #standwithpp #dapl #illustration #disneyprincess #disney #pocahontas #fuckdonaldtrump #artwork #art #socialjustice #aca #obamacare\nA photo posted by Maritza Lugo (@mindsaymohan) on Jan 14, 2017 at 1:17pm PST\nIn our final rendition of Disney Princesses VS. the GOP, we remember that last year we had Tiana getting her HPV vaccine in part to promote Cervical Cancer Awareness month. And to combat some of the fallacies that perpetuate about the vaccine itself, which include the idea that only girls should get it, it promotes sexual behavior, or that it‚Äôs ineffective. But this year there‚Äôs an even bigger issue at hand. And that‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs overall attitude towards vaccines. His insistence that vaccines cause autism has not waned, in spite of all scientific evidence to the contrary. Trump‚Äôs most recent claim is that there will be a better replacement to ACA which will be less expensive and available to everyone. Details of such a wonderful concept? There are none except the phrase that Americans will be ‚Äúbeautifully covered.‚Äù This sounds like what Beyonc√© would describe as a \"sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare\" and we're guessing it's not the sweet dream. #disney #princesses #obamacare #tiana #standwithpp #aca #disneyprincess #vaccines #illustration #artwork #princessandthefrog #blacklivesmatter\nA photo posted by Maritza Lugo (@mindsaymohan) on Jan 16, 2017 at 1:07pm PST\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/daniellesep/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPVvmwYAExD/", "http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPQnPkSgxBw/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPLeufVgEIa/", "https://www.instagram.com/mindsaymohan/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPI5L0yA09B/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPOChs5AvQP/"], "published": "2017-02-12T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:18:47.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
