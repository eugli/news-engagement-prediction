Got it Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the council on Foreign Relations Elliott Abrams testifies before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, February 9, 2011 on the recent developments in Egypt and Lebanon. (JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) By Anne Gearan By Anne Gearan February 10 at 4:42 PM Follow @agearan \nPresident Trump has rejected the hiring of former Reagan and George W. Bush foreign policy aide Elliott Abrams as the deputy secretary of state after seeing writings in which Abrams had been critical of Trump before his victory last year, a person with knowledge of the decision said Friday. \nAbrams interviewed for the influential No. 2 job Tuesday at the White House in a meeting also attended by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson had backed Abrams for the job, arguing that the veteran Republican official’s knowledge of the State Department and Washington’s foreign policy bureaucracy would complement Tillerson’s lack of government experience, people familiar with the selection process said. \nThe meeting went smoothly, according to the person familiar with the session, but after the president saw the comments, Tillerson’s choice was vetoed. Trump’s decision was first reported by CNN. \nMost damaging to Abrams appears to be a historical piece he wrote comparing the 2016 election to 1972 and counseling Republicans to voice their objections to Trump. \n“Do not allow the Republican convention to be a coronation wherein Trump and Trumpism are unchallenged,” Abrams wrote in a piece for the conservative Weekly Standard. “The party needs to be reminded that there are deep divisions, and Trump needs to be reminded of how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination.” \nCurrent and former officials familiar with the Abrams decision requested anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. The White House has not publicly discussed Abrams’s candidacy. A White House spokesman did not return messages asking about Abrams on Friday. \nBest known for his role in the Reagan-era Iran-contra scandal, Abrams had been considered the leading choice for a post that often goes to seasoned foreign policy professionals. His rejection reopens the search and leaves Tillerson as the lone Senate-confirmed person chosen by Trump who is on the job at the State Department. His chief of staff and several other advisers around the new top diplomat were campaign aides or political advisers selected by the White House. \nThe struggle to fill a key job illustrates how difficult it has become to find suitable candidates for top State Department jobs. The Trump administration has issued a near-total ban on hiring anyone on the long list of Republicans who signed public letters last year opposing Trump on national security grounds. Many other veterans of the Reagan and Bush presidencies have removed themselves from consideration for senior jobs, or are considered too old to return to government. \nAbrams did not sign a letter, but did write critically about Trump while advising two of his GOP primary rivals. \nPaula Dobriansky, who also served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, is another potential choice for deputy. One of George W. Bush’s most controversial advisers, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, was also mentioned as a possible deputy, but was opposed by Tillerson, people familiar with the process said. \nAlthough recent secretaries of state have had two deputies, the Trump administration might fill only one slot, according to current and former officials. \nAbrams pleaded guilty in 1991 to concealing knowledge of the scheme to sell arms illegally to Iran and divert the profits to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua. \nAbrams was pardoned by President George H.W.
