There are lots of “Bonjour’s!” and small talk with her neighbors. Emma Watson , of course, sounds as lovely as ever . But here some of the differences from the animated version start becoming more apparent. The schoolboys and a teacher sneer while girls and women resent her—a long way from the quizzical musings vocalized in the animated version. On the other hand, some small omissions from the song that fans have already noticed—a verbal ”Marie, the baguettes!” is missing, for one—might take some getting used to.
