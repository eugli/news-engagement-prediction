The exhibit currently is closed but reopens to the public on Saturday, March 18. Bob Shryock nj.com \nGaines, his wife Lorna and other family members traveled cross-country by train to visit sites he found long forgotten in Gloucester County. \n\"I was lost the first two days,\" Gaines said via cell phone heading home near Reno, Nevada. \nA will-o-the-wisp sprinter for legendary coach Charlie Way at the then-new Clearview Regional High School, Gaines helped lead the Pioneers to a slew of team championships. Peanut had lobbied to be one of the team's half-milers. But when Way told him Clearview had enough half-milers, Gaines became simply Gloucester County's all-time top sprinter. \nHe still ranks as the youngest inductee ever in the Gloucester County Sports Hall of Fame and is a member of the hall's charter class. \nPeanut burst on the scene as a 15-year-old in a big way, tying the world record in the 60-yard dash in an AAU meet (5.9) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the time, track meet times were measured in yards, not meters as they are today. \nAlthough his duals with Kingsway's Eddie Johns were classics, Gaines was virtually unbeatable in the 100 and 220. More than 5,000 fans turned out to watch the Gaines-Johns showdown at Deptford High in the county meet in 1967. \nGaines challenged the immortal Jesse Owens' best times in the 100-yard dash on numerous occasions and was nearly proficient in the 220 as he was in the 100. His many achievements include running a 20.6 in the 220 which at the time tied a national record. \nPeanut is retired and resides in Manteca, Calfornia. \nHe has provided coaching advice, worked with sprinters, and helped basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain hone his track team. \nHe is still remembered, however, for his blistering speed in the dashes, setting a litany of records including a 9.1 clocking for San Jose State in a pre-Olympic trial meet, and three 9.3s. Is best time in a county meet was a 9.3. \n\"I enjoy reliving those days,\" Gaines says. \"But now I just walk and fish.\" \nBob Shryock may be reached at .
