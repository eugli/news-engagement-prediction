One of those double-sized hits. Sugar-free, of course. \nIt's become quite the ritual. And whenever I do so each week, much like the can of Coke or Pepsi my body screams is necessary at exactly 2pm each day, I feel a pang of guilt that I'm damaging my insides in an irreversible way. \nThat guilt stems from multiple sources, such as the fear-inducing tales of otherwise healthy young people having heart attacks, most probably due to excessive overconsumption. \nAnd then there are other more-reliable sources such as Arianna Huffington's latest book, The Sleep Revolution , in which she shares that of the 10 bestselling soft drinks in the US, eight contain caffeine. \nREAD MORE: * Freeloaders and table hogs - the etiquette of working from a cafe \nShe adds: \"Our workdays, especially in the afternoon, have a way of taking on a survivalist tinge – how, we ask ourselves, are we going to make it through the rest of the day, trekking with flagging energy through enemy territory mined with meetings, emails, and expanding to-do lists? So we squirrel away provisions – usually unhealthy ones – and, like addicts, we think about where that next shot of caffeine or that next sugar bomb is going to come from. \n\"Our addiction to energy drinks is making us sick,\" she warns, while listing a series of unpleasant side effects such as \"nausea, vomiting, tremors, nervousness, delirium, seizures, altered heart rhythms, mood changes, diarrhoea, increased blood pressure, and kidney problems\", adding that emergency room visits involving energy drinks have doubled in the US in recent years. \nHer solution is to instead take a 20-minute nap, and she provides scientific data to back up her recommendation. But fresh scientific evidence calls into question the vigorous way she has written off this all-too-common vice. \nResearchers from the University of Illinois have investigated a range of \"micro-break activities\" among employees. These are the activities we engage in that take just a minute or two of our day but serve a vital purpose: they help us to momentarily recover from the stressors and demands we face. Or do they? \nThe scholars looked at four categories in particular: \n- Relaxation exercises like stretching and walking. - Social interactions such as chatting and texting. - Cognitive tasks like watching news clips and surfing the web. - Nutritional consumption such as snacks and beverages. \nAll but the cognitive tasks were found to reduce the amount of negativity the participants felt at the end of a hectic day at work. In other words, relaxing, socialising and eating/drinking made it easier to deal with a challenging job. \nBut not all eating and drinking is made equal. The researchers split that category into two. Caffeinated beverages in one; snacks and non-caffeinated beverages in the other. By doing so, it became evident that it was the caffeinated beverages that significantly moderated the stress of a stressful day. In contrast, food and caffeine-free drinks didn't have a positive influence at all. \nThe researchers suggest that might be because a dose of caffeine prevents us from being negatively affected by the energy depleting consequences of sleep deprivation. We end up feeling less tired and more alert, both of which have ongoing benefits in relation to productivity and mood control. \nNot all eating and drinking is made equal. \nThey even go so far as to recommend that organisations \"consider stocking office pantries with readily available caffeinated beverages for their employees' refreshment\". \nThey caution, though, that any short-term advantages may be dwarfed by disadvantages, such as the cumulative impact of disrupted sleep. In which case, maybe Huffington is right: a nap at lunch may be better. \n- James Adonis is the author of Employee Enragement - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:38:47.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
