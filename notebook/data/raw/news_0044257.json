Like I said, it’s 2017 and it’s time for things to start changing,” Brave Rock said.\nThey hope that the issue will raise awareness of the need for open discussion and more understanding, education and consultation in the future.\nAnother awareness event is planned for March 21, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\n(With files from CTV Lethbridge’s Terry Vogt) \nPhotos The Carriage House Theatre in Cardston is apologizing over culturally insensitive characters and images in their production of Peter Pan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:19:37.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
