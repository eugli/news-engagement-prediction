Theresa May, she who once sported a “ This is what a feminist looks like ” T-shirt, presides over a rabble of men who clearly feel they can behave appallingly towards female colleagues. Men behaving badly is just the rough and tumble of politics and really we should all relax and accept it.\nPart of the wider shift to the right is a reassertion of power-grabbing masculinity, usually performed for other men. Thus the bantering of the banterful is just the way of the world, and the ways of the world are sexist. For this is mostly where the bants go.\nLast week, there was an incident between Brexit secretary David Davis and Labour MP Diane Abbott in the Stranger’s Bar in parliament after the vote on article 50. Apparently, he was merely congratulating her for voting on the same side as the government. This man is one of our chief Brexit negotiators and it was reported that he tried to kiss or embrace her , to which she apparently told him to fuck off. Legendary banter or real edge? Witnesses seem confused. Davis claims it was light–hearted. It’s unlikely that Abbott was feeling particularly light-hearted after the vote.\nLast week Sir Nicholas Soames started 'woofing' when SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh was speaking in the house\nDavis’s subsequent text messages have now been made public, where he says he wouldn’t hug Abbott because “I am not blind”. Well, this is hilarious isn’t it? Harassment isn’t harassment if the man deems the woman not to be worthy of it. If Davis found Abbott to his taste, would it then be fine to lurch at her? At what point are women free of these judgments, this unwanted sexualised attention?\nHarriet Harman, who detailed in her autobiography the groping and creepiness she has endured during her long career, was accused in a headline in the Daily Mail of destroying “the good names of the men she says sexually harassed her”. That’s what matters. This is what happens when women speak out.\nNever mind what goes on behind closed doors, what happened years ago and what can be proved, what we are seeing now is the open and public humiliation of female MPs in plain sight. Take Channel 4 political correspondent, Michael Crick, who tweeted a cruel jibe made about Abbott by a London cabbie just to make a point about Jeremy Corbyn. And now it is OK for Davis to make her the butt of a joke in front of his friends.\nOne does not have to be a fan of Abbott – and I am not – to see that she probably knows more about being publicly insulted and sneered at than most. The level of abuse that is aimed at her has always been vast, but is now openly and swaggeringly racist. The tropes of misogynoir are easy to see: the black woman is both always desirable and undesirable, and reduced to a sexual identity. Currently a Conservative councillor has been suspended for portraying her as an ape wearing lipstick. Alan Pearmain retweeted this completely unacceptable message, added a comment, and is being investigated. “Can you tell me what’s wrong with this tweet?” he has said.\nWhy was Pearmain not sacked instantly? Is racist conduct now acceptable? The intensity of the abuse around her is not simply about her voting the wrong way over article 50, as many Labour MPs did. It is absolutely shot through with undisguised racism as well as sexism.\nDavid Davis apologises for insulting Diane Abbott in text message Read more\nLess jolly is the reality: every day Abbott deals with rape and death threats and remarks about her appearance and skin colour. These insults are not about her politics but her person, and the nasty racist scorn flows freely online and in some parts of the media. This is shocking. The climate now accommodates racism as being somehow natural, ordinary and something that its victims simply have to tolerate. If not challenged, it is given permission. Black MP Dawn Butler has spoken about how in a members-only lift at the House of Commons, a fellow MP told her “This lift really isn’t for cleaners” . Commons Speaker John Bercow may indeed make valiant speeches about parliament standing against the racism and sexism that Trump represents, but there are scant signs of this lately.\nLast week Sir Nicholas Soames started “woofing” or making barking noises when SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh was speaking in the house. She raised a point of order about his extreme disrespect. Soames had to apologise but insisted it was a “friendly canine salute” because obviously barking at a woman while she’s talking is just normal, right?\nAll these kinds of behaviour are not about colleagues joking with each other. They are about men making women feel uncomfortable. The reports of Abbott recoiling from Davis do not speak of a reciprocal and jovial situation. If banter is not consensual, it is actually bullying. And that is what we are witnessing here: the bullying of women in public life online, in bars, in the houses of parliament, in plain sight. And it really isn’t funny.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35685169", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4190332/She-destroys-good-names-men-says-harassed-her.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2016/07/12/fawcett-large_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0KR0mFzPADe05KFNpQO5hEzASqQtldMMI18Dt0Owy5Y.PNG", "https://twitter.com/michaellcrick/status/732536988474220544", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38801422"], "published": "2017-02-13T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:08:13.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
