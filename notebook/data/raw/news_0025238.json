Source: Supplied \nTheir spirits couldn’t be dampened, not even when one of Ellen’s staffers walked me to the front of the queue where they’d been lining up for hours and explained to them that I was a VIP. \nI did get one filthy look; but who knows, that could have been a case of resting bitch face. \nAs a group we were then escorted across the road and into the studio that Ellen’s show is filmed in. \nAfter passing through the metal detectors at the security station, we were all taken into Ellen’s gift shop which sells everything from drink bottles to shoes and of course, Ellen branded undies. \nPop music was blasting through the speakers in the gift shop area and even though we weren’t even on the set yet, the dancing had already begun. \nThe female audience members started shaking their hips as they introduced themselves to complete strangers and snapped selfies with large Ellen posters on the wall. So many undies. Source: Supplied Inside the gift shop waiting area. Source: Supplied \nTo quote Dennis Denuto from The Castle , “it’s just the vibe of the thing,” and the vibe inside the holding area was electric. \nAfter an hour of waiting and watching some truly memorable ‘mum dancing’, we were finally walked up some stairs and into the studio audience seats on Ellen’s set. \nThe first thing I noticed was how small it is in real life compared to how big it looks on TV. \nThe second thing I noticed was just how bloody cold it was. \nThey probably crank the aircon to counteract the heat generated from the huge number of lights that hang from the studio ceiling. But then again, they could just be trying to cool us down as we danced non-stop, waiting for the comedian herself to appear. A cheeky photo of us entering Ellen’s studio. Source: Supplied \nBefore long an audience warm-up guy walked on stage to pump up the crowd but seriously, his job could not have been more redundant. \nWe were already frothing. \nThe warm-up guy walked us through some basic instructions: You aren’t allowed to take photos but you are allowed (and encouraged) to laugh and clap as loudly as humanly possible. \nHe also asked us if we knew what Ellen liked to do after opening the show and in unison the women around me screamed back, “DANCE!” \nAnd with that the crowd were off again, twisting and twostepping in the aisles as music was played over the speakers. \nThe show’s resident DJ, tWitch, was then introduced and you’ll never guess what he did. Yep, he danced. \nPutting on a little show, he showed off an impressive array of moves as he walked through the studio audience challenging people to dance-offs. \nAnd then, about 25 minutes after we had entered the studio and had almost exhausted our repertoire of dance moves, the show was ready to start. \nThe warm-up guy started a count down and the theme music to Ellen’s show kicked in. \nIf I thought the audience was amped before, it was nothing to how compared to how they lost their s**t when the superstar herself walked out. \nEven if Jesus himself walked out had onto the stage during a Hillsong gathering, I don’t think the energy in the room would have topped this. \nAfter a long, long standing ovation, we took to our seats to listen to Ellen’s opening monologue. \nAnd then, just as she does at the start of every show, the comedian told tWitch to fire off a song and she danced her way into the studio audience. \nThe show was under way and in the following segments Ellen interviewed 2 Broke Girls star, Beth Behrs, a gay couple from Iraq and there was a performance by the host’s favourite band, The Growlers. I was thinking about these two all weekend. #BeKindToOneAnother pic.twitter.com/nDWmQwTye6 — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 30, 2017 \nThe show was filmed as if it was live, with just a few minutes left in between segments for the commercial breaks. \nDuring the short breaks, Ellen would stay on the set and chat with her producers and practice her opening lines for the upcoming segment. \nAnd what did we, the studio audience, do in those breaks? \nMore bloody dancing. \nAt one stage, the warm-up guy told each row to come up with a dance move and perform it together but unfortunately my row lacked a dominant personality and we spent the entire time staring at each other awkwardly waiting for someone to pick a move. \nAfter just 50 minutes, the taping was over. Ellen said farewell to the cameras but then stayed on set to have a super quick chat to the studio audience. \nShe thanked us for our energy and encouraged us to spread joy out in the world. \nEllen then headed backstage, the lights were dimmed and we all left the studio, not walking, but dancing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:58:09.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
