From Costa Rica 's Pacific coast to Belize 's Caribbean cayes, Central America is an underwater extravaganza. Central America Scuba diving can be challenging enough for experienced Scuba divers; yet beginning Scuba divers are drawn to the inexpensive PADI Scuba diving courses in Central America, and the chance to behold National Geographic-worthy sights on one's very first dive. \nExplore the top destinations for Scuba diving in Central America! 1. The Bay Islands, Honduras \nEach of Honduras 's Caribbean Bay Islands ( Roatan , Utila , and Guanaja ) is a world class Scuba diving destination in its own right. The Bay Islands run alongside the second-largest barrier reef in the world, and the diversity of the islands' undersea species is staggering. Besides dolphins, sea turtles , nurse sharks and manta rays, whale sharks are frequent visitors. While Bay Islands Scuba diving is some of the world's best, the prices are some of the world's cheapest: an open water certification at Utila Dive Center is just $229, and includes accommodations at the Mango Inn .

Isla del Coco, Costa Rica Costa Rica 's Coco Island, the largest uninhabited island in the world, is not for day-trip Scuba divers. Because the Coco National Park is over 300 miles offshore, it takes a day and a half on a live-aboard dive boat just to reach it. But for hardcore divers, the voyage is worth it - Central America scuba diving truly doesn't get any better than this. Undisputed dive expert Jacques Cousteau famously called diving at Isla del Coco the best in the world. As added attraction, Jurassic Park was set in Coco National Park (though it was filmed in Hawaii). Venture inland for a truly wild experience - minus the dinosaurs, of course. James Foley 3. The Corn Islands, Nicaragua Nicaragua 's Little Corn Island is largely unspoiled, absent of cars or high-rise resorts. As a result, Scuba diving at Little Corn Island remains sensational - rated a 9 out of 10 by National Geographic . According to Dive Little Corn , \"the island's reef offers a variety of unique diving adventures, from caves and caverns to un-chummed shark encounters … and virtually every reef fish classified as Tropical Caribbean .\" But don't overlook Scuba diving at Big Corn Island . The Nautilus Dive Center offers Scuba, snorkel, and glass bottom boat trips, in which you can \"enjoy the tropical splendor of the Caribbean as it was 30 years ago.\" 4. Ambergris Caye, Belize \nAmbergris Caye in Belize shares the same Caribbean coral reef as the Bay Islands in Honduras The most popular dive site is Hol Chan Marine Reserve , occupying three square miles off Ambergris Caye's southern tip .

Hol Chan, the Blue Hole and beyond can also be accessed through dive operators on nearby Caye Caulker . More » 5. Playas del Coco, Costa Rica \nNot to be confused with Isla del Coco, Playas del Coco is a popular beach in the Guanacaste region of northern Costa Rica . Playas del Coco is a great launch pad to explore the nearby Catalina Islands (manta ray territory) and the Bat Islands (bull sharks galore), while the curvy Coco Bay offers low-key Costa Rica Scuba diving. Because of Playas del Coco's popularity with all types of travelers, accommodations are available for every budget. 6. Turneffe Atoll, Belize \nThe largest atoll in the Caribbean, Belize 's Turneffe Atoll is comprised of over 200 islands, sheltering innumerable tropical species from rough waves.

According to one of the atoll's top on-site Scuba diving operators, Turneffe Flats , the atoll is home to \"all of the Caribbean tropicals, eagle rays, sharks, turtles, dolphins, moray eels, and occasionally whale sharks in addition to large schools of permit, horse eye jacks and dog snapper.\" In addition, the Lighthouse Atoll and the Great Blue Hole are about an hour away. 7. Bocas del Toro, Panama \nFor excellent Central America Scuba diving year-round, many divers head to Central America's southernmost nation, Panama. The Bocas del Toro islands in Panama offer some of the country's best diving , from popular dive sites Hospital Point and Coral Cay to the nearby Zapatillas Cays.

Isla del Caño, Costa Rica \nJust 12 miles offshore, Isla del Caño is like Isla del Coco's closer - and cheaper - little sister. Says Caño Divers : \"You can see many of the same species at Caño Island [as you would at Coco Island]. You will encounter both pelagic (open ocean) and reef fish … large schools of jacks and barracudas, sting rays and manta rays, and sharks.\" Caño Divers ventures to Caño every morning from Drake Bay , on the northern side of the Osa Peninsula in southern Costa Rica .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:02:20.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
