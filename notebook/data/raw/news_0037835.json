It was Donald's,\" Trump family friend Phillip Bloch told US Weekly. \" Truthfully, it's a lot to cope with.\"\nTrump has spent most of her time since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 in the $100 million Trump Tower penthouse on Fifth Avenue, where her 10-year-old son Barron has a whole floor to himself, the New York Post noted .\nPresident Trump's team recently insisted that she come to Washington and help give her husband a PR boost by attending the traditional first lady tours at the White House and pose for photos.\n\"She was told, ‘All you need to do is show up on one day and take photos,'\" a Trump family source said. Melania declined, however.\nThe first lady also could not be persuaded to accompany the Japanese prime minister's wife, Akie Abe, on the traditionally first lady-hosted Capitol tour for spouses visiting dignitaries.\nNegative press from late night hosts–including Jimmy Kimmel, who joked that she is \"trapped like Rapunzel\" in Trump Tower–has made the situation worse. Trump has also been fighting a libel suit against the Daily Mail , which she sued for implying she previously worked as a high-end escort. The publication later retracted the claim.\nCelebrities and fashion designers who are critical of the president's policies have publicly criticized the Trump family. Although the first lady is fluent in five languages, she is self-conscious of her heavy Slovenian accent, which comedians have mocked, according to US Weekly .\nWith pickets surrounding her building, Trump has given up her chauffeured trips escorting Barron to and from his private school.\n\"Melania has the Secret Service take Barron to and from his private school,\" a source said.\nAfter school, they both stay in, with Barron doing his homework while they watch cartoons, according to US Weekly. \nTrump is reportedly happier at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where she joins the president on many weekends.\nWhile she did entertain Akie Abe in Florida, and smiled in photos at Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Delray Beach, it was a struggle for her.\n\"Don't let her smile fool you,\" the family source said. \"She hates this.\"\n  Politics and tagged Donald Trump , White House  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:11:19.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
