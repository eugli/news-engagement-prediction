The initiative is part of the NHL’s Hockey Is For Everyone month – a chance to celebrate the game and its diversity. ‘There’s really no reason not to’: Oilers captain on marching in Edmonton Pride Parade \nTeams across the league will be holding You Can Play nights in an effort to show their support for the LGBTQ community and show young players that hockey is a safe and welcoming environment. \nIn a news release, the Oilers said, “In the spirit of inclusion, it’s even more fitting that our You Can Play Night falls on Valentine’s Day, a celebration of love and affection.” \n“As leaders in the community, on Feb. 14 the Oilers will bring attention and awareness to Hockey Is For Everyone month during You Can Play Night to help ensure that hockey truly is for everyone,” Oilers Entertainment Group Vice-Chairman Kevin Lowe added. \nFormer Oilers Captain Andrew Ference says supporting and recognizing the LGBTQ community is long overdue. \n“It’s about time we take a stand and talk about this and make this a comfortable situation for everybody.” \nGrowing up in Sherwood Park, Ference played hockey with guys who have since come out to him. He learned how they were forced to live a lie for virtually half their life, quitting the sport out of fear. \n“I don’t know if I would have (shown support) at that age because I didn’t have any mentors I could look up to that were talking about this.” \nThat’s exactly what You Can Play Night is all about. \nThe Oilers have teamed up with You Can Play, an organization dedicated to equality, respect and safety for athletes regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Essentially: if you can play, you can play. As part of the @NHL 's #HockeyIsForEveryone initiative, the #Oilers will host @YouCanPlayTeam Night on Feb. 14 vs. Arizona. https://t.co/C8Li3woDGG \n— Edmonton Oilers (@EdmontonOilers) February 1, 2017 \nWatch below: As part of a month-long NHL campaign called “Hockey is for Everyone,” the Edmonton Oilers will be hosting You Can Play Night on Valentine’s Day. Kent Morrison reports. \nEvan Asmussen understands message first hand. He’s won a National Championship with the Alberta Golden Bears Men’s Curling Team and a World Junior Curling Championship. \nLocker rooms can be a scary place for closeted gay athletes, which is why it’s important to know that there are supports in place. \n“I know for us to perform our best, we need to be comfortable in our environments in which we’re performing.” \nEvery day in February, Hockey Is For Everyone activities will focus awareness on LGBTQ, ethnicity and gender equality, socio-economic status and those living with disabilities. \n“Our clubs, our players and our fans are committed to welcoming everyone to hockey,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. “While the NHL family strives for diversity and inclusiveness all year long, February is Hockey Is For Everyone month, which will highlight, on a daily basis, the many ways our sport brings greater attention, heightened awareness and broader opportunities.” \nIn a news release, the league explained You Can Play Nights will feature ceremonial puck drops, anthem singers, hometown heroes and Pride Tape during the pre-game warm-up. \nThe Edmonton Oilers Community Foundation will auction off those limited-edition autographed sticks at a later date.
