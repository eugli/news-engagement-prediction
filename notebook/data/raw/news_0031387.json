Amy Jackson’s phone gets hacked, personal pictures leaked ) \nMid-Day quoted a source saying, “The phone’s automatic sync was on, as a result of which all photographs clicked by her were getting saved on iCloud. She was in her hometown, London, when she couldn’t log into her account for a few days and went to a local store for help. However, it was on February 7 when two pictures with her best friend having dinner appeared online that she realised her phone was hacked. She went to the service centre again before coming to India.” Jackson also spoke to the daily about it saying, “I was shocked when this happened. This isn’t a trivial matter and has to be taken up seriously. I will register a complaint with the cyber crime cell in London and ensure the hackers are taken to task. Cyber safety is the need of the hour.” She also plans to lodge a complaint in Mumbai’s cyber cell. \nOn the work front, Amy is gearing up for her next movie 2.0 which also stars Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar in the lead roles. She will be in Bombay for the next 15 days to complete the shooting schedule of the film.
