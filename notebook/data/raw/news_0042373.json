And we said, ‘Yeah go, of course’,” Johnson explained. Kieren Foran and Shaun Johnson of the Warriors. Source: News Corp Australia \n“So we just all dropped our rods and headed in. On this fishing charter boat there’s two levels and we were all around the edge, everyone was looking in every direction. \n“We thought, ‘Oh man we’re never going to find him’.” \nA police helicopter, a rescue boat and other vessels were searching for the man when Warriors player Matt Allwood spotted something in the water. \n“I went over and told the boat’s captain and we went in that direction, when (the man) came visible to us,” Allwood said. \n“He looked a bit buggered, he was tired. We yelled out and told him we were there and to keep swimming.” \nThe man was pulled onto the deck of the police boat alive. \n“We were all just standing there in silence. Then a radio call came through and said ‘good job boys, this is him’ and we just went off. We just went crazy,” Johnson said.
