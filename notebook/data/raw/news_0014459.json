She has the new presidency for all her weight loss needs.\nThe “Girls” star revealed Monday that she’s been losing weight since Election Night over her concerns for the country.\n“Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food,” Dunham told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM show.\n“Everyone’s been asking like, ‘What have you been doing?’ And I’m like, ‘Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight.”\nDunham was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter during the election season, even threatening to move to Canada if Trump won — she hasn’t followed through yet.\n“Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight,” Dunham said about President Trump.
