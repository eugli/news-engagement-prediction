Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: Angkor Wat, Cambodia: Angkor Wat was a massive city with a vast network of roads, houses, canals, ponds and temples across the Cambodian countryside. Hide Caption 1 of 24 Photos: Rome, Italy: The Colosseum -- a nearly 2,000-year-old stadium in the middle of a modern city -- is one of the sites that reminds visitors of Rome's glorious (and gruesome) old era. Hide Caption 2 of 24 Photos: Istanbul, Turkey: Istanbul's historic core of Hagia Sophia sits a short stroll away from the Ottoman Empire's Topkapi Palace (pictured here), which houses artifacts including Moses's staff. Hide Caption 3 of 24 Photos: Bagan, Myanmar: Long hidden from international view by Myanmar's military government, the treasures of Bagan -- an 11th-century complex of more than 2,000 Buddhist temples -- is built along the Irrawaddy River. Hide Caption 4 of 24 Photos: Tikal, Guatemala: Hidden in the jungles of Guatemala, Tikal was a Mayan citadel that reflects more than 1,000 years of cultural achievements starting from 600 BC. The structure in the picture is one of the most important temples in the site -- Tikal Temple I, or Temple of the Great Jaguar. Hide Caption 5 of 24 Photos: Cairo, Egypt: In addition to the pyramids of Giza in the outskirt of the city, Cairo city boasts a history of over 1,000 years. The picture shows a view of Al-Mu'izz al-Din Illah Street, one of the most important historical streets in the Islamic quarter of Cairo. Hide Caption 6 of 24 Photos: Persopolis, Iran: As Iran slowly reopens to Western tourism, Persepolis is regaining its allure for visitors. The city was founded in 518 BC by Darius I, ruler of ancient Persia's Achaemenian Empire, and grew in grandeur until Alexander the Great sacked it two centuries later. Hide Caption 7 of 24 Photos: Kyoto, Japan: As imperial Japan's capital for more than 1,000 years, Kyoto has found a way to respectfully preserve its old traditions while eagerly embracing the new. There are more than 1,000 well-preserved Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in the city. Hide Caption 8 of 24 Photos: Beijing, China: China's capital city has invested heavily in eye-popping modern architecture over the last two decades, but no new building speaks splendor like the city's historic heritage sites, including the Forbidden City. Hide Caption 9 of 24 Photos: Great Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe: As the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe grew into a trading empire from the 11th century, a royal complex expanded creating a terraced palace. Today, massive walls and narrow passages -- usually deserted -- still stand on the hilltop at Great Zimbabwe. Hide Caption 10 of 24 Photos: Timbuktu, Mali: Before the Sahara nearly swallowed the city, and before French colonialists swept through, Timbuktu was one of the world's most important centers of learning. Caretakers of the remaining manuscripts still use the same techniques to preserve them as the original librarians. Hide Caption 11 of 24 Photos: Machu Picchu, Peru: Sitting 8,000 feet high in the Andes, the mysterious Machu Picchu -- built more than 500 years ago -- attracts thousands of visitors a day. Hide Caption 12 of 24 Photos: Athens, Greece: Athens' ancient monuments have found remarkable ways to coexist with modern Athens. Cafes and shops can be found in walkable neighborhood streets below the Acropolis (pictured here), making the ruins a part of Athenians' everyday lives. Hide Caption 13 of 24 Photos: Petra, Jordan: With a history dating back to around 300 BC, Petra is known for its magnificent buildings carved into red sandstone cliffs. Gorges and canyons surround the ancient city, creating a maze of passages that helped keep it secret from Europeans for centuries. Hide Caption 14 of 24 Photos: Ellora, India: Ellora was carved out of the mountains, and this Indian monastic complex remains relatively unknown. The temples include Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina holy sites that were built over 400 years, beginning in the 6th century. Hide Caption 15 of 24 Photos: Xian, China: China's ancient capital city is home to the famous Terracotta Warriors -- thousands of clay soldiers that fill the mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. With excavation works still underway, it's one of the great archeological finds of all time. Hide Caption 16 of 24 Photos: Madurai, India: In the heart of Madurai -- once an important capital city of Tamil -- sits Meenakshi Amman Temple, one of India's holiest sites. The current structure was built in the 1600s, with 14 gateway towers guarding the shrines covered in vibrant colors. Hide Caption 17 of 24 Photos: Poverty Point, Louisiana: Largely unknown even to Americans, Poverty Point in Louisiana achieved the height of early human civilization in North America -- a complex trade hub reaching its greatest heights around 3,500 BC. It was built and used by hunters, fishermen and gatherers -- even though farming hadn't been established yet. Hide Caption 18 of 24 Photos: Borobudur, Indonesia: The ninth-century Buddhist temple complex of Borobudur is the most visited site in Indonesia. The complex, completed in the early 800s, lay covered under volcanic ash and jungle for centuries until it was revealed in the early 1800s. Hide Caption 19 of 24 Photos: Takht-i-Bahi, Pakistan: This Buddhist monastery was built in the first century, but fell out of use a mere 600 years later. Its hilltop location protected it against a succession of invasions, until the British came through and hauled off most of the surviving treasures. Meditation chambers here were once used by monks who brought Tantric traditions to this part of the world. Hide Caption 20 of 24 Photos: Stonehenge, England: It's believed that this prehistoric stone circle could have been built as much as 5,000 years ago and construction may have spanned over 1,500 years. The method by which the giant stones were transported here is still a mystery. Hide Caption 21 of 24 Photos: Gondar, Ethiopia: The capital of the old Ethiopian Empire, Gondar suffered under repeated invasions from the mid-1800s. However several castles and churches -- including Fasil Ghebbi, a royal citadel pictured here -- remain, offering a look into one of the few medieval African cities that's still alive today. Hide Caption 22 of 24 Photos: Nimrud, Iraq: The capital of Nimrud, the world's first empire, was once a formidable city with massive palaces and temples to gods of war and writing. Ivory furniture, carved stone slabs, gold jewelry and crowns were all buried inside. Hide Caption 23 of 24 Photos: Nimrud, Iraq: However, much of this irreplaceable art and architecture has recently been destroyed by ISIS. Hide Caption Some ancient sites that have survived for centuries are troubled today From Asia and Europe to the Americas and Africa, these sites provide history lessons (CNN) Ancient sites that have survived centuries, or even millennia, haven't fared so well in the 21st century. The destruction at Palmyra in Syria, the Buddhas at Bamiyan in Afghanistan, and Nimrud's ruins outside Mosul in Iraq show how precarious the future can be. Here are 23 places that offer glimpses into humanity's past, and the ingenuity that people brought to creating wonders without computers or heavy machinery. While some are recognizable, others are easily accessible but lesser known. Angkor Wat, Cambodia Read More Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Angkor Wat – So beautiful, so misunderstood. To get this sunrise shot, you're going to be fighting with a few hundred other tourists, all crowded around Angkor Wat's moat. Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Morning ceremony – Monks from the nearby temple can often be seen conducting Buddhist ceremonies inside Angkor Wat. Hide Caption 2 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Ta Reach – Many tourists walk right by this statue close to the west entrance of Angkor Wat without realizing its significance, says Alison Carter, who works with the Greater Angkor Project. It's a large Neak Ta (local ancestor spirit) called Ta Reach. \"I actually think this statue and its place in the community over hundreds of years is so interesting,\" she says. \"The statue is likely of Vishnu (it's not clear), but inhabited by this powerful local spirit.\" Hide Caption 3 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Bayon Temple – The faces of Angkor's Bayon Temple are believed to be representations of King Jayavarman VII, who ordered the construction of the temple in the 12th century. Hide Caption 4 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Bas-reliefs – \"At the Bayon, everyone marches up to see the faces towers -- and they are great -- but I think the bas-reliefs encircling the lower levels of the temple are a real treat, especially those showing scenes from daily life,\" says Carter. Hide Caption 5 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Ta Prohm – You didn't think you'd have the place to yourself, did you? Thanks to a little-known actress called Angelina Jolie and the film \"Tomb Raider,\" this Angkor temple, famed for the large fig, banyan and kapok trees that are 'choking' the ruins, endures the bulk of visitors to the area. Hide Caption 6 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Ta Prohm – Some parts of Ta Prohm are blocked off to tourists. Archaeologists have had to strengthen certain sections of the ruins with supports out of fear they would collapse. Hide Caption 7 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Sunsets in Angkor – In an effort to help tourists avoid sunset scenes like this, website Angkorsunsets.com, set up by the Cambodian authorities, offers suggested alternatives. Hide Caption 8 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Banteay Srei – Made of red sandstone, Banteay Srei is one of the oldest surviving temples in the Angkor area. Famous for its intricate and well-preserved carvings, it dates to the 10th century. Archaeologist Roland Fletcher recommends visiting the Angkor sites in chronological order to get a better understanding of how the area developed. Hide Caption 9 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Hidden art – Noel Hidalgo Tan discovered these paintings of deities, animals and musical instruments on the walls of Cambodia's Angkor Wat in 2010. This photo shows the image after it was processed with software that helps to distinguish between similar color shades. Researchers said they've known about the paintings for some time, but the software allowed them to really get a good look at the detail in them. Hide Caption 10 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Before – This was the original photo, before Tan used software to accentuate the colors. He said there are many walls with paint traces in Angkor Wat for those who want to give it a try themselves. Hide Caption 11 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for The dinosaur mystery – Stegosaurus fossil? Proof that man walked the earth with dinosaurs? You can make your own call at Ta Prohm. The small carving, well-known to most guides, can be found in a doorway with other non-prehistoric creatures, including monkeys and birds. Hide Caption 12 of 13 Photos: Exploring Angkor: What to watch for Show your teeth – \"The Devata [goddesses] at Angkor Wat do all seem to be quite distinct from one another, leading several people to speculate they might be portraits of real people,\" says Carter. Case in point, this one-of-a-kind smiling lady, found near an entrance gate at Angkor Wat. You won't find another Apsara or Devata carving among the thousands at Angkor that shows her teeth says Cambodian guide Tong Hann. Hide Caption 13 of 13 In the 12th century, the Khmer took their vast understanding of the known universe and sought to recreate it in miniature. The result was Angkor Wat, a sprawling city designed to impress with meticulously arranged moats and towers, and walls covered in astonishingly detailed bas reliefs of Hindu deities. The ancient Khmer took a broad view of scenes worth preserving. While many are celestial or holy in theme, other murals detail mundane acts like preparing supper. Angkor Wat stretches over 500 acres within the Angkor Archeological Park, a large area covering more than 150 square miles. The main temple receives packs of tourists, but many lesser-known temples offer a chance to wander through old Khmer capitals, which were built from the 9th century onwards. MORE: Angkor Wat travel tips and advice Rome, Italy Visiting a city as beloved as Rome comes with particular hazards: the crowds, the cheesy souvenirs, the young men in full gladiator regalia waiting to pose for selfies with tourists. And yet there are few places like it. Take the Colosseum -- a nearly 2,000-year-old stadium in the middle of a modern city. In the days of actual gladiators, 50,000 spectators would gather with the emperor for bloody contests to the death. The Colosseum had the original retractable roof, a whizz-bang contraption called a velarium that used sail technology to rig canopies to shelter crowds from sun and rain. And we've not even mentioned the Vatican, the catacombs or the Forum. Istanbul, Turkey Istanbul loves to depict itself as the city straddling two continents. What's most remarkable is the way the city straddles great periods of history that pile up and fold over themselves more naturally than anywhere else in the world. Construction by successive empires from Byzantium to Constantinople to modern Turkey have bequeathed Istanbul an instantly recognizable skyline that merges elements from all those eras. In the historic core around the iconic Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine-era Hippodrome circus sits a short stroll away from the Ottoman Empire's Topkapi Palace, which houses artifacts including Moses's staff. Surrounding it all is a thriving modern city with top-notch dining, galleries and architecture that make Istanbul one of the world's most important cultural centers. Bagan, Myanmar Less crowded than Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu, but just as magical. Long hidden from international view by Myanmar's military government, the treasures of Bagan are returning to the spotlight as political reforms open up the country. Here, over 2,000 Buddhist temples fill a plain along the Irrawaddy River, creating an ethereal landscape. The crowds remain far smaller and more adventurous than the tour groups that fill Angkor Wat or Machu Picchu. Myanmar is still finding itself after decades of civil war and international isolation, which makes this 11th-century temple city all the more magical. The kingdom that reigned here was destroyed by earthquakes and Kublai Khan's invaders, but the quiet temples retain a spiritual air that's impossible to ignore. READ: Myanmar's Megui Archipelago: Sailing through one of Earth's last paradises Tikal, Guatemala Hidden in the jungles of Guatemala, Tikal was a Mayan citadel that reflects more than 1,000 years of cultural achievements beginning from 600 BC. Jaguars and pumas prowl the surrounding wilderness, but the palaces, temples and plazas within the site represent some of the earliest pinnacles of human achievement. The stepped pyramids are icons of Mayan culture that rise above the canopy. Equally impressive are the sporting courts, temples and palaces that ring the main plaza. Most of the ancient causeways that link Tikal's 3,000 structures have been cleared of vegetation, so visitors can now wander among the buildings much as the ancients did. Cairo, Egypt For first-time visitors, it's a shock just how close the pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx are to Cairo's chaotic streets. With 22 million people, Cairo is one of the world's biggest cities, built around one of humanity's earliest urban centers. Tombs at Giza date back 4,500 years, and the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities boasts an incredible collection from the Nile's earliest inhabitants. But the slightly less ancient parts of Cairo are also rich with cultural treasures. The current city was founded more than 1,000 years ago and has one of the world's oldest universities, a rich legacy of Islamic art, and Coptic treasures that are often overlooked.

The city was founded in 518 BC by Darius I, ruler of ancient Persia's Achaemenian Empire, and grew in grandeur until Alexander the Great sacked it two centuries later. Its most remarkable feature is an immense terrace of 125,000 square feet, partially carved out of Mount Kuh-e Rahmat (the Mountain of Mercy). Rulers built ever more regal palaces, temples and halls around the terrace, complete with an underground sewage system and cisterns for fresh water. Despite a series of protective walls, rising to 30 feet high, Alexander laid waste to Persepolis, whose ruins were only rediscovered in 1618. Today, however, the city is one of the best examples of ancient architecture, especially for the slender columns that remain. Kyoto, Japan Kyoto cool: Japan's former capital preserves old traditions. If Tokyo represents the part of Japan obsessed with technology and the future, Kyoto is the part that rakes sand in Zen gardens and performs graceful tea ceremonies. That's not entirely fair -- Nintendo is based in Kyoto, just one part of the city's thriving tech scene. Perhaps closer to the truth is that as imperial Japan's capital for more than 1,000 years, Kyoto has found a way to respectfully preserve its old traditions while eagerly embracing the new as well. More than 1,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines temper the frenetic pace of modern life. Since the city was largely spared bombing during World War II, most are still in use. MORE: Inside Guide: Best of Kyoto Beijing, China China has invested heavily in eye-popping modern architecture for its capital over the last two decades, but with a past that stretches more than 3,000 years, the city has a deep history providing a rich legacy of art, architecture and education. Just visiting the city's six UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, could take a week. That would barely allow even a casual glance at the treasures inside the city's 144 museums and galleries, much less the alleyways of the hutongs, old neighborhoods reinvented and sometimes rebuilt as a trendy center of the Beijing's modern life. Great Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe From the 11th century, this kingdom in southeastern Zimbabwe grew into a trading empire that stretched through the African interior and across the Indian Ocean. A royal complex grew on a hilltop, with drystone architecture creating a terraced palace with fruit trees, hidden chambers and stunning views over the king's dominion. Below, the towering walls of the Great Enclosure surround a conical tower that's become a national symbol. Overpopulation and deforestation caused the kingdom's collapse around 1450 -- historically bad timing as Europeans soon began arriving to find a weakened polity that was easier to subdue. Great Zimbabwe remains a monumental reminder of Africa's achievements before colonialism. MORE: Great Zimbabwe: The spectacular ancient city that tourism forgot Timbuktu, Mali Before the Sahara nearly swallowed the city and before French colonialists swept through, Timbuktu was one of the world's most important centers of learning. The city's librarians guarded thousands of manuscripts, protecting them against the elements and violence. Many of the manuscripts were evacuated to Mali's capital Bamako during the last period of separatist violence, but the city's unique mosques remain. The three most important ones date as far back as the 14th century. Their earthen architecture requires continuous maintenance, and caretakers today use the same techniques to preserve them as the original builders. Machu Picchu, Peru One of the most popular ancient cities in the world. Nearly 8,000 feet high in the Andes, the Incan citadel of Machu Picchu retains an aura of mystery and majesty even as it welcomes thousands of tourists a day. When the Spanish conquered Peru, Machu Picchu's very existence was kept secret from them. The vast complex was revealed to the outside world in 1911, and quickly became the emblem of Incan achievement. Built more than 500 years ago with drystone construction, the city sits on the saddle between two peaks rising above tropical jungles. Clouds swirl among the ruins, whose significance remains largely unknown. Terraces and ramps skirt the mountains, and the buildings appear to reflect the Inca's sophisticated grasp of astronomy -- though archeologists are still seeking to understand exactly how. Athens, Greece Athens traces its origins back 5,000 years, but the modern city has found remarkable ways to coexist with its iconic ancient monuments. Below the Acropolis, walkable neighborhood streets wind past cafes and shops. Many brim with tourist tchotchkes, but with enough art galleries and good eating mixed among them even the most jaded traveler will be satisfied. Much of the city's social life centers around the monuments, turning the stunning ruins of classical Greece into casual backdrops of Athenians' every day lives. Petra, Jordan This region between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea has been inhabited since the earliest days of humanity, but around 300 BC the rulers of the Nabatean Kingdom laid their claim to cultural greatness by carving magnificent buildings into red sandstone cliffs. Gorges and canyons surround the ancient city, creating a maze of passages that helped keep it secret from Europeans for centuries. Adding to the mystique: no cars are allowed in the ancient city. Visitors who don't want to walk have to hire a camel, donkey or carriage to get around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:13:41.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
