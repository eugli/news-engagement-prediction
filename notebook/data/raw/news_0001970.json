(Supplied: Andrea Fernandez) \n\"Mum's was kind of the first [and] he just fell in love upon first reading her letter,\" she said. \nThe incredible tale was the stuff of family legend, but when Fernandez started developing her skills as a playwright, it became something more. \n\"This idea has been in my head for about the last eight years, and I only really got it onto paper last year with the help of Yirra Yaakin Theatre Company's writers' group,\" she said. \n\"It focuses on that â€” the letters that he sent to India and the responses that he got back.\" \nWhile the musical is based on her parents' story, Fernandez found their caginess about details is leaving plenty of space for imagination. \n\"I keep asking them, 'What did you write to one another?' but they've been very vague, so that's where I've had to be quite creative,\" she said. \nIt has allowed her to mix her Yamitji heritage, with Bollywood styling and American popular culture to portray her parents' rich cultural fusion. \n\"They are a little bit saucy [and] that's why Dirty Dancing has inspired this as well. They're not shy at all,\" she said. From page to stage \nWorkshopping the concept at Yellamundie National First Peoples' Playwriting Festival pushed Fernandez's concept towards production. \nThe event was part of the 2017 Sydney Festival and brought playwrights, dramaturges, producers and actors together to showcase Indigenous playwriting. \n\"During this process at Yellamundie, it [began] turning into a musical and I've started writing music and some songs as well,\" Fernandez said. \nThe developing work had its first public reading and Fernandez said the experience had been a huge boost. \n\"Just being here and the process with a director, dramaturge, and all the actors... it's just flowing out of me, so I'm in the best headspace possible,\" she said. \nFernandez hopes Bollywood Dreaming will be ready for production in 2019. \n\"I'm about 40 pages in, but I reckon it will be another couple of years,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:48:07.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
