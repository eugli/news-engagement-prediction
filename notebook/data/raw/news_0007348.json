We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence.”\nHowever Dirks adds that despite going to “ extraordinary lengths to facilitate planning and preparation for this event,” the efforts were undone by “ 100 armed individuals clad in Ninja-like uniforms who utilized paramilitary tactics to engage in violent destructive behavior designed to shut the event down.”\nSo-called anti fascists group have been known to infiltrate MILO events throughout the tour, with a marxist group as the “Freedom Road Socialist Organisation,” infiltrating protesters at the cancelled event at UC Davis and causing violence.\nPresident Donald Trump condemned the riots, threatening to take away the university’s federal funding if the university “does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view.”\nIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\nWe reported yesterday that the university receives over $370 million in federal funding, over half its budget.\nSince news of the riots broke out, pre-order sales of Breitbart Senior Editor MILO’s upcoming book Dangerous increased by a staggering 12,740% , propelling it to the top of the Amazon best seller list.\nD ANGEROUS is available to pre-order now via Amazon , in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook , on Twitter at @ben_kew , or email him at bkew@breitbart.com\n Education , Milo , Berkeley Riot , Dangerous Faggot Tour , UC Berkeley", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827112633224544256", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQXR1MQ", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fuc-berkeley-chancellor-riots-caused-armed-individuals-ninja-like-uniforms-using-paramilitary-tactics%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=UC+Berkeley+Chancellor%3A+Riots+Caused+by+Armed+Individuals+in+%E2%80%98Ninja-like%E2%80%99+Uniforms+Using+%E2%80%98Paramilitary+Tactics%E2%80%99", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1508238650", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fuc-berkeley-chancellor-riots-caused-armed-individuals-ninja-like-uniforms-using-paramilitary-tactics%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=UC+Berkeley+Chancellor%3A+Riots+Caused+by+Armed+Individuals+in+%E2%80%98Ninja-like%E2%80%99+Uniforms+Using+%E2%80%98Paramilitary+Tactics%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fuc-berkeley-chancellor-riots-caused-armed-individuals-ninja-like-uniforms-using-paramilitary-tactics%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=UC+Berkeley+Chancellor%3A+Riots+Caused+by+Armed+Individuals+in+%E2%80%98Ninja-like%E2%80%99+Uniforms+Using+%E2%80%98Paramilitary+Tactics%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/02/02/campus-condemns-violence-defends-free-speech/", "https://www.google.fr/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=milo+uc+berkeley&tbm=nws", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501173081", "https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/?skip_nax_wizard=true", "https://twitter.com/ben_kew", "https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LPn0heDguhipIA_xT8RtoBQLc8eFnqXvCAhydA4HUU51VcutEKyXHkuP95BL3pej4Y5IBnuZPZkD_VRnkrFeBFXm5F9ktzqv0Q3N84EUfdYX5P-HOsoNLRI4mEyC6t1YbUes9MbwM0KcLx4=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mailtrack.io/trace/mail/898f45683c70baad41abb7e43d34cf9ecdf08150.png?u=347159"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:11:22.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
