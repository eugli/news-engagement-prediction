Being happy and being depressed are not mutually exclusive,\" Sophie, from Birmingham said. Sophie suffers with psychosis but says she is still happy (Photo: Facebook) Sophie during an episode (Photo: Facebook) \nThe video shows Sophie during a psychotic episode, seeing visions of people screaming, covered in blood - but Sophie says when she started filming she had \"calmed down a bit,\" had taken her emergency drugs and had previously been much worse. \nIn an interview with Mirror Online, she explained her trigger before these visions last week was watching a TV programme featuring a man who suffers with paranoid schizophrenia. \nThis set her off, and her mind was filled with visions of people screaming.

I ask myself if there are really people in my house or if the voices I hear are real. \n\"My visions are both reality and fiction at the same time. \n\"In the video I have already taken my emergency medication, so I wasn't as bad as I had been- which is scary.\" \nIn an honest Facebook post she wrote: \"This is the reality of psychotic illnesses. This is the reality for some with bipolar, or bpd, severe depression or schizophrenia (all of which I've been diagnosed with at some point). \n\"Mental illnesses aren't romantic or beautiful or cute. Mental illnesses are scary, terrifying. Mental illnesses aren't a personality trait. Mental illnesses aren't a quirk. And I am not too happy to have one (or several). \n\"Mental illnesses are serious, they're dangerous and ugly. This is the reality of being triggered by something. Being triggered by something can lead to this. This state of pure agony and fear. \n\"Sometimes it involves voices but at a level I can deal with. But sometimes, it's far more aggressive. Sometimes, it makes me believe things that aren't real. \n\"It makes me see things that aren't real. It makes me feel things that aren't real, including physical pain. It makes me relive the worst moments of my life again and again with no escape. But those traumas are mine and I keep them with me at all times, wherever I go.\" Sophie has bravely spoken out about her mental health (Photo: Facebook) Sophie insists she is a smiley, happy person generally (Photo: Facebook) Sophie and her dog (Photo: Facebook) \nSophie explained how tiny her triggers can be. \nJust a few weeks ago somebody said something really small that she disagreed with, but she began obsessing over it for three or four days. \n\"I was crying and shaking. That's not normal behaviour,\" she said. \"It can be something really little that triggers an episode and my vision of reality just changes so quickly.\" \nDespite all of this, Sophie insists she's a happy person generally. \nShe lives with her boyfriend Alex, who she says is an incredible support and really understands that she can be \"ill and not ill at the same time\". \nShe said being happy can be tiring though, and if she has a good day, she can spend the following day in bed. Sophie and her boyfriend Alex who is a huge support to her (Photo: Facebook) \nHer episodes build up over time, and it takes a while reach the stage she's at in the video. \nThe signs normally start with Sophie feeling tired, taking naps during the day, enjoying things less, feeling reluctant to go outside, not caring about her appearance as much, and not wanting to see her friends. \nSophie's psychotic episodes started in January 2016, as it was the anniversary of three personal traumas that had happened in her life. \nShe was then officially diagnosed with psychosis and prescribed anti-psychotic medication that April, and now she takes medication in the morning and at night. \nSophie had already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2012. \nShe has taught herself self help techniques to deal with her depression using www.blurtitout.org.
