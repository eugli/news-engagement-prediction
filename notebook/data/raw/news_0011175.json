And while her opening monologue was brilliant, it was Melissa McCarthy who stole the show with her brilliant impression of White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. \nSpeaking to Extra at the Super Bowl, the Donald Trump employee spoke about the impression, saying McCarthy \"could dial back\" a bit.\nGoing into specifics, he added how McCarthy “needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.\"\nSpicer said he found out about impression after leaving Church the following Sunday when his texts blew up, ‘so much he thought there must be a national emergency.’\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington on 3 February (AP) While admitting he found the episode funny, Spicer called out Alec Baldwin’s impression of Trump as being “mean.” \"Alec has gone from funny to mean, and that's unfortunate,” he told the publication. “SNL used to be really funny. There's a streak of meanness now that they've crossed over to mean.”\nDuring the skit, McCarthy exaggerated many of Spicer’s habits. She opened by saying from a podium: “Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start. When I say ‘rocky start’, I mean it in the sense of Rocky the movie because I came out here to punch you.”\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.
