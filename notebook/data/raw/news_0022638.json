Look at your pets, vets say \nVeterinarians are also asking people to consider their pets during this weekend's heatwave in southern Queensland, and make sure animals had a cool place in the shade and plenty of cold water. \nVeterinarian Dr Anne Fawcett said owners must monitor their pets. \n\"Do be careful especially with these successive hot days not to dismiss all signs as just heat related,\" she said. \n\"We've had a lot of owners present animals late in the course of clinical disease lately saying things like 'well, I noticed they were drinking a lot more but I thought it was just the heat' and so they kind of dismiss the signs until things were quite advanced.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:04:30.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
