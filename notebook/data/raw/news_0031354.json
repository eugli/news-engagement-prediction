(ABC News: Margaret Burin) \n\"For those magnificent, gallant men and women, whether in uniform or not, theirs was not explosive and immediate courage of the battlefield, be it on land or at sea or in the air,\" he said. \n\"It was instead a slow burn courage, stoic, enduring, often unto death, a courage of daily sacrifice and determination not to give in, not to despair. \n\"This unquenchable fortitude got many through those dark times. \n\"It eased the suffering of those who did not survive and preserved the dignity and humanity that captvity and ill treatment could not dampen or displace.\" \nSixteen veterans of the fall of Singapore and POWs were on hand for the ceremony as the Governor-General thanked them for their sacrifice. \n\"On your behalf I acknowledge the veterans today. What you've endured, the story of your service and sacrifice touches us all,\" he said. \n\"You hold a special place in the heart of all here and in the heart of this nation.\" Photo: Robert Goodwin was one of 16 POWs or veterans who attended the service. (ABC News: Margaret Burin) Dark times for POWs \nBritain's wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, called the fall of Singapore \"the worst disaster and the greatest capitulation in British history\". \nOf the 22,000 Australians taken prisoner by the Japanese, 8,000 never came home. \nDavid Manning was luckier than some. He was blown off HMAS Perth in the battle of Sunda Strait off while fighting Japanese destroyers. Three prisoners of war share their stories on the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. \nHe managed to make it back to shore after 27 hours in the water. \nHe has perfected a lifetime of not talking about the atrocities, deciding to keep that \"rotten\" part of his life buried inside. \nFormer POW Colin Hamley, 93, placed a poppy next to the name of his brother Don, who he last saw on the Thai-Burma Railway 75 years ago. \nEarlier, a statue, titled The Garden of the Grieving Mother, was unveiled by the Governor-General at the Arch of Victory in Ballarat. \nThe bronze statue will stand as a permanent memorial to the mothers and families who lost loved ones during conflict. \nThe families of many of those who lost their lives often experienced deep anxiety and grief as they waited on news of loved ones. \nThe statue was designed by Peter Corlett, who also created the Cobbers statue at Fromelles. \nIt will stand as the main feature in the garden. \nIt depicts a grieving mother clutching the photo of her lost son.
