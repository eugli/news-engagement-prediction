That was despite a bizarre attempt at intimidation from Sutton skipper Jamie Collins, who lunged head-first towards him as the Arsenal speedster cruised down the wing. \nBut Oxlade-Chamberlain said: “I grew up in League One, I’m used to these places. Reuters A fan takes a selfie on the pitch with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez \n“That was one of the most exciting times I’ve had this season – coming off the bus, both sets of supporters in close proximity. It was a really good experience, I really enjoyed it. \n“Being on the bench first half, looking around, seeing all the fans and to have a few moments at the end with the Sutton players in the dressing room is what the Cup is all about. \n“The win was the crucial thing, but the night was something I don’t think certain players have seen in England. I don’t think Alexis Sanchez has experienced a game like that, in a place like this. PA Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came on as a substitute \n“It was different to what we’re used to, another challenge to get our heads round. Sutton made it really tough for us and competitive, and I’ve got to give them full credit for the way they played. But the win was the only thing that mattered and we got that.” \nDefeat to a team 105 places below the Gunners in the football ladder would have been unthinkable, and could have been the final nail in the coffin for Wenger’s Arsenal reign following last week’s Champions League humiliation in Munich. \nNow though, Arsenal face this season’s other FA Cup giantkillers, National League side Lincoln City, who shocked football by knocking out Burnley on Saturday, at home in the quarter-finals, and suddenly the path to the last four looks very open for the 12-times Cup winners. \n“Lincoln will be up for it after what they did at Burnley so we will have to go into it with very concentrated minds,” said Oxlade-Chamberlain. PA Lincoln City Manager Danny Cowley \n“The only thing you can do after a really disappointing result is to get a win. We did that, we went there, had a job to do and did the job. We’re into the next round of the Cup, that’s all that matters. \n“It’s good to get back to winning ways against any team, even if they are a good few leagues below you. We were confident we could win, but we knew it was going to be hard, we knew we couldn’t be complacent and we knew the first goal was crucial. \n“I’ve got to give Sutton credit, because they defended well and created opportunities of their own. It was tough. It would have been nice to win more convincingly, our final ball let us down at times. I’m just happy to get through. \n“It’s what the FA Cup is all about. Obviously 2-0 suggests that the game was a bit closer than it actually was. There was some good football, some bad football and some competitive football. It was a proper Cup tie.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:35:45.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
