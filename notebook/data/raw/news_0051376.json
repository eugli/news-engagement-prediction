The two longtime restaurateurs visited a variety of cities, including Chicago and New York, to study the ramen culture and the restaurants that do it best. They also hosted a 10-week pop-up ramen night inside Summit Grill in Waldo, and each night spurred bigger buzz, Lock said. Their culinary director Po Wang , a native of Taiwan, came up with the idea for the restaurant concept. He'd been encouraging them for years to pursue a ramen restaurant and once he served the two restaurateurs a few dishes, they were all in, Lock said. \"We think it's going to have a really neat energy. We don't want to be a bar and grill — we have one of those. We want to have a lively, different dining experience that's more fun and more interactive,\" Molloy said of Bōru Ramen Bar. Bōru's 3,300-square-foot space features a contemporary look with a red and black color scheme. There's also big-screen TVs throughout that play music videos from the '80s, '90s and early 2000s. Although the restaurant is ramen-based, its menu also draws inspiration from Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese dishes. In addition to ramen, the menu features a variety of steamed baos and salads, such as the Korean steak and noodle salad and the miso salmon salad. It also includes fried rice entrees, such as the loaded fried rice, which comes with pork belly, shrimp, vegetables, eggs bean sprouts, scallions and lime; and the akaushi wagyu strip loin served with garlic Chinese greens and fried rice. \"I think there's going to be a familiarity to it that people will notice,\" Molloy said. \"That's going to sound odd, because it's Japanese-based, but there's a sense of homemade chicken noodle soup, and everything's done from scratch.\" Some of Bōru's homemade stocks simmer for 24 hours, and the two restaurateurs also are sourcing ingredients from authentic vendors. In addition to a diverse food menu, Bōru has a full-service bar that serves specialty cocktails, such as the Long Thailand Tea, Flying Dragon and Big Trouble in Little Waldo, which includes vodka, calpico and matcha green tea syrup. Other drink offerings include Japanese and Taiwanese whiskey, sake, beer and wine. Molloy and Lock are confident about the concept and plan to open additional Bōru locations in the Kansas City metro in the future. \"I'm really excited that we get a chance to expose a lot of people to this type of cuisine,\" Lock said. \"Everybody knows what a good cheeseburger tastes like; everybody knows what a good French dip tastes like, but this is something I think we can not only expose people to, but we can educate people and they can become more passionate about it. … Kansas City's ready for it.\" Leslie covers entrepreneurs and technology, retail, and marketing.
