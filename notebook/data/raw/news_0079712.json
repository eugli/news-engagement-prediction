Photo: AP \nThe scheme has been popular in many states, even those controlled by Republicans. But it has also been criticised for its steep premium increases. \nThe Pew Research Centre last week indicated Americans have warmed up to the scheme, with 54 per cent now approving of the health care law passed seven years ago by Barack Obama and Congress, while 43 per cent disapprove. It is the first time the law has attracted majority approval.

He also said that he wanted states to have more flexibility but did not provide details. \nTrump previously discussed these ideas on the campaign trail. It is unclear how they would be implemented, or what changes he might make to Medicaid expansion, another key component of the Obamacare law.
