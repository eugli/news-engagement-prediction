Joseph Dunford told the President that capturing the raid’s intended target would be a “game changer,” an anonymous official told NBC News . \nTrump’s military advisers added that the previous leadership would not have been \"bold enough\" to launch it, the network said. Military advisers convinced President Trump to launch the Yemen raid with a comparison to Barack Obama, a report says. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \nQuestions about the rationale for the operation, which reportedly killed civilians, wounded three Americans and resulted in the loss of a $75 million helicopter, come as the Defense Department denied that it was aimed at a high-ranking terrorist. \nNavy Capt. John Davis said Tuesday that there was “never any intention, hope, anticipation, or plan” that Al Qaeda leader Qassim al-Rimi would be captured or killed in the raid. \nThough his comments came as response to an NBC report saying al-Rimi was the “secret” target, tribal leaders told the Associated Press in the aftermath of the raid that the U.S. had been looking for him. The raid was reportedly targeting Al Qaeda terrorist Qassim al-Rimi, though the Pentagon has said it was not.

Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed in the raid. (Department of Defense) \nA former SEAL Team 6 member told the New York Times that commandos knew the mission was compromised and that they “were screwed from the beginning.” \nIn response to a question about whether al-Rimi had previously been a focus of the raid, a Defense Department spokeswoman told the Daily News that he was “never at any point” been a target in the operation.
