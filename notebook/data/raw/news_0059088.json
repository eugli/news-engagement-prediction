The reservoir, located about 130 km. west of Haifa, will not only boost domestic gas supplies, but will also likely serve as an export outlet for Israel's immediate neighbors and the wider Mediterranean region. Houston-based Noble Energy holds a 39.66% share of the Leviathan reservoir, while the Delek Group’s subsidiaries Delek Drilling and Avner Oil Exploration each have 22.67% and Ratio Oil Exploration has 15%. Groner stressed how the development of Leviathan will not only provide Israel with a second natural gas reservoir, but will also spark a shift in momentum regarding the country’s position as an attractive place for investments. \"In an era of the BDS [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions] movement, where the Israeli government is going to such efforts to thwart BDS, this is a great victory,\" said Groner, who was a guiding force on behalf of the Prime Minister’s Office in recent gas negotiations. The development of the Leviathan reservoir faced significant setbacks over the past few years, as disputes among the developers and the government rattled the sector from December 2014 to the beginning of 2016. Ultimately, the parties settled on a deal, called the gas \"outline,\" whose goal was to ensure competition and stability in the industry. \"Almost tragically, there were many voices within Israel from the populist side that did everything in their power to thwart this investment,” Groner continued. “But thanks to the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, the haters were not able to succeed, and Noble was convinced that this is a place that's worthwhile to invest in. The next stage is to ensure that many other energy exploratory companies form around the world will invest here.\" Crediting Netanyahu and Steinitz for seeing this journey through, Groner described the formation and approval process of the contentious gas outline as “one of the most meaningful decisions that a government in Israel has made.”“If you look at the history of the 20th century through the lens of energy, you realize that countries around the world would go to war over types of reservoirs that we had under our noses,” he said. On Thursday morning, Steinitz also celebrated the announcement, declaring that the FID puts an end to the claims of those who objected to the gas outline.\"If we continue on a responsible and steadfast path, we will also succeed in discovering more gas fields, positioning Israel as an important player in the energy market alongside our neighbors in the Middle East and Europe,\" Steinitz said. The energy minister pointed out the numerous benefits of the field to Israel, including financial profits, clean air for future generations and an increase in energy security.Netanyahu also voiced his support for the investment, adding that the process \"provides a gas supply to the State of Israel and promotes cooperation with neighboring countries in the energy sector.\"While the partners confirmed the $3.75b. project budget on Thursday, this amount adds to the already approximately $1b. invested in various exploration, appraisal and planning activities to date.“Development of the Leviathan project is another milestone in the fulfillment of Israel’s energy security and will bring benefits in the air quality and health of Israel’s citizens, who will also benefit from increased government revenues and from a path to better relations with their neighbors in the region,” Bini Zomer, Israel country manager for Noble Energy, said on Thursday. While likewise discussing the many benefits of Leviathan at home, Groner emphasized how the project also marks “a major milestone in the US-Israel relationship.”“This is a private-public partnership the way private-public partnerships were meant to be,” he told the Post . “Government, private sector, major investments, cross-border cooperation – a move with security, diplomatic and economic ramifications to help make Israel stronger.” Not only will Leviathan’s development impact the US-Israel relationship, but it will also foster ties among Israel and its neighbors, Groner stressed. “Commercial partnerships and alliances are what create diplomatic and political stability,” he said. “There's not a seasoned diplomat alive that doesn't understand the value that this brings to Israel.\" Despite the many obstacles that delayed Leviathan’s development, Groner expressed confidence that Thursday’s FID sends “an unbelievable message to the people of Israel.”\"There were bureaucratic hurdles, and more sinisterly, there were political hurdles,” he said. “Not only is this a victory over BDS and over populism, but at the core, this is a victory for the people of Israel and for people who aspire for stability in the region.” Relevant to your professional network?
