(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Rick Singh Guest Columnist \n\nA few weeks ago I had the pleasure of watching a group of individuals become a team of American citizens. During a Naturalization Ceremony in downtown Orlando, I spoke to them about my own experience as an immigrant. \nMy story is similar to theirs; a settler from another country who came to America looking for opportunity. I started my expedition to America at an early age. After my father passed away when I was just 10 years old, my mother moved us to New York so that we would be closer to family. That’s when we started our expedition to becoming citizens of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America. \nWorking jobs as a domestic to make ends meet, my mother worked to ensure that we were not only taken care of, but to set the example that hard work is a part of America’s promise; the right to pursue happiness. \nWith all of that; losing my father and moving with my family to an extraneous land to watch my mom work and care for other people just so she could provide for her children, I still believe in the promise of America. \nIn watching the pride from the faces of those individuals as they took the Oath of Allegiance during their Naturalization Ceremony, it gave me a stark reminder of what makes our country so great. \nOur nation is quilted together by the stories and experiences of immigrants who have enriched our country. More than 40 percent of the largest companies in the United States were founded by immigrants, and some of this nation’s most innovative businesses are run by immigrants. Take Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. Birthed in the former Soviet Union, Brin moved to the United States with his parents to escape persecution they received because they are Jewish. \nPierre Omidyar is the founder of eBay and his parents are originally from Iran, one of the countries on the travel ban list. In reaction to the travel injunction, Omidyar called the president’s ban “simple bigotry.” \nAmerica is a refuge for anyone looking to escape the doldrums of social inertia. We are a shelter for those fleeing religious, social, and civil harassment because we serve as a beacon of justice for the rest of the world. \nWe are also an economic asylum. The opportunity that our country can offer is what draws many to our shores. From entrepreneurship to attaining financial independence through gainful employment, our ability to provide economic freedom is attractive. \nAcademically we have been augmented because of our immigration policies and ability to learn and grow from those of varied cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Our country needs this edification, and it is because of that we are able to lay claim to being the greatest country in the world. \nMahatma Gandhi once said that “morality is rooted in the purity of our hearts.” Our country’s moral obligation is to ensure that we take care of those who seek refuge and for anyone seeking new opportunity. It’s why we are the land of the free and home of the brave. \nThe nebulous and direct actions of President Trump have given us the opportunity to serve the least of these. Making Orlando and Orange County a safe haven for those who traveled here to depart a violent regime, an autocratic government or to simply seek new opportunity is the thesis of the principles we live by. \nMoving forward we should continue to celebrate and activate pluralism; we shouldn’t deride it or shun it. \nThis nation’s diversity and cultural richness is why so many of our country’s top companies were founded and are run by immigrants. It’s because of the opportunity that we offer as a country to anyone looking to start anew. \nIf we really want to make America great again, we’ll start by ensuring that Orlando and Orange County are sanctuaries for immigrants. \nRick Singh is Orange County’s property appraiser.
