There’s Malkah, Steve Price and Kris Smith, bickering in the foreground:\nmedia_camera It’s like Where’s Wally but with Jay Laga’aia.\nSpot it? There in the background, sprawled out on his camp bed, serenely plucking his ukulele, is a certain Play School presenter:\nmedia_camera IT'S JAY! *X-Files theme plays*\nWhile the scene was included in the episode to set up a larger conflict Malkah and Smith would go on to have, Laga’aia’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo did confuse some viewers:\n@ImACelebrityAU how is that #celebJay is on the TV in tonight's show when he was voted out last Sunday pic.twitter.com/5RRTZzhoNZ\n— Trevor Gerdes (@trevorgerdes) February 21, 2017 @ImACelebrityAU just played footage of Tziporah and Kris arguing... But Jay was in the background? He got booted on Sunday? #ImACelebrityAU\n— Rowan Brookes (@RowanBrookes) February 21, 2017 Who's the bloke singing in the background of the darts game? Was that Jay??? #ImACelebrityAU\n— Anouska (@AnouskaHaaket) February 21, 2017 Moments later, Malkah and Smith’s fight continued as their campmates looked on — among them celebrity style guru Carson Kressley, who entered the show as an intruder the day after Laga’aia left:\nmedia_camera Moments later, the cameras cut to shots of Carson Kressley — who entered the show as Jay exited.\nWe approached Ten for comment about this surprise cameo, and here’s what they had to say:\n“A scene was incorporated in last night’s show which included a shot of Jay Laga’aia from a previous day. This was included because Kris Smith referenced it as the source of tension between himself and Tziporah Malkah. In the past when campmates have referenced a past event, the scene is graded differently to clearly differentiate it as past tense. Unfortunately, this did not happen in last night’s show.”\nStill, it’s nice to think Jay is always out there, in some reality TV dimension, forever entertaining / annoying his I’m A Celeb campmates with that damn ukulele.\nOriginally published as Confusing figure in background", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d26571ef6e87a0e306b6c0d01add39e5?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/wtf-viewers-confused-at-jays-reappearance-on-im-a-celeb/news-story/4348b15dad38df94caf77211acb29ed5", "https://t.co/5RRTZzhoNZ", "https://twitter.com/ImACelebrityAU", "https://twitter.com/trevorgerdes/status/833972512534900739", "https://twitter.com/RowanBrookes/status/834013140253761536", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/celebJay?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACelebrityAU?src=hash", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7ebd54d8a3d4a2312360fcc69e77b84f?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/4348b15dad38df94caf77211acb29ed5?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://twitter.com/AnouskaHaaket/status/833966673132523520", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5463e3363cdf9e272f1ba943a3937447?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-21T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:55:32.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
