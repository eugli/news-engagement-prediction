The tribunal will be headed by a Judge.\nPakistani cricket fans have been disappointed after learning about Sharjeel's suspension under the anti-corruption code as the left-handed opener had cemented his place in all three formats as a hard-hitting batsman.\nThe Hyderabad based batter scored three half-centuries in the one-day series in Australia and also scored 39 in his Test debut in the third Test at Sydney. He remains the only batsman to have scored a century in the Pakistan Super League T20 event.\nKhalid Latif, who hails from Karachi, had also cemented his place in the national T20 side since last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:40:23.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
