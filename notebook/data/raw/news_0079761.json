Same-sex marriage still no closer, despite bi-partisan Senate proposals A parliamentary committee has handed down a consensus report on same-sex marriage draft laws but the major parties remain divided on how to progress. \nBut the homophobia still present in some parts of the Christian community is something he is hoping to change. \nMr Oh is one of the co-founders of a new cross-denominational organization made up Christian supporters of LGBT+ rights that is hoping to promote acceptance in the church and the broader community. \nThey also want to provide an alternative political Christian organization to challenge groups such as the Australian Christian Lobby, who oppose same-sex marriage and the Safe Schools school program. \n“It is time for a different voice, for a just voice to be loud and clear as juxtaposed to some very small, but very loud Christian voices, who are very unrepresentative of Australian Christians,” Mr Oh said. \nA 2014 survey by research company Crosby Textor, commissioned by the Australian Marriage Equality, showed 59 per cent of Christians in Australia supported same-sex marriage . \nBenjamin Oh is one of the co-founders of Equal Voices. \nHowever, Australian Christian Lobby Managing Director Lyle Shelton said the survey results reflected those who identify as Christian and not the views of active church members. \n“Certainly the people who populate the pews in churches, the overwhelming majority of those are in favor of retaining the definition of marriage,” Shelton told SBS. \nLast Friday, Equal Voices organized Australia’s first cross-denominational religious ceremony to apologies to LGBT+ people for the way the church and religious community had treated them in the past. \nAt Saint James Anglican church, the oldest church building in Sydney, around 100 people attended a service presided over by priests from the Anglican, Catholic and Uniting Churches. \nThe emotional service, held days before the beginning of Lent, involved the priests smearing ash on the forehead of church goers, a traditional ritual of asking God for forgiveness. Row over same-sex marriage plebiscite funding heats up The federal government is expected to reveal details of its same-sex marriage plebiscite this week. \nHolding back tears, Elaine Dietch and her husband John told the congregation about their difficulty accepting that their son Mark was gay and they said their attitudes contributed to the isolation he felt as a teenager, resulting in depression and a suicide attempt. \n“I know there are mothers out there who also want to say ‘I’m sorry, sorry for praying for God to heal you when there was nothing to heal',” Elaine said. \n“God accepts you just as you are and we need to accept you just as you are and we are sorry that we didn’t always do that”. \nAs many as 40 per cent of same-sex couples in Australia identify as Christian, according to 2011 census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Several LGBT+ Christians at the service said they stopped attending church regularly because they didn’t feel welcome there. \nMaria Sullivan, who has been a Catholic Sister of Saint Joseph for more than 50 years, said she was inspired by Pope Francis’ statement in July last year in which he called for the church to apologies for the treatment of LGBT+ people. \nReverend Thomas Peacock and Reverend Andrew Sempell. \n“I think always down at the grassroots level there has always been a lovely understanding,” Ms Sullivan told SBS. \n“But often the doctrine takes a lot longer and the moral teaching takes a lot longer to move than the people at the grassroots”. \nUniting Church member, Wilma Viswanathan arrived in Australia from Sri Lanka in 1983 and she says she hopes some religious organisations' opposition to same-sex marriage will change over time. \n“I’ve always stood for human rights and I think this is a right that all God’s children must have,” she said. \nThe Australian Christian Lobby’s Lyle Shelton said the church he attends is very welcoming of LGBT+ people, but said in the past some churches have been judgmental. Catholic Church told heads of SBS and Telstra to drop support for marriage equality The Catholic Church contacted SBS boss Michael Ebeid in a bid to convince him to retract public support for same-sex marriage . \n“I think wherever Christian people have treated other people poorly we should apologise. \n\"If LGBT people have been treated poorly by churches they should (apologise),” he said. \nReverend Andrew Sempell, rector of the Saint James church, told SBS he believed the apology was an important first step in making churches more accepting of people of all sexualities and genders. \n“If you understand that the image of God is in each person, if you understand that we have the spirit of God within us, then that should cause us to treat one another very differently,” he said. \n“The apology for me is partly that recognition that we have treated the children of God badly.” \nLifeline: 13 11 14 Same-sex marriage advocates welcome plebiscite's defeat SBS World News Radio: Australians won't be heading to the polls early next year to vote on marriage equality.But same-sex marriage advocates are confident the senate's rejection of a planned plebiscite won't stall momentum on the issue. Now, though, the question becomes whether the federal government will allow a parliamentary vote on the matter. Comment: Senate kills plebiscite, leaving same-sex marriage on indefinite hold The Senate has put to the sword the ill-fated plebiscite, killed by a remarkable combination of supporters and opponents of changing the law to allow gay people to marry. Same-sex plebiscite bill defeated in the Senate Labor, Greens and Senate crossbenchers have joined forces to shoot down the federal government's proposed same-sex marriage plebiscite. Comment: killing the plebiscite doesn't mean the death of the marriage equality campaign The plebiscite might not happen, but passing marriage equality through this parliament is still possible, writes Alex McKinnon.
