A hashtag that went viral on Twitter today is aimed at expanding your range of options: #actuallivingscientist . \nThe thing is, most people can’t name a living scientist — at least, according to a 2013 survey of 1,000 American adults : 70 percent of them failed to do so. That suggests the public — people who pay taxes to support scientific research — likely don’t know much about who they’re funding, what they’re funding, or what the results of their funded experiments are. That’s a problem, and one that scientists feel more urgently lately. The former Secretary of the Interior told scientists that if they didn’t make themselves heard and get to the table, they’d be on the menu . \nAnd it’s one that wildlife ecologist David Steen was trying to remedy when he tweeted on Thursday afternoon: “Most Americans can't name a living scientist (it's true, look it up!); no wonder they don't fully appreciate what we do. So...Hi, I'm Dave.”\n“Someone was giving me a hard time about how my work wasn’t worth doing, it’s not too unusual,” Steen told The Verge . “I’m there for science communication, so I try to understand it from their perspective.” So, he introduced himself. The hashtag itself was the work of Mary Roblyer (@darthmom7): \n@AlongsideWild Hi Dave! Maybe this is a good opportunity for other scientists 2 introduce themselves with a pic and #actuallivingscientist .\n— Mary Roblyer (@darthmom7) February 2, 2017 Over past day, scientists have been using the hashtag when they post pictures of themselves at work. \nHi, I'm DNLee I study behavior & natural history of small mammals across urban gradients. #actuallivingscientist #womeninscience pic.twitter.com/UCPQJbqa6x \n— DNLee (@DNLee5) February 3, 2017 Hi, I'm Janet & I study how endangered hawks live in an environment with lots of human development.
