'We really feel privileged' \nHorgan and Rob Delaney, her co-star and co-creator, are yet to decide how the show will deal with Fisher's death. \nCatastrophe - which tells the story of an American man and Irish woman who deal with a number of disasters after a one-night stand turns into a full-blown relationship - has become a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic. \nIt was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding comedy series writing last year. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Fisher 'was funny all of the time', says Horgan \n\"The first and second series, we didn't have her for very long,\" Horgan said. \"She flew in and did her bit in about a day and a half. \n\"We wanted to get to know her better. We idolised her. \n\"In series three, we wrote a bigger, chunkier part for her in episode six and got to spend time with her. She was part of the gang. \n\"All of the cast got to spend time with her. We really feel privileged. She was funny all of the time. She was incredibly witty company.\" 'Tribute to Fisher' \nAsked how Fisher's character would be written out of the show, Horgan said: \"It's a bit hard to think about yet. I hope time will pass and we'll think of a fitting finish to that story.\" \nChannel 4's head of comedy Phil Clarke said Fisher would be seen in \"very emotionally powerful scenes\", adding: \"We think it's a fitting tribute to her.\" \nFisher has appeared as Mia since the first series, having first been approached over social media to take part in the show. \nDelaney contacted Fisher on Twitter after he and Horgan saw her give a lifetime achievement award to Graham Norton and make an \"amazing\" speech. \n\"Sharon said, 'I wonder if she'd play your mum'. I said, 'Sharon, you're crazy'.\" he said. There was no response to the tweet, but after they approached her agent and Fisher read the script, she agreed to join the cast. \n\"She was a really lovely, kind, supportive person,\" added Horgan. Image copyright Channel 4/Avalon Image caption Delaney and Horgan play characters with their own first names in the sitcom \nThe third series sees the characters Rob and Sharon dealing with the fall-out of yet another catastrophe - her spending the evening with another man, a student in a band. \nIt goes on to deal with Rob, a recovering alcoholic, turning to drink. \nAsked why it strikes such a chord with viewers, Delaney said: \"We're very grateful it does. If it has a secret sauce, it's that every episode is written by two people - one of them is a man, and one of them is a woman. That's my theory.\" 'Filth finds us' \nHorgan added: \"I think maybe they (the audience) sees terrible things happening to people, and people not always figuring it out - and it's not the end of the world. Terrible things happen, and it's fine.\" \nOne episode deals with another parent at the school gate making a complaint about their son, Frankie. \nAsked about their inspiration for the show, Horgan explained: \"It's a little bit from looking around us, at the school gates and in our own homes.\" \nCatastrophe also doesn't shy away from topics some might consider crude - and is very, very rude in parts. \nBut, said Horgan with a smile: \"We don't look for filth. Filth finds us.\" \nThe third series starts on Channel 4 at 22:00 GMT on 28 February. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
