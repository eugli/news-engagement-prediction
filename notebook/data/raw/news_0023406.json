His uncle reported him missing on Monday and police are seeking assistance in locating him. \nThe person of interest may be driving one of two vehicles, a 1997 blue Ford Fairmont sedan registration ONV 954 or a white 2002 Ford Falcon station wagon registration RIL 435.

The public has been advised not to approach him if he is spotted, but to call triple-0. \nIt is understood the victim's distraught family did not recognise the man in the video ahead of Tuesday's press conference. \nAnyone with information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page .
