I urge the court to give him a low bail as he has given full cooperation to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission,” Fadzil said. \nDPP Mohammed Heikal Ismail said that Zailan was arrested in 2014 and then was out on MACC bail.\n“Since he’s been on bail, he has never reported back to the MACC office. He is only here in court because MACC knocked on his door this morning,” he said. \nAsmadi fixed bail at RM30,000 in one surety and ordered the accused to report to a police station every month till the case was concluded. \nThe case next comes up for mention on Feb 13. \nWhen asked about the case, Hishammuddin said he hoped the truth would prevail.\n“I was informed that this is an old case. The officer has been with me since I was in the Home Ministry and Transport Ministry.\n“Let the court proceedings take its course,” he told reporters after witnessing a MoU signing for a programme to help army veterans in the B40 wage bracket (below RM3,900 a month).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:45:22.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
