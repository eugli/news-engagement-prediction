(© Maxim Shemetov / Reuters/REUTERS) Updated:  49 PM \nFrom Russia with love? \nRussia is considering sending surveillance leaker Edward Snowden back to the United States as a “gift” to President Trump, according to a report. \nSnowden fled his job as an NSA contractor in 2013, when he leaked a trove of documents to journalists that exposed widespread surveillance on ordinary Americans through the bulk collection of metadata. \nHe fled to and was granted asylum in Moscow, though two unidentified officials told NBC News that internal Russian deliberations show conversations about using him to “curry favor” with the new administration. \nEx-NSA contractor may be indicted as early as this week \nSnowden has been charged under the Espionage Act and could face decades in prison, though Trump and other officials have suggested the death penalty. \n“Snowden is a spy who should be executed,” the President posted on Twitter in 2013, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo has also suggested that Snowden should be put to death. \nThe White House did not immediately comment on the NBC report, but the Justice Department told the network that it would welcome the return of Snowden. \n\"Finally: irrefutuable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian intel. No country trades away spies, as the rest would fear they're next,\" Snowden posted on Twitter shortly after news of the possible transfer broke. Edward Snowden has lived in Russia since fleeing the United States in 2013.
