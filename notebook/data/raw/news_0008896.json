(Photo by John McDonnell / The Washington Post via Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON — Junior Galette says he’s re-signing with the Redskins. \n“Five years of my prime left. I promise to give it everything I have,” the outside linebacker announced on social media Tuesday. “Thankful to be signing another contract with the Redskins tomorrow.” A photo posted by Junior Galette (@sackmanlives) on Jan 31, 2017 at 12:33pm PST \nGalette, who turns 29 in March, was poised to make his long-awaited Redskins debut last July before tearing his right Achilles tendon on the eve of training camp. It was a crippling blow to the Redskins, who were counting on Galette’s addition to their pass-rush attack in 2016. \nIt was also Galette’s second Achilles injury in as many years. He tore his left Achilles tendon in training camp the year before, which would have been his first season with Washington after his abrupt release by the Saints in July 2015. \nAt one point last month, Galette had contemplated retirement. Everyday I Woke up these past 2 weeks…I contemplated hanging the cleats up…Lord willing this is just a Phase… #Blessed \n— Junior Galette (@JovaisG) December 27, 2016 \nGalette racked up 22 sacks and 62 tackles over his final two seasons with the Saints, including 10 sacks and 33 tackles in 2014, his most recent NFL season prior to the Achilles injuries. \nGalette did not disclose the terms of the deal, which the Redskins have yet to confirm. \nFollow @ChrisLingebach and @1067TheFan on Twitter.
