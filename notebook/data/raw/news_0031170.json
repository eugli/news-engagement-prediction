He said he never expected something like this could happen. \n“Flood insurance wasn’t mandatory anymore because they just upgraded the levees. But right now, the levees are kind of high with water,” he said. \nMeanwhile, in Yuba City, Ed Hernandez and his family decided to stay than evacuate from their home Sunday night. \n“As a Filipino, I’m used to a flood and I know that during a flood, we can still swim outside the house and I want to experience it in America,” Hernandez said in jest. \n“We know that it takes time for the water to come down from the dam,” he said. “My kids would like to go right away, and my eldest son was at the Kings game last night…he was telling me that he would go to Stockton, but his mom told him to come home,” Hernandez added. \nThe Hernandez family spent the night together watching for updates about the dam. \n“We kept seeing the numbers decline as the hours [went on]… so we ended up staying,” said Kenneth Hernandez. “But a lot of our friends, a lot of our neighbors, did go to other cities and evacuated.” \nThe Oroville Dam, America’s tallest dam, remains intact. Officials say water is no longer flowing over the emergency spillway, and lake levels are continuing to fall. \nBut evacuations continue, as officials try to make repairs before new storms hit later in the week. \nRead more on Balitang America . \nShare ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:59:20.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
