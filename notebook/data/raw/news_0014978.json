Filmmaker Kevin Smith wrote on social media Thursday that Jay and Silent Bob are “coming back.” “This is not a drill!” In a rambling post Smith said he wrote the script for the tentatively titled “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” in January and hopes to be shooting the film by summer with “an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces!” Now this being show business, one can never know for sure. But for fans of the slacker duo (played by the motormouthed Jason Mewes and a mostly quiet but expressive Smith), this is potentially awesome news. Jay and Silent Bob first appeared in Smith’s 1994 classic indie “Clerks” and became regulars in Smith’s canon. They were featured in his 2001 comedy “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” The latter was intended to be a farewell of sorts ― but we imagine plenty of devotees will welcome back their big-screen buds.
