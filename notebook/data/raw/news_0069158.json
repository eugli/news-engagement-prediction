A slice of their “not so friendly” equation was apparent when the duo appeared in Karan Johar’s ‘Koffee With Karan’ recently. But the two actors really share a troubled equation? \nKangana has apparently denied having issues with Shahid. \nWhen asked about reports that Shahid reportedly said he would never want to work Kangana, the actress told reporters at an event, \"There's nothing like that. We were together at the screening last night. He didn't say anything like that to me.\" \nThere are been umpteen reports about Shahid and Kangana’s strained professional relation. But as long as the actors don’t actually have a problem with each other, wonder why we should be worried. \nInterestingly, the two, who have been romantically paired opposite each other for the first time, share a great chemistry. The trailer of ‘Rangoon’ dropped ample hints about their onscreen equation and we just can’t wait to watch them sizzle in the film. \nThe love-triangle set in the backdrop of World War II and India’s Freedom movement, also stars Saif Ali Khan. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 09:11 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:27:46.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
