(9NEWS/AAP) \nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived in Australia to find snipers and a police helicopter monitoring his movements for his own safety. \nMr Netanyahu flew into Sydney from Singapore early today for a four-day visit, which is the first official trip to Australia by a sitting Israeli prime minister. \nAs he and his wife disembarked from the plane, their movements were monitored by a POLAIR chopper snipers were perched atop nearby buildings. Snipers were on hand as Mr Netanyahu arrived, for his safety. (9NEWS) Dozens of police motorbikes waiting for Mr Netanyahu's arrival. (9NEWS) \nThey were then escorted from the airport by dozens of police officers on motorbikes. \nJust before 10.30am, the couple boarded a large white boat near the Opera House and sped across the harbour with a police escort to Admiralty House, where they were greeted by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy. \nIt is not clear whether the heavy police contingent is working to prevent a specific or general threat. A POLAIR helicopter hovered over head. (9NEWS) It's unknown if police were just being precautionary. (9NEWS) \nOn Monday, about 50 people gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Canberra protest the visit, with similar rallies expected in Melbourne and Sydney later this week. \nRoad closures and traffic diversions are in place across parts of Sydney for the visit. \nMore than 60 prominent Australians – including former Labor politicians, senior legal professionals and clergy – have signed a statement opposing Mr Netanyahu's visit because of his government's policies towards Palestinians. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:12:30.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
