Only a few of the Harvard students [Chazelle not among them] spoke Spanish. I told them that it was a big obstacle, but he was all for it. They took it on deliberately because it was hard.” Advertisement \nMoss taught Chazelle in his freshman video class. He also was his thesis adviser for the film that became “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench” (2009) which, like “La La Land,” is a feature-length musical in an urban setting. “Guy and Madeline” was filmed in the Boston area. \n“It had this beautiful synthesis of all of the things he loved,” said Moss. “It was so surprising. Such a wonderful juxtaposition of nonfictional, in a fictional form, and then adding another element, a musical.” In making that first feature, Moss saw the kind of directorial and personal qualities that would enable Chazelle to make such brilliant follow-ups as his second film “Whiplash” (which won three Oscars and was a best picture nominee in 2015) and now “La La Land.” \n“Damien is the kind of person who can put together a good team and lead a crew,” he said. “So much of ‘La La Land’ is corralling the people around him. People kind of rally to him because he’s a really lovely person.” \nWhat do Guzzetti and Moss think Harvard contributed to Chazelle’s success? \n“You can’t really teach someone to be an artist but you can avoid slowing them down,” said Guzzetti. “Find out what they’re after rather than imposing something else on them.” \nMoss agreed that Chazelle was motivated from the start and just needed the opportunity to fulfill his talents. “When he was a freshman and had just come to college he was already in love with the movies,” he said. \nAnd what has the recent spate of Harvard-grown Oscar nominees, including Chazelle, contributed to the school’s film program? \n“It inspires and gives hope to the students and other alumni,” said Guzzetti. “They see that the same is possible for them.” \nWin or lose, though, Moss does not see the Academy as the ultimate arbiter of greatness. Just look at the way best picture played out in 1981. \n“Hollywood chose ‘Ordinary People’ and not ‘Raging Bull,’” he said. Meredith Goldstein of the Globe staff contributed to this report.
