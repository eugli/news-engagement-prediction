The matchup came to an unusually friendly conclusion. Udine, the former mayor of Parkland, attended his opponent's church, and contributed $250 from his campaign stash to it.\n Udine won the race for District 3 in northwest Broward (filling the seat formerly held by Stacy Ritter). The victory was no surprise; like all nine districts in Broward, it leans Democrat in its voter registration.\nCandidates with campaign cash left over can contribute it to a non-profit, return to contributors or put some in an office fund.\n Udine, who is Jewish, also gave to Jewish causes, including $500 to David Posnack Jewish Community Center and $500 to Soref Jewish Community Center. He transferred $8,263 to an office account.\nShould Broward pay price in Tallahassee because Democrats won't pick Chip LaMarca to serve as mayor?

My congregation warmly welcomed him, and we all applauded after his well-received comments.''\nBroward's wish list: beach sand, affordable housing, and no fracking Brittany Wallman Broward County doesn't have the odds in its favor when it comes to seeking change, and dollars, out of the state Legislature.
