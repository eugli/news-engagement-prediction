Now I can relate to the clients,\" she said.\n(Left)Alison Duffy and Carla Foley spoke about their time in the Dragon's Den on CBC's Weekend Morning show. (Bruce Ladan/CBC)\nThe paternity test is often used in high stress times in a family's life, they said. They are used when the father of a baby isn't known or sometimes after death-bed confessions.\nHowever, for the business itself, explaining to the dragons what DNA testing was and why it was a good business venture was one of their toughest challenges yet.\n\"They were tough because we had such a short amount of time to explain the enormity of what we do,\" Foley said.\n\"For them to wrap their head around what DNA testing actually entails was our biggest triumph,\" Duffy added.\nThe business partners can't divulge their outcome just yet, the episode will air on Wednesday, they do say that having Winnipeg's support has made all the difference.\n\"Winnipeg has been so supportive to us.
