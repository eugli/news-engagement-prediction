Michael Kovac via Getty Images Harrison Ford \nIn the video footage (above) , it is clear to see just how close the two aircraft actually were. \nDespite the near-miss, the Boeing 737, with 110 passengers and six crew on board, was able to take off safely minutes later. \nFollowing the incident, a spokesman said: “Air traffic controllers cleared the pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L at John Wayne Airport Monday afternoon. The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway. \nThey added: “The FAA is investigating this incident.” \nIt’s not the first time Harrison has been involved in a flying incident.
