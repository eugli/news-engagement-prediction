Not by his players, who drenched him in public as he was about to speak to the world's media, and not by his owners, who seemed more interested in parading pictures of Thai royalty on the day of his crowning glory. It should have been Ranieri's image up there that afternoon, just as it should have been Ranieri who was given the chance to complete this epic journey, whether it ended in safety or relegation to the Championship. Sean Dyche took Burnley down, but the club knew what it had in him, and kept faith. Speculation of disharmony among players led to the manager receiving a vote of confidence Leicester's Champions League loss in Sevilla proved Ranieri's final game in charge of the Foxes They were rewarded with a return to the Premier League and, so far, a season that has exceeded all expectations. And Ranieri was not due that? He was not due the opportunity to right the wrongs of this campaign, no matter where it ended. He has not even been given a year from the most remarkable, illogical, title win – from an achievement that took the name of Leicester City into parts of the world that did not know it existed. Muhammad Ali, it was said, could look out of an airplane window on any continent in the knowledge everyone on the ground below knew who he was. And that was true of Leicester, last May. Not ly-cess-ta in America, anymore. Leicester. Leicester City. Improbably famous, even now. The outsiders against which all others will be judged, forever more. Ranieri was the surprise choice to replace Nigel Pearson in 2015 with few expecting success Leicester owner Srivaddhanaprabha says sacking Ranieri was 'the most difficult decision' Leicester changed the sporting landscape, changed our expectations, even changed the odds at the bookmakers. No one is quoted at 5,000-1 anymore. Even this season, they continue to confound. Breezing into the Champions League knockout round – Tottenham couldn't do it – and now a 1-0 home win over Sevilla away from the quarter-finals in this, their supposed moment of great catastrophe. Imagine what their fans would have considered Ranieri due before this happened. What loyalty they would have considered sufficient for a man who could deliver the Premier League title, and then a Champions League run. Five years? Ten? A lifetime? In the end, Ranieri didn't even get nine months. And this is a decision that could cost millions. Not millions in terms of finance, which is the prime consideration for Ranieri's employers, obviously; but millions in terms of support. Fans, followers, lovers of football, who may feel this morning that the game is no longer for them; that a sport placing such little value on integrity and humanity, that no longer recognises feats unprecedented, has truly lost its purpose and its soul. The charismatic Italian overcame the odds to lead Leicester to an incredible league title Ranieri returned to Chelsea on the final day of last season and was given a guard of honour Roman Abramovich sacked Roberto Di Matteo months after winning the Champions League. Carlo Ancelotti was gone a year after winning the double in his first season. We were appalled, yes, but we also understood. Chelsea consider themselves a huge club now. They set standards, they make demands. They seek parity with Real Madrid. Elite clubs are manager eaters. But this was Leicester. This was a club that nobody – nobody – ever thought could be England's champions. The days of parity had passed. We had resigned ourselves to that fact; and Ranieri then made us reconsider what was possible. His achievement in managing Leicester to the title remains the single greatest of the modern sporting age. Better than Liverpool in Istanbul, Manchester United's treble, Arsenal's Invincibles, the 2017 Super Bowl, the miracle in Medinah. Wonderful though they all were, those outcomes were all considered possible. The 65-year-old prepares to take his seat ahead of his final pre-match press conference Leicester's fairy-tale season is the greatest story ever told but this is its bleakest coda These were good teams, great players, elite performers. It was different for Leicester, last year. Ranieri drew elite quality from mongrels, from journeymen, and at a time when football is ruled by money like never before. He took a club marked for relegation to heights unimagined. And what did it get him? Not even nine months grace. Not even the courtesy of being treated honestly, openly, by those that employed him – of being allowed to at least complete the Champions League campaign that he delivered. Leicester were the greatest story football ever told, yet this is its bleakest coda. The weasel words of the club statement should only harden the sense of disgust around this decision. Leicester may not be the favourites to go down; but, after this, it is quite likely they will be the people's choice.
