O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.\nIt was announced earlier this month that he will be joining the upcoming Marvel superhero movie Black Panther.\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the 40-year-old actor will play a character called N’Jobu, who is reportedly a figure from main character T’Challa's past.\nLooking good: Sterling - who is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Randall Pearson in This Is Us - looked handsome in a well-cut tux\nClassic Hollywood glamour: Ryan - who has a recurring role in the NBC drama series - wore an asymmetric ivory gown with white lace overlay\nPretty: No wonder Sterling couldn't keep his hands to himself, as she looked exceptionally beautiful with an elaborate updo drawing attention to her stunning features\nHappy together: The couple met at Stanford University and married in 2007\nThe Screen Actors Guild created its own awards ceremony in 1995.\nThe gong handed out to winners is a statuette of a nude male figure brandishing both a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy; it is called 'The Actor'.\nIt is one of the only award shows where actors are honoured by their peers; the ceremony recognizes achievements in acting alone.\nThe first honours given out in SAG's inaugural ceremony included industry staples Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) and Jodie Foster (Nell), for lead roles in films.\nHowever it wasn't until 1996 that the show began handing out an award for best ensemble, a category that is now seen as one of the most accurate predictors for the best picture award at the Oscars.\nThe first ensemble to win the prize was Apollo 13, another film featuring Tom Hanks; however, this year the awards favorite was snubbed despite a critically acclaimed turn in Clint Eastwood's Sully.\nOnly one film since 1996 has gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards without first being nominated in SAG's best ensemble category.\nOnly Mel Gibson's Braveheart managed it 20 years ago.\nHowever, this is simply being nominated in the category. The statistics for those ensembles that win at the SAG awards is a bit different.\nThe Screen Actors Guild has handed out the ensemble award 21 times (SAG only began giving out ensemble awards in 1996), but of the films that were awarded the honour only 11 went on to land best picture at the Oscars (52%).\nStill, actors, the largest group in the Academy of Motion Pictures, hold considerable sway. (SAG, though, is much larger, with about 160,000 members, compared to about 1,200 actors in the academy.)\nNominees are selected by separate movie and TV nominating panels, each comprised of more than 2,000 randomly selected SAG members.\nSunday night marks the 23rd annual ceremony for the Screen Actor's Guild.\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-30T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:52:29.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
