Most Popular Feb 21, 2017 Conspiracy theories go hand-in-hand with feeling really damn lonely. A new study from Princeton University that will be published in next month's issue of the Journal of Experimental and Social Psychology found a correlation between social exclusion and belief in conspiracy theories.

They also went through the steps of the first part of the study, only to find the same results.
