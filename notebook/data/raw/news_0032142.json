But on Monday, neither he nor his lawyer presented themselves before it. \n\nContempt proceedings were initiated by the CJI J S Khehar-led bench against Justice Karnan after he continuously levelled allegations against the Madras high court chief justice and other judges. \n\nAfter Karnan failed to show up for the proceedings, Madras high court counsel K K Venugopal underscored the severity of the charges against Justice Karnan. He said the Calcutta high court judge had levelled malicious rape charges against a Madras high court judge. \n\nVenugopal then told the Supreme Court that Madras high court judges need protection from Justice Karnan's verbal abuse and wild charges. \n\nThe seven-judge bench conferred and decided to grant Justice Karnan more time to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. The apex court has given Karnan until March 10 to respond to the contempt notice . \n\nLast week, the Supreme Court initiated contempt of court proceedings against sitting Calcutta high court judge C S Karnan for continuously levelling allegations against the Madras HC chief justice and other judges. This is the first time that a constitutional court has initiated contempt of court proceedings against a judge of the Supreme Court or high court. \n\nKarnan reacted sharply to the apex court's notice and accused it of harbouring a caste bias against him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:02:12.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
