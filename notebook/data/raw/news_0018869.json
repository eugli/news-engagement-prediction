Blair Walsh (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:17 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:17 p.m. ET \nBlair Walsh's kicking career hasn't been the same since his now-infamous missed chip shot in a 2016 playoff game cost the Vikings their season. \nBut Walsh has been given a chance at redemption by the biggest beneficiary of his flub, the Seahawks, who signed the free-agent kicker Thursday to replace free-agent-to-be Steven Hauschka, the team announced . \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft 2017 \nThe Vikings were a 27-yard field goal attempt away from defeating the Seahawks in their wild-card round meeting a year ago, but Walsh's kick sailed wide left with 22 seconds remaining. NFL kickers had hit 189 of 191 field goals from 27 yards or shorter during the 2015 season. \nEver since, Walsh hasn't been able to snap out of a funk. He missed four field goals and four extra points in eight games last season before Minnesota cut him. \nIn a twist, he'll be in line to replace Hauschka, who has been one of the NFL's more accurate kickers since joining the Seahawks in 2011. \nWalsh, entering his fifth season, made the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 2012 after setting an NFL record by going 10-for-10 on attempts of 50 yards or more. He still maintains an 84.2 field goal percentage through his career.
