Article continues below \nIn an extended interview with ESPN, the 62-year-old was questioned on how he had coped without Formula One, his working relationship with FIA president Jean Todt, and the difficulty of overtaking in modern racing. \nHowever, most notably, Brawn was quizzed on the possibility of increasing the number of races in a season to 25.
