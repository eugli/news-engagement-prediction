Or maybe it's from Clueless , IDK. Regardless, cosmetic companies are taking it to heart. An explosion of every-person-colored makeup is hitting counters daily, and we couldn’t be happier about it. Everyone should have the chance to experience makeup that makes them feel great, and the new Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder shade suited for darker skin tones does just that. Hot on the heels of what feels like every brand broadening shade ranges, we wouldn’t call this a fad—more like an eye opener. In the base category alone, inclusion is the name of the game.

Made for medium deep to the deepest skin tones (and formerly only available in a single shade), the launch made waves on Reddit. Users sent off sentiments like, “Seeing this made me scream as I just purchased the original translucent and just hoped that it wouldn't make me look ashy. Glad there's another option now!” That pretty much sums it up. While the new shade might not work for everyone, it’ll work for more people than just the one translucent shade. According to Reddit user, it's sheer enough to slide on most light skin tones, but can leave a “noticeable whiteness” on darker skin. The new shade slipped into Sephora and we’re still eagle-eyeing for Insta swatches. This tutorial gives a feel for the shade, though. Even if you were set and dandy with the first, it’s worth a watch for her pure joy at the shade match.
