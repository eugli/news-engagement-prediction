This not only angered the protestors but prompted community members to take the law into their own hands. \n“Angry residents chanting ‘Burn‚ burn‚ burn’ began to attack suspicious drug dens and brothels and setting them alight‚” Sun added. \n“My assessment of the situation was that most of the crowd were spectators and were not violent at all. Many of the elderly spectators were unable to move away from the scene quickly and became vulnerable‚” Sun said. \nTogether with five other councillors from the area‚ he had addressed the community and called on them to be calm and conduct themselves in an orderly manner‚ he added.
