(photo credit:WESTERN GALILEE MEDICAL CENTER) \nHealth Minister Ya'acov Litzman said on Thursday that he would order the Western Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya to stop receiving Syrian patients (whom the hospital has been treating for the last four years, providing medical care to some 1,550 Syrian civilians) if the government does not quickly pay the hospital the NIS 300 million it has spent on their treatment. Litzman made the forceful statement in a meeting Thursday with the editorial staff of the Jerusalem Post . The minister said Eli Groner, the director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office, was asked by the Finance Committee to settle the matter. But if this is not accomplished, the state-owned hospital will no longer treat the men, women and children from Syria whose medical facilities have almost collapsed. Syrian patients leave mark on staff as they recover at Israeli hospital The Finance Committee held a special discussion this week on the issue and learned that the Defense, Finance and Health Ministries were supposed to split the costs equally. The Health Ministry still owes a small amount, according to the hospital management, but most of the debts belong to the other two ministries. Hospital director-general Dr. Masad Barhoom was abroad, but a management spokesman said that it initially received funding, which eventually petered out. The hospital’s patients have not suffered as a result of the lack of money, but its development -- including the opening of new departments and the purchasing of more advanced equipment -- has almost been stopped.“We were asked by the government to carry out this medical task, and we have done it. We have treated and saved the lives of 1,500 babies, children, men and women. We have no idea what has happened to them after their release and return home.\" But the hospital has benefited from the challenge, as “we have gained much experience and expertise from treating severely injured people suffering from war injuries and trauma of the head, chest, legs and other body parts. We are among the leading medical centers in the world with such expertise, and this benefits Israel.” The average cost per diem for treating the Syrian patients is NIS 10,321, while the government transfers only NIS 1,300 daily to the hospital. The medical institution is situated only 10 km. from the Lebanese border, and in the past has treated Lebanese civilians as well. Relevant to your professional network?
