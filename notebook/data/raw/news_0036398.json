An upper limit of 40 has also been applied to men.\nThe decisions were made after a public consultation where around one in four respondents supported stopping IVF and around half supported further restrictions to IVF funding.\nIVF treatment on the NHS will be available only to women aged between 25 and 34 in some areas of Nottinghamshire. Credit: PA The Clinical Commissioning Groups announced last August that they need to reduce a funding shortfall of around £20 million so they can keep meeting obligations for local healthcare services.\nFunding of IVF in Newark and Sherwood and Mansfield and Ashfield is currently around £300,000 per year. The CCGs currently fund one cycle of IVF and patients sometimes pay privately for additional cycles should that be required.\nDr Amanda Sullivan, chief officer for NHS Newark and Sherwood and Mansfield and Ashfield CCGs said:\nIn taking this decision we believe we have reached a conclusion that allows us to continue to provide the service yet still maintain our responsibilities to commission safe and effective care in Mansfield, and Ashfield, and Newark and Sherwood; still under very challenging financial circumstances.\nWe do recognise the impact that our decision will have on local people but we have to balance the needs of our whole population and ensure that there is enough money to maintain high quality and safe services.\n– Dr Amanda Sullivan - Chief Officer for NHS Newark and Sherwood and Mansfield and Ashfield CCGs A review of the decision is scheduled for one years' time.\nLast updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Health East Midlands nottinghamshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:11:42.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
