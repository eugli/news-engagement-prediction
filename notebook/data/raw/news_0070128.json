Sophie Brunner would never want or claim that. But her decision in fall 2012 to put her faith in ASU was a turning point for a program that reached the NCAA Elite Eight in 2007 and 2009 but eroded in the next two seasons. Needing a break after 15 seasons, coach Charli Turner Thorne took a leave of absence in 2011-12. She hired former Sun Devil Amanda Levens as associate head coach and set about searching for the blue-collar players who typified her best teams. \nPlayers like Brunner, a 6-foot-1 forward from Freeport, Ill., close to where Levens grew up. Even from tiny Aquin High School, with all of 100 students, she was an all-state player (all divisions) as a junior and senior and could have stayed close to home to play for any number of schools, including highly successful DePaul. \nRELATED: Arizona State women's basketball dominates Arizona for rivalry split \nFor Turner Thorne, Brunner and her 2013 recruiting mates Kelsey Moos and Quinn Dornstauder have been the class from heaven. \nASU is 95-33 in the past four seasons after going 13-18 in the season before Brunner's arrival. The Sun Devils have made three straight NCAA Tournament appearances, the second ending a one-point loss shy of the Elite Eight. A fourth NCAA opportunity is looming, although likely not starting at home like the past two years. \nSo, the seniors are bracing themselves for the emotion of their final home games this weekend, and Brunner is drawing near to the close of what is arguably the second best career in ASU history behind scoring/rebounding leader Kym Hampton. \n\"She's a stud,\" Turner Thorne said. \"You're only as good as the players you can bring in. For her to go far away from home and believe in us and what we were about and what she could do for us and us for her was amazing. We needed somebody like Sophie Brunner to get ourselves back to a top-level program.\" \nAlready ASU's second leading career rebounder, Brunner needs 63 more points to reach third in career scoring despite averaging just eight shots per game. \n\"You almost have to prod her to take 12 or 13 shots,\" Turner Thorne said. \"She's a total team player and doesn't have a selfish bone in her body.\" \nEven with non-eye-popping career averages of 10.8 points and 7.2 rebounds, Brunner is a virtual lock to make all-conference for a third straight year, something only Emily Westerberg has accomplished for ASU in the Pac-10/12 era. She played on the 2015 U.S. Pan American Games team, the highest any Sun Devil has reached on the USA Basketball ladder. All from a player who received a 40 grade out of 100 rating and no recruiting stars by ESPN Hoop Gurlz out of high school. \nFREE ASU APP: iPhone | Android \n\"I was always excited to come, but then when you get here, you realize how hard it really is,\" Brunner said. \"People make it look so easy on TV, but once you get here, you understand how hard you really have to work for everything you do. Nothing is given to you. Coming from high school, there’s only like one good person on each team and coming here, you’ve got to worry about every single person. That was a big adjustment and just how important your mental energy is and your mental toughness.\" \nShe only recently admitted to her parents about being homesick at first, but her sister, Ellen, also came to ASU, and Moos, from a ranch in northwest Washington, almost instantly became like a sister. Roommates for four years, Brunner and Moos and their families have formed an inseparable bond. When Moos suffered a plantar fascia injury Jan. 1 that took her out of the lineup for six weeks, a heavy load fell on Brunner and Dornstauder to keep the otherwise inexperienced Sun Devils afloat. \nIt's required Brunner to be less selfless on the court and take a much greater leadership role. \n\"It was crushing to her to not have Kelsey,\" Turner Thorne said. \"That's the ultimate challenge your senior season. Sophie's had to do everything and then some.\" \nBrunner realizes how Moos' absence made her grow. \n\"I didn’t really talk that much while I played, I just kind of led by example. I’m not really vocal in that sense,\" Brunner said. \"This year has definitely made me be a vocal leader, especially after Kelsey got hurt. I had to step up into that role and take that on. It doesn't come easy to me and has been hard sometimes, but I think I’ve learned a lot from it.\" \nWith Moos back in the starting lineup, it's still possible ASU could have a quality postseason run, although the road will be tougher for a lower NCAA seed. In the big picture, though, what the seniors and Brunner especially have done to right the ASU ship will be long remembered. It also will be honored during senior day on Sunday when a large number of Brunner's family and friends will be here as they have for games around the country throughout her career. \n\"She's one of the most loved kids I've ever coached,\" Turner Thorne said. \"The support from her hometown is not just because you're a good basketball player. It's because of who you are as a person and everything about you.\" \nBrunner's mother, Darcy, said Sophie goes out of her way to \"do anything asked of her\" when she is at home. \n\"She understands the responsibility she has to give back to the community,\" Darcy said. \"The community appreciates her humbleness. She's never arrogant like, 'I'm it.' She's never disappointed us.\" \nTurner Thorne believes Brunner can play professionally somewhere \"for as long as she wants.\" There will be doubters because of her size but like when she made the Pan Am roster, it won't be entirely shocking for her to be a WNBA draft pick in April. \nBrunner welcomes the chance to continue playing basketball but is also prepared to \"move on the next thing in my life.\" She'll graduate with a degree in educational studies and wants to work with youth promoting a healthy active lifestyle. Eventually, odds favor her returning to Illinois because of her family ties and even her love of the Chicago Cubs (she and Moos live across from Sloan Park, the Cubs' spring training home in Mesa). \nBrunner's ability to pull rebounds with one hand, her trademark short fade away against taller opponents and what Turner Thorne said are more buzzer beaters than all her other ASU players combined stand out. For Moos, Brunner means much more than any on-court highlight. \n\"She just a very caring person. We're best friends for life,\" Moos said. \"Hopefully, our kids like each other because they're probably going to be spending a lot of time together.\" Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:26:03.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
