Recruited into wrestling after a fighter saw him working as a bouncer at a rough-and-tumble Hamilton bar, he earned a reputation as a hugely entertaining and dirty fighter described by a commentator as being “like an animal or a dog” in the ring. \nHe made it into the World Wrestling Federation in the 1980s under the name Johnny K-9 as a “heel” or bad guy, and was dubbed the “most dangerous man in wrestling.” He once fought a televised match against Hulk Hogan. \nHe said he took the nickname when he was arrested and saw “K-9,” the designation for a police dog, painted on the side of the police vehicle he was placed in. \nThat name stuck. \nKroitoru was a man who could be genial and light-hearted but was also had an easy comfort with violence, inside and outside of the ring. \nThe youngest of six kids, Kroitoru grew up fast and tough. His long criminal history began early in his life. \nHe worked as an enforcer and debt collector for the mob, accumulating a rap sheet for assault, extortion and drugs before he got serious in the underworld. \nHe recently said he rarely had to hit anyone because everyone quickly paid his debt when he came to call just by looking at him. \nKroitoru reveled in the money, notoriety and fame he drew from working with serious gangsters. \nHe first made a name for himself in organized crime as the president of the Hamilton, Ont., chapter of the Satan’s Choice Motorcycle Club. \nHe pleaded guilty in the 1990s to conspiring to bomb a strip club in Sudbury after the club asked members of the gang to remove their jackets bearing their gang’s colours. It led to a standoff with Sudbury police. \nKroitoru secured the explosive but, in the end, the bikers moved their ambition up a notch and, in 1996, his bomb was instead used to blow up Sudbury’s police headquarters. It punched a hole in the wall and made an immense statement, but no one was injured. \nAfter the 1997 murder of John “Johnny Pops” Papalia, a Mafia chieftain based in Hamilton who was one of the country’s leading mobsters, Kroitoru’s name again emerged. \nIn response to the murder, Papalia’s killer and the rival mobsters who he said ordered the hit braced for a response from the mob clan; they drafted a list of those who might strike back on Papalia’s behalf. Kroitoru was near the top. \nAlongside others, Kroitoru was arrested in 2005 and charged in the 1998 shotgun slayings of Lynn Gilbank, a Hamilton criminal defence lawyer, and her husband Fred, a computer specialist. The prosecution in that case ended after one of the longest bail hearings in Canadian history when it was deemed there would be no reasonable prospect of a conviction. \nHe then moved to Vancouver and worked in security for the film industry and also had small parts as a heavy in films. \nKroitoru, however, was unable to avoid the lure of gang life and the easy money he sought. In Vancouver he started working with the United Nations gang. \nIn 2008 and 2009, a drug war between the UN gang and rivals in the Red Scorpions, led by the Bacon brothers, gripped B.C.’s Lower Mainland, featuring high-powered weaponry, day-light shootings and raging gun battles from moving cars. \nIn a case of mistaken identity, a man who was driving one of the Bacon brothers’ cars was shot dead and his girlfriend injured. \nIn 2013, Kroitoru pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and marijuana in lieu of the first-degree murder charges he faced. His sentence was 13 years in prison minus time in pre-trial custody. It was his third federal prison term. \nIn applying for parole, he downplayed his role in the B.C. gang war, saying he was only guilty of being a braggart and having “false bravado,” he told parole officials. He merely wanted to impress his new friends. \n“I am no angel,” he told parole officials, but because of his reputation and size he gets blamed for more than he really does, he said. If he is around trouble, everyone believes he is responsible for the trouble, he complained. He would never kill anyone, he said. \nKroitoru was freed on statutory release in August 2016 but the Parole Board of Canada still imposed special restrictions on him. Among his parole conditions was to avoid people in gang or organized crime — and he was banned from entering the city of Hamilton. \nHe begged to be returned to his home province of Ontario, though, asking the board to let him prove he was “a changed man” and volunteering to wear an electronic ankle monitor. \nHe insisted he wanted to focus his attention on being a family man and to distance himself from his criminal past. \nHe is survived by his wife Tracy and three children. \n“Your long history of negative associates and organized criminal activity that includes violence is extremely concerning,” the parole board noted in its most recent decision, in August 2016. \n“A review of your file reveals a man that engaged in a criminal lifestyle for over 20 years.” \nToronto police confirmed Kroitoru died a sudden death inside a halfway house on Tuesday evening. Toronto paramedics, fire department and police attended. He was declared dead at the scene. \nA source said it was a suspected respiratory ailment but the case was still open, pending information from the medical examiner. \nA funeral is being planned for Kroitoru by friends and family. For his service, Kroitoru will finally be allowed back into Hamilton. \nNational Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:07:58.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
