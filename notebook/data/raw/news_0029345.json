The agency did not specify its reasoning for a handful of immigrants other than that they were in the country illegally.\nFormer Democratic President Barack Obama was criticized for being the \"deporter in chief\" after he deported over 400,000 people in 2012, more than any president in a single year.\nIn 2014, Obama's homeland security chief issued a memo directing agents to focus on deporting a narrow slice of immigrants, namely those who had recently entered the country or committed serious felonies. Immigrants who were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, for example, were treated as lower priorities for deportation.\nPresident Donald Trump promised to deport 2 million to 3 million migrants with criminal records on taking office.\nAt a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Trump said his administration had \"really done a great job\" in its recent arrests of immigrants.\n\"We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems,\" Trump said.\nICE said in a statement on Monday that the operations targeted immigrants in the Midwest, Los Angeles, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and San Antonio.\nNot every immigrant arrested had a criminal record or prior order to leave the country, according to the data released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nIn Los Angeles, for example, 151 out of the 161 immigrants arrested had criminal records, but the agency did not give a reason for the arrests of the 10 migrants with no criminal record.\nThe immigrants' arrests followed Trump's Jan. 27 executive order temporarily banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees from entering the United States. That order was suspended by a U.S. district judge, in a ruling upheld by a federal appeals court.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:29:57.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
