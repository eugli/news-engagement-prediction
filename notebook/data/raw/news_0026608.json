Our support for Magu was borne out of our strong belief that he would be intolerant of corruption and kick same in the groin. We call on the Senate to proceed and not tarry in your confirmation.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:01:51.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
