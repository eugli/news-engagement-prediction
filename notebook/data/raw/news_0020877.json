But when producer, rapper, and singer UNIIQU3 busted out this evening on the Chromat Fall 2017 runway, belting out her new hit “Werk Ya Bawdy”—the thumping anthem felt so in tandem with the collection’s theme of “buoyancy.” Decked out in Chromat’s body-conscious wares, UNIIQU3 and her energetic backup dancers broke it all the way down and got the crowd moving before Chromat’s designs hit the runway. But then again, as UNIIQU3’s reputation seems to suggest, the producer and singer is the life of the party wherever she goes. Running the New Jersey club scene for years as its de facto “kween,”the curly-haired Newark native is known for her monthly underground dance parties that would leave many of her followers—Chromat deisgner Becca McCharen included—sweating it out on the dancefloor to any of her inventive mixes. It’s the perfect soundtrack when activewear is involved, and certainly got New York Fashion Week off to a flying start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:17:59.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
