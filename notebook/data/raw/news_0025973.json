After all, the Late Late Show host did orchestrate that Broadway-themed ride back when he hosted the Tony Awards last year. And sure enough, on Sunday night, Corden busted out his signature move once more—but this time, Corden opted for a cardboard car from the Grammys audience rather than a pre-recorded segment. This allowed for perhaps the most precious moment of the night: when Blue Ivy crept her way into a celebrity karaoke session. As Corden gathered stars including John Legend, Jennifer Lopez, and Neil Diamond around his cardboard jalopy for a rousing rendition of Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline,” it all looked like business as usual—but soon enough, there Blue was, just minutes after her mother’s show-stopping performance , basking in some spotlight of her own. We’re guessing those new Knowles-Carter twins won’t do anything to cramp Blue’s style. \nhttps://twitter.com/FACTmag/status/830964007695626240 Just after the gambit ended, a perfectly time ad aired—for Apple Music’s own “Carpool Karaoke” show. A press release from CBS says the series “features 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don’t expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over.” Expect stars including Corden (of course), Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, Jeff Gordon, John Cena, and Shaquille O’Neal.__ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:31:52.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
