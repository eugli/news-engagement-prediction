This year I cried because we won,\" said Galusha. \"I had to make a tough shot to win and my girls played amazing.\"\nWiping the tears from her face, shaking, her voice trembling, Galusha spoke to reporters after the win.\n\"It's been a cruel last couple years so this feels good to be on the other side of it.\"\nIt certainly has been a frustrating and complicated journey getting to this point for Galusha and her team out of the Yellowknife Curling Centre.

They now enter the 12-team field and have 11 games ahead of them, having already played five to get to this point.\n\"I'm super relieved which is something our coach said we shouldn't feel because now we have to go out and play right away,\" said Galusha. \"But I don't care, I feel so relieved right now.

Next year, the format is being altered to include 16 teams from across the country.\n\"I know a lot of people hate it,\" said Galusha. \"We've grown to deal with it. I see why it's in place. None of the three territories had to play off to get here so I see why they did.
