Benett/Getty Images \nThe Predator has hunted down a new cast member in Alfie Allen. \nThe English actor, known for playing Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones , is set to appear in director Shane Black’s sci-fi/action flick, EW has confirmed. \nAllen joins an ensemble that includes Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, and Trevante Rhodes. \nProduction began Monday on the film, which is looking to re-invigorate Fox’s enduring franchise about extraterrestrials that hunt other species for sport. According to the Hollywood Reporter , which first reported Allen’s casting, he will play an ex-Marine battling the alien menace in a suburban setting. \nBlack, who had a supporting role in the original Predator some three decades ago, wrote the script for The Predator with Fred Dekker and has characterized the movie as an “inventive sequel” rather than a straight reboot. It’s scheduled to hit theaters Feb. 9, 2018. Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:17:20.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
