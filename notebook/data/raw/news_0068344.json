Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nRooney has 18 months left on his Manchester United contract, although the club have the option of extending it by another year. \nUnder Mourinho, Rooney has become a squad player at United and has not played since February 1 because of a muscle injury. \nCSL clubs are allowed to have only three foreign players in their starting line-ups. Wayne Rooney returns to Manchester United training ahead of tonight's Europa League match and EFL Cup final on Sunday \nThree clubs still have a slot available for a foreign player - Tianjin Quanjian, Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guoan - but other clubs could also sign Rooney and drop another one of their foreign players. \nRooney was a member of the United squad which travelled to China last July on a pre-season tour which was plagued with problems. \nUnited were unable to train properly because of the intense heat and pollution in Shanghai and Beijing and their game against Manchester City was cancelled because of the poor state of the pitch at Beijing's Birds Nest Stadium.
