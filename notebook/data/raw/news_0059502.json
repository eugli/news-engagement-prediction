Why not? Ronda Rousey was there last year or the year before last. We saw Floyd Mayweather fight “The Big Show” at WrestleMania. There’s always those big matches, most of them involving the Undertaker and Triple H and the John Cena’s of the world. But there’s usually that one gimmick match or that one memorable moment that involves an outside celebrity or sports star. I’d love to see Conor McGregor cross over to WWE,” Grisham told FOX Sports. \n“Think about it, if there’s ever been an athlete perhaps other than Chael Sonnen, Conor McGregor’s the perfect fit for that organization.” Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports \nThe only thing that could hold McGregor back in McMahon’s eyes is that he’s only 5-foot-9 and typically fights at 155-pounds. The WWE has notoriously promoted bigger wrestlers over the years although some superstars like current UFC welterweight CM Punk have made waves while not looking like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. \nOf course, McGregor making an appearance in WWE would probably only be as a guest appearance so Grisham believes it would be the perfect move while probably cashing a big fat check at the end of the night. \n“Vince likes the big guys though. He would prefer that Francis N’gannou had the personality that Conor McGregor has because then he could be in the main event against whoever, but with Conor McGregor you’ve got to be a little more selective,” Grisham said. \n“But McGregor’s already fed into it saying ‘I’d kill everyone of them, I’d destroy them’ whatever. So he knows what to say, he knows what to do and what he loves most is cash money and Vince McMahon has plenty of it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:52:14.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
