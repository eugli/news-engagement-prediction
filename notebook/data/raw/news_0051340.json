Abrams-Stephen King Drama 'Castle Rock' AP Images; Courtesy of Hulu Abrams and King The streaming service confirmed the 10-episode drama on Tuesday. \nIt's official: Hulu and Warner Bros. Television are reteaming with J.J. Abrams and Stephen King for drama series Castle Rock . \nThe news of the series was unofficially announced Friday with a cryptic teaser and now both outlets have released more information about the forthcoming collaboration. THR will update this post as additional details become available, but here's everything we know so far: \nWhat: \nCastle Rock is a 10-episode drama from writers and exec producers Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason ( Manhattan ). It's described as an ongoing series, though sources tell THR that it's more of an anthology that will weave together characters and themes from King's novels featuring the mysterious Castle Rock location. Each season, sources say, will follow a different set of characters and storylines while interjecting themes and specific characters from previous seasons. \nLogline: \nHere's how Hulu describes the series: \"A psychological-horror series set in the Stephen King multiverse, Castle Rock combines the mythological scale and intimate character storytelling of King’s best-loved works, weaving an epic saga of darkness and light, played out on a few square miles of Maine woodland. The fictional Maine town of Castle Rock has figured prominently in King’s literary career: Cujo, The Dark Half, IT and Needful Things , as well as novella The Body and numerous short stories such as Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption are either set there or contain references to Castle Rock. Castle Rock is an original suspense/thriller — a first-of-its-kind reimagining that explores the themes and worlds uniting the entire King canon, while brushing up against some of his most iconic and beloved stories. Production team: \nCastle Rock is based on characters and situations created by King. Shaw and Thomason developed the project for television and executive produce alongside Abrams and Bad Robot Productions' Ben Stephenson and Liz Glotzer. The series is from Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. \nCast: \nNo castings have been announced yet. \nContext: \nCastle Rock reteams Abrams and King with Hulu and Warner Bros. Television following the streaming service's limited series 11.22.63, which starred James Franco. It's Abrams' latest TV series and joins HBO's Westworld . \nWhen: \nA premiere date/time period is unclear. Production will begin this year. \nICYMI: \nIn case you missed it, here's the teaser trailer for it and THR 's original story.
