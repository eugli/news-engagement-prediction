Grace Meng Focuses on Immigrant Communities, Youth in Race for DNC Vice Chair by Chris Fuchs advertisement \nU.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) — currently the Democratic National Committee's only Asian-American officer — is hoping to help steer her party in a new direction if she wins reelection as a vice chair this weekend in Atlanta, Georgia, the congresswoman told NBC News. \n\"Obviously since the last general election, we have a lot more work to do,\" Meng said. \"So I feel like I have something to add to that process and would love to help the party going forward.\" U.S. Representative Grace Meng (D-NY) speaks during the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 27, 2016. R REUTERS/Mike Segar / REUTERS/Mike Segar \nThe winter gathering, when DNC members vote in their officers, comes as Democrats regroup in the wake of President Donald Trump's November victory, which surprised many. While much attention of late has been on the selection of a new DNC chairman , some nine candidates as of Wednesday afternoon were also vying for vice chair positions, Meng said. \nRELATED: Rep. Grace Meng Elected Vice Chair of Democratic National Committee \nMeng has held one of those five slots since late July when party members unanimously elected her shortly after the DNC convention in Philadelphia. The spot had been vacant since former vice chair Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) resigned from it last February . \nMeng said outreach to emerging and immigrant communities and working with millennials are among the areas she'll continue to focus on if reelected. She also said she wants to use ethnic media to engage groups often overlooked by the DNC. Post by NBC News . \n\"Whether it's the Chinese or Vietnamese newspapers, or whether it's in-language radio outlets, the DNC was not touching those,\" Meng said. \"These are groups of constituents and voters that we should be reaching. I believe the [Republican National Committee] puts efforts and resources into many of these outlets, so our party should be doing at least what the RNC is doing.\" \nRELATED: As Asian-American Electorate Grows, GOP Aims to Turn Local Wins National \nIn recent years, the RNC has made a concerted push to win back Asian Americans, a bloc that once gave 55 percent of its vote in 1992 to former President George H.W. Bush, according to Cornell University. Those efforts have included using social and ethnic media, as well as going door to door, to find voters receptive to the Republican message. “ If left untouched, we don’t know what will happen, and we can’t just take the Asian-American community for granted.” \nFormer Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton still toppled Trump among Asian Americans, securing 79 percent of their vote , according to an Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund exit poll. \nBut a nonpartisan survey released in October found that more than 1 in 5 Asian Americans were undecided before the election. Asian Americans last year made up around 4 percent of the nationwide electorate, according to Pew Research , and are the fastest growing racial group in the country. \nRELATED: Opinion: Effective Asian American and Pacific Islander Voter Engagement Must Continue \nDespite Clinton's success with Asian-American voters, Meng said she was concerned about the RNC's efforts to woo that electorate. \n\"When you've seen many Asians in the past lean Democratic, it's not just a coincidence,\" she said. \"I think a large reason is because we've seen more Democratic Asian candidates across the board, and that has also helped increase alliances between the Democratic party and the Asian-American community.
