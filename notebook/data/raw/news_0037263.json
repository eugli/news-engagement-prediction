There is a decent number of phones that are covered in the post although not all of them are focused on getting VoLTE support, as some of them are on their way to receiving the update to Android 7.0 Nougat. While Rogers does note that the Pixel and Pixel XL will get this update soon, the perhaps unfortunate thing for subscribers of the network who use either of Google’s Pixel devices and are looking forward to VoLTE is that the update schedule literally says “coming soon” so there is no exact time frame for the release. \nComing soon could mean that the update will hit by the end of next week or it could mean that the update is more than a month away. With VoLTE under the hood, Pixel and Pixel XL owners will be able to see a marked improvement on voice quality when making phone calls, and should they need or want to talk on the phone while browsing the web they’ll finally be able to do so with LTE speeds as they continue with the call at the same time. \nIn addition to the VoLTE support coming for Google’s latest smartphones, there is an update showing up for the Samsung Galaxy S5 on February 22nd which is next Wednesday, although this is just a security update with bug fixes and improvements. There is also an update on the way on February 28th for the Huawei Kiwi GR5, though this is also a security update. The devices which might be getting the most exciting software are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, as they’re both on schedule to be receiving a bump in software versions from Marshmallow to Nougat in the near future. These two devices will also be joined by the Leonovo Moto Z Play which is scheduled to receive the same update soon as well. This will bump those three devices up to Android 7.0 from Android 6.0.1.
