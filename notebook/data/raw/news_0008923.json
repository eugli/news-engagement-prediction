(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (CBS) – As we celebrate the latest and, arguably, the greatest Patriots’ Super Bowl title ever, let’s take a moment to consider just what it is we’re celebrating. \nObviously, we’re honoring the skill and accomplishment of the players. \nAs Coach Bill Belichick constantly points out, they’re the ones getting the job done on the field, playing hurt, performing at a high level, modeling determination and toughness. \nAnd certainly, the coach and his staff are being celebrated in the Back Bay today. \nIn a culture where examples of brilliant leadership are few and far between, Belichick and his assistants consistently show how it’s done, without fanfare and without belittling the opposition. I’ve suggested in the past that Belichick turn to politics when he’s done with football, and that idea has never seemed more valid. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady.

They are closely involved, but are never overly meddlesome. Roger Goodell, after handing the Lombardi Trophy to Robert Kraft.

Other cities may have devout sports fans, but not in our numbers. Patriots fans line up outside of Gillette Stadium to send the team off to Houston and Super Bowl LI. (WBZ-TV) \nAnd where in America are the fans more deserving of our amazing run of success? \nYes, the weather’s much nicer in Miami today. But Miami’s teams stink. \nSo let it rain, and all hail the Pats. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
