And now, the actor turned author is all set to don a producer’s hat with her maiden production venture, Pad Man. The project will be produced under her new banner and will have her superstar husband, Akshay Kumar, in the lead role.

Katrina Kaif is reportedly planning to turn producer and also launch her younger sister, Isabel Kaif, in the Hindi film industry. Ranbir Kapoor’s debut production venture, Jagga Jasoos, is likely to hit theatres this year. Emraan Hashmi also turns producer with Tony D’Souza-directed Captain Nawab, which is expected to release this year. \nWatch Jagga Jasoos trailer \nSpeaking about his project, Emraan says, “My first project is a patriotic film inspired by real events. It is an aspirational story and also has other elements that will make for an interesting film. When you hear some of the scripts, you want to own them. Besides being an actor, I can also submit my inputs as a creative producer. I’d like to produce movies and stories that I find interesting.” Priyanka Chopra, after Marathi and Punjabi films, turns to Hindi film production this year. (HT Photo) \nGoing slow \nOn the other hand, director Zoya Akhtar, who has so far made films under brother Farhan Akhtar’s banner, is turning to production with Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt-starrer, Gully Boy. Also, after her forays into Punjabi and Marathi cinema, Priyanka Chopra is venturing into Hindi film territory with Little Joe Kaha Ho? (in Konkani and Hindi) and Almaseer. Ranbir Kapoor produces his next release, Jagga Jasoos. (HT Photo) \n“We are a small production house and we’re taking things slowly. We want to make good quality films — in Hindi, English or regional languages — that have new stories to tell. Hopefully, everything will go well. We’re looking forward to creating more movies, TV content, and entertainment for the rest of the world,” says Priyanka. Her mother Dr Madhu Chopra takes care of her production house in India even as the actor is busy working in the West. Twinkle Khanna turns producer with Pad Man that stars her hubby, Akshay Kumar. (HT Photo) \nExperts feel that it’s not necessary for all actors to turn producers, but they admit that turning producer may turn out well provided a “good business model can be followed and sustained over a period of time”. “It [production] gives [you] a lot of freedom, but as they say, with freedom comes responsibility. So, if an actor is turning producer, they should be an asset to a film and not become a liability,” says exhibitor-distributor Akshaye Rathi. Zoya Akhtar turns to production with Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt-starrer Gully Boy. (HT Photo) \nNo pressure \nRanbir thinks along the same lines. “I wanted to have a 50-50 partnership with the director of the film I was producing. I don’t want to produce the film all by myself, because the director should also feel like it is his film too. This way, we can do things our way without any pressure… we know that we can make the film the way we want to,” says the actor. Emraan Hashmi turns producer with his next, Captain Nawab. (HT Photo) \nAt the same time, experts also feel that an actor becoming a producer can be the “only way out” for films starring big names. “In fact, the way things are going right now [in the industry], if an actor commands a fee above a certain limit, that [turning producer] is the only way to go,” says Rathi. \nThis year will also see Anushka Sharma and her brother, Karnesh Sharma returning to the producers’ chair with their second venture, Phillauri, after NH10 (2015). Also, Sanjay Dutt is co-producing a Rajkumar Hirani-directed biopic on his life. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:03.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
