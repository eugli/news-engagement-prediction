From left are White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Trump, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier and Ford CEO Mark Fields. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Associated Press \nPresident Trump brought two dozen chief executives of manufacturing companies to the White House on Thursday and declared their collective commitment to restoring factory jobs lost to foreign competition. \nYet some of the CEOs suggested that there were still plenty of openings for U.S. factory jobs but too few qualified people to fill them. They urged the White House to support vocational training for the high-tech skills that today's manufacturers increasingly require — a topic Trump has seldom addressed. \n“The jobs are there, but the skills are not,” one executive said during meetings with White House officials that preceded a session with the president. (Reporters were permitted to attend the meetings on the condition of not quoting individual executives by name.) \nThe discussion of job training and worker skills is a relatively new one for Trump, who campaigned for the White House on promises to restore manufacturing jobs that he said had been lost over flawed trade deals and unfair competition from countries like Mexico and China. \nAgain and again, Trump brought up that theme in his meeting with the CEOs. \n“Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back,” Trump said. “The good jobs, the real jobs. They've left.” \nWhite House officials said Trump heard the executives’ concerns about a shortage of qualified workers. The officials said Trump supports efforts to increase training for factory jobs, but they didn't provide details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:01:27.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
