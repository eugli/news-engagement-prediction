The group contends that the images show violations of the federal Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which decrees that animals must be “rendered insensible to pain” before they are slaughtered. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We see a lot of ineffective stunning in the video because the animals are continuing to move after slaughter,” said Erica Meier, the group’s executive director. The video also raises questions about Superior Farms’s promise that all meat from the plant is butchered according to the Islamic rules of halal, or ritual slaughter. The company said Wednesday that the video was another example of an animal rights group misconstruing normal slaughter practices, with which most people are unfamiliar. “The video falsely alleges multiple violations” of the slaughter law, the company said in a statement. It said the stunning procedures seen in the video ensure that a sheep is “absolutely insensitive to pain,” and that the use of the knife seen in the video was appropriate for slicing the carotid arteries and jugular veins. As for the changing of dates on packages, the company said labeling was often updated when new information was received or errors made. “The packaging label changes shown in the video are not the result of any falsification of dates,” it said.

Compassion Over Killing has sent its video to the United States Department of Agriculture, which inspects the plant and can shut it down for violations of the slaughter law. The department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service “is reviewing the video and will take appropriate action as necessary,” Aaron Lavallee, a spokesman, wrote in an email. “We take the safety of our food supply and the welfare of all animals seriously.” The video shows a sheep being repeatedly stunned with a hand-held electronic device, a practice Mr. David said he saw several times. “You can see them tense up as the stunner hits them,” he said, “then their head droops a bit, and then they often begin to struggle again when the workers try to lay them on the slaughter line.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Lester Castro Friedlander, a former inspector for the department who volunteers with various animal rights groups, viewed the video and said it was clear that some of the animals were in pain when their throats were slashed or their tails were cut off. The Humane Method of Slaughter Act requires that if an animal is stunned before slaughter, it must be immediately rendered unconscious. “The stunned animal shall remain in a state of surgical anesthesia through shackling, sticking and bleeding,” the law states. Mr. Friedlander said he believed that “the voltage probably wasn’t high enough to adequately stun the animals. And I think they know that — otherwise, why do they have an electrical stunner right next to the place where the animal is being bled out? You don’t need that if the animal is properly stunned from the beginning.” Americans eat less than a pound of lamb a year per capita, according to the Department of Agriculture. “While more lamb is consumed each year, the increase is absorbed by the increase in population, causing consumption to be flat” on a percentage basis, a department spokesman wrote in an email.
