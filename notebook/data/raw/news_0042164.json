He was about to leave for Macau. \nJong-chol has since been remanded for seven days until Friday. \nIt is learnt that the suspect often travelled in and out of Malaysia and has been in the country for at least a year. \nPolice are still hunting for three more suspects, aged between 30 and 50, linked to the case. \nIn another development, representatives from the North Korean embassy went to the Sepang district police headquarters (IPD) at about 4pm and spent about an hour there. \nIt is believed that the embassy officials went to the IPD to gain access to Jong-chol. \nHowever, the officials did not stop to speak to journalists waiting outside the IPD. \nRelated stories: \nN.
