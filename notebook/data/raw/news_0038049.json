One of the reasons is thought to be due to the El Nino weather pattern, which is increasing water temperatures and reducing their food supply.\nThey breed on the Pacific coast of South America and the offshore islands of Chile and Peru.\nBBC Nature - Humboldt penguin videos, news and facts", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Humboldt_Penguin", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1FAC/production/_94680180_germany_mannheim_464_0217.cmp.png", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10624/production/_94680176_mediaitem94680174.jpg", "http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/vermisster-pinguin-in-mannheim-kadaver-entdeckt-staatsanwaltschaft-ermittelt-a-1134929.html"], "published": "2017-02-16T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:51:42.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
