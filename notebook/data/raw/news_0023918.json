Associated Press He’s another one of those overnight sensations that was years in the making.\nMore than two years after Okaro White played his last game at Florida State and went undrafted by the NBA, White not only has accomplished his dream of playing in the NBA, but he has become one of the league’s more intriguing stories.\nHeading into Friday night’s game at Brooklyn, the Miami Heat are 12-0 since they signed White from the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League. And after every win, the Heat’s official Twitter account makes a post in reference to their new good-luck charm.\n12-0karo pic.twitter.com/scYREeQr0Y\n— Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) February 9, 2017 “When he got his call-up, immediately they had success,” FSU assistant coach Stan Jones said of his former protege. “They haven’t lost a game.”\nThe win streak is especially important to the Heat, who were struggling mightily for most of this season. With 12 straight wins, they now hold the NBA record for longest such streak by a team below .500.\nAnd while White hasn’t necessarily been the driving force behind those wins, he has found a niche, averaging 4.3 points and 2.6 rebounds per game, while also giving the Heat a long, athletic defender.\n“Okaro’s always had the potential to be an NBA player,” Jones said. “He has the length, he has the athleticism, he’s had the acumen to be an NBA player, and he’s continued to mature and develop his game.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/829830368207446016", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/cqvqg91cqqhr3p6t2g3k", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/cqvqg91cqqhr3p6t2g3k)", "https://t.co/scYREeQr0Y"], "published": "2017-02-11T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:49:55.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
