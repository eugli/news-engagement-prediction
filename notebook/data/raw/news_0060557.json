Such has been the case with the long demanded Step Brothers 2 . The most recent news on the project, however, will not make those fans very happy. Will Ferrell says that part of the reason the original film was so special was because it was a new idea, which means that a sequel is not something he necessarily wants to do. \nYou have to resist the temptation. It's just tough because the things everyone wants you to do sequels of are special because there's not a sequel of it. I guess we'll see, but as of now there are no plans. We just don't want to be doing sequels of everything. \nWhile there have been rumblings of plans for a Step Brothers sequel over the years, it would seem that nothing of note is being done with those plans. Not only is nobody working toward a sequel, but it seems that there's currently an active movement against making another one. \nThis shows a pretty significant shift from where the project was just a couple of years ago. There was an outline for a Step Brothers sequel ready to go when Will Ferrell got the call to make another sequel to one of his popular comedies, Anchorman . While that project took Ferrell away from the Step Brothers follow-up it certainly seemed like he was going to come back to it. Now, however, the comedian's comments to Rolling Stone make it seem like maybe the experience of making Anchorman 2 might have turned him off from making sequels in general. \nI think we personally feel great about what we did with Anchorman 2 . And I think there are actually some people who like it more than the original. But then you always get that little bit of people saying, 'Awww, why'd they have to do that?' \nThere will always be people who will turn their nose up at the idea of a sequel to a film they thought was great, but then there will also be those who actively want to see more of whatever they enjoyed the first time around. There's certainly no pleasing everybody. \nWhile this makes it seem like a Step Brothers sequel is the last thing we'll ever see, folks shouldn't give up on the concept entirely. Director Adam McKay says that the central joke of the film only gets funnier the older that Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly become, so the possibility of going back to it at some point down the road will always be there. What's more, Ferrell and McKay continue to write together, so even if there's never a sequel, the possibility of the next Step Brothers , the next incredibly funny, and totally original idea, is also a strong possibility.
