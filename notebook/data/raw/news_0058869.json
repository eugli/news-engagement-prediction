GETTY Britain's motorists pay the highest fuel tax in the world With our road network such a snarling, constipated ruin, we wonder why pollution is at record levels? Quentin Wilson \nAccording to a national passenger survey run by watchdog Transport Focus, satisfaction with services has suffered a significant decline over the past year with commuters in the south-east particularly unhappy. \nFare rises have easily outstripped wage inflation in the last decade but one in five passengers now expect a poor service and two million commuters see late trains and overcrowding as a normal part of everyday life. \nThe roads report, commissioned by the FairFuelUK campaign, said rail investment is almost nine times that of road investment per mile, with £186,000 spent on rail infrastructure for every million miles of passenger travel in 2015 compared with £21,000 for roads. \nIt said road upgrades deliver economic benefits that are 50 per cent higher.

IG 1 of 16 Vehicles teeter on the edge of Yungas Road in Bolivia aka Death Road, which claims the lives of around 200 people every year \nA separate study by traffic consultancy Inrix found Britain’s roads are also the most congested in western Europe and London is the world’s seventh worst city for tailbacks, with vehicles reduced to 4mph at peak times. \nMotoring journalist and FairFuelUK spokesman Quentin Willson said: “These are truly shameful numbers. With our road network such a snarling, constipated ruin, we wonder why pollution is at record levels?” \nThe Department for Transport said: “We are investing a record £23 billion to make the biggest improvements to our roads since the 1970s, making journeys faster, better and more reliable for everyone.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:15:12.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
