Very happy (delighted really) to announce that we’re also not publishing Milo. — Canongate (@canongatebooks) February 21, 2017 \nUnfortunately for the person controlling Canongate’s social media accounts, information to the contrary later emerged. @canongatebooks My colleague tells me we're currently in discussions with piss-covered wolf, 1 of the most exciting new voices in literature — Canongate (@canongatebooks) February 21, 2017 \nAnd it got worse - there were already plans afoot for the luminary piss-covered wolf. @canongatebooks Should think so too! U sold us TV rights to Piss Covered Wolf's book 4 a fortune. Already started filming w the Chuckle Bros — Channel 4 Press (@C4Press) February 21, 2017 \nThankfully they managed to recover and it appears piss-covered wolf’s debut book will be in stock soon. Very excited for this. ‘Voice of a generation’ is an overused phrase but, believe me, in this case the hype is well deserved. pic.twitter.com/0wfNQiHV1N — Caitlin Moran (@caitlinmoran) February 21, 2017 \nNot everyone was happy with the publisher’s stance, with lovers of brawling clowns threatening to boycott them in response. @canongatebooks Disappointed in your attitude to this, will turn to more enlightened stockists of clown brawl texts in future. Good day sir! — Steve Hey (@SteveHey2) February 21, 2017 @canongatebooks Shame. I liked Two Clowns in a Bar Fight way before they had that hit single & got big. — David Pattie (@DavidPattie) February 21, 2017 \nBravo Canongate, bravo. — EuroGav Reads (@gavreads) February 21, 2017 Note to all: be more like Gav. https://t.co/Rzh2FJHeFB — Canongate (@canongatebooks) February 21, 2017 \nIn December, it was reported the British-born Breitbart News editor had signed a $250,000 book deal with Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. \nIn the videos , which were posted online Sunday, Yiannopoulos can be heard defending “relationships between younger boys and older men”, saying that society tends to “get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff”. \nYiannopoulos responded in a post on Facebook, stating that the videos of him were “selectively edited.” “I do not support pedophilia. Period,” he said. \n“If it somehow comes across (through my own sloppy phrasing or through deceptive editing) that I meant any of the ugly things alleged, let me set the record straight: I am completely disgusted by the abuse of children.” \nSimon & Schuster’s Adam Rothberg later announced that the company and its Threshold Editions division would be cancelling the book that was due for release on June 13.
