We all want toned abs. \nWhy wouldn't you? \nRELATED: Exercises for Toning Your Abs Without Straining Your Low Back \nGrowing up, I used to crank out Crunches, Sits-Ups, Planks or whatever I could just to get those washboard abs. At age 13 it was pretty easy to have abs. My metabolism was sky high and I was wrestling every day of my life. I had a solid set of six-pack abs and it felt great! \nThrough high school and my collegiate wrestling career at Michigan State, I still had those toned abs from being an athlete and training my body to the limit every day. \nCollege came to an end, I got a job, wife, kids and BAM! My Sit-Ups and Crunches got put on the back burner. Not a good idea. \nI thought that I could get by with doing my basic moves—you know Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Sled Push, you name it. I was doing everything except targeting my abs. \nSo after a vacation this past fall, I came home after a week of drinking beer and eating everything in sight to discover that I had kind of lost my abs! \nWhat? No!! \nThis had to come to an end. \nSo I went back to my 13-year-old days and came up with a Simple Ab Routine that I could do in addition to my strength workouts. Sure enough, it still works! \nAfter doing this workout just twice a week, I now have my toned abs back and I'm feeling phenomenal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:48:06.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
