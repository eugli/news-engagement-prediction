A General Catalyst spokeswoman declined to comment for this article. Mr. Spiegel was unhappy with the outcome. Over the years, he has alluded to his early dissatisfaction with venture investors. In a 2015 interview at a start-up awards show , he said, “when we were first getting started and took financing, our lawyers would take us through the documents and they’d say, ‘Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s all standard.’” “I’ve since learned that standard means either the person who’s walking you through documents doesn’t understand them or you could be getting taken advantage of,” Mr. Spiegel continued. “When someone says something is standard, just ask why, and why and why and why, until you really understand intricately, I think, how the deal is structured.” \nAdvertisement   Mr. Spiegel embarked on a way to work around Lightspeed and Mr. Liew so that he could get the investors he wanted for Snapchat in the future. To do so, he struck a deal with Mr. Liew: Lightspeed would be able to buy a limited number of Snapchat shares at a discount. In exchange, the venture firm would remove its right of first refusal clause and other terms that the Snapchat founders considered onerous. Mr. Spiegel later added provisions of his own to Snapchat’s corporate charter. He authorized the creation of a class of preferred stock, FP Preferred, which would have 10-to-1 voting rights, allowing its holders to exercise far more voting power than holders of regular, or common, stock. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy control the FP Preferred shares, which also gives them the power to vote on many things, including the rights of other shareholders. The Snap founders’ overwhelming control of the company is now one of the most talked-about features in its I.P.O. filing. Early institutional investors often take board seats with the companies they nurture and become key advisers. Mr. Liew was not chosen to be an early board member, but other venture investors have joined Snap’s board since. Mitch Lasky, a partner at Benchmark, became a board member in 2013 after his firm led an investment round in Snapchat. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Lasky are close. According to emails between the two men that have become public, Mr. Lasky has given Mr. Spiegel advice on Snap’s valuation and fund-raising, among other matters. Mr. Liew remains special to Snap in one way: He was the first and last investor to get special terms from the company. In subsequent deals, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy retained voting control and did not grant preferential treatment to investors. \nFollow Katie Benner on Twitter @ktbenner .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:38:14.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
