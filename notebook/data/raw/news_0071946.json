He vetoed a similar measure last year. \n“Attempts to restrict women’s access to health care will impede the goal of making Virginia the best place to live, work, and run a business,” he said in a statement. \nAdvocates for the law had said it would underpin organizations that provide the widest range of services. \nPlanned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions. Republican President Donald Trump has pledged to defund the organization. \n(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by James Dalgleish) Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?
