He's notorious for his disparaging comments about Muslims, women, transgender people, and widespread bullying against these groups. \nThe decision to drop Yiannopoulos from the CPAC speaker lineup and cancel publication of his book received cheers from Republicans and Democrats alike, while people who affiliate with the fractured alt-right movement, of which Yiannopoulos is a controversial and sometimes reluctant voice, lamented the move as political hit job and a loss for free speech. Others, like author Roxane Gay, called out publisher Simon & Schuster for not acting sooner. \nDigging into the group that sparked the uproar over Yiannopoulos' comments about pedophiles, which he has since condemned, reveals a knot of links that leads back to an independent conservative presidential candidate, a pro-Democrat progressive operative, and one of the most active grassroots movements in the United States. \nThe video of Yiannopoulos, which was freely available on YouTube, was promoted by the Twitter account of a group calling itself the Reagan Battalion, an elusive and apparently conservative activist group. The video sparked an immediate uproar in conservative circles, with many calling for Yiannopoulos to be dropped from CPAC. . @ReaganBattalion 's statement in regards to #ACUConservative rescinding their invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017 . pic.twitter.com/Z6iEiy4jp0 ‚Äî The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 20, 2017 \nWho exactly is behind the Reagan Battalion brand is immediately unclear. Reagan Battalion's online presence is remarkably sparse. It consists only of a website, which advocates for 16 popular conservative blogging and news publications, as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook page where the group describes itself as a ‚Äúsource for news, information, commentary, from a conservative perspective.‚Äù Conservative media websites featured on the home page. Screenshot via thereaganbattalion.com \nEmployees at four of the publications listed by the Reagan Battalion‚Äîthe Daily Caller, the National Review, the Federalist, and the Blaze‚Äîsaid their companies have no affiliation with the Reagan Battalion. ‚ÄúWe have no affiliation with this site at all. Looking at it, I assume this is just his way of promoting websites that he likes,‚Äù Leon Wolf, managing editor of the Blaze, told the Daily Dot. \n‚ÄúNo relation at all,‚Äù said Madeline Orr, a spokeswoman for the Federalist, of the Reagan Battalion. ‚ÄúNever heard of them, and ‚Äòthe Federalist‚Äô logo they have on their site is not our logo. Looks like a knock off.‚Äù \nOther publications listed on the Reagan Battalion site did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nAttempts to contact the Reagan Battalion through Facebook and Twitter went unanswered, as of publication. A quick run back through the group‚Äôs posting history reveals that it backed Evan McMullin for president during last year‚Äôs election. [Placeholder for https://www.facebook.com/ReaganBattalion/posts/1717352488590853 embed.] Screenshot via evanmcmullin.com McMullin was a former CIA operations officer turned investment banker who ran as an independent presidential candidate in the 2016 election . He was an opponent of President Donald Trump , a voice in what became known as the #NeverTrump movement ‚Äîa trend, rather than a cohesive or clearly organized initiative. ‚Äî Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) August 26, 2016 \nIn a tweet posted on Monday, after news of Yiannopoulos' book deal hit the internet, McMullin retweeted a pro-Trump activist who alleges the former candidate spent $250,000 on opposition research against Yiannopoulos and was involved in his ouster. Never cared much for Nazi punks. ‚úñÔ∏è‚úåüèæüá∫üá∏ https://t.co/ra2Vu97ogt ‚Äî Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) February 21, 2017 More revelatory, perhaps, the only contact information on the Reagan Battalion Facebook page is a link back to a now defunct website for the Stop Donald Trump PAC . However, the ‚ÄúStop Donald Trump PAC‚Äù never existed in any official capacity, according to a search of Federal Election Commission records. \nAn archived donation page, which appears to be exactly the same as a hidden donation page on the current Reagan Battalion website, suggests that the site was managed and paid for by an official PAC registered with the FEC under Stop Trump PAC. \nBoth the website for the Stop Trump PAC and its Twitter account have since been shut down. \nThe Stop Trump PAC named on the donation page was established in March 2016 in opposition to Trump‚Äôs presidential bid but was quickly forced by the FEC to close down in June because it used a political candidate‚Äôs name in its own PAC. \nThe donation page for the Stop Donald Trump PAC explains at the bottom that it was paid for by the Stop Trump PAC and lists the website StopDonaldTrump.com . Interestingly, that site now redirects to the Indivisible Guide. Indivisible Guide is a grassroots group, backed by progressives and some Democrats, that is often characterized as the Tea Party of the Left. \nThe Reagan Battalion Twitter account was established months before the Stop Trump PAC, in December 2015, and its website was registered months later, in July 2016 . Prior to backing McMullin, the group regularly tweeted out support for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) before his presidential bid failed to topple Trump, who the group consistently called a ‚Äúliberal.‚Äù \nCuriously, on July 11, 2016, just weeks after terminating its FEC registration, the archives show that a page appears on the Stop Trump PAC‚Äôs website dedicated to the Reagan Battalion , although it contains no information on the group. \nFurther complicating matters, the named treasurer on the FEC records for the Stop Trump PAC is Nathan Lerner. The Stop trump PAC FEC registration information. Screenshot via fec.gov Lerner is now the executive director of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, previously known as the Keep America Great PAC . Co-founded by Lerner and Scott Dworkin, the Keep America Great PAC aimed to raise $20 million to mobilize voters who were not pleased with either Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . As the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the group ‚Äúnow exists to hold the Trump White House accountable,‚Äù according to its website .\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Lerner for comment but has not received a response. \nSo, to recap: The Reagan Battalion bills itself as a coalition of conservative news outlets, many of which often take a critical stance on Trump but claim no affiliation with the group. Reagan Battalion lists in its contact information a website for the nonexistent Stop Donald Trump PAC. That group's web presence has largely been deleted, but archived copies show it was paid for by the Stop Trump PAC, a registered political action committee, created by a progressive activist, the website of which now links to the grassroots group Indivisible. \nWhat remains unclear is whether Lerner and other progressive activists are directly involved in the Reagan Battalion and whether the connections to progressive groups reveal a conspiracy to undermine certain segments of the conservative movement‚Äîor simply reveal the messy nature of American political groups. \nWhat is clear, however, is that Milo Yiannopoulos made some unfortunate public statements about pedophiles, which led to his recent downfall‚Äîno matter who first tweeted out the video. \nDisclosure: Milo Yiannopoulos was the founder of the Kernel, a publication the Daily Dot acquired in 2014. \nAdditional reporting by Andrew Couts and Dell Cameron.
