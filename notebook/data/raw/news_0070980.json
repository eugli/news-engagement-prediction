The assault, that lasted for two-and-half hours, ended with the actor being thrown out of her car near Padamugal in Kakkanad. \nThe chain of events unfolded thus: The actor left the site of her shoot at Patturaikkal near Thrissur around 7 pm in an SUV provided by Lal Creations. She was headed to her friend’s house in Kochi’s Panampilly Nagar. \nDuring the journey, the driver - Martin - sent several SMSs to someone. Based on the information given by Martin, the gang followed the actor in a catering van and hit her car deliberately around 8.30 pm near the Nedumbassery Airport Junction. \nWhen the car stopped, the second and the third accused persons barged into the car and forcefully covered her mouth with their palms. Threatening and asking the actor not to shout, the accused grabbed the mobile from her. \nDuring the journey, the third accused (not named in the FIR) got down from the car at Kalamassery. The fourth accused - clad in a black T-shirt - then entered the car and helped the others overpower her before stepping down at Palarivattom. \nThere, the fifth and sixth accused persons joined the abduction team. They diverted their route and entered a house with a grilled gate. From there the prime accused Pulsar Suni, whose real name is Sunil Kumar, entered the scene with a towel covering his face and took over the driver’s seat. Martin, who had driven the car till then, left the gang and moved into the catering van. Pulsar Suni then drove the car to Kakkanad where he molested her. \nActing at the behest of a third party, Pulsar Suni told her he was entrusted with the task “of shooting her compromising pictures and videos” and wanted the actor to cooperate. After being thrown out of the car, the actor took refuge at the residence of director Lal, who reported the incident to the police.
