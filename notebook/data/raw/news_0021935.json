The Patriots tight end was partying at Shrine Nightclub with his brothers Glenn and Gordie , and hip-hop star Rick Ross . We’re told Gronk and his entourage cracked open and sprayed about 45 bottles of champagne — including 15 liters of Luc Belaire — and doused the jubilant crowd with bubbly from their perch in the DJ booth at the club. While Ross performed, Gronk pumped up the throngs of Pats fans in the club. He busted out his sunglasses, danced, and chugged champagne, as Gronk is wont to do.\nRoss definitely has a thing for the Patriots. We’re told he led some anti- Roger Goodell chants during the post-parade celebration at Shrine, and have you ever listened to his rap lyrics? On the track “Mafia Music III” Ross says, “ Bill Belichick , coachin’ and callin’ the shots,” and on his latest single, he gives a shout-out to “ Tom Brady my new neighbor.” He also appears with Drake and Lil Wayne on the French Montana song “Pop That,” in which he busts out the line, “Ballin’, ballin’ like I play for New England.”\nICON nightclub\nDevin McCourty.
