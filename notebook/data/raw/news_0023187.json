The Guardian was unable to independently verify the report. \nSnowden’s ACLU lawyer, Ben Wizner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, he told NBC News he was unaware of any plan to return his client to the US.\n“Team Snowden has received no such signals and has no new reason for concern,” Wizner said.\nEdward Snowden (@Snowden) Finally: irrefutable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian intel. No country trades away spies, as the rest would fear they're next. https://t.co/YONqZ1gYqm \nFebruary 10, 2017 Russia granted Snowden asylum in 2013 and a three-year residency in 2014. Snowden has been living in exile in Moscow, facing charges in the US including violations of the US Espionage Act for leaking documents about secret mass surveillance programs.\nSpeaking at a GOP candidate debate in March 2016 , Trump said of Snowden: “I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy. It didn’t take me a long time to figure that one out.”\nThe Kremlin publicly dismissed these claims.\nSnowden offered a longer explanation of his feelings of vindication when he was interviewed by Katie Couric in December 2016 , when rumours of a Russian handover first started circulating.\nState of surveillance: privacy in Donald Trump's America – tech podcast Read more \nHe described the suggestion as vindication that he was“independent”. He added: “The fact that I’ve always worked on behalf of the United States and the fact that Russia doesn’t own me. In fact the Russian government may see me as a sort of liability.”\nSnowden suggested that a reason why Russia might want to return him was his recent criticism of the Kremlin’s human rights record and his suggestions that its officials had hacked US security networks.\nPreviously Snowden has said that Moscow had “gone very far, in ways that are completely unnecessary, costly and corrosive to individual and collective rights” in monitoring citizens online.\nWhen Couric asked if Snowden would mind being extradited, he replied: “That would obviously be something that would be a threat to my liberty and to my life.\n“But what I’m saying here is you can’t have it both ways. You can’t say this guy’s a bad guy – a Russian tool or something like that – at the same time you say he’s going to be traded away.”\nAfter reiterating his sense of vindication on Friday, Snowden posted again to Twitter: “Speak not because it is safe, but because it is right.”\nEdward Snowden (@Snowden) Speak not because it is safe, but because it is right.\nFebruary 11, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:31:58.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
