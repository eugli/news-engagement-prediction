The source goes on to explain that male employees \"need to have a certain look\" and \"be sharply dressed\" at all times, and that Trump is particularly obsessed with ties. The source also revealed to Axios that Press Secretary Sean Spicer was \"reamed\" for his outfit at his first briefing room meeting, and that Steve Bannon gets a pass on the appearance rule because \"Steve is Steve.\"\nMeanwhile, the president reportedly prefers his female employees \"to dress like women\" - a statement many were quick to take issue with given its incredibly sexist implications. The source adds that \"even if you're in jeans, you need to look neat and orderly\" if you work for Trump, before clarifying that most women still feel pressured to wear dresses in order to impress him.\nIn response, #DressLikeAWoman was soon the top trending topic on Twitter - with thousands offering their own examples of what it means to \"dress like women\" in order to help show that femininity comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and outfits.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 11 NEXT SLIDE >\nClick to expand Replay Video Baby's Priceless Reaction To Water This adorable baby is learning how to be more independent already!
