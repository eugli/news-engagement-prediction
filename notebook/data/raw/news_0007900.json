This post originally appeared on January 3, 2017. In the past few weeks Jeffree Star has shared some major beauty announcements , but that does not mean we’ve lost sight of the hotly anticipated Jeffree Star Cosmetics Androgyny Palette, which has had fans rabid for the past few months wondering what the makeup artist's second eye-shadow palette will look like. Yesterday, Star posted a photo on Instagram finally unveiling the latest—right alongside his first eye-shadow palette, Beauty Killer , which, if you can recall, featured ten different hues with three separate finishes: matte, frost, and glitter. Although the 'gram only shows the palette's exterior packaging, Starr captioned the photo, “Introducing the #ANDROGYNY eyeshadow palette.... Launching in MARCH. 10 jaw dropping shades. This is my version of a 'neutral palette' but with a twist.... sneak peeks and shade reveals coming soon! #jeffreestarcosmetics #androgynypalette.\" So while both palettes each have ten shadows, make no mistake that everything else about them is different. The Androgyny Palette appears sleeker and is encased in hot-pink leather with a bolder, straightforward font—no cursive in sight. And although the long-awaited androgyny palette was set to drop in the fall, it looks like we're going to have to wait a few more months for ten more Starr-approved shadows. Loading View on Instagram While we don't know much else yet, Starr decided to drop one more hint about the Androgyny Palette. Yesterday, the beauty vlogger and muse tweeted out a picture of him with his BFF, Manny MUA , from last August, where Starr (and perhaps Manny) are wearing shades from the palette. Meaning, he sneakily showed us some of the shades already—and we just didn't know it. https://twitter.com/JeffreeStar/status/815658296870768640 As you can see, the hues Starr swept on his lids are a mix of bold oranges and softer blushes, the latter specifically used to rim his waterlines. (Hot tip: This makes the whites of his eyes appear brighter!) While the theme of the Jeffree Star Cosmetics Androgyny Palette is \"neutral,\" it's clear Starr's definition of \"neutral\" is far more exotic than many other neutral shadow palettes of past. But that's no surprise, really, considering Starr's unique approach behind his cult-favorite beauty products . Keep those previews coming Jeffree—we'll be waiting.
