EPA Arsenal Supporters’ Trust believe the actual attendance figure was 10,000 under what was stated against Hull on Saturday Rex Features 6 There were clearly a load of empty seats for the Hull game and the decision of many to stay away was labelled ‘disappointing’ by a club official \nHowever, the AST reckons there were as many as 10,000 empty seats and that the club are duping supporters by telling them the amount of tickets sold rather than fans in attendance. \nA group spokesperson told The Mirror : “They’re deliberately misleading people because they use the word attendance and it’s clearly not attendance. \n“What they’re giving you is tickets sold. They do know what the [real] attendance figure is and sometimes we’re able to get hold of it. \n“It’s obviously guess work using the naked eye but I could tell it was around 50,000 [against Hull] because I know what was recorded for previous games and could work out the equivalent. EPA There were certainly plenty of empty seats around Arsene Wenger EPA A section of unfilled seats can clearly be seen behind Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Rex Features There was no denying the number of vacant seats at Saturday’s game Reuters Some supporters believe Arsene Wenger could be keeping fans away in their droves \n“The club ought to stop hiding behind a fake attendance and start addressing the real reasons.” \nAnd the AST believe Arsene Wenger is one of the reasons people are staying away. \nThe spokesperson added: “There have been disappointing Arsenal results, some people are fed up with the team, some people are fed up with the manager.
