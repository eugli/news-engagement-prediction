That must be a better feeling than anything that is legal on God’s green Earth. Brad didn’t exactly dodge a bullet since he was married in that madness for years, but he got the bullet removed from his brain with no real damage. \nAnd it’s not like spiders are some local delicacy or anything. Angelina herself said that Africans didn’t eat tarantulas because they were good or nutritious. They were mowing down spiders because they were in the middle of fucking war. It’s the same thing for Timon and Pumbaa. They weren’t eating grubs and worms because they tasted like filet mignon. It’s because they were forced to based on their surroundings while they were Hakuna Matataing their dicks off. Which is why Brad will probably have a nice little chuckle to himself today as he eats whatever is on the menu, whether it’s shrimp cocktail, a sandwich, or a superdupermodel’s ass.
