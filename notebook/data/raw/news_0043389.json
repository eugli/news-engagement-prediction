Then there was a law signed in Arkansas that bans a procedure commonly used in the second trimester of abortions , and also included a clause that allowed the woman's partner and family to file a civil lawsuit against the doctor or seek injunctive relief to stop the doctor performing the procedure. Then there's the fact that in some states around Australia it is still illegal to seek an abortion . Oh and Donald Trump reinstating the \"global gag\" which stops funding to US-led international aid groups that provide information on abortions. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Abortion rights activists rejoice in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, Monday, June 27, 2016, as the justices struck down the strict Texas anti-abortion restriction law known as HB2. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite \nAnd one woman has decided that enough is really quite enough. \nIn a bid to highlight the absurdity of laws and societal reactions to a woman's right to making her own decisions, Kentucky state representative Mary Lou Marzian is taking a stand . In response to a new law in Kentucky that requires women to seek a medical consultation 24 hours before having an abortion, Marzian has introduced her own law: a bill that would require men to get written permission from their spouses for Viagra or drugs that do similar things for erectile dysfunction, and the men would also need to only use the drugs for sex within their marriages. Related Content The photo of Trump that enraged women around the world \nAs you can imagine, men did not appear to enjoy this turning of tables. As Marzian said of her law, introduced to make a point and also to enrage, men don't like having their agency taken from them. \n\"I have found that men are very touchy about their sexual lives, and they think that it is very personal,\" Marzian told The New York Times . \"So I wanted to hit a chord that men could understand how it feels to have a politician say, 'Well, you really don't know enough.'\" Advertisement \nIt was a point she further hammered home in a radio interview over the weekend, following widespread attention: \n\"It's picked up because it's hit a nerve. And I have heard probably from at least two or three thousand people all across the state and the country, and I think women and men are just sick and tired of politicians dictating personal, private decisions, number one. And I think that they feel just great. I've had so many [say], 'Way to go, we're so glad you're revealing the hypocrisy.' It's just amazing, the response, and I think people have felt very disenfranchised, and that politicians don't listen and we sit up here and do idiotic things like mandate ultrasounds or whatever for women's health, and it's really struck a nerve.\" \nNow if only Marzian could do something about the male chiropractor who has invented a yet-to-hit-the-market \"feminine lipstick\" designed to literally seal a woman's labia shut during her period . The CEO and President at Mensez Technologies, Daniel Dopps describes his product as such: \n\"Mensez feminine lipstick is a natural patented compound of amino acids and oil in a lipstick applicator that is applied to the labia minora and causes them to cling together in a manner strong enough to retain menstrual fluid in the vestibule above the labia minora where the vaginal opening and urethra exit. The Mensez compound is instantly washed away with urine, which releases the menstrual fluid along with the urine into the toilet every time a woman urinates. No pads or tampons are needed. Safe, secure and clean.\" \nHe has of course been thoroughly pressed on his technology and also on why he perhaps felt the need to design a product for women without proper understanding or experience of the female anatomy. \nBut then again, men will never have an abortion either so...
