Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad Airways has strongly hit back at UK's aviation authority over non-payment of passenger compensation over delayed flights.\"Etihad Airways has been engaged in constructive dialogue with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK on the issue of compensation over several months. We take such matters very seriously and in no way look to breach the law,\" the airline said in a statement to Khaleej Times.According to a statement by the CAA, several airlines, including American Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines, have breached consumer law by not paying compensation to passengers who face a delay in the first leg of their flight, thereby missing the connecting flight, causing them to arrive at their destination more than three hours late.\"Over 200,000 passengers each year travelling on these airlines could be at risk of missing their onward connection and thereby being delayed by over three hours at their final destination,\" the CAA said.Etihad, however, has strongly denied these claims, calling the \"CAA's approach wholly 'unprofessional and unacceptable' to publicly blame Etihad Airways for infringements to passengers' rights which we unreservedly deny\".\"Further to our own review, we categorically state we have not contravened the law, yet pledge to maintain dialogue with the CAA and regulators to ensure we continue to have robust compensation policies in place,\" the statement added.\"The issue of a non EU airlines' liability under EC261 for a delay due to a missed connecting flight outside of the EU is currently subject to a case that will be heard by the UK Court of Appeal. Etihad Airways will, of course, abide by any decision of the Court of Appeal.\"Passengers on long-haul flights who experience delays of between three and four hours are entitled to 300 euros (Dh1,165) compensation, while those delayed by more than four hours are entitled to 600 euros (Dh2,332).
