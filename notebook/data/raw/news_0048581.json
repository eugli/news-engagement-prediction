It’s a horrible, horrible world out there.” \nAbbott said people abusing her on the internet tended to dehumanise her and in particular “talk about black politicians in a different way”. \nShe called for Facebook and Twitter to do more to stop abuse being directed at people, while maintaining freedom of speech, and suggested a parliamentary inquiry could look into how the social media firms had responded to hate speech. \n“No one really has a right to peddle this racist and sexist abuse … I think there is probably a case for a parliamentary inquiry, partly to make internet providers do more to close down these people,” she said. \n“They are poisoning the political debate and putting off particularly young women from getting involved in political debate online and they must be putting off some women from getting involved in politics.” \nAbbott said online abuse had become “turbo-charged and it’s become worse and it’s almost as if they want to drive some of us out of politics. \n“Now you can press a button and threaten to rape someone. The more some of these guys see this stuff online, they more they become encouraged and emboldened.” \nShe said she first had a “wobble” about staying on as an MP a few years ago but was talked out of it by her colleague Keith Vaz who told her: “Diane, you have forgotten what it took for us to get here.” \nAbbott first revealed the scale of abuse she received in an article for the Guardian last week, saying she might have thought twice about entering public life if she could have predicted some of the abuse she received today. \nIn the article , she said: “Suppose that someone had told me back then that 30 years on I would be receiving stuff like this: ‘Pathetic useless fat black piece of shit Abbott. Just a piece of pig shit pond slime who should be fucking hung (if they could find a tree big enough to take the fat bitch’s weight)’. Then I think that even the young, recklessly fearless Diane Abbott might have paused for thought.” \nAbbott is one of a number of senior MPs to have spoken of the need to stop misogynistic abuse towards politicians in recent years, particularly online. \nYvette Cooper , the former shadow home secretary, has said online harassment and abuse is “stifling debate and ruining lives”, while Maria Miller , the Tory former cabinet minister who now chairs parliament’s women and equality committee, has also called for action. \nA number of online trolls have been convicted of threats towards female MPs, including two who subjected the Liverpool MP Luciana Berger to campaigns of antisemitic abuse. In 2014 a man was jailed for 18 weeks for bombarding the Labour MP Stella Creasy with messages threatening to rape her. \nJess Phillips , the MP for Birmingham Yardley, has spoken of receiving more than 600 threats of rape in one night on Twitter and had extra security installed in her home.
