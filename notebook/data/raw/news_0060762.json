On Friday’s broadcast of “ Real Time ,” the host referenced the results of a recent Fox News poll which suggested that more people currently think they can trust President Donald Trump than they can the press. Maher praised various outlets for already pushing back against the Trump administration’s falsehoods — such as NBC’s Chuck Todd for taking on Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway over her “ alternative facts ” and the New York Times for calling out Trump’s “lies” on its front page.
