Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Feb 1, 2017 A Colorado-based U.S. Army armored brigade has deployed to Poland to deter Russian aggression. It's part of a new rotational plan designed to keep U.S. Army ground forces in the area indefinitely. The deployment and others like it are meant as a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose 2014 annexation of the Crimea and intimidation of Scandinavian and Baltic countries has prompted local politicians to ask NATO for a show of force.   Equipped with the latest Abrams tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, the brigade has traveled all the way from Fort Carson, Colorado, to western Poland, where it will remain for much of 2017 conducting training and drills with Polish Army troops. The 3,5000-man Third Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, will spend the better part of a year in Poland, training with local army troops and providing a deterrent against Russia. Known as the Iron Brigade, the 3-4 ABCT shipped 2,800 pieces of heavy equipment to Europe. M1A2SEPV2 Abrams fires a live round at Swietozow, Poland.

Most Popular The unit is equipped with 87 of the most recent upgrade of the iconic M1 Abrams main battle tank, the M1A2SEPV2 . Like previous versions of the Abrams, the M1A2SEPV2 has the 120-millimeter tank gun, .50-caliber machine gun, depleted uranium armor, and a 1500-horsepower turbine engine. Externally, the M1A2SEPV2 is identifiable by an M2 .50-caliber remote-controlled machine guns and a phone mounted on the rear of the tank for dismounted infantry to communicate with the crew inside. Some of the tanks also have ballistic glass shields for the tank commander and loader. Internally, the M1A2SEPV2 also has full color LCD displays for the crews, a new upgraded transmission, and a new computer backbone.

The brigade is also equipped with 140 M2A3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, a similarly upgraded version of the original M2 Bradley. The Bradley is armed with a 30-millimeter Bushmaster cannon, two TOW anti-tank missiles in the ready position, and can carry up to seven infantrymen. The 3-4 ABCT's Bradleys have the relatively new Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) that allows the vehicle commander his own thermal viewer separate from the gunner's. A tall, boxy protrusion, the CITV allows the commander to look ahead at threats ahead and maintain situational awareness while the gunner engages targets.

The third major weapons system deployed by the brigade is its 18 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers. Designed to support the tank and mechanized infantry forces with indirect fire, the Paladin is also an upgrade, this time of the older M109 tracked howitzer. The Paladin incorporates new armor to protect the crew and an inertial navigation system that allows the crew to travel to a new firing location and be ready to fire within 30 seconds, much less than older howitzers. The 3-4 ABCT is one of the best trained units in the Army, with some subunits having completed a rotation at the National Training Center at Fort Lewis, California last summer. After the nine-month stint, the 3-4 ABCT will be replaced by another, yet-unannounced U.S. Army brigade. According to Ash Carter, Secretary of Defense under President Obama, the brigade will eventually send company-sized units of approximately 100 men and a dozen or more armored vehicles to Bulgaria, Romania, and the Baltic States until relieved by larger NATO forces.
