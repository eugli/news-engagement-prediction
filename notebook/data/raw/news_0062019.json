Because of a threat of litigation, Penzone said, the county jails immediately would end the practice of detaining suspected immigration-law violators for ICE officials for up to 48 hours after a criminal court judge had ordered their release. \nThe action led U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of DHS, to characterize the move as a \"dangerous change.\" \n\"I am not the only Sheriff and Maricopa is not the only County taking this position. In fact, 43 of the 50 states have counties that cannot enforce courtesy holds due to the illegality of the practice,\" Penzone said in a letter sent Thursday afternoon to DHS Secretary John Kelly. \n\"For far too long, local law enforcement has been forced to take a position without the support, guidance and resources to accomplish our common goal of public safety. This issue is far too important and has gone on far too long without a responsible, ethical and legal solution.\" \nPenzone asked Kelly to help state and local law enforcement by providing \"consistent, legal and constitutional guidelines.\" \nPenzone was not immediately available for comment. Earlier in the week, a Sheriff's Office spokesman said Penzone was attempting to work out with ICE representatives \"a lawful, logistical exchange” once people suspected of being in the country illegally were released from state custody. \nOn Wednesday, the majority of the 33 people released at county jails who previously would have been held under “ICE detainers” until they could be retrieved by federal immigration agents remained free, officials said. 6 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2mdmtgC TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:48:59.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
