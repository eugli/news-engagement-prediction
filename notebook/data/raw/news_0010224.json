I request Islam to leave the House immediately,” Mr. Goswami said. \n“It is a matter of great regret. The Ethics Committee recommended suspension of the member for a specific period during the current session. I have accepted its recommendation,” he added. \nMr. Islam used the social media platform on Friday during the post-lunch session while the House was discussing a private member’s resolution over timely solution to the illegal immigration problem. \nThe AIUDF member later told the media that he had committed a mistake and accepted the verdict. \n“[But] At the same time, I also demand that entire proceedings of the Assembly be telecast live. People are demanding that as we are their representatives, they should see our all activities inside the House,” he said. \nWhile pronouncing the verdict, Mr. Goswami said he had received complaints from several members, including the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, about the incident on February 3 during the ongoing Budget Session. \n“After that, my office submitted a video footage to me. It was a clear case of breach of Modal Code of Conduct. I requested the Ethics Committee to make an inquiry and submit a report to me by February 6,” he added. \nHe informed the House that Mr. Islam had submitted a written apology for his conduct. \n“It is not a minor action. He [Islam] is a senior member and it was not expected of him,” the Speaker said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:28:17.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
