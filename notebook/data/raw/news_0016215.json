I had quite a bit of wound pain and felt washed out, but I don’t regret going.” Read More More than 4,000 patients had their life-saving surgeries cancelled at the last minute due to lack of beds and staff Joe with his mum Sarah, sister Eve and brother Max (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nBorn with polycystic kidney disease, Joe’s kidneys were so enlarged and damaged they had to be removed within weeks of his birth, and he has been on dialysis ever since. Last year, doctors discovered the kidney disease had damaged his liver and he was in danger of bleeding to death. \nNow, 11 days after their surgeries, mum and son are both doing well. Joe is still on intravenous drugs and being fed through a tube, but he has moved from intensive care to a high-dependency ward. When the Sunday People went to visit him today, he was well enough to be wheeled in a chair to the ward’s playroom. \nToday, he also got to see his brother Max, 12, and sister, Eve, 10, who flew from the family’s home in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to see him for the first time since his ­transplant. Sarah, 36, said of his recovery: “He is slowly getting there. \n“He’s still got discomfort from where they operated. But, importantly, there is no sign of rejection of my liver. \n“His recovery will be slow because he has no kidneys and is still on dialysis. This is just the first stage of curing my little boy. He needs a kidney and then he will be like any other four year old.” \nSarah, who has a ten-inch scar after her eight-hour operation, has no doubts about undergoing surgery again to donate her kidney to Joe, hopefully as soon as May. Sarah shows off the scar left by the transplant operation (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nShe said: “I’ve been there and done it once and now I’m ready to do it again. This was the tougher and more dangerous of the two [operations]. \n“So much of my energy has been focused on helping Joe that Max and Eve, are having to grow up fast. I’ve been torn between wanting to do the best for all my kids. As I went down for the anaesthetic, I couldn’t help thinking that I could be saving Joe and possibly leaving them all orphaned if I died donating.” \nExperts have praised Sarah’s bravery and said her selflessness will encourage others to consider becoming live donors. Paulo Muiesan, who removed the section of liver from Sarah said: “She’s a very courageous lady. She has not only Joe to think about but her two older children. \n“We cannot be seen to be putting pressure on people to be live donors, particularly when they are single parents like Sarah, but it was she who came to us saying she wanted to give.” \nKhalid Sharif, Joe’s transplant surgeon said: “What a magnificent lady. She has been so determined to help Joe. He was on our list for a liver and needed one sooner than later, but we can never be sure when we will get a dead donor organ. \n“There are always more children ­needing transplants than organs.

What is particularly unique in this case is that Sarah will be offering both her kidney and part of her liver, as a combined donation. The courage of parents and relatives who give organs to loved ones is a real inspiration to our teams,” Mr Sharif said. \n“We know the conversations around this can be very difficult, but offering that gift of life really improves the chances for children like Joe, who need life-saving operations.” \n“We’re delighted with the progress Joe has made following his transplant. \n“Our specialist teams will continue to monitor him closely over the coming days but early signs are very positive. \n“We’re hopeful he’ll be able to go home to his family in the next week or two. Tansplant surgeon, Dr Khalid Sharif, is 'delighted' with Joe's progress (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nMairead Ritchie, of the Children’s Liver Disease Foundation, said: “Sarah has shown what can be done. Every year we lose children who don’t get a donor. Live donation is so important.” \nLive donation is a complex process involving two teams of surgeons. To ensure the highest chances of success, speed is of the essence, as organs should ­ideally be transplanted within three to four hours of being harvested. \nSarah’s surgery began at 10.30am. First, her abdomen was opened up from below her breastbone down to her tummy button. Then, one third of her liver – the left lateral segment, weighing 310g – was removed. \nThe sliver of liver was perfused with special fluid to prevent blood clots, packed in ice and placed in a cooler. \nAt 6.30pm, it was rushed by courier with a police escort – narrowly ­avoiding getting stuck in a traffic jam caused by a car crash in the city – from Queen Elizabeth Hospital to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where Joe’s ­surgeons were waiting. \nThe organ was being placed inside Joe just under an hour later. At that stage, Mr Sharif had already spent two hours prepping Joe in theatre.

Mr Sharif said: “I was separating the liver from surrounding tissue, which took longer than usual because Joe had internal scarring caused when he had his kidney removed as a baby. \n“Once Sarah’s liver was with us, I was able to start taking out Joe’s liver and begin ‘plumbing’ in his mum’s.” \nSarah said of her operation: “Mine was less straightforward than they thought. \n\"They found my arteries running from the liver were not normal and they had to do a lot of work to prevent me suffering serious blood loss as they removed the liver.” \nBut she has no regrets about volunteering for the surgery. \nShe said: “Joe was on the transplant list for a liver but there is never any guarantee that one will come from a dead donor. \n“Joe was a ticking time bomb. I decided something had to be done. I didn’t know about live liver donation. \n\"I looked it up and then asked Joe’s doctors. People ask why I didn’t donate earlier. Joe’s liver has been bad for over a year. Happy mother and son (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \n“I think the doctors were anxious about broaching live donation to a single mum, so it was left to me to ask them. \n\"These things generally don’t happen instantly. There were a lot of discussions to make sure that I was aware of the risks and to make sure that I had no doubts. \n“And then there are all the tests to make sure you are match. Amazingly, although I’m related – and you can be a non-related donor – I only just scraped home on tissue-matching. \n“If I’d failed one of the tests, the transplant wouldn’t have happened.” \nDespite the pain after the liver transplant, Sarah is still determined to go through with the ­kidney donation. \nShe said: “I’ve done it once and I’m prepared to do it again. \n“There’s a risk each time but giving a liver is much more complicated and more dangerous [than donating a kidney]. \n“There are loads of kids waiting for kidney transplants. So that’s why I’m going to be a ­double live donor. \n“Dialysis keeps you alive but it can shorten your life and it is no life having to be on dialysis three times a week – particularly for a child. Sarah says she wants a normal life for Joe (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \n“Joe hasn’t had a life yet as a normal child. And this year I want that to change. And I also want it to change for all the other children needing transplants,” Sarah said. \n“And if something had happened to me, my kids would have been well looked after. \n“I’ve got some fabulous friends who have helped me and a great mum, Betty, who Joe and me saw for the first time since the op when they flew in this weekend.” \n“And the people of Ballymena have been magnificent in their support. \n“We need more people to sign up for the donor register and some parents need to think about being donors for their kids. \n\"Not everyone can, but looking at my Joe recovering today, I just know it is the best thing I ever did.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:22:17.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
