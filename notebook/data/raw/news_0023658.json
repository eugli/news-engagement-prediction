(Randall Benton / Sacramento Bee) --> \nHouse members are getting their fair share of calls as well. \nRep. Karen Bass, a former community organizer, said so many constituents have reached out to her by phone, mail and in person that she has scheduled two extra town halls next weekend. Her staff said the office received 1,140 constituent calls in January, far above the 252 they received in the two weeks the office was open in December. \nBass is encouraging her constituents to contact Democrats and Republicans, saying all members of Congress need to hear their concerns. \n“I feel like I have to bring people together,” she said. “People are so frightened by this man that they look to me, literally, to reassure them. I trying to figure out how to be constructive in this process, and it’s tough to reassure people when I’m not necessarily feeling reassured.” \nRep. Julia Brownley (D-Westlake Village) said that at the moment she’s hearing from constituents about Trump’s proposed ban on entry to the U.S. by migrants and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \n“Generally it’s people calling to say, ‘We’ve got your back,’” Brownley said. “People are really activated in the district, people are yearning to gather together. I think people are just very anxious to have their voices heard and are trying to figure out the most effective things that they can be doing.” \nMultiple staff members were answering calls in Brownley’s office Tuesday afternoon. \n“I really appreciate you took the time to call,” an intern said after listening to a caller. “Your voice still very much matters and very much contributes.” \nRepublican Rep. Duncan Hunter’s Washington office has had a slight uptick in calls from outside his suburban San Diego district, his chief of staff Joe Kasper said, “but contact from within our district? Nothing has changed.” \nMany Democrats calling are asking Hunter to hold a town hall meeting, a request that’s popping up in a lot of offices. Hunter normally holds at least two in-person town hall meetings a year, as well as three telephone town halls. Kasper said the congressman feels no rush to hold a meeting, especially if he feels it won’t be constructive. Some of the progressive groups have been mimicking the town hall tactics used by the tea party to oppose the Affordable Care Act in 2009. \n“They’re doing it with the specific purpose of trying to create a public event which they can attend and agitate,” Kasper said. “We’re not going to adjust the way we do things just because there is a group out there looking to make a scene.” \nRep. Steve Knight (R-Palmdale) has personally been taking some of the calls to his office, and he said that as he gives callers more information,specifically about which parts of the Affordable Care Act Republicans want to keep, they seem to calm down. Many calls are indeed about the healthcare law, he said, and there was a bump in calls when Trump’s entry ban was instituted. On Tuesday, his staffers were urging people to email and then follow up with a phone call. \n“We want to hear from people. If no one says anything, do we know we’re doing good by them, bad by them, whatever? We like to hear,” Knight said. “A lot of people don’t call but think that we’re doing a good job. You’ve got to be committed to what you’re doing and that what you’re doing is right, but also you’ve got to have a pulse on the district.” Caption President Trump lashes out over Australia refugee deal \nTrump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. \nTrump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center.
