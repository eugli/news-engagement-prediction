It did not disclose financial terms of the deal. \nThe entry late last year of Reliance Industries' wireless carrier Jio into India's crowded telecoms sector with its free voice and deeply discounted data plans has pushed rivals to slash costs, sharply eroding their profits. \nBharti Airtel reported its lowest profit in four years in the October-December quarter while No. 3 player Idea Cellular posted its first-ever quarterly loss for the same period.

After thorough consideration, it is our view that the significant investments needed to secure Telenor India's future business on a standalone basis will not give an acceptable level of return,\" Sigve Brekke, CEO of Telenor Group, said in a statement. \nShares of Bharti Airtel, in which Singapore Telecommunications is the second-biggest shareholder, jumped 5.5 percent in early Mumbai trade after the deal was announced.
