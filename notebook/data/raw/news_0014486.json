He still has a tumor, but doctors say it is much smaller than it once was. They are hopeful he can live with it, if it doesn’t grow again.\nChildrens Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC/Facebook Jimmy’s mom, Lacie Spagnolo ― who is documenting her son’s treatment via the “I’m Praying For Jimmy Spagnolo” page on Facebook ― told The Huffington Post that people from across the hospital left meetings early to witness Jimmy ringing the bell.\n“It was moving to have all those people watch at the hospital with us and how they wanted to share in Jimmy’s joy with us,” she said, adding that now the video had gone viral “the world gets to do that, and as the world gets to know Jimmy I know it will become a better place just because of him.”\n“Our moment is everyone’s moment,” Spagnolo added. “And it’s already connecting everyone on an incredible level. Jimmy is like that all the time, he celebrates life like that every day.”\nRelated Coverage Watch Baby's Ridiculously Cute Reaction To Seeing Mom Clearly For First Time Little Boy Freaks Out After Hearing GPS Say 'Bear Right' WATCH: This Dog Is So Happy To Be Reunited With His Favorite Toy After 5 Long Years Mom Gives School Hilariously Honest Excuse For Daughter's Tardiness Also on HuffPost More: Power Of Humanity Diseases And Conditions Children's Hospital Of Pittsburgh Of UPMC On a budget?
