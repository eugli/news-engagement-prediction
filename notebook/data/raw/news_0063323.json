Scott Taylor walked into a town hall teeming with constituents ready to confront him Wednesday for supporting Obamacare repeal and President Donald Trump’s agenda. When he walked out, he received lengthy applause and hung around to mingle with his critics, some of whom expressed grudging respect for the man they had planned to protest. \nFor most of event, the room was quiet enough to hear a pin drop. Story Continued Below \nThe freshman Republican and former Navy Seal used a calm demeanor and produced a case study on how to defuse tensions at a town hall — a method he hopes his GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill can apply during their own events, which have at times been overrun by protests and frustrated constituents. \n“Listen, calm’s contagious, especially in events. So is crazy emotions,” he told POLITICO after the town hall, his third in three days across his northeastern Virginia district. “I think it’s important to be calm. My demeanor should always be calm.” \nNot all of Taylor’s experience, of course, is replicable. “I’ve dealt with a lot of crowds before … I mean, literally with AK 47s with people pissed off in the Arabian desert,” he said, alluding to his service in Iraq and Yemen. “You understand very quickly how to read body language.” \nBut he said there are “mechanisms” to reduce the likelihood of disruption and confrontation. For example, Taylor said he’d counsel his colleague to wait silently whenever their room breaks out into sustained applause or jeers — rather than attempt to talk over protests. But if a “rabble rouser” seems intent on disrupting, he’s got another strategy: “you isolate them” until they’re shamed into silence. \nTaylor also noted that he detailed his own difficult childhood — raised by a single mother and already on a dangerous path in life at 11 years old. It was partly to introduce himself to constituents who may not know him, he said, but also to emphasize that not all members of Congress are from “elite” backgrounds living charmed lives. It was a story, he said, that helped put the crowd at ease \nAt times, the crowd did seem to test Taylor’s patience, if fleetingly. In response to a question about how he could justify taking taxpayer-funded health care coverage while voting to repeal Obamacare, Taylor noted that he declined to accept coverage afforded to members of Congress. But when he added that he gets his coverage through the Veterans Administration, the crowd groaned. \n“You guys have a problem with me being treated by the VA because I was injured in Iraq for you?” an incredulous Taylor shot back. \nBut there were few other moments of obvious tension. And Taylor, self-deprecating at times and at others highlighting his differences with GOP orthodoxy and President Donald Trump, kept the crowd off balance, unable to generate sustained opposition. He also noted, part way through, that his four-year-old son was on hand for the meeting. \nTaylor also had a home field advantage Thursday — he grew up just 70 miles away on a farm in tiny Hebron, Md. and he quickly tapped into the Eastern Shore’s low-key vibe to defuse any tension at the outset of his visit. \n“I know your mamas didn’t teach you to shout if you’re from the Eastern Shore,” he admonished the crowd. “If you’re shouting, you’re probably not from here.” \nIn the end, constituents walked away satisfied that they’d been heard, even if they strongly disagreed with his positions. \n“His demeanor is very good,” said John Harlow, an Air Force veteran and longtime Eastern Shore resident who said Taylor acquitted himself well at the 80-minute event. \n“And,” added Harlow’s wife Mary, with a laugh, “he’s not bad to look at.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:11:31.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
