'They very much appreciate all the kind wishes and messages of support they have received already.' Friends and fans were quick to congratulate the young couple, with fellow cyclist Dani King calling it the 'best news ever.' While the green child's balance bike in the picture may be for beginners, it's unlikely the child of championship cyclists will need stabilisers for very long. In fact, Mrs Kenny has already hinted that their child could follow in their Olympic footsteps. The cyclists (pictured today) married in an intimate, secret ceremony in September, just weeks after they rode to Olympic glory During the Olympic Games on August 16, the seven-time world champion wrote on Twitter: 'I love him to bits @JasonKenny107! Our kids have to get some of these genes right?' The talented couple met in 2011, but Mrs Kenny – then Miss Trott – admitted she found her future husband 'unsociable.' She said: 'Only when the World Championships came around in Melbourne in spring 2012 did we find ourselves staying in the same hotel again and racing on the same track. 'I broke his headphones. Jason didn't even mention it. And then a little thought popped up in my head: he doesn't take himself or his headphones too seriously. I like that.' Their romance became the hottest news of last year's games when they kissed on camera following Mr Kenny's win in the keirin men's cycling final. Following his victory, he admitted: 'The best thing about is that we get to come away together and race together. 'Not many couples in the Olympic village can enjoy their success together. So that's really special and I feel really lucky about that.' Mr Kenny, 28, has a total of six Olympic gold medals. His wife won two golds in 2016 and two in 2012, making her Britain's most successful female Olympian. The couple are expected to be competing in the 2020's Olympic Games in Tokyo, with Mrs Kenny hoping to target an unprecedented third double gold medal haul.
