I thought my wife and kids would be better off without me. \n\"I wound’t say I was suicidal but I did not want to be here anymore. \n\"Being on benefits can be very depressing if you do not want to be on them.

I was embarrassed to be on benefits.\" \nScott worked as an electrician but had \"always wanted to work with animals\". \nAfter going on benefits to become a full time carer for his son, he also studied at Liverpool John Moores University to try and fulfill his dream of working with animals. \nBut the pressure of being on benefits proved to much and he suffered his breakdown and was forced to leave university. \nJust seven months later he joined the TV programme and his life was dramatically transformed. \nAnd he says there are tens of thousands of other people just like him who are struggling and just need some help. \nHe says the government should do more to help people who have ideas for a business or job opportunity but can't take the risk of coming off benefits. Scott says other people trapped on benefits should be given more help to fulfill their ambitions \n\"I think there are a lot of people in the same situation as me who have brilliant ideas or could be amazing in certain jobs and would love to be given the opportunity,\" he said. \n\"I am not a one-off. There are people out there with better ideas than me but they are stuck there with nothing to do because they are on benefits and cannot afford to come off and take a risk. \n\"A lot of people think those on benefits are freeloaders and skivers but that's not always the case. \n\"For many people benefits provide a safety net.\" \nCritics were quick to judge when the show's trailer aired, accusing Scott and his wife Leanne of wasting the money. \nSpeaking previously, Scott's wife Leanne, 26, told of the difference the money had made.

(Because) now we're standing on our own two feet rather than relying on state benefits.\" \nWith the help of the show's financial adviser Lee Healey, Party Central Entertainments Ltd went from strength to strength in just months. \nScott, 31, said: \"We've learnt all about how to budget and how to do our finances. And now we've got our own business and it's getting better and better. We do christenings, car shows, birthday parties. Scott and Leanne \n\"We took three deposits yesterday. We've got bookings right up to October. I prefer working for myself rather than being on benefits. Life used to just go by day by day. It was time to start doing stuff for ourselves.\" \nScott and Leanne said they're \"not interested\" in the negative reaction the show generated. \n\"I'm just concentrating on looking after my wife and kid,\" Scott said.

It was a life-changing moment - who wouldn't celebrate?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:00:11.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
