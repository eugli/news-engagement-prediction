CQ: \n\nSilverware snatched. \nNew Zealand grabbed back the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series by winning the \"decider\" against Australia in Hamilton on Sunday. GETTY IMAGES \nTrent Boult captured six wickets to spearhead New Zealand to victory in Hamilton. \nIn front of a packed crowd of 9539 fans at Seddon Park, the hosts triumphed by 24 runs to win the three-match one-day international cricket series 2-0, with the middle encounter in Napier mid-week abandoned. \nChasing 282 to win and level the series at 1-1 - and keep the trophy - Australia were dismissed for 257 in the 47th over as the world's top-ranked ODI bowler Trent Boult starred with 6-33 of his 10 overs. \nâ€‹Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner also played a critical role on his 25th birthday. Santner, charged with the major spin duties after New Zealand surprisingly omitted leg-spinner Ish Sodhi from their playing XI, took 2-50 - despite giving up 31 runs in his final two overs as Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins swung for the fences. PHOTOSPORT \nNZ's Mitchell Santner celebrates the wicket of Glenn Maxwell with Tom Latham. \nREAD MORE: \nThe victory extended New Zealand's home winning streak to 12 matches this season - as well as the two ODI victories against Australia, they've scored four consecutive test wins over Pakistan and Bangladesh and swept the latter in limited-overs contests. GETTY IMAGES \nAustralia's Aaron Finch gets airborne during game three of the ODI series against New Zealand at Seddon Park. \nWickets fell in pairs throughout the Australian reply as the almost-hero of Eden Park for the tourists, Marcus Stoinis, again had home fans worried. He got to 42 off 48 balls and appeared poised to possibly go one better than his Auckland effort before falling to the wiles of Santner. Ad Feedback \nEven hometown hero Ross Taylor acknowledged his side's tally may have been 20 short of what it should have been at 281-9, but thanks chiefly to the veteran right-hander and Boult's bowling, it proved enough. \nAustralia romped to 39-0 off seven overs in their chase before impressive fielding from Santner found Shaun Marsh short on a second run and Peter Handscomb chopped on from Boult two balls later. GETTY IMAGES \nRoss Taylor was all aggression during his knock. \nFinch (56 off 64 balls) and Travis Head (53 off 72) both got going then got out for the visitors. \nFinch appeared to deliberately target his opposite when Williamson brought himself on to bowl in the 17th over. He offered a powerfully-struck caught and bowled chance off the first ball, and then swung lustily for a four and a six off the next two deliveries. \nBut Williamson did get his man when Finch committed batting hari kari when holing out to Trent Boult on the cow corner boundary to the off-spinner. GETTY IMAGES \nMarcus Stoinis of Australia pulls one into the leg side. \nNew Zealand's score was built around 107 at better than a run-a-ball from Taylor, while Dean Brownlie - getting his chance in place of the injured Martin Guptill - made a composed 63 off 78 balls to hint that his international career may have been kick-started. \nTaylor's century was his 16th in one-day internationals, drawing him level as New Zealand's most prolific ODI century-maker with Nathan Astle. \nThe Hamilton resident looked in fine touch from the outset as he added 100 for the third wicket with Brownlie while dominating the partnership. Brownlie was on 36 when Taylor walked to the wicket but Taylor got to his half-century when his partner was on 47. GETTY IMAGES \nDean Brownlie made a half-century on his return to the New Zealand one-day side. \nThe right-hander had a life on 38 in the 25th over when he top-edged a cut off James Faulkner and part-time wicket-keeper Handscomb dived full-length to his right but could only get the end of his glove to the ball as it passed for boundary. \nHe came almost becalmed as his middle-order partners were all at sea against the Australian quicks in a 13-over spell from the 32nd over onwards. Neil Broom, Colin Munro and James Neesham all fell cheaply after being tied up and worked over as the hosts looked set to fall short of a challenging target. \nBut Taylor hung around until the end of the 47th over, striking 13 boundaries in his 101-ball knock. Santner celebrated his birthday with a much-needed 38 not out off 34 balls as New Zealand added 30 from the last two overs, despite losing Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson to consecutive yorkers from Starc. \nSCOREBOARD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:58:19.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
