Let us not underestimate those people who waste their money on bingo, lotto, and manicure like nail art,” she said. \nHer remarks prompted various comments of disapproval from those present including Caritas director Leonid McKay. \n“It is very unjust to say that some deserve to be poor more than others,” Mr McKay said. “Such argument is very dangerous for policy makers. The idea that poverty is self-inflicted stems from a very conservative approach,” he added. \n“I subscribe to the view that poverty is the result of policies, an unjust economic system and unfair political decisions,” he argued. \nOrganised by the Department of Sociology in collaboration with the Alliance Against Poverty and the Anti-Poverty Forum, the event included a brief presentation from Mr McKay. \nMr McKay outlined the criteria used by his NGO to define poverty in relation to a landmark study Caritas issued last year. The report had started the ball rolling on a proposal to increase the minimum wage, which the government has taken on board. \nThe Caritas director noted that poverty was directly linked to the individual’s financial means to afford basic necessities such as healthy food, clothing, healthcare, education, transport and household goods. He acknowledged that other criteria such as how many times a family should go out to eat, were highly subjective. \nMr Mckay also dwelled on the geographical aspect of poverty in Malta and said that more research was needed to investigate whether the perception of a north-south divide still made sense. More often than not, he said, there was a correlation between those who were materially deprived and areas of affordable housing. \nThe debate also touched on the issue of pensions’ sustainability. Quoting from a European Commission report on Malta’s economy published two days ago, Moses Azzopardi from the Alliance of Pensioners warned that the rate of those aged 65 and over who were at risk of poverty had increased to 21 per cent. « Most   Advert \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:03:59.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
