On Wednesday evening, after news broke that Trump rescinded the Title IX guidance the Obama administration issued protecting transgender students, Evancho tweeted at the president, asking he spend some time with her and her sister, Juliet Evancho, who is trans. \"You gave me the honor to sing at your inauguration,\" she wrote. \"Please give me and my sister the honor to meet with you to talk transgender rights,\" the 16-year-old wrote on Twitter. \n@realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me &amp; my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ? Earlier in the day, she tweeted that she was \"obviously disappointed\" in Trump's decision to remove the federal protection. \nI am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove Jackie Evancho defended her decision to perform at the inauguration to the New York Times while also defending her sister, who is currently in a lawsuit with her school district to use the restroom that matches her gender identity. Evancho said the lawsuit is about \"just accepting people for who they are\" and is not political. Jackie Evancho (left), Juliet Evancho (right) Source: Evan Agostini/AP Juliet Evancho also supported her sister Jackie's decision in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning . \"The way I look at it Jackie is singing for our country, and it's an honor for her to be singing in front of so many people,\" Juliet Evancho said. \"So I feel that's really where I look at it. And that's where I'm going to leave it right now.\" Like us on Facebook: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:14:49.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
