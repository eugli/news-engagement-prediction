Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA key French Presidential candidate has announced he wants to lure away Britain's bankers and professors after Brexit . \nBrass-necked Emmanuel Macron made his bold pledge yards from the door of 10 Downing Street, straight after meeting Theresa May today. \nThe independent candidate, who has come from behind to jostle for the lead ahead of April's election, requested the meeting with the Prime Minister himself according to Downing Street. \nTonight he is due to address 3,000 of the 200,000 French voters living in London in a campaign rally. \nHe told the Press Association as he left Downing Street: \"In my programmes I will have a series of initiatives to get talented people in research and lots of fields working here to come to France. Read More \n\"I was very happy to see that some academics and researchers in the UK because of Brexit are considering coming to France to work. \"I want banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on,\" he said (Photo: REUTERS) Downing Street said Mr Macron requested the meeting with Theresa May (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"It will be part of my programme to be attractive for these kinds of people.\" \nAsked \"do you want banks to move from London to Paris after Brexit ?\", he said: \"I want banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on. \n\"I think that France and the European Union are a very attractive space now so in my programme I will do everything I can to make it attractive and successful.\" \nDowning Street refused to give any details of Mr Macron's conversation with Theresa May, saying it was private. \nAnd hitting back at his boasts on the steps of No10, a spokesman said: \"London is global financial centre and is going to remain so after Brexit .\" \nAsked if Britain would like to seize business off France, the spokesman said: \"Obviously the British economy is open for investment. Britain is open for business.\" \nA new poll today put support for Mr Macron down five points on 17-18.5%, behind Republican Francois Fillon on 20-21% and far-right Marine Le Pen on 27-28%. \nBut the poll also suggested Mr Macron would beat Ms Le Pen by 59% to 41% if they were to face off in the second round, Reuters reported. \nToday Mr Macron said he assured Mrs May of his willingness to seek a \"fair execution of Brexit \" which protects and defends French and European interests.

Because we have 200,000 people. I want to win this election in France, so I want to speak to the 200,000 voters we have here in London. \n\"I want to convince them that France is changing, I want to promote my country and make it succeed in the 21st century and (tell them) that now, in the coming years, they will have a lot of opportunities to come back to France and succeed in France.\" \nFrench citizens overseas are entitled to vote in this spring's election to find a replacement for Francois Hollande at the Elysee Palace. \nA Downing Street spokesman said no other candidates had yet requested a meeting with Mrs May, but added there was a long-standing Government policy not to engage with the National Front party, whose leader Ms Le Pen is widely expected to reach the second-round run-off with Mr Macron. \nFormer PM Tony Blair met the centre-right's Nicolas Sarkozy at Number 10 when he was running for president in 2007.
