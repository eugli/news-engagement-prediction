I don't know if they signed up for this service.\" \nThe coalition has often seen VBIEDs depart on missions, only for their drivers to veer off course and attempt to hide behind structures. \n\"We see a VBIED going to its attack, going off and hiding,\" Isler said. \"We see a party going to find the AWOL VBIED driver, we see (IS) command and control trying to figure out where their VBIED driver's gone, we've seen multiple VBIED drivers going AWOL.\" \nThe coalition first saw drivers being chained into trucks when Iraqi security forces approached the Tigris river as they cleared eastern Mosul, Isler said.

After clearing the east side, Iraqi forces on Sunday launched an operation aimed at flushing the militants from Mosul's west bank. \nOn Thursday, they thrust into Mosul airport on the southern edge of the IS stronghold for the first time since the militants overran the region in 2014. \nIraqi troops backed by jets, helicopter gunships and drones blitzed their way across open areas south of Mosul before entering the airport compound. Although they apparently met limited resistance, they strafed the area for suspected snipers. \nAs its fighters are killed off and it loses ground, the IS group has developed new ways to counter-strike, including by steering hobby drones fitted with grenades and bombs at troops and civilians. \nThe buzz of the small, pilot-less aircraft now puts soldiers on guard, but their impact has been limited. \"It has a harassing effect, but it's not a game changer,\" New Zealand Brigadier Hugh McAslan said. \nThe coalition officers said the most the IS group can hope to do now is fight \"delaying actions\" ahead of losing Mosul. \"Defeat's inevitable,\" McAslan said. \"It's just when.\" - AFP/ec", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:35:41.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
