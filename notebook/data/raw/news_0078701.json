The mother of two says she doesn`t have the money to move elsewhere without her deposit. \nSafety and security are number one for Tonya Bell, just like they are for every mom. That`s why she says her current housing condition is unacceptable. \n\"It is scary! We can`t sleep. Every time I hear a noise in the wall, because I know they`re there. They`re in the walls. It is just creepy, \"said Bell. \nShe took FOX 4 into her daughter's bedroom for a closer look at what`s kept her up at night. There was a snake on a sticky mouse trap. \n\"I`m like wow! You know that could have gotten around my daughter`s neck. Anything. It could be poisonous,\" said Bell. \nNAVY VET SAYS HE'S FORCED TO LIVE IN A STORATE UNIT \nWithin five days, Bell said she had found eight snakes. \n\"My kids don`t want to come home. They want to stand outside. They want to sleep in the truck,\" said Bell. \nThe pest problem started with mice. \n\"The mice were really bad, jumping in and out of the trash cans. Eating on my bread. Everything,\" said Bell. \nShe signed a two-year lease last June, but after several attempts to get rid of the snakes, the owner of the home, and Kansas City Housing Authority, agreed to let Bell out of her lease. However, her relief turned to frustration when she learned she wouldn`t be getting the $500 of the $600 that she paid for her deposit. \n“Why? What did I do as a tenant?” said Bell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:11:52.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
