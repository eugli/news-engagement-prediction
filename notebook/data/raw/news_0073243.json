Remove pet hair: Make a DIY lint (and pet hair) remover by wrapping duct tape—sticky side up—around a paint roller. Then go to town on your sofas and corduroy pants. Weatherproof windows and doors: Tape along the gaps of windows and doors to prevent cold air from infiltrating during the winter. You’ll be warmer and cut down on energy bills to boot! However, do not try to protect your windows from a hurricane by putting duct tape in the shape of an X on them. The National Hurricane Center debunked this popular emergency prep myth; it’s a waste of time and can actually create larger, deadlier shards of glass. Wrap handles: Duct tape wound around hammer handles and other tools will give you a better grip. Temporarily replace a roof shingle: If you have a leak and no extra shingles, cut a shingle-sized piece of plywood and wrap it with duct tape. Push it into place for a temporary fix. Grab ceiling cobwebs: Wrap a broom handle with duct tape, sticky side up, and swipe high cobwebs, which will stick to the tape. Keep remotes from disappearing: Duct tape remote controls to large kids’ building blocks, which prevents the clickers from disappearing into the couch. And if your kids love to rip off the battery covers, tape them shut. Prevent furniture scuff marks: Place a tiny square of duct tape on the bottom of chair legs to prevent scratching and scuffing floors. Waterproof shoes: Cover the tops and sides of running shoes to protect them from puddles. Fly catchers: Hang strips of duct tape from your patio ceiling to catch flying pests , which will land on and stick to the tape. Secure cords: Duct tape cords in your home office to the floor to prevent tripping hazards. Locate garden tools: Wrap brightly colored duct tape around garden tool handles, which will make them easier to find when hidden in your garden. Fix a leak: Repair garden hose leaks by wrapping the break with duct tape. Extend the tape 2 or 3 inches before and after the break. It won’t last forever, but it’ll last long enough to water the garden. Patch siding: If a tree limb has ripped your home’s siding, cover it with duct tape, which will last until you can get it properly fixed. Repair ripped screens: In a pinch, you can duct tape together ripped screens to keep mosquitoes out of your porch or house.
