The evidence is expected to be discussed at an oversight hearing the committee is holding Tuesday.\nThe evidence comes from Dr. John Bates, the agency's former climate change data czar, who suggested that the study was published \"to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus,\" and rushed to publication in order \"to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy,\" according to science committee.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Bates said in a blog post Saturday, and subsequent newspaper interviews published Sunday, that he was never consulted on the paper's findings, even though he was in charge of ensuring the integrity of NOAA's climate data.\nBates wrote in his blog that it is the \"most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset ... purporting to show no 'hiatus' in global warming in the 2000s.\"\nHe added that the findings drew intense \"criticism from other climate scientists, who disagreed with [its] conclusion about the 'hiatus,'\" while spurring a GOP-back investigation into \"the timing of the report, which was issued just prior to the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan submission to the Paris Climate Conference in 2015.\"\nThe Science, Space and Technology Committee had scheduled a hearing Tuesday on the Environmental Protection Agency, called \"Making the EPA Great Again.\" But aides said Monday to expect the hearing to also cover the new findings on the NOAA study.\nThe committee said it's hopeful that Bates' \"disclosures\" will \"stiffen President Trump 's determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor's 'green' policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal – so triggering an intense political row.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Melania Trump: Libel kept me from cashing in as first lady \nFirst lady Melania Trump was interested in cashing in on her role as first lady, and a lawsuit argues that a story alleging the former model had been an escort in the 1990s wrecked the value of her brand.\nTrump's third defamation lawsuit against Mail Online, the website of the Daily Mail, alleges the \"plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person … to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.\nBy Caitlin Yilek • 02/06/17 9:32 PM Committee chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, had been chasing the cover up in an investigation he launched in 2016, subpoenaing the atmospheric agency for records that he was confident would show conclusive evidence that the Obama administration had taken intentional steps to undermine the U.N.'s findings.\nTop Story WATCH LIVE: Democrats on Senate floor all night against DeVos \nBy Washington Examiner Staff • 02/06/17 8:40 PM Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:00:22.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
