The pregnant diva took to the stage of the prestigious music awards and slayed it with her panache! Already the fact that she were to perform post the good news (of her pregnancy) was setting new kinds of hopes and expectations but clearly, the diva has lived up to it and this video we have here us proof! Bey started her performance with a monologue on motherhood and shifted focus to some crazy awesome tracks of her own! She chose to sing on Sandcastles and Love Drought. With her bump on display, she actually dressed up as a Queen, ready to own the throne. Wearing a sheer golden gown, she serenaded the stage of Grammys as she mesmerised everyone with her gorgeous voice. The Single Ladies hitmaker was literally dripping gold as she traipsed on the stage, with her bump in display. \nThe performance is salute-worthy. We kid you not as we say how fabulously she spoke about motherhood, dipped herself in a colour that perfectly personifies what she is to the music industry and blew minds with her voice. Sexy is an understatement to Beyonce on the stage of Grammys 2017! She was the beacon of sexy, shining on everyone. You can check out the video of her performance below.

While Bey was busy leaving the audience spellbound, her baby girl Blue Ivy Carter and husband Jay Z, both were having the time of their lives! We found a video on social media where an ecstatic Jay Z and Blue Ivy were all smiles as Beyonce couldn’t help blushing. That did happen. You can check it out below. \nBlue Ivy Carter’s reaction to her mom’s performance is the CUTEST. #Grammys pic.twitter.com/VXiqszl4vl \n— ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) February 13, 2017 \nClearly, thanks to Bey, the night of Grammys 2017 will surely be remembered.
