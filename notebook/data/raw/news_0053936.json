Teenager died after branch snapped and he hit head on submerged rock \nThe Met Office initially warned the worst of the weather would hit England, with yellow ‘be aware’ warnings for Scotland, but they have now been upgraded to the amber ‘be prepared’ across the central belt, the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Tayside and Fife. \nChief Meteorologist Eddy Carroll said: ‘Storm Doris will bring damaging winds with some significant disruption likely to central parts of the UK on Thursday, whilst southern Scotland will see some heavy snowfall. \n‘People in the warning areas should be prepared for disruptive stormy weather, wind speeds in some locations could reach up to 80 mph so make sure you keep up to date with your local forecast and any weather warnings for your area.’ \nUp to 15cm of snow is expected to fall ‘quite widely’, with accumulations of 30cm potentially falling on hills above 300 metres. \nWinds of up to 80mph are expected to hit northern Scotland on Wednesday before Doris arrives from the Atlantic on Thursday, the Met Office said. \nOn Thursday, the strongest winds are forecast across England but there could be gusts of 50mph to 60mph across southern and eastern Scotland. \nThe Met Office said: ‘As storm Doris moves eastwards across central parts of the UK on Thursday, a spell of heavy snow is expected on its northern flank. \n‘There is some uncertainty over the track of Doris and, therefore, over the extent of snowfall, but confidence is now higher for disruptive snow to affect the amber area. \n‘Heavy snow is expected on Thursday. Accumulations of 10 to 15cm are likely quite widely, with 20 to 30cm falling on hills above 300 metres. \n‘This will lead to disruption to transport and perhaps power supplies.’ \nStein Connelly, of Traffic Scotland, said: ‘With the unsettled conditions expected over the next few days, we are advising road users to check all of the available information on the Traffic Scotland website before they set off on their journey. \n‘On Thursday the worst of any snow will be on the higher routes, especially in the central and south of Scotland, and we would ask road users to keep this in mind when they are planning their journeys and that they drive according to the conditions. \n‘We have more gritters than ever before to spread salt as conditions dictate and salt stocks remain healthy. \n‘The Traffic Scotland twitter feed and website has the reliable traffic and travel information that drivers need to make informed decisions.’ \nStorm Doris is the first major winter weather front for two months. \nThe north of the country was worst-affected, with homes losing power when Storm Conor hit on Boxing Day with winds of more than 90mph.
