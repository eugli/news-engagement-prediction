Gov. Dan Patrick posted the announcement on his website, saying “The Texas Rangers are on the trail.”\n“In Texas we place a very high value on hospitality and football. Tom Brady’s jersey has great historical value and is already being called ‘the most valuable NFL collectable ever.’ It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day,” Patrick said in a statement. “It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas. I’ve called Colonel Steve McCraw to ask that the Texas Rangers work with the Houston Police Department on this case.”\n”I’m a Texans and Cowboys fan first, but the unquestionable success of the Super Bowl in Houston last night was a big win for our entire state and I don’t want anything to mar that victory. Whoever took this jersey should turn it in. The Texas Rangers are on the trail,” he added.\nBrady’s jersey went missing Sunday night shortly after the Patriots defeated the Falcons in Super Bowl LI and Brady became the first quarterback in history with five Super Bowl wins. He told authorities he set the jersey in one of his bags, only to return and find it missing several minutes later.\nThe world-famous Texas Rangers are one of the country’s oldest and most respected law enforcement agencies, responsible for capturing many infamous outlaws ranging from train robbers to bootleggers in the 1800s. Today, the Texas Rangers has a division within the Texas Department of Public Safety, and participate in major crime investigation, public corruption, and even border security matters.\nAfter #TexasRangers began trending on Twitter, the Texas Rangers major league baseball team also decided to join the conversation.\n \n**hear we’re tasked with finding a jersey**\n**name Beltre lead detective**\n**thief turns self in** pic.twitter.com/l2WrUmE84t \n— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) February 6, 2017 \n\n \nFor those asking for a search update, we have BREAKING NEWS…\nSheriff @ColeHamels has joined the case & expects to swiftly bring justice. pic.twitter.com/mNHWcMw0CH \n— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) February 7, 2017 \n\nThe jersey could reportedly be worth more than $400,000, according to the editor of Sports Collectors Daily Rich Mueller. \n“I wouldn’t be surprised to see such a jersey hit $400,000 or more,” he said. “It would just depend on who is bidding. It would obviously be one of the most important Super Bowl jerseys ever sold and they rarely come on the market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T22:06:48.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
