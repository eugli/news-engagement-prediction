The hotel stipulates that guests will only be able to book the discounted rooms on Feb. 25 and 26, which happen to be the first few days of the Cubs’ spring training in Mesa, Ariz. \nFOR MORE TRAVEL STORIES, FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK \nFor comparison, the hotel’s website lists its current room rates on April 10 between $179 and $219 a night. \nThe Chicago Tribune also notes that the hotel’s special rates won’t be available online, either, but only by phone. And there's a limited availability — only 20 rooms on both nights— so it’s pretty likely that more than a few fans will get shut out. \nThe AC Hotel Chicago Downtown opened May 2015 as part of Marriott's \"new breed of lifestyle hotels targeting millennial and business travelers.\" There are currently 80 AC branded hotels worldwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:45:42.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
