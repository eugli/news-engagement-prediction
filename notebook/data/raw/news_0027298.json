The firearm used has been taken for ballistic examinations‚” Mojapelo said. \nThe man was initially charged with culpable homicide. However‚ on Monday morning Mojapelo said the charge had been changed. \n“The case involving the killing of a 23-year-old worker has been changed from culpable homicide to murder. The provincial detectives have since taken over the case‚” he said. \nMojapelo said the worker‚ who was employed on the neighbouring farm‚ could not be named until his next of kin have been informed. \nThe suspect is expected to appear before the Modimolle magistrate’s court on Monday. \n- TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
