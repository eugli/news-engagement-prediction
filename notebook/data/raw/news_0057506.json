The gossip news site added that the man was pronounced dead after he was discovered by hospital employees. \nBIGGEST CELEBRITY SCANDALS OF 2016, REVEALED \nChase was arrested on Wednesday for an outstanding, unrelated warrant after police received a tip she may have been with the man before his death. Chase is reportedly not a suspect in the death and authorities believe the man overdosed and she was merely trying to get him to the hospital. \nWhile her relationship to the deceased person is unknown, TMZ explained police were told she was “hanging out” with him in the hours leading up to his death. \nFOLLOW UP ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS \nChase is best known for playing creepy girl Samara in 2002’s “The Ring.” She also voiced Lilo in the 2002 animated Disney film “Lilo and Stich.” She recently appear in the 2016 film “Jack Comes Home” opposite Rory Culkin and Natasha Lyonne. \nA rep for Chase didn't immediately return Fox News' request for comment.
