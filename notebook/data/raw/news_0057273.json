Rents rose at a 2.7-percent annual pace in January, an increase from December’s 2.3-percent pace. Nationally, apartment rents rose 2.2 percent last month. \nThe apartment occupancy rate in metro Denver remained unchanged at 94 percent, the same level seen in December, but down from the 94.3 percent of January 2016, according to Axiometrics. \nStephanie McCleskey, vice president of data acquisition for the firm, said in the monthly report that employment gains continued to run strong in metro Denver last year at 44,800, allowing the market to absorb new apartments. Apartment construction is expected to ramp up this year, adding to the pressure landlords will face to win over tenants.

Denver County rent gains averaged 5.3 percent, while Arapahoe County averaged 4.8 percent and south Aurora, 4.8 percent. \nAverage rents and the sheer number of apartments reflect a move away from home ownership, numbers show. \nAcross metro Denver, 61.6 percent of residents owned their homes in 2016, a rate that matched 2015. Denver ranked 47th among the top 75 metro areas for its rate of homeownership. \nIn 2006, about 70 percent of metro Denver residents owned their home.
