When it comes to work, science tells us that an expression of commendation is more effective than even monetary rewards in many situations. \nFor example, research organization Gallup surveyed more than four million employees on the topic of praise. They found that individuals who receive regular recognition and praise: Increase their individual productivity increase engagement among their colleagues are more likely to stay with their organization receive higher loyalty and satisfaction scores from customers have better safety records and fewer accidents on the job \nResearchers have also highlighted the benefits of showing appreciation to our spouses and children. \nBut here's the question: If we know how effective praise can be, why don't we do it more often? Why We Lack Appreciation \nIt's easy to begin taking for granted the things we really appreciated in the past. \nFor example, a team lead may be impressed with a new employee's work ethic and propensity to go above and beyond. Over time, though, the boss stops giving commendation. Why? Because this type of effort becomes the new normal. \n\"Why should I praise someone for doing something they should be doing?\" a mid-level manager for one Fortune 500 company once asked me. \nHow about, so they don't stop doing it? \nOr even worse, so you don't lose them to someone who appreciates them more. \nThis principle applies in all areas of life--whether at work, in the family, or in other relationships. But how can we cultivate a more appreciative spirit? And how should we make our commendation count? Look for the Good. \nThere's an old saying: Familiarity breeds contempt. \nUnfortunately, that adage may prove true--if we're not careful. Over time, we tend to be overly critical of those we are closest to. I'm not talking about constructive criticism, which is necessary for growth. Rather, it's the penchant we have to start concentrating on what a person is missing, rather than on what they bring to the table. \nInstead, why not look for what a person is doing right? It may be helpful to start making a list of traits you appreciate in your spouse, child, or colleague--or positive actions they have done that benefit your family or team. \nAt times, that also means looking for potential. If you see something that others don't even see in themselves, you help to create self-fulfilling prophecies. \nThey'll get better--because you believe they can. Don't Just Feel It. Say It. \nOnce you cultivate an attitude of appreciation, you need to communicate it: \nClearly. Specifically. Sincerely. \nBe clear by telling them directly how you feel. Don't leave it up to chance. Make sure they know, by telling them. \nBe specific by not only saying that you appreciate them, but telling them what you appreciate, and why. \nBe sincere by speaking up quickly. If you noticed someone doing something harmful, you'd likely point it out to discourage them from continuing. Why not do the same for positive behaviors? See something good, praise right away--to encourage them to continue. \nHow might this look in real life? Here's an example: \n\"Hi, can we talk? \nI know I don't say this enough, but I really appreciate you and everything you do around here. The way you (tell them the what, where, and why--the more specific the better) is really great. It makes our (home/workplace) a better place. I'm really thankful to have you.\" \nObviously, you have to keep it real. Make it your own, adapt to your circumstances, be sincere. And don't view commendation as a task to be marked off your checklist; instead, try to cultivate a mindset of appreciating others--from your family members, to your colleagues, to your office housekeeper. \nSo, what are you waiting for? Go tell someone how much you appreciate them. \nBecause Joni Mitchell got it right: \nSometimes, you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone. Like this column?
