The deal leaves cash-on-hand and other assets on BULLDOG's balance sheet, resulting in approximate proceeds of $70 million at closing to BULLDOG's shareholders, a multiple of 5.7x BULLDOG's full-year 2016 revenue. Additionally, BULLDOG may receive an earn-out, payable upon the achievement of certain targets through 2021, potentially significantly increasing the total consideration. The earn-out is based on sales exceeding current plan and forecasts in 2019, 2020, and/or 2021.\nGruppo Campari has distributed BULLDOG Gin since 2014 through its own distribution network, including the Global Travel Retail channel, by virtue of an exclusive five-year agreement with an attached call option to acquire ownership of the brand in 2020. Following a renegotiation of the deal terms, Gruppo Campari accelerated its purchase of the brand. The new deal structure enables Gruppo Campari to achieve a financially attractive proposition, allowing it to fully exploit the brand's growth potential going forward by taking full control of the marketing strategy as well as the brand building initiatives.\nLaunched in the USA in 2007 and subsequently in Europe , BULLDOG Gin has experienced a meteoric rise and is the #4 premium (and above) gin in the world (IWSR) and also the fastest growing premium gin in the world* by annual growth rate.
