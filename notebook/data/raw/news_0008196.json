There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,” he said. \n“The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward.” \nBut senior US sources told \nThe Australian \nthat the White House was “not happy” about the conflicting message the clause sent and Australia would ultimately be expected to reciprocate. \n“The favour won’t be called in straight away … but some sort of reciprocity will come eventually,” the source said. \n“And that is likely to come in the form of freedom-of-navigation exercises (in the South China Sea) or the deployment of special forces to Iraq.” \nThe Australian \ncontroversial immigration order \nto cover the Nauru deal with Australia as a “special favour”, after intense lobbying by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and diplomats in Washington. \nMr Turnbull announced after his weekend phone call with Mr Trump that the president had agreed to honour the deal involving refugees being held on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island and Nauru. \nThis was despite the agreement originally being struck by former President Barack Obama and last week US President Donald Trump placing a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict US border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria. \nOn Tuesday, the new Homeland Security secretary John Kelly revealed travellers singled out for “extreme vetting” from seven predominantly Muslim countries would face scrutiny of their social media use and phone contacts, “so that we can see who they are talking to”. \nOn Friday, Trump ordered a suspension of arrivals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as all refugees, to give time for the new government to develop procedures for extreme vetting to weed out potential extremists. \nMr Trump’s order halted immigration from the seven countries for at least 90 days, but Mr Kelly suggested that for some the ban could go on longer if stronger vetting procedures are not in place once the review period has elapsed. \n“Some of those countries that are on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon. There are countries that are in various states of collapse, for example,” Kelly said, without offering specifics. \nThe sudden order caught many US immigration gateways and foreign airlines by surprise, resulting in many people with legal US residency being blocked from boarding aircraft for the United States or being detained upon arrival. \nWith the move under widespread criticism, Mr Kelly denied it specifically targets Muslims, which could violate the US Constitution. \nUS Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan also cleared up an issue that had impacted many travellers with dual nationality, saying they could enter the United States as long as the passport they present is acceptable. \n“Travellers will be assessed at our borders based on the passport that they present, not any dual national status,” he said. \nMr McAleenan said that through Monday 721 people had been denied boarding while more than 1,000 people were granted waivers from the Trump order to allow them to enter the country. \nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.
