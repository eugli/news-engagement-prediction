Let me tell you what happened. I got a first text, and I was like, 'Why is this person saying congratulations?' \n\"Then I get a second text from one of my students at Texas Southern, and I was like, 'What are you talking about?' He was like, 'Go to the web.' I didn't know myself.\" \nHowever, once he heard the news, Mathew - who used to be Beyoncé's manager - quickly called his daughter and they had a \"wonderful\" chat.

I was like, 'You're OK?' Because she sounded a little tired because she's working on the Grammy performance. \n\"We just had a wonderful daughter-dad conversation. [But] I'm not gonna tell you all of that... \n\"Beyoncé and I had a great conversation. I'm looking forward to seeing her soon and I told her, 'Look, slow down a little bit. You need to slow down a little bit.' \" Beyonce Pregnant (Photo: Beyonce.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:30:20.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
