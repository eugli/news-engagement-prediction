This year's judges were Pulitzer winner Thomas French and Pulitzer finalist Kelley Benham French of Indiana University; data journalist Carl Bialik of FiveThirtyEight; and Mindy Marques and Rick Hirsch, editor and managing editor of the Miami Herald. Marques judged our Spanish-language entries. \nA special prize, the Robert W. Decherd Award for Civic Journalism, was given to Sunday and Enterprise Editor Tom Huang for his community-related efforts. He was nominated by a panel of senior editors and selected by Wilson and Jim Moroney, publisher and CEO of the Morning News. \nThe civic journalism award is named after the retired longtime CEO of the Morning News' parent company. \nHere are the winners and excerpts of the judges' comments. \nCommunity Journalist of the Year: Matt Wixon \nIn a city where high school football is a community connector, Matt Wixon has elevated coverage with original, off-the-beaten path stories far beyond the game. With deep reporting, a deft writing style and a creative approach, Wixon is a model for how to tap into the personal stories that drive high school sports. \nProduction Hero of the Year: Greg Riddle \nIn a metro newsroom with a big league print product, few things are harder than maintaining a digital mindset and tempo while pressroom deadlines loom -- all the while remembering what's important to your audiences. Greg does that with pride and aplomb. \nVisual Journalist of the Year: John Hancock \nWith a clean, modern style, John Hancock weaves in multiple elements to produce stunning digital story presentations . His designs offer multiple points of entry that co-exist rather than compete for attention. He brings a creative but subdued design that doesn't overwhelm the story itself. A photo by Tom Fox, The Dallas Morning News' photographer of the year, showing the Dallas Police Honor Guard following the horse drawn caisson carrying slain Dallas police officer Patrick Zamarripa at Dallas Fort Worth National Cemetery on July 16. Zamarripa was among the officers killed in an ambush attack in downtown Dallas on July 7. Tom Fox/Staff Photographer \nPhotographer/Videographer of the Year: Tom Fox \nFox's photos and videos shimmer with a cutting wit, intelligence and a gift for finding moments when the world opens. His work blew us away. \nCopy Editor of the Year: Frank Smith \nFor whittling stories with minimal blood loss and for crafting headlines that pop off the page, Frank Smith stands out. This year, this veteran held down the new digital desk singlehandedly for several weeks until reinforcements arrived. \nSports Reporter of the Year: Evan Grant \nEvan did it all on the Rangers beat: He broke news, blended humor and graphics with his Game of Thrones knowledge to enliven a midseason report, and interviewed newsmakers on his podcast. Throughout, he showcased strong reporting and expertise with compelling writing. \nBeat Reporter of the Year: Sharon Grigsby \nThe relentless focus of Sharon Grigsby's reporting and dissection of Dallas Animal Services redefines what beat reporting can be about in 2017. It's unusual to have an editorial writer in a category like this, but in this digital age, it may reveal a new marker. Her work -- in stories, columns and editorials -- provided the classic drumbeat of tenacious beat coverage that doesn't let its subjects slip away until it there are significant results. \nInvestigative Journalist of the Year: J. David McSwane \nMcSwane's work stood out for its combination of data, document digging, interviewing, and writing; for its relevance throughout Dallas and the state. It also demonstrates the payoff of digging into a story, generating expertise and sources for important follow-ups. \nDigital Audience Builder of the Year: Chris Siron \nNot everyone can move easily from print to digital. Chris has done it with great creativity, ambition and success. His Q&A sessions with colleagues from other departments are a model of collaboration across the newsroom. He challenges his team to create work that embraces the digital so much that he'd find it difficult to adapt for print. It's all yielded work that is highly popular with readers. \nDigital Storyteller of the Year: Hannah Wise \nIt sometimes feels like journalists today are expected to be masters of all media in addition to all the traditional tools of the craft. That's daunting for many, but not for Hannah Wise, who beamed live video reports through her cellphone from important events; used a Facebook group to engage young readers; and helped build invaluable interactive tools. \nPICA (perspective, insight, context, analysis) Writer of the Year: Chris Vognar \nVognar's incisive analysis on race and culture smolders on the page with lingering power. His reporting was impressive, allowing him to offer insights that undermine popular assumptions and force the reader to think and feel more deeply. We were especially impressed by his piece on slavery stories in the age of Black Lives Matter. \nNarrative Feature of the Year: Steve Thompson and Anna Kuchment \nThompson's and Kuchment's impressive piece about the Texas Railroad Commission left no doubt about the link between fracking and earthquakes in North Texas. These two journalists took a highly complex and charged subject and emerged with a crystalline narrative that mixed science, politics, money, power and bald-faced lying into a seamless and shocking story. \nLine Editor of the Year: Dave Hiott \nThe award goes to Dave Hiott for jumping into a new role to handle the biggest story of the year, coordinating 19 reporters to produce a rich, gripping narrative of the day five officers were killed. Dave guided reporters through some of the toughest days and best work of their careers, and kept a steady hand on a desk that continued to deliver big headlines. \nDigital Innovators of the Year: Andrew Chavez, Allan James Vestal and Ariana Giorgi \nWe can only take nominators at their word about the budget app, but we know from experience how important it is to have a good one. The elections page was truly elegant: The search tool and the trends by county made the page stand out among many local and national contenders. \nNews Reporter of the Year: Naomi Martin \nMartin's work stands out for both storytelling power and impact. The deep profile of (right-wing commentator) Tomi Lahren reveals a local woman with a sudden national profile whose story too easily could be told in caricature. The nuanced tale of (recovering addict) Monica Frasier captures the essence of a life of conflict. And the investigative enterprise in both her Clay Jenkins piece and an analysis of how rising property tax rates are penalizing Dallas' middle class are classics of accountability reporting. \nRobert W. Decherd Award for Civic Journalism: Tom Huang \nHuang built and helped run the Hispanic Families Network , which taught research and social media skills to moms and dads in our community. He brokered the collaboration between the Dallas Festival of Ideas and the Dallas Book Festival, which will result in the festivals co-locating this spring. He helped organize the Actions Speak Louder community discussions after the police shootings. And now he is co-leading the Storytellers Without Borders project, in which Dallas high school students will learn research skills and multimedia storytelling techniques. Tom does all of this on top of conceiving and editing some of The Dallas Morning News' best journalism.
