The Vengeful Bitches In The First Trailer For Sofia Coppola's 'The Beguiled' February 09, 2017 at 04:56AM By Elise Jost , writer at creators.co 'The Beguiled' [Credit: Ben Rothstein / Entertainment Weekly] By Elise Jost , writer at Creators.co \"It's a UNIX system! I know this!\" \nIf you're familiar with the universe of #SofiaCoppola , whose varied stories have always involved female heroines and a dreamy sense of glamour, you should be very excited to get a first look at her next feature, an adaptation of the 1966 novel by Thomas Cullinan, A Painted Devil . \nThe plot of #TheBeguiled is simple, but the story is packed with intrigue and potential for electric scenes: In 1864, an all-female boarding school in Virginia sees its quiet, lonely routine interrupted when one of them discovers a wounded soldier during the Civil War. His presence brings out sexual tension and jealousy among the school's residents â€” need we say more? One Man To Disturb The Ladies: Watch The First Trailer For 'The Beguiled' \n\"What have you done to me, you vengeful bitches!\" I'm already sold. \nWhile #ColinFarrell plays the wounded soldier, #NicoleKidman stars as the headmistress. She's joined by Coppola regulars #KirstenDunst and #ElleFanning , as a teacher and a student. The stellar cast alone is reason enough to be intrigued by the movie, but what's most compelling is Coppola's reversal of the rather sexist 1971 adaptation of the same novel, starring Clint Eastwood in the main role. \nThat version was told from the soldier's perspective, but as Coppola tells Entertainment Weekly, The Beguiled is first and foremost about its female characters: \n\"The main crux of the story is about the dynamics between a group of women all stuck together, and then also the power shifts between men and women. So for me, it's very universal, but it's in this exotic setting of the Southern gentility.\" \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:33.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
