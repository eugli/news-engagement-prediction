The franchise came into existence under the guidance of David Ayer last summer, but now it appears that Warner Bros. and DC want to enlist the talents of this Hollywood icon. Make no mistake, Gibson may have become a polarizing figure in recent years, but there is absolutely no questioning the fact that this guy knows how to direct the hell out of a movie. \nOn that note, we have put together a list of reasons why Mel Gibson may actually be the perfect choice to take control of this highly anticipated Suicide Squad sequel. Take a look at our ideas, and make sure to let us know what you think of this recent development in the comments section below. Now, let's get the ball rolling with the thing that makes the world go round and round: money. He Knows How To Work On A Low Budget \nDavid Ayer directed the original Suicide Squad for a staggering $175 million price tag. By contrast, Mel Gibson directed Hacksaw Ridge (a full-blown war movie) for a comparatively small $40 million. You would never even notice how cheaply made Hacksaw is because Gibson knows how to stretch a dollar and work within a small budget. With that in mind, DC could take a page from the Deadpool handbook by lowering the price tag for Suicide Squad 2 , handing more creative control over to Gibson and letting him work his magic on the story. With such a minimal financial investment, the potential for success becomes exponentially greater than the first installment in the franchise with considerably less of the risk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:26:32.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
