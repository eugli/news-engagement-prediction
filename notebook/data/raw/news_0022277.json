The sitcom became the most popular programme on TV and is seen as one of the shows from the Golden Age of the genre. It earned Galton and Simpson, who had not been expected to survive tuberculosis in their teenage years, Writers' Guild Awards in 1962 and 1963. In 1997, a six-part BBC series called Get Well Soon, written by Galton and John Antrobus, was based on Galton and Simpson's experiences in Milford Sanatorium.

Both were both awarded OBEs in 2000 for their contribution to British television. The pair said last year that they still met every Monday to drink coffee and discuss the best comedians. 'When there were only two channels, there was a load of rubbish. A show might start out dreadful, but you nursed it,' Simpson told the Daily Telegraph, rubbishing the suggestion that there had ever been a TV Golden Age. 'Fifty years ago, if you had an idea, it could be going out within three weeks - the time it took to build the sets. Now it has to go through committees, and the process can take years.' Galton and Simpson were honoured with the Bafta Fellowship last summer. 'We always wanted a Fellowship, even though we did not know what a fellowship was. 'Not the sort of thing one associates with a couple of Cockney lads, apart from Alfred Hitchcock, of course,' Simpson said at the time.
