I will be reimbursing the accommodation claims made within my own electorate. \n\"All claims were made within parliamentary guidelines and assessed by parliamentary officers.\" \nOn his sister Kate Langbroek's Australian Radio Network program, Mr Langbroek said there was no differentiation for accommodation costs between small and large electorates, as there was for car allowances. \n\"It's weird — when you have car allowances they give you a different level depending on the size of the electorates, but they don't for hotel stays,\" he said.

They changed it for everyone.\" \nThe interview took a strange turn when Kate Langbroek referred to social media comments about her brother's behaviour. \nShe told the audience Mr Langbroek had been with his wife, Stacey, \"and at the time it didn't even occur to me that it was hookers!\" \n\"It's not hookers,\" Mr Langbroek chimed in vehemently. \n\"Where does that come from? We were at three charity events together.\" \nMr Langbroek said: \"Really sorry to people who have felt it was the wrong thing — even though, according to our rules it was OK. \nThis prompted his sister to chide him: \n\"Oh that doesn't sound like you're sorry, that actually sounds like a justification. Don't use that tone, apologise again.\" \nWhich Mr Langbroek did: \"I'm sorry and I won't do it again.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:19:29.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
