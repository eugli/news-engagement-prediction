But fear not: the Texas rangers are on the case.\nNew England Patriots fans celebrate Super Bowl win – in pictures Read more \nAfter leading New England to an improbable and historic comeback at NRG Stadium, Brady lost his shirt in the melee. The quarterback was unable to find his jersey despite a thorough search of the locker room after the game. “This is not good,” a flustered Brady said at the time. “It was right here and now I don’t have it. Not good.”\nOn Monday, however, Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor, said he was calling in the big guns to help the Houston police department retrieve the missing item.\nPatrick said: “In Texas we place a very high value on hospitality and football. Tom Brady’s jersey has great historical value and is already being called the most valuable NFL collectible ever. It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day.\n“It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas. I’ve called Colonel Steve McCraw to ask that the Texas rangers work with the Houston police department on this case.\n“I’m a Texans and Cowboys fan first, but the unquestionable success of the Super Bowl in Houston last night was a big win for our entire state and I don’t want anything to mar that victory. Whoever took this jersey should turn it in. The Texas rangers are on the trail.”\nNo police report has been filed, but NFL security has been in touch with officers in Houston.\n\nBrady said on Monday: “I put it in the bag, and I came out and it wasn’t there any more. It’s unfortunate because that’s a nice piece of memorabilia. If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me know so I can track that down.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:30:26.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
