The plan includes hiring a director to implement the strategy, Indigenous representation on student council, an elder-in-residence program, a dedicated Indigenous space, as well as daycare and housing.\nPresident Tim Loreman aims to make Concordia a destination for Indigenous learners. (CBC)\nThe university, located at 7128 Ada Blvd., will also establish a Cree language program and introduce Indigenous knowledge into a variety of courses.\n\"One thing that I really want to achieve here is a meaningful and rich Indigenous element to Concordia that is infused throughout our programming and throughout our institution,\" said Concordia president Tim Loreman.\nHe said the aim is to create touch points so all Concordia students can have some engagement with Indigenous knowledge, history, culture and spirituality.\n'Destination for Indigenous learners' And with just five per cent of Concordia's students identifying as Indigenous, a number on par with other local post-secondary institutions, the strategy aims to expand that to 12 per cent by 2021.\n\"My hope is that ultimately Concordia becomes a destination for Indigenous learners,\" Loreman said.\nThe plan drew on six months of consultations and talking circles with more than 100 Indigenous students, elders, business leader, and other cultural groups led by Indigenous strategy advisers Lewis Cardinal and Faron Cahoon.\nLewis Cardinal outside the construction site where Corcordia's new Indigenous centre will be located.

The Indigenous space will incorporate natural elements with glass walls that look out into the river valley, a smudging space, and Indigenous art, as well as flat screen TVs, comfortable chairs, desks and computers.\n\"So it's a space that will encapsulate that Indigenous world view,\" he said.\nThe space will have a prominent place in the facility's new Centre for Science Research and Innovation, which is funded by a $6.55 million federal infrastructure grant. In December, the university broke ground on the centre. It is expected to be completed in 2018.\nPlans for Concordia's new facility with an Indigenous centre overlooking the river valley.
