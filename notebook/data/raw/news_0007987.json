But he acknowledged it didn’t look good for either of them. \n“It puts everyone in difficult position, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. \n“From Mr Turnbull’s side it raises serious questions about whether the refugee deal will go ahead.” \nMr Trump labelling Mr Turnbull’s call “the worst” even after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the same day, would not have sat well with Mr Trump’s opponents, Mr Robinson said. \n“That is extraordinary and this would not have happened between John Howard and George W Bush, or any other leaders” he said. Mr Trump spoke with Mr Turnbull for 25 minutes before hanging up.

Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \n“The Washington Post story, a leading US newspaper, would have pushed this issue (refugee deal) into the domestic debate and that makes it more difficult to see how it will proceed,” Mr Robinson said. \nThis deal would not be well received by those who had propelled Mr Trump into power, particularly given he was so vocal about immigration during his campaign, he added. \nMr Robinson said such a deal was not binding which was why Mr Turnbull would have been keen to seek assurances from Mr Trump that it would still go ahead. \nGiven the executive order was signed just a day before the call took place, Mr Trump would also have been angered that he was backed into a corner over accepting refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. \n“His supporters and those behind this executive order would have been somewhat aggrieved,” Mr Robinson said. \n“Enabling this deal would be breaking face with those who propelled him into the presidency. \n“This indicates the deal is less likely to go ahead.” \nHowever there remains confusion as to whether the US President intends to honour the deal with the White House confirming in a written statement to the ABC that Mr Trump was “still considering” whether to take refugees from Australia. \nMr Trump later tweeted calling it a “dumb deal” that he would study. Mr Turnbull said details of the weekend’s conversation with Donald Trump were private.

So he didn’t let diplomatic niceties get in the way of how he felt about that refugee policy.” \nTREAT WITH ‘ALLIES WITH RESPECT’ \nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said it was time Mr Turnbull told Australians what was really going on surrounding the deal. \nMr Shorten also said he has previously expressed concerns about some of Mr Trump’s views. \nSpeaking in Canberra, Mr Shorten said the American alliance should be stronger than individuals. \n“But it is most important that whoever is in power in Canberra or in the White House, that we treat our allies with respect,” he said. \n“If I was Prime Minister, I would want the United States to be our ally, and I’m sure that the Americans want Australia to be their ally, but if I was Prime Minister I would never just be a satellite of the United States.” \nMr Shorten also said he felt it was important that Australia spoke its mind. \n“I’m not going to make a habit of commenting on every in and out of American politics and I would expect the Americans to respect that about Australian politics,” he said. \n“But sometimes silence can be bad as agreement, and I think it is important that Australia takes a robust, pro-Australian position in its dealing with the United States.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:34:43.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
