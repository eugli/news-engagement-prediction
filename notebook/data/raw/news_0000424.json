Related Why 'Westworld' Was a Success HBO's hit show was compelling, confusing, thrilling, maddening – and most of all, it was virtually impossible not to keep watching \nIn the video, Crystal's Mitch plays one of Westworld's humanoids who is being questioned by the park's security guard Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) and technician Sylvester (Ptolemy Slocum) after going off his \"loop.\" \n\"Today was like any other day: Herded some cows, Phil took an hour to pee, just living the life,\" Mitch tells them, only to quickly reveal that he was lying and he in fact shot his robot pal Phil, played by Stern in both City Slickers films, in the face after Phil confuses a DVR for a VCR. (\"Do I set it to channel three and then press record?,\" Phil asks.) \nAfter some tinkering –\"Thank you, other Hemsworth brother,\" Mitch says in a meta moment – Crystal's character is unleashed back into the park, where Phil once again annoys him to the point of murder. \nThe two city slickers are then reconfigured, decommissioned and eventually put in storage, where Mitch hits it off with one of Westworld's prostitutes, Clementine (actress Angela Sarafyan in a cameo). \nThis isn't Stern's first time reviving one of his classic Nineties characters: In 2015, the actor conjured up Home Alone 's thief Marv after Macaulay Culkin reprised the Kevin McAllister role for a creepy video .
