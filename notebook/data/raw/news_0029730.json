(AP) \nThe United States, Japan and South Korea on Sunday requested an urgent UN Security Council meeting to discuss North Korea’s latest missile test, which Pyongyang claimed was a success. \n“The United States, along with Japan and the Republic of Korea, have requested urgent consultations on the DPRK’s launch of a ballistic missile on February 12,” said a US mission spokesperson. The test was seen as a challenge to Donald Trump’s young presidency. \nNorth Korea fired a ballistic missile early on Sunday in its first such test of the year. State media said leader Kim Jong Un was at the site to observe the launch and expressed pleasure at the North’s expansion of its strategic strike capabilities. \nA report on the launch carried early Monday by the North’s Korean Central News Agency said Kim watched from an observation post and gave the order to fire the ‘Pukguksong-2’, which it said was a “Korean style new type strategic weapon system”. \nIt is believed to have flown about 500 kilometers before splashing down into the ocean in international waters. \nThe report said the test proved “the reliability and security” of a new mobile launching system, the solid fuel that was used and the guidance and control features of the ballistic missile. Solid fuel can give missiles longer range and make detecting them before launch more difficult because they can be readied faster than liquid fuel missiles. \nThe report also said the test verified control and guidance capabilities and said the missile can be “tipped with a nuclear warhead.” \nIt suggested the launch conducted in a “lofted” style, which puts the missile into a high trajectory rather than a lower one that gives it more range, in order take “the security of the neighbouring countries into consideration”. \nIt added Kim “expressed great satisfaction over the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means”. \n“Now our rocket industry has radically turned into high thrust solid fuel-powered engine from liquid fuel rocket engine and rapidly developed into a development- and creation-oriented industry, not just copying samples,” he said. “Thanks to the development of the new strategic weapon system, our People’s Army is capable of performing its strategic duties most accurately and rapidly in any space: under waters or on the land.” Read more North Korea nuclear attack would trigger ‘overwhelming’ response from US: James Mattis \nNorth Korea had warned it was ready to test its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The US Strategic Command, however, said it detected and tracked what it assessed to be a medium- or intermediate-range missile. The reports of the launch came as Trump was hosting Abe and just days before the North is to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un’s late father, Kim Jong Il. \nAfter receiving word of the launch, Trump stood at his south Florida estate with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who called the move “intolerable”. \nAppearing with Trump at a news conference at Trump’s estate, Abe condemned the missile launch as “absolutely intolerable.” He read a brief statement calling on the North to comply fully with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. He said Trump had assured him of U.S. support and that Trump’s presence showed the president’s determination and commitment. \nTrump followed Abe with even fewer words, saying in part: “I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.” \nThe North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Kim Jong Un said in his New Year’s address that the country had reached the final stages of readiness to test an ICBM, which would be a major step forward in its efforts to build a credible nuclear threat to the United States.

The Foreign Ministry said South Korea would continue to work with allies, including the United States, Japan and the European Union, to ensure a thorough implementation of sanctions against the North and make the country realize that it will “never be able to survive” without discarding all of its nuclear and missile programs. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:51:48.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
