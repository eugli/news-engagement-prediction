I’m excited for the challenge. I lead by example and I do what I say.” \nBeams played 110 games for Collingwood, including the 2010 premiership, before moving back to Queensland to play alongside his younger brother, Claye, at the end of 2014. \nWhile he had an outstanding first season at the Lions — winning the club’s 2015 best and fairest in a four-way tie — knee tendinitis restricted Beams to only two performances last year. \nNonetheless, Beams suggested he was confident his body would bounce back to optimum fitness this season. \n“It’s always the question mark that’s going to be around me: will my body hold up?” Beams said. \n“It’s a fair question. What I can say is I’ve done everything possible ... to make sure I’ll play every game this year. I’ve got full confidence my body will hold up.” \nBeams said he was equally confident of working with Rockliff, despite the dynamic between the pair shifting. \n“I need his support and Tom is really open to supporting me. I’ve learnt a lot from Tom,” Beams said. \n“When Chris (Fagan) came in he had a clean slate for all players and what I can say of Tom over the last four months is he’s been very, very good. \n“He’s worked on a lot of things. I couldn’t be happier to have him in my corner.” \nFagan said Beams had made an immediate impression on him, and that he was confident Brisbane would be well placed to tackle 2017 under his leadership. \n“Dayne was the first person to call me when I got the job. I came to understand that he’s massively passionate about the footy club,” Fagan said.
