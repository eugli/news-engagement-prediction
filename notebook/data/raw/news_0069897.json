Source: Tweet \nLeverkusen were gunning for revenge after their European elimination at the hands of Atleti in 2014-2015, and they had every reason to be confident following an eight-game unbeaten run in the Champions League, with only Real Madrid on a longer streak. \nHowever, the visitors made an electric start, Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann putting them two goals up at half-time, before Karim Bellarabi pulled one back early in the second half. \nStefan Savic's own-goal after a Kevin Gameiro penalty prompted a late onslaught from Leverkusen, but Atleti were always dangerous on the break and Fernando Torres' late header restored their two-goal cushion. Saul has scored the 100th European goal of Diego Simeone’s reign as Atletico Madrid head coach (in his 61st European game) #UCL pic.twitter.com/s2692CtaY2 \n— Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) February 21, 2017 \nA heavy home defeat leaves Leverkusen's chances of progression hanging by a thread in an underwhelming season that has seen head coach Roger Schmidt fight off reports that he could be sacked. \nDiego Simeone's side have also struggled to replicate their best form this term, and their new-found defensive frailties were on display again, but a scintillating attacking display bodes well for the weekend's clash with Barcelona. \nAtletico immediately pinned Leverkusen back in their half from the off and came close to opening the scoring twice in rapid succession after just 12 minutes. 15 seconds between Leverkusen putting the ball into the Atlético Madrid box and Antoine Griezmann making it 0-2 up the other end. pic.twitter.com/CRWA9YfVU2 \n— Archie Rhind-Tutt (@archiert1) February 21, 2017 \nGriezmann first called goalkeeper Bernd Leno into action with a low show from a narrow angle, before Wendell hit his own crossbar moments later with a clumsy clearance after Filipe Luis' cross from the left. \nThere was no such escape for the hosts five minutes later, however, as Saul handed Atletico the lead with a stunning strike, cutting inside onto his favoured left foot and curling a beautiful shot into the top corner past the helpless Leno. \nThings went from bad to worse for Leverkusen as Aleksandar Dragovic inadvertently sent Gameiro on his way with a poor clearance on the halfway line and the Frenchman raced clear before setting up Griezmann for a composed finish inside the box.
