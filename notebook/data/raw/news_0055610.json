We'll see what happens. We actually sat down in the studio and were talking for a little bit. I mean, we’re both busy, but when he has like a moment we’ve just been sitting down and just working together. I think it’s about catching a vibe.” \nGambino also mentioned how he'd prefer to work with Chance in the studio, rather than collaborating over e-mail. “I just wanna hang out with him. I don't work with people over email anymore. I think it just doesn't make for good work. We just have to find a time to sit down together,\" he said. \nLast January, the two stars snapped a photo together on Chance's Instagram, sparking rumors of a joint project. The caption read \"Hawaii then LA, back to work. #roscoeswetsuit.\" In 2013, Chance made an appearance in Gambino's Because of the Internet screenplay , where the two coined the phrase \"Roscoe's sweatsuit.\" \nOn the music front, Chance and Gambino partnered up for two collaborations in the past. First, the latter appeared on \"Favorite Song\" from Chance's acclaimed mixtape Acid Rap . The Chi-Town rep then returned the favor on Gambino's Because of the Internet album, teaming up for \"The Worst Guys.\" \nCheck out the 21-minute interview below, as Gambino also speaks on his new album Awaken, My Love! and his upcoming Star Wars and Spider-Man film roles, and also shares an update on season two of his FX hit series Atlanta .
