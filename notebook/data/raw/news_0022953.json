The Army had begun further study of the river crossing after contamination fears raised by the Standing Rock tribe, but it notified Congress on Tuesday that it would stop the study and grant ETP permission to continue work.\nThe decision came after Donald Trump formally backed the project last month in one of his first acts as US president.\nThousands of predominantly Native American protesters have boycotted the pipeline's construction in the state of North Dakota.\nThe 1,172 mile (1,886km), four-state project is almost finished except for the one-mile stretch under Lake Oahe, where demonstrators have set up protest encampments.\nThe Obama administration announced in September that it would not allow the project to proceed, but Mr Trump overturned the decision.\nThe Army's statement on Tuesday said: \"The Department of the Army announced today that it has completed a presidential-directed review of the remaining easement request for the Dakota Access pipeline, and has notified Congress that it intends to grant an easement.\"\nAn easement is a special permit that allows a company to cross private land. North Dakota's two US senators welcomed the Army's announcement.\nStanding Rock Sioux lawyers said approval of the project cannot be \"legally granted at this time\".\nProtests have raged in the North Dakota plains Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and the Center for Biological Diversity have criticised the decision and vowed to fight the pipeline.\nThey accused the Trump administration of putting corporate profits ahead of Native Americans and the environment.\nNearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials.\nJust last week 76 protesters were arrested after refusing to leave land owned by the energy company.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37863955", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FCE8/production/_92244746_dakota_pipeline_map624.png", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38734450", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0F29/production/_94218830_gettyimages-626821358.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9185/production/_94235273_mediaitem94235272.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38836329"], "published": "2017-02-09T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:23:15.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
