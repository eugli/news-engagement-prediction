For anyone who has ever lost a family member or friend to mental illness, my heart goes out to you,” Lake wrote on Instagram. \n“I am a greater person for having known him and spent the past 6 and a half years of my life with him.

Rest in peace, my love.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:59:26.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
