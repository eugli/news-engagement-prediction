Paul Sullivan ” hit as many home runs as him.\nBut Sosa said if the Cubs invited him back, he’d say yes. He has not returned since walking out on the team on the final day of the 2004 season. \n“Why not?” he said. “One day, if they invite me, a lot of people will be very happy about it.” \nSosa added the Cubs \"know where to find me.” \nThe Cubs do know where to find Sosa, but that day is not coming. \nOver the years Chairman Tom Ricketts has repeatedly been asked about bringing Sosa back to a Cubs Convention, or to throw out a first pitch of sing the seventh-inning stretch. Ricketts always left the situation open-ended, waiting for Sosa to come clean and admit his mistakes. \n“Nothing has really changed from the way I really feel about this,” Ricketts said at the 2016 Cubs Convention. “At some point, something will happen that will allow us to welcome Sammy back. I look forward to that day. Until that day, I don’t have anything to add.” \nThe Cubs declined to comment on Sosa’s latest remarks, but Ricketts and other high-ranking officials apparently weren’t happy with the interview and have decided to stop talking about him. \nThe organization clearly is tired of answering questions about a possible Sosa return, especially after finally winning a championship and now focusing on a repeat. \nSo the door quietly has been slammed shut on Sosa, once and for all.
