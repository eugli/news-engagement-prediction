It opened in mid-September in the Mass Ave. district at 707 Fulton St., in a garage-style space behind Circa Apartments. \nThe philosophy behind third-wave coffee is that instead of adding things like syrups and flavors to the coffee, they start with top-quality beans from around the world and focus on simple brewing techniques to bring out the best flavors.

The map shows the coffee belt — which stretches between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer — and regions that are color-coded with the bags of coffee beans that originate there. Eventually, Kilander said, he wants to add LED lights that will illuminate a coffee’s country of origin while it’s brewing. \nSingle-origin coffees are becoming more common on the Indy coffee scene, but the Kilanders take it a few steps further. Certain specialty drinks on the menu use the brewing techniques, recipes and serving sizes traditional to the coffee’s country or region of origin. \nThe Vietnamese coffee, for instance, uses beans from Vietnam brewed in a phin brewer, served over ice with sweetened condensed milk. \nAnother popular choice is the bicerin coffee, a drink native to Turin, Italy, that layers Italian espresso over dark chocolate, topped with layers of steamed milk and foam. \nEven the chai — available in black, green and red blends — is made in-house from real spices just like it is made in India. \nKilander said he’s excited about the opportunities the Mass Ave.-area space will give him to explore new innovations in coffee — from a healthier decaf to a new way of making cold brew. Rather than mimicking the trends of the moment, he plans to continue doing his own thing. \n“People want to come to a unique experience,” he said. “If someone comes to Indianapolis, you don’t want to go to a typical coffee shop, you want something that when you leave you go, ‘Wow, I remember that coffee we had in Indianapolis.’” 160 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2kX82wi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:04:58.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
