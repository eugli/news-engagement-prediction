The professional provocateur has made a name for himself as one of the most visible faces of the white nationalist alt-right movement, which often espouses hate speak against other races, cultures and women. \nBut unlike the past, Yiannopoulos is finding himself on his own, without help from either “Daddy Trump”— as he often refers to the leader of the free world — or the man who discovered him, former Breitbart executive chairman and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Also Read: Milo Yiannopoulos Resigns, and Merriam-Webster Tweets About 'Schadenfreude' \nOn Monday, the Washingtonian reported that “at least a half-dozen” employees were prepared to leave Breitbart if Yiannopoulos wasn’t “promptly” fired. Ostensibly, one call from Bannon could have put a kibosh on the whole thing. Apparently, that call never came. \nThis is not how Yiannopoulos is used to rolling. When UC Berkeley canceled his planned speech earlier this month, the U.S. president came to his defense, publicly threatening to cut Berkeley’s federal funds . \nBannon, arguably now one of the most powerful people in the world, was the publisher of Breitbart and posted much of Yiannopoulos’ most contentious articles, including ones like, “ Gay rights have made us dumber, it’s time to get back in the closet ” and “ Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer? ” Yiannopoulos has unabashedly credited Bannon with discovering him, telling the Washington Post: “He made me a star.” \nBannon has praised Yiannopoulos’ work as “valuable.” \nBut on Monday, when Yiannopoulos’ lost a lucrative book deal and a high-profile speaking gig, there was no tweet from POTUS or a single word of encouragement from Bannon. The deafening silence from the White House continued on Tuesday when Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart amid a swirl of growing pressure.

But it’s possible Yiannopoulos managed to find the one taboo even Trump and Bannon can’t defend. \n“There is no political advantage in seeming to endorse or excuse pedophilia,” Jack Pitney, professor of government at California’s Claremont McKenna College told TheWrap. “Milo is so radioactive right now there’s no advantage to getting near him.” \n“He crossed one of the very few remaining lines in what is otherwise a line-less land,” Pitney said. \nThe White House did not respond to TheWrap’s requests for comment. 16 Media Losers of 2016, From Roger Ailes to Billy Bush (Photos) \nAs 2016 wraps up, it's time to declare the winners and losers of the media industry. The bizarre year featured a wild presidential election, the head of a top cable news network stepping down in disgrace and numerous pundits emerging as household names. Check out 16 losers from 2016. TheWrap \nRoger Ailes \nThe disgraced former Fox News CEO was arguably the most powerful man in media until Gretchen Carlson accused him of sexual harassment and numerous women came forward with similar claims. He resigned last summer and Fox news settled with Carlson and publicly apologized. Fox \nRosie O’Donnell \nNot too many people are mocked during a presidential primary debate, but O'Donnell checked that box in 2016. Her longtime-nemesis Donald Trump is president-elect, and she recently had to apologize after sharing a video suggesting his youngest son, Barron Trump, is autistic. Getty Images \nESPN \nESPN, is coming off its worst month ever in November, shedding 621,000 subscribers who opted not to pay their cable provider an estimated $7 for the network, according to a Nielsen report. Unfortunately for the World Wide Leader, people can watch highlights on their phones these days. ESPN \nChelsea Handler \nThe Netflix host was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter and was brought to tears when discussing Donald Trump’s victory. \n“Sorry, I hate f—ing crying on camera,” an emotional Handler said before discussing that she had threatened to move to Spain if Trump won the election but was talked out of it. Netflix \nKeith Olbermann \nThe former MSNBC and ESPN host went the entire 2016 presidential election cycle without landing a gig on cable news and eventually started offering commentary online through GQ. Olbermann is one of the most polarizing political pundits in the media industry and, if he didn’t land a primetime show in 2016, then it’s probably not looking good moving forward. ESPN \nBilly Bush \nThe former “Today” show co-host lost his job after The Washington Post published a videotape of Donald Trump on a hot mic boasting about kissing, groping and having sex with women. “When you’re a star, they let you do anything … I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,” he said. “Grab ‘em by the pu-y.” \nBush is heard throughout the tape agreeing with Trump as he made disparaging remarks about a married woman, and even egged him on. Bush is out of work, but the same can’t be said for Trump. NBC \nPollsters and data journalists \nNate Silver is the face of data-driven journalism and the FiveThirtyEight founder called all 50 states correctly during the 2012 election. This year the election didn’t go so well for anyone in the industry, including Silver. \nSilver reported on Election Day that Clinton had a 71.4 percent chance of winning the election. His site was wrong about the outcome in major battleground states including Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and Trump obviously won the election in addition to the individual states that were supposed to vote Clinton. ABC \nBill Simmons \nBill Simmons’ highly publicized HBO show “Any Given Wednesday” was canceled after only four months. The former ESPN star still has a comprehensive overall deal with HBO, a successful podcast and website, but getting canceled so quickly after so much buildup has to sting. \n“One of the many reasons I joined HBO was to see if we could create a show built around smart conversations for sports fans and pop culture junkies,” Simmons said in a statement. “We loved making that show, but unfortunately it never resonated with audiences like we hoped.” Getty Images \nHuffington Post \nA lot of people in the media were wrong about Trump, but few were as bold and arrogant about it as the HuffPost. When Trump first announced his candidacy, the HuffPost decided to cover Trump’s presidential campaign in its entertainment section, claiming the site won’t participate in the legitimacy of a “sideshow.” \nThe site was denied credentials to Trump events because of the decision, so it eventually moved coverage to the political section with the following editor’s note on every story: “Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:32:19.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
