The searches, however, went off peacefully,” a policeman manning the PCR said. \nArmy spokesman Rajesh Kalia said stones were hurled at the security forces by a mob when they were returning after conducting the search, which was initiated based on some intelligence inputs. \nThe mob was dispersed by the police, he said. \nA local news agency in Srinagar, however, reported that the security forces had to withdraw the operation after facing “stiff resistance” from locals. Police and army officials refuted the report. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:48.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
