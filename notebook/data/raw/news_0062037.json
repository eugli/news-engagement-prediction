I really believe they are the true Northern Lights. I'm just here to find ways to take down barriers so that they could shine, so that they could dance, so that they could light up our lives.”\n\nThe prize comes with a $1 million purse.\nIf she wins, MacDonnell has said she would like to establish a non-profit that runs environmentally focused programs for northern youth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:56:20.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
