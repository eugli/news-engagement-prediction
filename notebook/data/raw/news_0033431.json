Image caption Emerson residents have donated care packages \nEarly Saturday morning, as it struggled to handle 19 people who had crossed overnight, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) asked the municipality to open its community hall as a temporary shelter, where the town provided tea, food and blankets. \n\"We did this out of the goodness of our hearts,\" said Emerson official Greg Janzen, but added that the town cannot handle the influx on its own resources. \nHe noted there are concerns for both for the safety of local residents and for those making the dangerous trek on foot in freezing temperatures. \nBut Mr Janzen said \"most people in town are more concerned than scared\" about the strangers wandering into town. Image copyright AP Image caption Janzen and other officials held an emergency meeting \nThe town's fire services, which responds to calls about people who have crossed illegally, says many are found tired, hungry and very, very cold. \nOn Christmas Eve, two Ghanaian refugee claimants were badly frostbitten after making the crossing and getting lost. \nA truck driver eventually picked them up after finding them wandering on the highway after crossing from North Dakota into Manitoba. \nOnce people are intercepted, they are processed by the CBSA - identified, searched and screened. \nThe phenomenon of asylum seekers crossing the border in Manitoba is not new, but the spike in high numbers is. \nBetween April 2013 and March 2014, 68 claimants illegally crossed the international border, according to CBSA numbers. \nThe next year it was 136. The year after 340. Image caption The town has warned it cannot take an increase in refugee arrivals \nBetween April 2016 and 31 December 2016, 430 asylum claimants had been intercepted after crossing into Canada near the Emerson border. \nIt is not immediately clear what is driving the spike of mostly African refugee claimants, many travelling from Minneapolis up the I-29 Interstate before walking through fields into Canada. \nStill, Rita Chahal, executive director with the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, said \"people are coming, people are saying they are scared\" when asked about the political climate in the US under President Donald Trump. \nManitoba MP Ted Falk said on Thursday that more needs to be done to secure the border. \n\"Once they're on our soil they are our responsibility,\" he said. \nHe said he has heard from constituents asking him to push the federal government to do more to enforce the border's integrity. \n\"I know the folks in my riding, someone shows up at their door cold and hungry they're going to to get looked after,\" he told the BBC. \n\"But we certainly don't want there to be a negative incident that occurs as a result of that.\" \nThe federal government is also under pressure to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement, under which refugee claimants are required to request protection in the first safe country they arrive in. \nIt is a policy meant to better manage refugee claims and to avoid so-called \"asylum shopping\" between countries. \nBut it is also among the reasons the asylum seekers are avoiding trying to come to Canada at official ports of entry. \nSo far, the federal government is standing behind the agreement, which came into effect in 2004.
