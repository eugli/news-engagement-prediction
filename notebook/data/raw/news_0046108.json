(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTAMPA — In his first day as a special spring-training instructor at New York Yankees camp, Alex Rodriguez confirmed on Tuesday that he has retired from baseball. The three-time AL MVP said he has \"zero\" interest in returning to the field as a player. \nRodriguez played his final game for the Yankees on Aug. 12 at Yankee Stadium following a pre-game ceremony in his honor. He said he received interest from other clubs late in the season, but that he quickly decided not to return. \n\"I haven't had those thoughts,\" Rodriguez said. \"I know that was kind of the general sense, that I would probably come back and play. But being a Yankee means everything to me. I'm grateful to (Yankees owners) Hank and Hal (Steinbrenner) for the opportunity they gave me to get back my life, and get my life back in order. Walking out with my mother and my two daughters is something I'll never forget, and I thank Hank and Hal for giving me that night. MLB’s bullpen revolution a hard sell for 162 games \n\"I flew the whole family home after that Friday night and I thought about it a little that weekend. I was fortunate enough to have a few offers, but I called them back and said no thank you. ... The Pinstripes mean so much to me.\" \nA 14-time All-Star, Rodriguez will finish his career with 696 home runs, good for fourth on MLB's all-time list. He missed the entire 2014 season while suspended for his involvement in baseball's Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. During his press conference Tuesday, he repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the Yankees organization for giving him the opportunity to return to the field after the suspension. Facebook Posted!
