Meteorologists said the storms were spawned by an “atmospheric river” bringing moisture from the Pacific Ocean. \nLast week a string of storms triggered a crisis near the Lake Oroville Dam about 100 miles (160 km) northeast of San Francisco, where damage to two spillways prompted an evacuation of more than 100,000 people downstream. \nCalifornia is slowly recovering from five years of drought thanks to several months of unusually wet weather. \nAt least 3 inches (8 cm) of rain fell in many areas, though some received far more, such as the sparsely populated Big Sur region and outside the city of Santa Rosa, which got more than 8 inches (20 cm), the weather officials said. \nThe next heavy storm is expected to hit Northern California this weekend, they added. \n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Additional reporting and Writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by James Dalgleish and Clarence Fernandez) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:34:24.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
