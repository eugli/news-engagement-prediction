She's bent over and exhausted and crippled and can't breathe.\"\nSmall number of patients helped The government isn't providing blanket coverage of the pricey Duodopa medication, but will cover the drug \"on an exceptional basis,\" for the small number of patients for whom other treatments don't work, said B.C. Health Minister Terry Lake in a release.\nPhysicians at the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre at the University of B.C. will identify suitable patients and submit requests for coverage under the ministry's \"special authority\" program, according to a news release.\nThe Ministry of Health was unable to provide any further information about how patients would be selected or prioritized for coverage.\nThe government is also in discussions with the manufacturer, AbbVie , to explore ways to make the drug more affordable and plans to review Duodopa's use compared to other treatments.\nIt's an important win for Wood's family in its fight against a disease that's taken a physical, emotional and financial toll.\n\"I'm glad that we were all annoying enough that the government decided to just do it.\"\nWith files from Liz McArthur", "external_links": ["http://www.abbvie.ca/?trackingSelection=Yes", "http://parkinsons.ubc.ca/wp/", "https://twitter.com/lizziepetra?lang=en"], "published": "2017-02-14T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:46:35.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
