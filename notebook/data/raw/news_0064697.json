Article continues below \nApparently, The Architect has been either reading or watching Chuck Palahniuk’s Fight Club during his time out of the ring because some of these posts contain quotes from the book. \nThe former NXT standout wrote: “Without pain, without sacrifice we would have nothing.

Well, it works both ways.” \nAll of these quotes point to the rapid deterioration of Triple H and his former protege’s relationship as a result of this recent attack. \nMore fuel has been added to the fire as WWE has said that Rollins will be appearing on next week’s Monday Night Raw, although he won’t be competing. \nStill, having the superstar appear and even speak his peace should ensure that fans will be tuning into the company’s flagship program in an effort to figure out what exactly is going on with one of the most popular storylines running right now. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
