IndiaToday.in | Posted by Anvita Singh A + A - Sofia Hayat. Picture courtesy: Instagram/sofiahayat \nSofia Hayat is the new Rakhi Sawant, which translates to this--The woman knows how to stay in news. \nHayat recently posted a picture of her feet on her personal Instagram account. But here is the twist; her feet bore tattoos of the sacred Swastika symbol, which holds importance for especially two religions--Buddhism and Hinduism. \nHave a look: A post shared by Sofia Hayat. (Gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Feb 18, 2017 at 3:47am PST \nHayat uploaded the picture with the caption, \"Ok, so my last photo was me having tattoos on my feet, the sacred swastika found on the feet of BUDDHA the sacred; eternal, self-existence, the star of David, the Islamic moon, universal manifestation, the Sun, Hindu swastika, ancient christian cross, Buddhist, Tibetan, it encompasses the all--the power of the universe at my feet so to at yours, wake up, we are one! \nAlso read: Now, Sofia Hayat is out to support Swami Om's disgusting act \nA symbol is just a symbol and it is the intent that makes the difference. A scalpel in the hands of a surgeon is a tool in his profession that can save a life; while in the hands of a perpetrator is unlawful possession of a weapon, in the eyes of the law, to commit a crime.\" \nRight after she posted the photograph, she started getting a lot of hate for the picture. People wrote saying that they were upset as the picture had hurt their religious sentiments, and some others even abused Hayat for being insensitive.
