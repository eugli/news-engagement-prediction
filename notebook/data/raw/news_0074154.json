They also featured a picture of former President Barack Obama and his daughters with a link to titles in a father/daughter book club. The tweet was published the same day Trump took the oath of office. \n“I can see where the perception that these were politically slanted can be drawn,” Nissler said. \nIn an e-mail to The Post this week, Nissler said it is the “library’s obligation to provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues, and to be a neutral, reliable source.” \n“That is foundational to our mission and it is not an obligation that we take lightly,” Nissler wrote. “We would never want to be perceived as taking sides, or promoting a particular point of view. In this case, I felt that our postings created the perception of bias and I removed them.” \nShe said Rosier didn’t order her to remove the tweets and said neither her job nor the library’s $39 million budget was threatened by county leaders. \nJames LaRue, director of the Chicago-based American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said he wouldn’t have deleted the tweets. \n“I think she would have been right to leave them there,” he said. “I did not find anything objectionable to them — there is nothing there but information pointing to library resources.” \nLaRue, who served 24 years as head of Douglas County Libraries, said the tweets were not partisan in nature but messages focused on topics of the day, albeit topics — Russia, immigration, health, accuracy in reporting — that have generated heated discussion of late. He pointed to one tweet in particular showing a picture of Russian leader Vladimir Putin with the question: “Want to know more about what’s going on with Russia?” \n“That’s quite a jump,” he said of the claim that the tweet is an example of political bias. \nLaRue said he hadn’t heard of libraries in the U.S. removing tweets they posted and said it will be something his office will be keeping an eye on, given libraries’ central role as a bulwark against censorship. While he said he didn’t believe Nissler, who once worked for him, “caved” on the issue by removing the tweets, he called the situation “problematic.” \n“Censorship has to be resisted,” he said. \nNissler said she expects to be criticized for her decision to take down the tweets but said she had to make a judgement call. In hindsight, she said, “it might not have been a bad idea” to more closely examine each tweet to see if some met the test of impartiality and deserved to remain on the library’s Twitter feed. \nThe staffer who posted the tweets had been counseled to be more politically balanced when using the library’s social media accounts, but “has not been instructed to stay away from topical or political issues,” she said. \nAs of the end of last year, Jefferson County Public Library had more than 360,000 cardholders. \nBrian DeLaet, chairman of the library’s board of trustees, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Trustee John Bodnar said he didn’t see the issue of the scrapped tweets as censorship, but more as the library’s director “erring on the side of caution.” \n“The library is an area for dissemination of that information — not for initiation of that information,” he said. \nTwitter has been at the center of a number of recent free-speech controversies and the incident at Jefferson County Public Library is not the first time a public agency has found itself in the cross hairs for its posts. \nIn January, the U.S. Department of the Interior placed a temporary freeze on tweeting from its official accounts after an employee retweeted a pair of posts that appeared to take a jab at Trump on his first day in office. Last week, the Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington, D.C., fired off a string of tweets defending the school from critical comments made by new U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos after a visit. \nBut Jefferson County resident Arist Athanasopoulos said the library is supposed to be an impartial source of information for people of all political stripes. The conservative Republican said he was bothered that no one in the library system noticed the tone of the tweets and that it took a private citizen to bring it to the county’s attention. \nIn an e-mail he sent to the commissioners earlier this month, Athanasopoulos said “partisan politics have no place in a PUBLIC library.” \n“Keeping the community informed about hours, services, special programs or other events are appropriate uses for taxpayer dollars and should be the library’s mission on Twitter,” he said. \nHe wrote that tweets about refugees are not appropriate because the term is often used as a “euphemism to describe individuals who are in this country illegally.” \n“Where are tweets on the other viewpoint on immigration?” he wrote. \nTweets highlighting the “facts are facts” theme are “directly pointed at our current presidential administration,” he said, despite the fact that one of Trump’s closest advisers pushed the much-criticized idea of using “alternative facts” to counter evidence that points the opposite direction. \nHe also characterized the messages the library posted about women’s health care reform as “politically motivated” and a “political statement about abortion.” \nJefferson County commissioner Casey Tighe said his reading of the deleted tweets was that they didn’t represent a good balance of political viewpoints and that it was right for the library to “recalibrate” its Twitter feed. But he defended the library as a place to “engage the public in discussion” and doesn’t want to see it shy away from thorny issues because of this. \n“It’s a difficult balancing act,” Tighe said. “But I don’t want to see the library go into a shell.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:02:24.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
