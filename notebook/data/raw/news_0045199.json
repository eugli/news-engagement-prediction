Parker, his girlfriend and the couple's 4-year-old daughter, who was home during the incident, were not seriously hurt. \nFollowing the break-in, Mebane police contacted the Orange County Sheriff's Office and asked deputies to go to Crockett's home on Virginia Lee Lane in Efland. \nWhen deputies arrived at the home and knocked on the door, an armed man came outside the home and raised the gun at deputies, who opened fire and killed the man. \nThe sheriff's office says the man deputies shot and killed was the same person Mebane police were looking for in the home invasion, although officials did not confirm that Crockett was the man killed. \nThe names of the deputies involved in the shooting have not been released. They have been placed on administrative duty, which is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting. \nOrange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood would not comment on the incident Sunday, saying only that the matter has been turned over to the district attorney's office. \nKyle Dawson, who lives across the street from where the fatal confrontation took place, said his brother was outside at the time of the shooting. \n\"He heard the gunshots, and he came running inside. And the next thing we know, my mom and my brother all run outside trying to see what happened,\" Dawson said.
