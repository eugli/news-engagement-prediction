There's good prices around at the moment. The numbers are starting to line up,\" Mr Wild said. \nHe is aiming to sell the cattle to the live export market through an online auction site. \nThe mickey bulls have been fed on a sorghum-silage, corn and molasses supplement mixture. \nMuch of the feed was sourced from the Top End, with the sorghum grown at the cattle yards and the corn trucked from the Ord Valley. Happy with weight gain \nArriving at the yards at about 220 kilograms, after 90 days the cattle weighed an average of 342kg. \n\"Over the whole trial so far they have put on an average of about 1.34kg per day, but since we have tweaked the ration a bit in the last month, we have seen a gain of 1.51kg a day,\" Mr Wild said. \n\"We are really happy with that. I think that is where it needs to be to make it work. \n\"We have been feeding once a day, usually in the afternoon just to try and control the heat that we run into here.\" Photo: The cattle are being fed a combination of sorghum silage, corn and molasses supplement. (ABC Rural: Daniel Fitzgerald) \nMr Wild said the cattle had to be adjusted to the ration, after previously being fed on native pastures. \n\"We have a starter ration and then progress to an intermediate ration then build up to a finisher ration,\" he said. \n\"It is a gradual process over the first month. That lets their gut change from eating pasture onto this silage-based ration.\" \nMr Wild said it was difficult to feed cattle during the wet season and he wanted to conduct the trail again during the dry season. \n\"It is a juggling act here trying to keep the pens dry, trying to keep the cattle dry, shifting from pen to pen and cleaning out,\" he said. \n\"Definitely during the dry season in the cooler months we should see better weight gains and better performance out of the cattle.\" \nAside from the heat and wet, Mr Wild said birds eating the feed had provided a significant issue for the trial. \n\"The magpie geese and cockatoos have also done 90 days on the rations, so if anyone wants a fat magpie goose please come and see me,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:18:37.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
