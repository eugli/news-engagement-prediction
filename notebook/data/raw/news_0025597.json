Solent News Painter Dave Tooke has received £5,300 in fines for parking his van on his driveway outside his home \nHe moved into the £400,000, three-bed, four years ago and had no problems for the first two. \nBut he’s been told commercial vehicles are not allowed to be parked on the upmarket new build estate even though he has his own space. \nThe 40-year-old even bought a new £11,000 van without any branding on it but he keeps getting hit with parking tickets. Solent News 4 Dave even shelled out £11,000 on a new unbranded van to comply with the rules of the estate which he lives on \nHe even had to go for an ECG heart scan at hospital which he puts down to the stress of his ordeal. \nDave – who lives with wife Claire, 36, and their daughter Rheya, five – said: “When you’ve got a car parking bay you expect to be able to park and maintain a livelihood. \n“It feels like I’m being bullied because I’m a tradesman and don’t fit in with the people round here. \n“They are making sure they don’t get tradesman, we’re the ones who build their houses but we can’t live here and mingle with everyone else. Solent News But the tickets keep coming from the ‘snobby’ estate developers – with Dave receiving one-a-week since Christmas \n“We’ve tried to liaise and reason with them but they won’t reason with us. \n“Each morning I get up before work, go to my van and find a ticket I become overwhelmed with anxiety. \n“These snobby estate developers are picking on me and discriminating me, what kind of place is this if you can’t keep your vehicle on your spot?” 4 Just last month we told how Oliver Smith was refused a home after developers banned him from parking his van there \nHe added: “The first two years were fine, I had a sign-written van at the time and didn’t get any tickets. \n“After two years signs around the street about parking started going up and I got two tickets in a fortnight. \n“I paid the initial two and spent £11,000 for my new van without any signs on only to continue getting tickets. \n“That’s the way it’s been since, sometimes we get tickets once a month, sometimes twice a month, sometimes once a week and sometimes twice a week. Moment a cyclist shamed a white van driver into picking up his litter \n\"Since Christmas just gone I'm getting at least once a week, are they trying to force me out? Without my van I can't pay to live here. \n\"I had to have an ECG because of stress. \n\"We came here to get out of the town and relax with our daughter and bring her up in a nice quiet place. \n\"They would rather have suited office workers with fancy jobs and fancy cars. related stories Petrol giants accused of ruthless £1 billion diesel 'rip-off' scheme hammering hard-pressed families 'YOU WANNA PICK UP YOUR LITTER?'
