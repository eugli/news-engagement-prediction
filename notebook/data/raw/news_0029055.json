It's just whether or not they'd a) work and b) have any chance of actually being implemented given the political firestorm that erupts every time someone so much as mentions the words \"negative gearing\" or \"assets test\". \nWe've listed the pros and cons of some of the top suggestions, along with their likelihood of ever actually happening. Taking mansions into account re: the pension \nPros: \nDid you know you can live in a multimillion dollar beachside manor and still get the age pension? \nThat's because the family home is exempt from the assets test for this payment. \nThis means there's an obvious incentive for retirees to have as much of their wealth tied up in their home as possible... which means they could still be living in a big five-bedroom house when a two-bedder would be more suitable. \nRemoving the family home exemption (or making it only apply to less pricey houses) would get rid of this market distortion and put more of these houses up for sale, which would be a good thing for the younger people who want to buy them. \nCons: \nIt's not grandma's fault that the home she's owned since forever is now worth a fortune. And the whole point of removing the exemption would be to force her to sell up and relocate, essentially. \nSo it's about weighing this up against the fact that the oldies have all the houses ( between 1982 and 2011, home ownership went down for every age group except over 65s ). \nLikelihood of this ever actually happening: \nThe Coalition Government says this would go against its principles . It's not on the agenda for Labor either. Make negative gearing not a thing \nPros: \nA big part of the reason why so many homes are owned by investors is negative gearing. \nBasically, this allows investors to reduce their taxable income if they make a loss on their housing investments. So if they lose $10,000 over the course of a year, they can reduce their taxable income by that same amount. \nIt's pretty clear that getting rid of negative gearing would make investing in property less attractive, which would push down prices and free up more of the market for owner occupiers. \nCons: \nThe justification for negative gearing is that it increases housing supply and keeps the cost of rent down. According to the Grattan Institute, though, these are both myths. \nHowever, what's definite is that getting rid of negative gearing wouldn't be popular with investors ( and one in 10 taxpayers uses negative gearing ). \nLikelihood of this ever actually happening: \nLabor went to the last election with a promise to limit negative gearing to new properties . The Coalition currently has no such plans. Goodbye stamp duty, hello land tax \nPros: \nIf you don't have to pay stamp duty, you're thousands of dollars closer to being able to afford a house (though there are already first home buyer exemptions and/or concessions in all states and territories except Tasmania). \nStamp duty also makes the market less efficient by discouraging existing owners from moving house. So parents whose children have moved out might choose to hold onto their bigger home instead of getting a smaller one. \nIf stamp duty was replaced with a land tax, that would also encourage people who own empty plots of land to get a move on with their developments. \nAnd there's another advantage to getting rid of stamp duty: in 2015, the Treasury released a paper which singled out stamp duty as the least efficient tax in Australia (that hypothetical land tax, meanwhile, would the most efficient and actually contribute to economic growth). \nCons: \nStamp duty is a big revenue raiser for the states, so they'd need to make up the shortfall somehow (again, a land tax seems the most likely contender). \nLikelihood of this ever actually happening:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:35:16.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
