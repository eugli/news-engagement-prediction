More Jamie Lynn Spears' 8-year-old daughter, Maddie, was involved in a scary ATV accident on her family's Louisiana property Sunday afternoon. Currently still hospitalized, Maddie is in critical but stable condition. Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards issued a statement that gave a detailed account of what happened after initial reports said the accident occurred on a hunting trip. According to Edwards, though, it happened on the family property as Spears and her husband, Jamie Watson (Maddie's stepfather), were watching. As Maddie was driving an ATV, she attempted to avoid running over a drainage ditch and \"in doing so, she overcorrected causing the ATV to enter the pond,\" the report reads, according to People. \"The ATV and child were instantly submerged in the water right before their eyes. \"Within seconds the child's mother, step-father and other family members reached the pond, dove in and attempted to rescue the child to no avail,\" the report continues. \"The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV's safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.\" Spears has yet to release her own statement, but her father, Jamie, told ET, \"All I can say is pray for our baby Maddie.\" Along with Jamie Lynn's father's request, the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office asks for fans to keep Spears' family in their prayers and respect their privacy as Maddie continues to recover in the hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:46:45.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
