The answer wasn’t pretty. So we reached out to some of the foreign-born talents who have shaped the world of beauty. They opened up to us about growing up in another land and how they define the American dream. We're going to feature one of their incredible stories every day for the next week. Today we're talking to makeup artist to the stars Nick Barose.

His clients now include Lupita Nyong'o , Tracee Ellis Ross, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw . Birth country: Thailand Arrived in the U.S.: 1992 “When I first started doing makeup, I loved reading Kevyn Aucoin’s column in Allure , and an American friend told me I should try to get in touch with him. He helped me write a big letter: ‘I love your work, I love your column, and I would love the opportunity to assist you.’ And then I got a phone call from one of Kevyn’s assistants and they booked me to help backstage at Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, DKNY—I was an amateur, and all of a sudden I had all of these shows on my schedule. “I’ve been here for almost 25 years now, and just recently became a citizen. It was a little hard at first because I originally came as a student and then after that I was here illegally, which meant I couldn’t go home and come back. Those years were really tough because I couldn’t see my family. I didn’t go home for my grandmother’s funeral or my older sister’s wedding. But I eventually got my green card with the help of my friend Gilbert King (who happens to be a Pulitzer-winning writer, so my letter was amazing!) and other American friends. From there, I got my citizenship. I’ve been a lot luckier than most because I had support from a lot of people, and of course, a lot of luck. “It’s weird because, you know, I still feel like a foreigner. Sometimes I forget and I have to look at my passport again. I guess there’s that feeling when you’re from another culture entirely—it will always be where you’re from. But I’m proud to be an American and proud to bring something to the table. I’m still very in touch with my culture. It’s influenced my work a lot and to be able to have that as a background—it made me feel special. I never felt like where I was from was a minus. I always saw it as a plus. I have something different to offer. I’m from a culture with a long history of art and literature, and it shows in my use of colors. We had a lot of land growing up outside of Bangkok, and we had exotic birds roaming in the backyard—beautiful peacocks and pheasants and colorful animals—it’s influenced my sense of color. That’s something I always refer back to.
