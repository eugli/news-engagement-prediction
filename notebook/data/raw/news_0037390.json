A Radically Normal Location February 15, 2017 9:39 PM by Madeleine Luckel Yeezy Season 4 Ready-to-Wear Photographed by Driely S Where was today's Yeezy show? This afternoon, Kanye West debuted his Yeezy Season 5 collection . The designer's wife, Kim Kardashian West , arrived on scene in a head-to-toe maroon ensemble , which helped show off her Cher inspired-hair . But even Kim's look was quickly overshadowed by what was seen on the runway itself. Denim was included in a Yeezy collection for the first time, model Halima Aden walked the runway in a hijab, and new Yeezy sneakers made their debut. But what was the most radical aspect of the show? It dispensed from Yeezy's usual gargantuan, and often trying, locations. What exactly do we mean? The show took place at Pier 59 Studios , a mainstay location during New York Fashion Week, and throughout the year for both editorial and advertising shoots. Just earlier today, Delpozo showed it's Fall 2017 collection at the pier. But past Yeezy collections have been shown at locations that have been anything but previously used. West's Season 4 show took place at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park (in the grueling heat), while his Season 3 was staged at Madison Square Garden. Spectacles, yes, but also fodder for some spectacular complaints. Perhaps this year, the post-show chatter will be focused solely on the clothes.
