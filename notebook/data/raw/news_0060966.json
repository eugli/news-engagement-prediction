Australia, on the other hand, were handed a series defeat by South Africa down under before drastic changes in the batting line-up brought about four successive wins on the trot including three against Pakistan. ( Nathan Lyon rubbishes Harbhajan Singh's claims, says Australia will compete hard with India ) \nHowever, Kohli, riding high on a successful home season, said his mantra was to focus on his own team's strengths. \n\"We tend to focus on our game. We respect every team but we focus on our skills and qualities,\" Kohli told the media on the eve of the opening Test. ( Virat Kohli won his battles against Joe Root, can he trump Steve Smith? ) \nThe 28-year-old captain, who became the first batsman in history to slam four successive double hundreds, said he was aware of the threats Australia possess but he reiterated that his players would not be bogged down after whitewashing New Zealand 3-0, blanking England 4-0 and crushing Bangladesh in the one-off Test in Hyderabad. \n\"We are aware of their skills, positive and negative points. But we are not bothered about the opposition too much,\" Kohli said. \"Every match is challenging, every series is challenging. All teams we play are of good quality.\" ( Five India vs Australia controversies that shook the cricketing world ) \nIn fact, Kohli had said after the win over Bangladesh that India thought that the England series was the biggest challenge this season. But Australia have two of the most dangerous batsmen in world cricket - Steve Smith and David Warner - in their line-up and their spinners, led by a wily Nathan Lyon, could ask some questions in helpful conditions. ( Aussies just don't have the arsenal to walk the 'sledging' talk ) \nThe pitch in Pune appeared tailor-made to suit the spinners and it is expected to take turn from the first day.
