(Sanjeev Verma / HT Phot o) \nA female foetus was found wrapped in a newspaper inside a dustbin of an upscale residential complex in Gurgaon, police said on Tuesday. \nThe incident was reported on Monday evening from the 18th floor of A-2 tower of World Spa-East in Sector 41. \nRajinder Singh Rana, who provides security in the condominium, lodged a complaint with the police after his staff informed him about the foetus that was found by a cleaning staff. \n“I informed the matter to the police, who reached the spot and took the foetus in possession. We will cooperate with the investigation and provide CCTV footage to the police,” said Rana. \nThe police have filed a case and have asked the security agency to provide relevant CCTV camera footage of the floor and the building. \nA post mortem on the foetus was carried on Tuesday and the medical team confirmed that the foetus was not aborted clinically. Dr Deepak Mathur, who conducted the post-mortem, said the foetus is of about a four-month-old baby girl.

For that forensic tests are required,” Dr Mathur said. \nSudhir Kumar, station house officer at Sector 40 police station, said the police have sought details of the CCTV footage and it might take a day as the security agency has to follow certain official procedures. \nIn another incident, a less than five-month-old unborn baby boy was found in the women’s toilet near the gynaecology OPD of a Delhi government hospital in South Delhi’s Malviya Nagar on Monday afternoon. \nAt least 10 women die every day after undergoing unsafe abortions in India, where an estimated 6.8 million of them choose methods to terminate pregnancies that threaten their health and life. \nIndia’s Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act legalises abortions up to 20 weeks if there is a threat to the mother’s life or her physical or mental health, or if the unborn baby has abnormalities. \nHowever, many women end up using unsafe methods because they don’t know where or who to go. Many don’t even know it’s legal to abort up to 20 weeks. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:17.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
