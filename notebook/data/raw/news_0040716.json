The project would complement the $40 million White River flood wall, which already has been completed from Broad Ripple to near Illinois Street.\nCity officials hope the financial commitment, which was introduced Tuesday during a Rocky Ripple Town Council meeting, will spur the state and nearby Butler University to contribute money as well. The city plans to work with Rocky Ripple residents to determine what kind of barrier they want.\n\"We would contemplate enclosing all of the land developing a locally funded, locally designed, engineered and built project that provides a level of protection for Rocky Ripple that either lowers or eliminates their need to have flood insurance,\" said Jeff Bennett, the city's deputy mayor of community development.\nRocky Ripple is a community of more than 300 homes that sit perilously between the flood-prone White River and the canal near 52nd Street. Residents there have been anxious since December 2015 when former mayor Greg Ballard chose a final phase of the White River flood wall that would veer east of the canal and offer no protection for Rocky Ripple.\nWithout a wall, Rocky Ripple residents face perpetually skyrocketing flood insurance — which can cost thousands of dollars per year — as well as the threat that a 100-year flood could bury the community. A river level exceeding 17 feet would put Rocky Ripple under water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The river has risen as high as 20 feet in 1913 and more recently hit 15 feet in 1990 and 14 feet in 2005.\nRocky Ripple in 1996 opposed a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plan to expand the flood wall around the town because residents feared it would obstruct their views of the water. But many residents have changed their minds, calling on Mayor Joe Hogsett to overturn Ballard's 2015 decision to leave Rocky Ripple out of the flood wall plan. They want the city to select a different Army Corps option that would include protection for Rocky Ripple.\nThe final phase of the Army Corps flood wall is set to be built on Westfield Boulevard, east of the Central Canal Towpath, from Capitol Avenue to Butler University. Although construction has yet to begin, city officials say there's no turning back because the city would lose federal money that already has been approved to complete the project.\nBut city officials think they can satisfy Rocky Ripple residents' concerns with a separate project.\n\"We've been making a consistent commitment to them that simply ignoring the flood issues in Rocky Ripple is not an option that the mayor was going to tolerate,\" Hogsett's chief of staff, Thomas Cook, said.\nThe city plans to use $10 million from its stormwater fund to help pay for a project that could cost up to $40 million.\nCarla Gaff-Clark, president of the Rocky Ripple Town Council, said she hopes residents can get behind the city's proposal.\n\"Some people think if we could stop the wall on the canal, we could use that money, but that's not the way it works,\" she said. \"We're just trying to get people to stop focusing on that little wall on the canal and start focusing on the river and what we can do for flood control for us, and have our project.\"\nThe city has a probable partner in Butler University, which sits east of Rocky Ripple and owns 75 acres of land adjacent to the community. Butler has expressed interest in participating in a flood protection project but has not made any financial commitments, said Bruce Arick, Butler's vice president of finance and administration.\nButler's land near Rocky Ripple consists primarily of athletics fields. But if the property became safe from flooding, that would open up new development opportunities for a university that has little room left to grow elsewhere.\n\"Do we have immediate plans? No,\" Arick said. \"But when you think about a university, we're going to be here for a long time. If an opportunity presented itself where there was going to be a project that would provide the appropriate level of flood protection that would make that property available for expansion, it certainly would be attractive for us to consider.\"\nButler in 2015 joined several neighborhoods in opposing the final phase of the White River flood wall because it would cut through Holcomb Gardens. The university's position is unchanged, Arick said, but he added Butler could still support a separate Rocky Ripple project.\nState support also is being proposed by Democrats in the Republican-dominated Indiana House of Representatives. State Rep. Gregory Porter, an Indianapolis Democrat who represents Rocky Ripple, has introduced legislation that would divert money from the Hoosier Lottery into a fund to pay for a flood protection project.\nThat proposal \"has a long way to go,\" Porter said.\n\"It may take a year,\" he said. \"It may take two years, it may take three years. But we need to just have the conversation and move forward.\"\nThe city is expecting at least a five-year process to plan and complete a project for Rocky Ripple. The city will work on finding more money to build the project and meet with Rocky Rocky Ripple residents to determine how to offer maximum flood protection while building a minimally invasive wall or levee.\n\"There was really nothing in the conversation a year ago that provided any level of protection to Rocky Ripple,\" Bennett, the deputy mayor, said. \"So, to get to a point where we think it's not only feasible from an engineering standpoint, but more feasible economically than it's ever been because of potential participants, it seems like we have a pretty clear path for next steps.\"\nIndyStar reporter John Tuohy contributed to this story.
