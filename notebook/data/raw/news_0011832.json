Share via Twitter Gary Gershoff/WireImage/Getty Images At this point, Gisele B√ºndchen is somewhat of a pro when it comes to the Super Bowls. After all, this is her husband Tom Brady 's seventh Super Bowl‚Äîa record he's the first to set as a quarterback. So it might not be surprising that B√ºndchen came well prepared for Super Bowl LI. This year, she wore her heart on her sleeve in a custom jersey that was emblazoned with crystals spelling out her husband's initials. It also read \"Brady's Ladies.\" As that caption suggests, Gisele B√ºndchen wasn't the only one to wear the jersey‚Äîshe also had copies made for her family and friends. \"We are ready!,\" B√ºndchen wrote in a caption alongside the photo she posted to Instagram. \"Let's go @tombrady !! Let's go Pats!!\" While some of her friends slipped on the jersey over another shirt, the group effort doesn't seem like a last-minute plan. Aside from having the jerseys made ahead of time, it appears that B√ºndchen and her loved ones coordinated the rest of their outfits as well, opting for jeans and flashy sneakers. B√ºndchen also offered a closer look at the bedazzled jerseys‚Äîwhich apparently were further customized for the kids who wore them, including her daughter Vivian Lake Brady. Her jersey read \"Brady's Little Ladies.\"\"Bom dia!,\" B√ºndchen wrote. \"Game day! #superbowl #daddyslittlegirl ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üèà\" See B√ºndchen's Super Bowl style Instagram posts below.
