He added that four additional teams had been formed on an emergency basis to vaccinate the ailing birds. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Monday, February 27, 2017 - 21:10 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:38:35.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
