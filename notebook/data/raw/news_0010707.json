'Impossible targets a waste of time' \nHaving signed four players last summer, United did not buy anyone during the January transfer window - but Mourinho has identified the men he wants in the summer. \nIn recent seasons, United have become embroiled in negotiations with Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and forward Gareth Bale, and midfielder Cesc Fabregas when he was at Barcelona, but the Mourinho says he will not chase \"impossible\" transfers. \n\"I know what I want and I am very realistic,\" said the Portuguese. \"I know what are the impossible targets and I don't like my club to participate in them. \n\"It is a waste of time. It is a gift to the agents to help them improve their situation.\" Atletico Madrid and France forward Antoine Griezmann has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in summer Analysis \nSimon Stone, BBC Sport \nGiven they have been in sixth place since early November, there is a real possibility that United will fail to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive year. \nThat would cost them more than £20m in sponsorship income due to a clause in their £750m, 10-year deal with Adidas, but is unlikely to impact on their ability to attract top-class players because of Mourinho's reputation and the club's ability to pay top salaries. \nMourinho's priorities will be to bring in at least one \"game-changing forward\" and bolster his defence significantly. \nAtletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann has been heavily linked, although United officials have played down a story from France that personal terms with the 25-year-old have already been agreed. \nA formal move for Benfica's Victor Lindelof is anticipated after United ruled out a January move for the 22-year-old Sweden defender due to his near £40m buyout clause. \nMonaco defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is also of interest to Mourinho, with England winger Ashley Young and Schweinsteiger top of the list of likely departures.
