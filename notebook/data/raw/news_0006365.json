He said he would have no objection to more timely donation reforms and said it was a matter for the joint standing committee on electoral matters (Jscem), which is examining political donations . \n“Obviously in the 21st century, just as with parliamentarians’ expenses, the closer, the more timely any matter of public importance, any public information, that can be disclosed more promptly – or in as close to real time as possible – should be. \n“I’ve got no doubt that’s one of the matters they will be looking at.” \nHowever, when asked whether he would disclose his own donations to the Liberal party ahead of the February 2018 disclosure, Turnbull declined. \n“My donations to the Liberal party have been regular and generous and I would encourage others to do the same,” he said. \nA Guardian analysis has found that, of the total income received by the Liberal, National, Labor and Greens parties, the origin of a substantial proportion is unknown. For the Liberal party, it is more than half of their total receipts. \nParties are only required to declare details of donations or payments over $13,000, so for payments under the threshold the name of the donor or source of the payment is unknown. Parties are, however, required to declare the total amount they receive in the financial year, which is the total of all payments regardless of the amount. \nFor the Liberal party, 57.2% of their total income had no source, followed by 41.5% for the Greens, 40.1% for Labor and 33.5% for the National party. \nAveraged out across those four major parties, this means voters have no idea of the source of close to half (47.7%) of their income. chart \nWhile Jscem is expected to report back to parliament in March, Labor has committed to a range of reforms. \nLabor’s policy would reduce the donation disclosure limit from $13,200 (indexed) to a fixed $1,000, ban foreign donations, ban donation splitting (to keep under the limit), ban anonymous donations above $50, link public funding to campaign expenditure and introduce new offences and tougher penalties for abuses the system. Political donations 2015-16: search the declarations by Australian parties Read more \nThe Greens senator Lee Rhiannon urged real time disclosure of donations and payments as well as a lower disclosure limit. She said the most recent disclosures show the total amount of declared donations and payments made to Australian political parties since 1998 had topped $1bn. \n“More transparency is absolutely needed but it does not stop the cosy relationship between vested interests and political parties,” she said. “Only bans and strict caps on donations and election expenditure will achieve that. \n“Transparency alone will not stop the Parakeelia spin cycle, it won’t stop resource companies sending millions to the major parties and it won’t cork the flow of money for influence from other vested interests.” Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:43:59.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
