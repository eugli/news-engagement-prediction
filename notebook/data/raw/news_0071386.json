They are the nasty party.”\nHe said Labour would demand Chancellor Philip Hammond reverses the decision ahead of the Budget on March 6th. \nBut George Freeman, who leads the Tory policy committee, said: “The truth on the disability budget is that we spend £50bn a year on disability benefits and what we’re trying to do is make sure we’re getting them to the right people who are most in need.\nRead More Tory cuts are seizing 800 vital Motability cars a WEEK from disabled people “He didn’t mention these tweaks are actually to do with rolling back some bizarre decisions through the tribunals that now mean benefits are given to people who take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety. We want to get the money to the really disabled people who need it.”\n“Anxiety is a very serious mental health condition and actually can stop people from working.”\nHe said: “I totally understand anxiety, and so does the Prime Minister. We set out in the mental health strategy how seriously we take it.”\nFreeman later tweeted that he had suffered from anxiety as a child, insisting he didn’t “need any lectures on the damage anxiety does.”\nThere are two types of PIP - the \"daily living\" element and the \"mobility\" element.\nDisabled people are assessed for each type by totting up their circumstances under a 'points' system, where 8 points get a basic rate and 12 points an enhanced rate.\n(Photo: Getty) The first tribunal said more points should be available in the \"mobility\" element for people who suffer \"overwhelming psychological distress\" when travelling alone.\nThat would have handed new money to 143,000 people who previously received nothing for the mobility element of PIP.\nHalf of them would have received the enhanced rate of £57.45 a week, and the other half the standard rate of £21.80 a week, the DWP said.\nAnother 21,000 people would have moved from the standard to the enhanced rate, giving them an extra £35.65 a week.\nThe second tribunal recommended more points in the \"daily living\" element for people who need help to take medication and monitor a health condition. This would have affected just over 1,000 people, a DWP impact assessment said.\nWe’re going back to Victorian times, where disabled people were hidden away: My Wigan Pier story \nThe DWP said together, making these changes would have cost taxpayers £560m in 2017/18, £650m in 2018/19, £760m in 2019/20, £830m in 2020/21, and £910m in 2021/22.\nMs Mordaunt told MPs in a written statement: \"If not urgently addressed, the operational complexities could undermine the consistency of assessments, leading to confusion for all those using the legislation, including claimants, assessors, and the courts.\n\"It is because of the urgency caused by these challenges, and the implications on public expenditure, that proposals for these amendments have not been referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee before making the regulations.\"\n  Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics   Comments Show more comments More On Labour Party Conservative Party BBC Department for Work and Pensions John Pienaar George Freeman Philip Hammond John McDonnell Patrick McLoughlin Government cuts Pensions strike Mental health Disability Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:06:06.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
