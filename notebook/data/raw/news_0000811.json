Story continues below \nPolice said over the course of the investigation, the investigator obtained evidence to support criminal charges against House. \n“We are a non-profit organization so the budget that we have to work with as all other non-profit organizations is pretty small and regarding the charges, one of which was theft over $5,000, obviously for a small non-profit organization that does affect our centre,” Kaminski added. \nHouse is facing several fraud charges including fraud over $5,000 and theft over $5,000. \nHouse was arrested Friday evening and appeared in provincial court Monday afternoon. \nLawyers agreed to her release, provided she not be present at the Regina Sexual Assault Centre among other conditions. House agreed to the conditions. \nHouse is scheduled to make her next appearance on Feb. 27. \nRSAC has fired House from her position with the organization. The centre remained fully operational. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
