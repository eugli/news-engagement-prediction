He was shouted out in host Jimmy Kimmel’s opening monologue. \n\"If you win tonight, you can expect your Oscar to arrive in two to five business days,\" Kimmel said. Good one, honestly. Better than Kimmel’s cracks about how almost no one has seen Moonlight , which came right after an extended bit about his 2006 faux-feud with Matt Damon. This segment of the awards show is typically dedicated to roasting well-known actors and directors, so it was a little odd to see a tech CEO and streaming service shouted out by the host. \nAmazon is the first streaming service to receive an Academy Award nomination— edging out Netflix , which campaigned aggressively for Beasts of No Nation last year to no avail. \nCongratulations to Jeff, who seems to be having a great time, and now joins the proud ranks of actors and directors who get tepid roasts while everybody pretends the Oscars are daring.\nIn this Storystream Oscars 2017: All the news, drama, and politics from the 89th Academy Awards Jeff Bezos gets a shout-out in the Oscars opening monologue Oscars 2017: All of the winners from the 89th Academy Awards View all 15 stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:06:53.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
