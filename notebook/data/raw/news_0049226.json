Houston Police swarmed the area after hearing reports of an active shooter on the campus.\nHouston police were searching floor by floor at Ben Taub Hospital after responding to multiple reports of shots fired at Ben Taub hospital Tuesday afternoon.\nAlthough an early report indicated a shooter had been cornered on a floor of the hospital, Acevedo said that no evidence had yet been found of an active shooter or shooting.\nAcevedo said no victims have been located and that the police have searched every floor at least once. SWAT teams and K-9 units were doing a second, more thorough, check, he said.\n\"All patients and employees are safe at this point,\" Acevedo said.\nMedical providers hid inside their offices at Ben Taub Hospital as Houston police responded to reports of shots fired inside the building. Others barricaded themselves in other areas of the hospital.\nReports started coming in about 2 p.m. of shots fired, Houston police spokesman Kese Smith said.\nPatients in the Emergency Room told the Chronicle that hospital staff originally said the flurry of action was part of a drill but then began disconnecting patients from their IVs. Images showed nurses and others bringing patients outside on hospital beds and gurneys.\nMore patrol units as well as members of the SWAT team were en route at 2:15 p.m. Police Chief Art Acevedo was at the scene.\nTexas Southern University student Pegah Nassiri was working the second day of her job when she heard staff announce a \"code white\" over the hospital's loud speaker.\n\"I didn't know what code white meant, but we knew we needed to lock ourselves in a room,\" Nassiri said.\nShe said she and another student stayed locked in a first floor room for 15 minutes before police found them and told them to get out.\nSt. Marks Episcopal School in Bellaire posted on Twitter about an hour before the shooting a picture of fifth grade students holding up paintings and posing with hospital staff. The school would not answer a reporter's questions about whether the students were still at the hospital and if they were safe.\nBaylor College of Medicine's security department issued an emergency notification of an \"active shooter situation\" about 2:15 p.m. The notification instructed college employees not to go to Ben Taub and ordered those already there to follow emergency response guidelines.\nThe last shooting at Ben Taub happened in October 2016, when an officer shot an inmate who had taken a medical student hostage.\nRicky Hall, 46, was facing a parole violation and a host of new charges when he was shot by a sheriff's deputy after he took up an \"edged weapon,\" according to Chronicle archives.\nDays before his violent outburst, Hall - who struggled with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, his mother said - was taken to the hospital for treatment of seizures. Hall ultimately died from his wounds.\nCheck back for more details on this developing story.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:52:15.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
