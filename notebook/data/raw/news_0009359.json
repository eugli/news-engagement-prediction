The case grows ever stronger for an independent commission to investigate Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election,\" he added.\nMother Jones' David Corn added separately, \"This is crazy. The FSB, according to our own intelligence community, plotted to subvert the 2016 election. Now it is rewarded.\"\nHe added, \"Dems should go ballistic over this. So should McCain, Graham & Rubio & anyone who gives a damn about the sanctity of American democracy.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Khizr Khan warns resisters: Get violent and Trump will 'deal with' you \"They will incite violence so that they can claim then that we have to deal with it with force.\"\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/02/17 9:24 PM \"[N]ot even pretending that russian [sic] doens't [sic] own us at this point,\" said Genius senior writer Insanul Ahmed .\nBlogger Keith Olbermann , of course, weighed in with his usual bluster, saying \"The FSB is the Russian spy agency. You know, the one [Trump] claims he's not working for or being blackmailed by #Disloyal.\"\nEtcetera , etcetera .\nBefore these hot takes had a chance to cool, however, NBC's Alexander tweeted out a rather important follow-up to his initial supposed scoop: \"NEW: Source familiar w sanctions says it's a technical fix, planned under Obama, to avoid unintended consequences of cybersanctions.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Senate Democrat: Obstructionism is a 'trap' and 'a big mistake' Democrats \"can't fall into the exact same trap that I criticized Republicans for falling into.\"\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/02/17 9:17 PM Oh.\nFirst, as noted elsewhere by the New York Times' Peter Baker, the proposed fix was in the works long before Trump took office.\n\"Treasury action on Russian sanctions was a technical fix initiated by career officials when Obama was still in office, not a Trump move,\" he said .\nSecond, the actual explanation for what happened is far more complicated and far less nefarious.\nEric Lorber, who is a consultant for the Financial Integrity Network, explains the boring details.\nSome analysis from my colleague @ELforeignpolicy on the new Treasury General License re: FSB pic.twitter.com/z7sMZKSvWv — Boris Zilberman (@rolltidebmz) February 2, 2017 \nPut more plainly, the fix is to, \"facilitate what is otherwise permissible exports of tech goods to Russia.\"\nStop the presses indeed.\nThough certain reporters and experts stepped forward to explain the facts of the matter, bitters partisans, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, seized on the idea that Trump had somehow \"repaid\" Russian President Vladimir Putin quickly.\nVladimir Putin's thugs meddle with an American election, and President Trump gives them a thank you present. https://t.co/ID01aS21nM pic.twitter.com/vAiGYWNbIu — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 2, 2017 \nNow it's the narrative.
