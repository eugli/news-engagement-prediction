(Video courtesy: Seven News) More videos Preferences for Pauline angers Joyce \nDeputy PM Barnaby Joyce isn't happy the WA Liberal Party is preferencing One Nation over the Nationals but Pauline Hanson says her party is a force that can't be ignored. \nIt's fair to ask why the Liberals would carry this abandonment of the party that's allowing them to govern while knowing that it only takes one disgruntled Nats-aligned MP to cross the floor and the government no longer has a majority. \nHowever, the answer – blind terror of being ousted in WA – means that survival takes precedence over trivial matters like \"legislating anything at all after giving One Nation the balance of power\". That, after all, is a problem for after the election. SHARE Dignity. Quiet dignity. Photo: Andrew Meares \nNow, let's keep this in perspective: \"preference deal\" means the order on those how to vote cards handed out at polling stations. And the Liberal-National Coalition has been characterised of late by both sides making clear how much contempt they have for each other. \nThere was the gleeful extortion the Nationals made in their deal with the new PM when Turnbull rolled Tony Abbott, locking the government into unpopular policies like no action on climate change and no movement on marriage equality. Advertisement \nAnd the Libs returned the respect in November when Attorney-General George Brandis showed just how much the Liberals valued their colleagues by describing the Queensland Liberal National Party as \"not very good\" and \"very very mediocre\", before adding that \"I think there might be a revisiting of things\" regarding the merger of the two parties in Queensland. \nStill, preferencing the party currently outpolling the Nationals on their home turf is a new level of naked aggression from the Libs, and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has made clear how hurt he is by the decision . \"When you step away from [the Liberal-National deal], there's one thing you can absolutely be assured of is that we are going to be in opposition,\" he snarled to reporters. \nHowever, federal government figures are talking about how great an idea it is, because that wound isn't going to salt itself. \n\"The One Nation of today is a very different beast to what it was 20 years ago,\" federal Industry Minister Arthur Sinodinos told the ABC on Sunday with a straight face. \"They're a lot more sophisticated … Our job is to treat them as any other party.\" \nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo was also determined to pretend aligning with conspiracy theorists and \" sovereign citizens \" made perfect sense on Monday morning. \n\"If you look at, for example, how Pauline Hanson's gone about putting her support in the Senate, you'll see that she's often voting in favour of government legislation,\" he hedged. \"There's a certain amount of economic rationalism, a certain amount of approach that's reflective of what it is we are trying to do to govern Australia in a fiscally responsible way.\" \nNow, it's reassuring that Arthur Sinodinos can remember what One Nation were like 20 years ago, given his forgetfulness in his testimony before the Independent Commission Against Corruption. \nBut Sinodinos is right about them being more sophisticated. Why, Pauline Hanson used to manipulate bigots by pretending that we're at risk of being \"swamped by Asians\" - now she manipulates bigots by pretending we're at risk of being \"swamped by Muslims\" . \nSo yeah, Artie: they're a totally different beast. Well observed, buddy! \nWhat other things would the Liberals now be tacitly supporting in a preference deal?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:43:19.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
