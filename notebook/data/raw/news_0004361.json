Adams, who competed for JoJo Fletcher's heart on last season of The Bachelorette , was a guest on Vinny Ventiera's Wrong Reasons podcast on Thursday, when he was asked about fan favorite Rachel Lindsay possibly becoming the next Bachelorette. However, Adams wasn't convinced that the gorgeous lawyer from Dallas, Texas, will be next season's star. He cited producers ultimately choosing JoJo Fletcher to be the season 12 Bachelorette instead of Caila Quinn , who's half Filipino.

Regardless of the diversity issue, it might've just been they didn't really love her personality or persona. But when they found out it was JoJo, it was like, people were very excited about that.\" \"I think the franchise wants to so badly break out of its cookie-cutter, white person shell, but I don't think that America will embrace it, sadly enough,\" he added. \"And I think what they're going to do is it will be misdirection. I think it's going to be ... Rachel, and then at the last second, they're gonna have [ Bachelor villain] Corinne.\" Chase McNary -- who also competed for Fletcher's heart last season -- appeared alongside Wells on the podcast on Thursday. He agreed that producers would ultimately go for controversial Bachelor breakout star Corinne Olympios instead of Rachel. \"Smoke and mirrors ... they want everyone to think, 'Oh, this black girl is finishing pretty late on,' and they've never had a black Bachelorette -- that might be the direction they're going to go,\" McNary said. \"It's the direction they have to go. But then, 'Holy s **t, Donald Trump's the president, and Corinne's the Bachelorette? What's the world going to do?'\" WATCH: EXCLUSIVE -- 'Bachelor' Villain Corinne's Friend Claudia Oshry Explains Engagement Ring Pic Meanwhile, this season's Bachelor, Nick Viall, certainly appears to be completely smitten with Rachel. ET spoke to him in October, as he took 31-year-old Rachel for a romantic one-on-one date in New Orleans, and he confirmed that she's been \"a frontrunner since day one.\" \"I love a woman who knows how to have a great conversation and just have a strong personality and a great smile,\" Viall gushed about Rachel, who received the coveted first impression rose. \"She certainly has all of those.\" Watch below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:36:53.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
