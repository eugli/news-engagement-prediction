The Crafter is a nine-seat van available in two variants: \nThe Crafter 35M measures 5905mm long x 1933mm wide x 2415mm tall, with a 3665mm wheelbase. Price is P2.5 million. \nThe larger 35L stretches to 6940mm long x 1993mm wide to a roof-scraping 2705mm, on a 4325mm wheebase. That one goes for P3 million. \nThe Crafter is powered by a 2.0-liter twin-turbo diesel with 163hp and 400Nm. It mates to a six-speed manual transmission. Given the manual tranny and the vanâ€™s size, maneuvering and parking the Crafter is probably best left to a chauffeur. \nFeatures include panoramic windows, multiple-vent aircon, power sliding door and leatherette seats. Safety features include ABS brakes, Electronic Stabilization Program and traction control.
