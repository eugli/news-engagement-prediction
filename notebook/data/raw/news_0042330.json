He also pledged to “do something over the next couple of days” to address the immigration order that has been blocked in the courts. Said Trump: “We don’t give up, we never give up.” \nWATCH: Trump discusses travel ban ruling, reads statute supporting own view \nInsisting he was the victim of false reporting, Trump said his White House was running “so smoothly” and that he “inherited one big mess.” The president has been trying refocus after reports of disarray and dysfunction within his administration. \nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One before the rally, Trump said he was holding a campaign rally because “life is a campaign.” \n“To make America great again is absolutely a campaign,” he said. “It’s not easy, especially when we’re also fighting the press.” \nWATCH: I want to speak to you without dishonest media: Trump to supporters Story continues below \nAnd he’s also had to contend with crowds of protesters. Thousands of them were out on the streets of Dallas and Los Angeles to oppose immigration enforcement raids and to support immigrants and refugees generally. In Los Angeles, an organizer urged local authorities not to spend money on immigration enforcement. \nTrump, who held a rally in the same spot in Florida in September, clearly relished being back in front of his supporters, welcoming the cheers and letting one supporter up on stage to offer praise for the president. He also enjoyed reliving his surprise victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nThe event had the familiar trappings of a Trump campaign rally, including red Trump caps, “Make America Great Again” and “Trump/Pence” signs and at least one sign reading “Hillary for Prison.” Some of the speakers ahead of Trump’s appearance called for repealing and replacing President Barack Obama’s health care law, criticized the news media or lobbed barbs at Clinton, other constants of last year’s rallies. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump slips back into campaign comfort zone with Florida rally \nThe music playlist preceding Trump’s appearance included rally favourites like Free’s “All Right Now.” As Air Force One rolled up to the hangar, the theme to the Harrison Ford movie “Air Force One” signalled its arrival. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, appeared as Lee Greenwood’s “Proud to be an American” played. And his 45-minute remarks were followed by another 2016 campaign favourite, the 1969 hit “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” by the Rolling Stones. \nThe rally came during Trump’s third straight weekend at his private south Florida club, Mar-a-Lago. It was another working weekend for the president, who planned to interview at least four potential candidates for the job of national security adviser, a position unexpectedly open after retired Gen. Michael Flynn’s firing early this week. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump says Michael Flynn didn’t do anything wrong, asked for resignation over statements to VP Pence \nTrump said Saturday “I have many, many that want the job, they want to really be a part of it. I’ll make a decision over the next couple of days.” \nScheduled to discuss the job with the president were his acting adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster; and the superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the four interviews were expected to take place Sunday at the private estate. \nFinding a new national security adviser was proving to be a challenge for Trump. His first choice, retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, turned down the offer. \nREAD MORE: Trump’s pick for national security adviser Robert Harward rejects job \nTrump had also expressed interest in former CIA Director David Petraeus, but Spicer said Saturday that Petraeus was not a finalist. The retired four-star general resigned as CIA director in 2012 and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanour charge of mishandling classified information relating to documents he had provided to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. \nFlynn resigned at Trump’s request Monday after revelations that he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about discussing sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Trump said in a news conference Thursday that he was disappointed by how Flynn had treated Pence, but did not believe Flynn had done anything wrong by having the conversations. \nTrump has lurched from crisis to crisis since the inauguration, including the botched rollout of his immigration order, struggles confirming his Cabinet picks and a near-constant stream of reports about strife within his administration.F \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:05:10.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
