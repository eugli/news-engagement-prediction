The crowd roared in approval, clearly loving the throwback moment. \nEven after the show ended, Mel B continued paying homage to her days as Scary Spice. On Instagram, she posted a throwback from the ‘90s of one of her typical wild ensembles, writing, “Me walking off broadway last night at my last show.” And her ode to Scary continued with her adorable young daughter Madison, who clearly wants to take after her famous mum. \nIt’s good to see Mel B hasn’t forgotten her roots. Now if only someone can convince Mel C and Victoria Beckham to do the same , so we can get a full-fledged reunion going.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:06:55.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
