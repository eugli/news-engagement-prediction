Now it is up to individual schools to decide what policy best suits their needs. \n“In general, the use of cell phones is left to the discretion of schools or classrooms,” Bird said. “We encourage the use of technology but only when it makes educational sense.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
