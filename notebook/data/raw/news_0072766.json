Australian. Nerd. Twitter: shuey1984 \nProduction on The Predator may already be underway, but Shane Black just added a new cast member to his roster of stars. Yvonne Stahovski, most well-known for her work on cult sitcom Chuck , is set to join the cast of the highly anticipated remake. \nEven though they have just gone into production this week and are still announcing new cast members, Shane Black treated us with a partial cast shot of some of the new victims — uh, I mean, cast members — and if this previous films are anything to go by, most of these people aren't going to survive for a sequel! Partial cast... beautiful human beings, good people. Also, killers. Cameras roll today. Follow me on Twitter for updates. Wish us luck. pic.twitter.com/vYGgGesW0Y — Shane Black (@BonafideBlack) February 20, 2017 \nPlot details have been kept under wraps so far, but now that production has started on the long-awaited sequel, it probably won't be too long before more news hits the web. What Is The New 'Predator' Film? \nWe were first introduced to Predator all the way back in 1987, which debuted the fictional extraterrestrial species that takes part in the trophy hunting of other species for sport. Now onto its fourth film, the franchise has starred the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Adam Baldwin, Adrien Brody, Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo. \n2018's Predator will mark the fourth instalment in the franchise. Rumors about a fourth film started circulating as early as 2014, and it's been a long road to get the movie out of pre-production. Thankfully, the movie has finally started shooting, aiming for a February 2018 release date. Who's Been Cast So Far? \nThe Nice Guys director Shane Black has lined up a formidable ensemble for the Predators' return to the big screen. Strahovski will joinOlivia Munn ( Office Christmas Party ), Trevante Rhodes ( Moonlight ), Keegan-Michael Key ( Keanu ), Thomas Jane ( The Punisher ), Alfie Allen ( Game of Thrones ), and Sterling K. Brown ( American Crime Story ). \nThere have been rumors that Arnold Schwarzenegger might be reprising his original role from the first film, which also happened to star director Shane Black, who played Hawkins. Nothing's been confirmed so far, but watch this space. \nThe Hollywood Reporter has revelled that Strahovski will be playing the mother to Jacob Tremblay's ( Room ) character, who is drawn into the conflict with the gruesome predators by his father/ Strahovski's character's ex-husband. The patriarch of this (probably doomed) family will be played by Boyd Holbrook, of Narcos and Logan fame. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:18.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
