(Carolyn Kaster/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, February 6, 2017, 7:04 PM \nWASHINGTON — Senate Democrats made a last-minute bid to try to convince one more GOP colleague to join them to block Betsy DeVos' confirmation as Secretary of Education on Monday. \n\"Democrats will hold the floor for the next 24 hours, until the final vote, to do everything we can to persuade just one more Republican to join us,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) announced Monday afternoon on the Senate floor after ripping into DeVos' record. \nDemocrats are just one vote short of blocking DeVos, and planned to hold an all-night \"talkathon\" to try to convince wavering members to block her ahead of Tuesday's confirmation vote. But the Republicans they once thought might be convinced have come out in support of her, making the move mostly political theater. \n\"Above all, and on basic competence, she has failed to make the grade,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday on the Senate floor, accusing DeVos of displaying a basic lack of knowledge about the federal education system that was on display during her Senate confirmation hearing. \"I ask my Republican colleagues to look into their consciences and cast their votes tomorrow not based on party, but based on whether or not Ms. DeVos is qualified to be our nation's leader on education policy.\" \nBetsy DeVos now one step away from education secretary post \nDeVos is set to get a final vote on confirmation Tuesday afternoon, and it appears she'll pass by the thinnest of margins after a pair of Republicans broke party ranks. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) announced their opposition to President Trump's pick to head the Department of Education last Thursday. That left DeVos' nomination in limbo, with a 50-50 Senate split, and led to a huge effort by liberal activists, who have tied up senators' phone lines for days demanding that they vote down DeVos. \n\"We've gotten a lot of phone calls,\" Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) told the Daily News. \nBut even though the Capitol switchboard has received the most calls in history in recent days, the rest of the GOP appears to be hanging tough behind Trump's pick. That means that when the Senate votes on Tuesday, she's likely to survive — with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:26:35.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
