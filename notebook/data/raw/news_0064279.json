By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 17:23 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Climate change and global warming have forced arctic sea ice to melt terribly and it has also caused spring to come sooner. \nThe study covers 12 years of observations at a West Greenland field site near Russell Glacier, a dynamic front protruding from the massive inland ice sheet that covers most of the island. \nClimate change winning? Scientists confirm receding Antarctic sea ice has hit record low! \nEach year from early May to late June, researchers looked daily for the first signs of growth in plots enclosing individual plant species. \nLed by the University of California, Davis in the US, researchers found that warming winters and springs associated with declining arctic sea ice cover created a mixture of speed demons, slowpokes and those in between. \nOne sedge species now springs out a full 26 days earlier than it did a decade ago. This was the greatest increase in the timing of emergence the researchers have seen on record in the Arctic. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 17:23 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:57:00.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
