Could   \nTesco has vowed to check the price of every item in its 3,500 UK stores after a probe found customers were being short-changed. \nSecret cameras discovered that in two-thirds of outlets investigated,­ items marked on offer did not have the discounts applied at the till. \nInvestigators found multi-buy­ deals advertised days, weeks and, in one case, a month after the deductions were no longer being applied at the check-out. \nSome items went through tills at 60% more than the advertised offer price, others were nearly double. In every case when prompted about the discrepancy, Tesco staff honoured the offer. \nBut Martin Fisher, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: “If customer A has come back and complained and been refunded, it could still mean 20 others didn’t spot it and so didn’t complain.” \nEven after the issue was highlighted at tills, some stores failed to remove out-of-date labels on the shelves, it was claimed.

It was still on display a month after it was first pointed out. \nMr Fisher added: “That is very bad. It’s pretty basic that if one customer has shown something wrong then it’s put right to stop other customers being misled. Alarm bells would be ringing.” Read More \nThe BBC investigation went to 50 stores across the country and found problems at 33, including in the West Midlands, Liverpool and Leeds. Tesco, Britain’s­ biggest supermarket chain, already employs teams to ensure prices are up to date. \nBut it has now promised to double-check the prices of all stock at its 3,500 UK stores. \nA spokesman said: “We take great care to deliver clear and accurate labels for our cust­­omers, so they can make informed decisions on the products­ they buy. \n“We are disappointed errors occurred and will work with stores involved to reinforce­ our responsibilities to customers”.
