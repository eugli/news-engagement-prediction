Advertisement \nAn education department spokesman said: \"Enrolment boundaries are regularly revised at NSW public schools, particularly in response to changing patterns of enrolment.\" \nAs schools in Sydney continue to grow, some principals are implementing strict enrolment processes, which include insisting on statutory declarations in addition to four pieces of evidence showing a family lives in the catchment, including bills, rate notices and tenancy agreements. \nPrincipals also warn parents that submitting false information when enrolling a child in school could result in a $22,000 fine or even jail. \nMany schools do not accept out-of-area enrolments and some do not guarantee a place for siblings if the family has moved out of the catchment. \nMatthew Pearce Public in Baulkham Hills is a high-achieving school and competition to enrol is fierce. Real estate agents report that they are swamped in the lead up to the new school year as families try to move into the school's catchment. \nIt has undergone significant growth, seeing an increase of 300 students in just four years. Last year, 1311 students were enrolled. \n\"If leasing a property the lease must extend into the school year, a minimum of six months,\" the enrolment form for Matthew Pearce says. \n\"This may require families to present a new lease prior to enrolment. Office staff will advise when necessary. All lease agreements must be substantiated with the accompanying rental bond receipt from the Department of Fair Trading.\" \nThe form also stresses that documents will be reviewed to ensure a family's situation has not changed. \n\"For new students enrolling for the next year, whilst current documents will be asked for in the year prior to the day of enrolment, more current documents will need to be provided on the day of enrolment, to ensure address is still current. \n\"This will be for all residents, both rental properties and home owners.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:05:10.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
