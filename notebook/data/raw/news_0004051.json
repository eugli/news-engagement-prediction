Fortunately, she wasn't hurt, but the vehicle was destroyed.\nThe Insurance Corporation of B.C. has offered her just over $22,000, but Chicoine said that's not enough to replace what she lost. Sidewinder Conversions, which specializes in mobility products, estimated she should be getting closer to $33,000.\n\"It's about the whole picture. It's about what the customer is losing,\" said general manager Graham Edney.\nICBC spokesman Sam Corea told CTV News that their offer isn't final, and that discussions are ongoing.\nIt's rare that accessible vehicles are lost in accidents, he added, and ICBC needs to do some research into the appropriate value of Chicoine's van.\n\"We're doing our due diligence right now,\" Corea said. \"It's not a matter of just looking it up in a book and saying this is the value of a vehicle, there's a lot of research to be done.\"\nThat research will help the insurer deal with future claims involving accessible vehicles as well, Corea said.\nChicoine hopes it won't take long to get her back behind the wheel.\n\"Without my van I am not independent,\" she said. \"I want to live my life again.\"\nWith a report from CTV Vancouver's Maria Weisgarber  \nPhotos Alexis Chicoine lost her modified van in a crash in January, and says ICBC's offer won't cover a replacement.
