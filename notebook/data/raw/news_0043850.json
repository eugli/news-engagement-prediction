We have a couple of ideas why right now, but we’ll have to wait and see.” \nThe team still looks poised to pick up where they left off last season, where Keselowski won at Talladega and Daytona, while Logano picked up a victory at Talladega in the playoffs. \nDespite the up-and-down weekend, Team Penske shouldn’t be too concerned. \nIf Keselowski can win his Can-Am Duel qualifying race Thursday night (7 p.m. ET, FS1), he’ll keep his third-place spot, as it also gives Logano a chance to improve his position, as well. \nRegardless, both drivers will be favorites to win heading into the 59th running of the Great American Race.
