Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 R epublicans say Mr Sessions has demonstrated over a long career in public service - and two decades in the Senate - that he possesses integrity, honesty and is committed to justice.\n\"He's honest. He's fair. He's been a friend to many of us, on both sides of the aisle,\" Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, said. \"It's been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.\"\nMr Sessions won unanimous backing from Senate Republicans but picked up the support of just one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\nMr Sessions told his colleagues that he hopes the intensity of senate debate will die down and \"maybe somehow we get along better.\"\nHe also thanked the president for nominating him adding that Mr Trump believes in the rule of law and in protecting the American people from crime and violence.\nSessions is urging senators to \"agree on what we can agree on\" but not to denigrate people who disagree, saying it's not a healthy trend. He also confirmed that his resignation as US senator would be effective at 11:55pm EST (4:55am GMT).\nThe nomination drew wide attention when Elizabeth Warren, a high-profile liberal senator, attempted on Tuesday evening to quote Martin Luther King’s widow in a senate speech only to be silenced by the Republican majority senate. \nCoretta Scott King had written a letter in 1986, when Mr Sessions was proposed as a federal judge in Alabama, arguing that he was racist and unfit to be a judge . \nMrs Warren was silenced by Mr McConnell but later read the letter outside the senate, streaming video live on Facebook to more than five million people. \nWatch | Elizabeth Warren silenced for quoting Coretta Scott King 01:56 M r Sessions' nomination to a federal judgeship was rejected three decades ago by the Senate Judiciary Committee after it was alleged that as a federal prosecutor he had called a black attorney \"boy\" and had said organisations like the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union were un-American.\nAt his hearing last month, Mr Sessions said he had never harboured racial animus, saying he had been falsely caricatured.\nWatch | Jeff Sessions - in 60 seconds 01:03 \"We will not be disheartened.
