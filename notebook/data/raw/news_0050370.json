(AP: Rajanish Kakade) \nNeither Marsh brother has played a Test since the first match of the home summer against the Proteas. \nShaun Marsh retired after reaching three figures in Mumbai, while Mitch Marsh opened the bowling and scored a measured 75 in the first-class match. \n\"He batted really well for us in Sri Lanka to be fair, he was one of our better batters,\" Lehmann said of Mitch Marsh. \n\"We've been impressed with way he plays spin bowling.\" \nNathan Lyon went for 5.6 runs an over in Mumbai but claimed four wickets, while Steve O'Keefe grabbed figures of 3-103. \n\"I'm pleased with the way the spinners are going,\" Lehmann said. \n\"It's going to be a challenge bowling here, but they're on the right path.\" \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:17:51.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
