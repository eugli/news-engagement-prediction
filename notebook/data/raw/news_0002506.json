Relocating to the city to take over as the Chief Creative Officer of Calvin Klein, Raf has always looked to America (or rather Americana) as much he's looked to his European homeland. There was big statements here about his new home, a cream oversize jumper read \"I <3 NY\", other splashes of duct tape were printed with the city's skyline, one said \"youth project\" a little nod to the designer's constant obsessive explorations of subcultural youth and their coded ways of dressing. \nThere was however less of the plays of proportion that have defined Raf's recent work. Although last season's Robert Mapplethorpe collaboration should've prepped us for for a dose of NYC downtown cool, it didn't materialise. There was instead an easy universal classicism to the statement coats, relaxed trousers and naive knitwear he sent down the runway. Apart from the very obvious nods to New York, it felt more rooted in Raf's psyche than in a specific location. Those T-shirts — poking out through coats, blazers and shirts — a definite nod to Raf's past, a dose of classic Raf graphic boldness. \nAll that's left in his conquest of America, is to see what he does when he debuts his CK vision in two weeks time.
