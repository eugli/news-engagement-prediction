Lieutenant General H R McMaster wrote a book on the subject, drawing conclusions from the National Security Council and its operations in the 1950s until the 1970s.\nIn his 1997 book Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam , he said Americans ended up \"questioning the integrity of their government\".\nRead more Trump mistaken if he thinks new security adviser will always back him He wrote that: \"The president was lying, and he expected the Chiefs to lie as well or, at least, to withhold the whole truth. Although the president should not have placed the Chiefs in that position, the flag officers should not have tolerated it when they had.\"\nThe shadow of the failed war, he said, hung over the government for decades.\nMr McMaster's advice in the book, according to Politico - and possibly to the new President - is not to lie, do not rely on a close group of advisers and do not attack the media. He accused former President Johnson of being arrogant, weak and self-interested, which led to failings in Vietnam too.\nIt remains to be seen how Mr McMaster will apply this wisdom to the Trump administration, where the President has frequently attacked the media for being \"dishonest\" and spreading \"fake news\", and where he is heavily reliant on a group of advisers including Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller.\nNew York City bodegas strike to protest Trump's travel ban 27 show all New York City bodegas strike to protest Trump's travel ban 1/27 Ethnic Yemenis and supporters protest against President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on February 2, 2017 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

The main thing is he’s a blunt, outspoken guy and he’s self-confident,\" he said.\nMr Jeffrey stressed that the National Security Adviser has no power to execute a plan without the President’s permission. \n\"As National Security Adviser you’re the President’s staffer and your job is to give him the best advice possible but at the end of the day the President makes a decision and you execute it. You co-ordinate it, monitor it, but you have no real execution authority yourself.\"\nTrevor Noah: Steve Bannon is the ‘real President' \"His best possible advice may run contrary to what the President indicates.\"\nMr McMaster will be present for the delivery of the President’s Daily Briefing on security matters and global threats. If there are warnings in the briefing, they will not go unnoticed because the document is read by many people, added Mr Jeffrey.\nBut, similar to the Vietnam War era, the number of National Security Council’s principals committee staff has been reduced and the power of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has become more limited.\nThe purpose of the meetings, mostly composed of civilian analysts and lawyers, was to expand the consensus for decisions already made.\nRead more CIA analyst quits after 11 years over 'disturbing' Trump behaviour Who is HR McMaster, Donald Trump's new national security advisor Trump announces new Gen HR McMaster as National Security Adviser Mr Trump appointed Breitbart founder Mr Bannon to become a permanent member of the NSC.
