Celtic pounced on the France Under-21 international and have been well rewarded with Dembele finding the net 29 times in 42 appearances. Hasselbaink believes that had the 20-year-old joined the Blues last summer he may not have developed as well as he has. \n‘I think his agents have done a shrewd job to send him to Celtic to let him play week in week out. \n‘To be in a big arena, to have the pressure to win every match. But also for him to get games and to score and to feel that net over and over again – to get in that habit.
