At least 16 civilians and 14 militants were killed in the operation, which the Pentagon said was aimed at capturing information on potential Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. and its allies. \nYEMEN SEEKS ‘REASSESSMENT’ OF DEADILY US RAID \nThe elder Owens told the newspaper he refused to meet with the president because the family had requested a private ceremony. \n\"I'm sorry, I don't want to see him,\" Owens recalled telling the chaplain who informed him that Trump was on his way from Washington. \"I told them I don't want to meet the president.\" Expand / Contract \nIn this February 2017 photo, William Owens holds a photo of his youngest son Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens in Lauderdale by the Sea, Fla. (Emily Michot/Miami Herald via AP) \nHe said he was also troubled by the attack Trump leveled at Khizr and Ghazala Kahn, an American Muslim family whose Army officer son died in Iraq in 2004. The couple had criticized him at the Democratic National Convention last summer. He also questioned why the president approved the raid a week after taking office. \n\"I told them I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him,\" Owens told the Herald. \"Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn't even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen — everything was missiles and drones — because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display?\" \nTRUMP HITS MCCAIN FOR CRITICISM OF YEMEN RAID \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC’s “The Week” on Sunday that she believes the president would support an investigation, but defended the raid. \n“I can't imagine what this father is going through,\" she said. \"His son is a true American hero, and we should forever be in his son's debt.\" \nThe White House says the raid was planned during the Obama administration, but the former president's aides have said he hadn't given the go-ahead because it would have been an escalation of U.S. involvement in the war-torn and destitute Arab country. \n\"The mission has a lot of different critics, but it did yield a substantial amount of very important intel and resources that helped save American lives and other lives,\" Sanders said. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
