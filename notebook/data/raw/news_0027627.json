The 6-foot-2, 206-pound Allen visited Notre Dame during the off-season and marks the second four-star defensive back to go Irish today, following Kalon Gervin of Cass Tech in Detroit. \nGervin at least visited over the weekend for Junior Day. \nThe timing on Allen’s commitment was more of a surprise. \n“It’s been a long journey coming from a freshman to now,” Allen posted on Twitter. “I’d first like to thank God for giving me the ability to perform at the level I do. I would also like to thank my coaches and parents for nurturing me into the young man and athlete I am today and also pushing me to be a Student/Great person first and then a star athlete. Thank you for all the coaches that have recruited me and or even just coached me and helped me get better. \n“After this long journey my family and I have decided that for the next four years I will be attending the University of Notre Dame. Go Irish.” \nAllen is the eighth verbal commitment in Notre Dame’s class, which now ranks No. 2 on Scout.com in the early team rankings. \nAllen is the highest-rated defensive prospect in Notre Dame’s class at No. 129 overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:29:44.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
