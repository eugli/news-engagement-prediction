Cuomo said. \nAn exact date for blowing up the approaches has not been set, administration officials said. \nCross Bronx Expressway named most congested city roadway in U.S. \nThe implosion of the approaches is part of a $555 million project to remove the aging bridge and build the first of the two new spans that will carry the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. \nThe decaying main span will be dropped down separately before the approaches explode to avoid dropping materials into Newtown Creek. Cuomo said traffic will switch from the old bridge to the first of the two new bridges in early Spring 2017. That span will carry three lanes of traffic in each direction. (Farriella, Christie M,, Freelanc) \nCuomo said traffic will switch from the old bridge to the first of the two new bridges in early Spring 2017. That span will carry three lanes of traffic in each direction. \nOnce the existing bridge is removed, the second bridge, intended for Brooklyn-bound traffic, will be constructed in its place. State officials have not released a cost estimate for the second bridge. \nPort Authority eyeing harness-equipped cops on GWB \nCuomo said the second bridge is projected to open in early 2020, about 4 years ahead of the initial schedule. \nWhen both spans are completed, the Queens-bound bridge will carry five lanes of traffic and the Brooklyn-bound bridge will carry four lanes, as well as a bikeway/walkway.
