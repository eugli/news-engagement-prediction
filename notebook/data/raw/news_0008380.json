A pile of couch pillows. \n“My neighbours loved it,” Schultz said. “They would always come out and watch. Sometimes, they even cheered for us.” \nTurns out, those neighbours might have been cheering for the next Canadian destined for greatness in the heptathlon. Recently turned 18, Schultz set a new Canadian junior record earlier this month with 4,042 points in the indoor pentathlon. \nThe search is on for the next Theisen-Eaton, and Schultz doesn’t shy away from comparisons to the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist and world indoor champion. Sports in brief \nStar of the week Ted-Jan Bloemen, speed skating \nChalk up the 2016-17 season as a grind for the transplanted Dutchman with the potential to win multiple medals for Canada at the 2018 PyeongChang Games. Coming off a nasty skate laceration to the leg and a badly sprained wrist (from a bike crash), Bloemen earned his first win of the season on Saturday with World Cup gold in the 5,000 metres in Berlin, Germany. \nA distance specialist, Bloemen is a legitimate contender in the 5,000, 10,000 and team pursuit. \n“It’s always hard if you are not skating the way you want to skate,” said the 30-year-old who lives and trains in Calgary. “It messes with your confidence. This gold medal is really great going into the World Single Distance Championships.” \nOne to watch Mirela Rahneva, skeleton \nThrough the first five races of her World Cup career, Rahneva already has one gold medal and two bronze. A wedding planner by trade, the Ottawa native is ranked fourth in the World Cup standings heading into the race Friday in Igls, Austria. \nSkeleton is about the start and the drive down the track. Already crushing the competition at the top, Rahneva will no doubt improve even further once she gains valuable driving experience on tracks around the world. \n— Vicki Hall \n“Brianne is obviously a great athlete, so it’s a lot to live up to,” Schultz said. “Obviously, she just retired, so I’m hoping that I can eventually fill her spot, fill her shoes and live up to her expectations and do well in Canada’s multi program.” \nSchultz oozes potential, especially given her bloodlines. Her grandfather, Duan Qiyan, is a former national team track coach in China. Her grandmother, Zheng Fengrong, held the high jump world record for a time back in 1957 at 1.77 metres — and she did that scissor-style. \n“She never lets me forget it,” Schultz said. “My personal best is only three centimetres higher, and I flop, so it’s a lot easier. She always nags me about that, so I hopefully can get a lot higher.” \nThe heptathlon ­ — which includes the 100-metre hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-metre dash, long jump, javelin and 800-metre run — is considered the ultimate test of overall athletic ability and mental toughness for female athletes. Most elite participants tend to peak in their late 20s or early 30s. Success as a teenager is rare. \nSchultz credits her grandparents for giving her a head start. \n“I think one of the big factors is having my family involved in my early track career,” she said. “Obviously, they were very experienced, so my grandpa made a very good coach. Right from the beginning, I had very good training and technique.” \nSchultz’s grandmother missed out on competing at the Olympics because China boycotted from 1952-84 over the International Olympic Committee’s recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation. She later carried the Olympic flag to open the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. \nSchultz hopes to one day give Zheng the joy of watching her granddaughter compete at the Olympics, perhaps as early as 2020 in Tokyo. So far, she’s on the right track. Related ‘I am just ecstatic’: Canada’s Kim McRae slides to unlikely, momentous bronze at world luge championships \nMR. COOL GROWS UP \nThe Toronto Star dubbed Manny Osborne-Paradis Canada’s Mr. Cool at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. The happy-go-lucky party boy on the Canadian alpine team seemed eternally young at the time, without a care in the world. \nNow 32, Osborne-Paradis is all grown up, married and the proud daddy of two-month-old baby girl Sloane Grace. \nSloane arrived on the weekend of the 2016 Lake Louise World Cup, which just happened to be cancelled for the first time in 29 years due to lack of snow. \n“It was kind of a good thing for me that Lake Louise didn’t happen, because I wouldn’t have been there,” said Osborne-Paradis. “Bittersweet. Bitter in that the race didn’t happen but sweet in that I wouldn’t have been there anyways.” \nTwo days after Sloane was born, Osborne-Paradis flew to France to resume his day job of charging down slick mountainsides at 140 km/h. \nRacing on new skis this year from Head, Osborne-Paradis posted a season-best World Cup finish of sixth on the weekend in Garmisch, Germany — only 0.83 seconds back of winner Travis Ganong of the United States. \nIn any given race, Osborne-Paradis remains in striking distance of the podium, even though he is one of the older dogs on tour. \n“When we talked 10 years ago, I thought I would be retired at 30,” he said. “But the best guys now are Aksel Lund Svindal (34) and Hannes Reichelt (36). All these old guys are up there. So we’re going to keep going as long as I’m having fun.” \nErik Guay is the elder statesmen on the Canadian speed team at 35. He crashed in Garmisch, but is expected to compete at the world championships Feb 6-19 in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
