The search engines’ autocomplete functions, a timesaving feature that suggests what users may be looking for, should also remove terms that may lead to pirate websites.\nInternet piracy has fallen in recent years A lthough the code is voluntary, the IPO will monitor how Google and Bing respond over the next few months. In the summer it can recommend further action by the Business Secretary Greg Clark which could lead to legislation that imposes fines or other measures.\nMatt Hancock, the minister for digital and culture, said: \"We are one of the world's leading digital nations, and we have a responsibility to make sure that consumers have easy access to legal content online. Pirate sites deprive artists and rights holders of hard-earned income and I'm delighted to see industry led solutions like this landmark agreement which will be instrumental in driving change.”\nGoogle has long argued that search engines are not a major source of traffic to piracy websites. A spokesman said: “Google has been an active partner for many years in the fight against piracy online. We remain committed to tackling this issue and look forward to further partnership with rights holders.”\nOne in six internet users access pirated content according to the IPO, although this is falling amid the rise of legal streaming services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:08:20.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
