We were much more powerful in the past. It depends always on the board,” he declared bluntly.

The players need to be powerful but not in sacking managers. They never did it. It’s not like the Leicester players did it or something. It is if someone asked they gave an answer. \n“I have never had this situation. There is never a direct line to the owner or whatever. As long as the players talk together there is no problem. If they start talking about you? For this you need an ear on the other side.” Klopp says he's never had a problem with player power (Photo: Liverpool FC) \nKlopp is a manager who holds the trust of his players, and fosters a team spirit within his squad, just as Ranieri did last season in winning the title. \nBut even though he holds a strong public image as a jovial nice guy, he made clear that is not the case if there is any dissent within his dressing room, and if the players stop working to their maximum. \nThere have been strong reports that Leicester’s players “downed tools” this season, and Klopp said if that is the case, then the board have to be strong to let the manager deal with the problem. Ranieri's final stand was the loss in Sevilla (Photo: REUTERS) \nAsked if managers can be the victim of a weak boardroom, he replied: “I don’t know if it’s weakness, it’s the situation. I never had it but I know it has happened. \n“To maintain the relationship, it’s not like we come together every day and hug each other. We enjoy the work. I know what they want, they know what I want, so it is very good information. \n“It is pretty simple and being good together is not too difficult. It is all full of respect. As long as they work really hard I am a really nice person. Not always in training, but I always respect.

If they start not working – and that does not mean running it means concentrating on what you need to play football, listening – then I am not a nice guy actually, but none of the players expect me to let them do what they want. \n“They know someone has to make the rules and it is long ago I made them, and now we have to respect them. It’s good work together.” \nKlopp will run the rule over Dejan Lovren this morning, before deciding his line up for the visit to the King Power after the defender returned to training following a 10-day break. poll loading Who will win this one? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:29.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
