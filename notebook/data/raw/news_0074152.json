Fitting with the location, the displays are botanical—giant butterflies, flowers, spiders set in beautiful twinkling webs, peacocks with shimmering tail feathers, and more. This is an especially perfect option if you want a Christmas lights display that's a little different. \nWhen: After Thanksgiving through December 31 Where: 12001 Main Street, Bellevue, WA 98005 More » Bellevue's Snowflake Lake. Takuya Oikawa Snowflake Lane and Celebration Lane \nWhile not a Christmas light display per se, Snowflake Lane and Celebration Lane in Bellevue combined Christmas lights, a light show, and music to ring in the holidays every night. Snow falls from the sky (artificial, but it’s still very cool). Drummer boys climb onto platforms all up and down the street, which is lined with trees covered in lights. Then a parade of more toy soldiers, reindeer, fire engines, and Santa. \nWhen: November 25-December 24, nightly at 7 p.m. Where: Snowflake Lane takes place on the streets around Bellevue Square; Celebration Lane fills the sidewalks at The Bellevue Collection More » Lights at Zoolights.

Copyright Odenosuke Fantasy Lights \nFantasy Lights is the largest drive-through Christmas light display in the Northwest and is located just outside of Tacoma. Stay in your car, turn on some Christmas music, and enjoy a leisurely drive through two-miles of displays. Often to open for the season, Fantasy Lights closes to cars and welcomes in walkers.
