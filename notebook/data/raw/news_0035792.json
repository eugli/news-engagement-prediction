The fly-on-the wall filmmaking is driven by the teenagers themselves. Photo: Steven Siewert \n\"The amount of pressure they are under and the belief that one number defines who they become for the rest of their lives is common to all of them.\" \nThat number, the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank [ATAR], determines what course a student can study at university. SHARE Share on Twitter Link Tom Forrest from My Year 12 Life: Students from WA to NSW took part in the new series. Photo: Steven Siewert \nIt came under criticism this year after a Fairfax Media investigation revealed the advertised ATAR cut off at up to 60 per cent of courses at some universities bore little resemblance to reality. \nWhile striving towards a particular ATAR remains a dominant theme throughout the series, so does its influence on every other aspect of the students' lives and their family around them. \nIt's often in those moments of pressure release that the show gains its deepest insights into familial bonds, teenage relationships, mental health and the delicate balancing act that binds them all. \nSome, like Ms Zhang, a black belt in taekwondo, relieve the burden of expectation by practising kicking technique on a 12-year-old brother. \n\"I'm sick of studying right now, so I'm going to let off some steam with this one,\" she said. \nOthers record their turmoil from their bathroom floor as they move through the familiar study-party cycle. \n\"How much have you had?\" Melbourne teenager's Zoe Mallet's mother asks, pointing halfway down a bottle of vodka. \"That much?\" \nThe fly-on-the wall film making is driven by the teenagers themselves, who don't turn off the camera in hard times. \n\"It was the worst year of my life,\" said Ms Mallett. \"I developed quite a bit of mental illness from my own personal expectation.\" \n\"I was always very organised, I never handed things in late, I found the work easy, content-wise, but being a perfectionist just led me to breakdowns.\" \nShe said the camera acted as her counsellor in times of need. \n\"It just listened and allowed me to vent my problems in a way which was quite therapeutic in hindsight.\" \nMs Waters, who is also the show's executive producer, said the series was about starting conversations about whether the end of high school was providing the best way to launch young people into the future and to give students and parents a resource to know others were going through the same thing. \n\"I found the whole experience really emotional,\" she said. \"I cried while watching a lot of the episodes because the kids have been so open and honest about what they are going through.\" \nMy Year 12 Life will premiere on February 20 at 7.30pm on ABC ME. \nLifeline 13 11 14, beyondblue 1300 224 636, Kids Helpline 1800 551 800 Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:15:52.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
