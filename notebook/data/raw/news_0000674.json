GARY MELVILLE \nA moulting juvenile Fiordland crested penguin on the Kaikoura peninsula in 2013. \nThe area is home to the the world's smallest penguin, the little penguin, also known as the little blue penguin, which has a breeding colony near the Kaikoura Coastguard building at South Bay. \nREAD MORE: \nHowever the larger of the penguin species are rarely spotted and are a sought-after sighting for avid ornithologists. JODY WEIR \n'Moonshine' the yellow-eyed penguin liked Kaikoura so much he visited twice last year. \nAlbatross Encounter skipper Gary Melville, who has a wealth of pelagic seabird experience including 25 years of fishing in the Kaikoura area, said it was a very uncommon sight. \n\"The staff are really excited about it,\" he said. \n\"It's certainly a hard-to-get tick in any bird-watcher's book.\" supplied \nA little (blue) penguin at the Kaikoura colony. \nThe erect-crested penguin is one of three similar-looking crested penguins endemic to southern New Zealand (Snares Crested and Fiordland Crested). Ad Feedback \nIts main breeding grounds are on the remote Bounty and Antipodes Islands. \nIndividual birds can be found moulting on the east coast of the South Island most summers and could be the reason the penguin, probably a juvenile, has come ashore in Kaikoura. \nHowever Melville said it looked to be in good condition if this was the case. \n\"They like to moult in their first season but this one's feathers are really nice with a lovely dark colour...he could just be moving through, but it's hard to say.\" \nPenguins normally looked 'feather-worn' before moulting, he said. \nMoulting penguins also usually stood in one spot on land for a couple of weeks, however this one had moved around the peninsula from Shark's Tooth to nearer the Point Kean seal colony. \n\"He is in a good spot, away from people. \n\"There are bound to be one or two others along the coast, although they may not be seen by people.\" \nThe last sighting of a crested penguin in Kaikoura was a juvenile Fiordland crested penguin, identified during a penguin survey conducted by Penguin Education and Awareness Programme (PEAP) in 2007. A photo posted by Birds Life Of Instagram (@birdslife124) on Apr 23, 2016 at 7:16am PDT \nThe area is also a favourite spot for one member of the world's rarest penguin family, the yellow-eyed penguin, or hoiho. \nThe individual, nicknamed Moonshine, appeared in Kaikoura in May last year and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility in Christchurch before being released on Banks Peninsula, only to return to Kaikoura in July. - Kaikoura Star", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:09:52.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
