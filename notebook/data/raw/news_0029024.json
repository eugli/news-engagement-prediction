Like DuVernay, they understand that we must come face to face with our past before we can fix our future.” \n“13th” was the opening film at the New York Film Festival and was released Oct. 6 on Netflix. DuVernay begins the film by pointing out that 25% of those incarcerated in the world are imprisoned in the U.S. and contends that maintaining such a system amounts to perpetuating slavery. \nFollowing the Netflix debut, advocacy organizations such as the ACLU, Center for Media Justice, cut50, and Google.org hosted dozens of community screenings across the country to support their organizing efforts — from Oakland, Des Moines, and Columbus, Ohio; to Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. \n“13th” is competing for the best feature documentary Academy Award against “Fire at Sea,”“O.J.: Made in America,”“Life, Animated,” and “I Am Not Your Negro.” \nNetflix original documentaries that are also part of the educational screening program include Oscar-nominated shorts “Extremis” and “The White Helmets,” as well as “The Ivory Game,”“Winter on Fire,”“Audrie & Daisy,” and “Into the Inferno.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:06:23.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
