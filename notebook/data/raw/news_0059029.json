She stressed a seven-minute arrival time \"is not something that's completely out of the range\" of the department's aims. \nComplicating matters was the discovery that the fire \"was being fed by natural gas,\" Scheller said Monday in a news release. Nicor Gas employees had to be called to the scene, she said. \nJellouli on Tuesday pointed to a mound of mud left by a backhoe Nicor workers used to get to a gas main. \"You could hear the gas line hissing\" during the fire, he said. \"It was loud.\" \nThe fire also spread to the neighbors' house, seriously damaging the side facing the Jellouli home. A deck fire that erupted at a third home was extinguished quickly, Scheller said in the release. \nFirefighters \"were able to extinguish the main body of fire within the (Jellouli) garage and home within 30 minutes,\" Scheller said. \"Crews were unable to fully extinguish fire within the (neighbors') home until the main gas line was shut down.\" \nBoth houses were deemed uninhabitable by an inspector from the city's Transportation, Engineering and Development office. \nThe loss of their home, which Jelloui and his wife purchased 13 years ago after immigrating from Morocco 10 years earlier, might be especially painful for Jed Jellouli, who suffers from chronic seizures and last spring received a \"bedroom makeover\" courtesy of Special Spaces. The nonprofit, Tennessee-based organization creates dream bedrooms for children battling life-threatening illnesses. \nDonors and volunteers in April refurbished Jed's bedroom with two custom beds and storage areas. \"Mini-makeovers\" were provided for his sisters' rooms. \nJed is a student at Scullen Middle School in Naperville. Kelly Knox, a friend of the Jellouli family, said Scullen teachers, students and parents are already rallying to the family's aid. \n\"This is the kind of family (where) they are still being gracious, and have a smile on their face, even through all of this,\" Knox said Tuesday. \nJed requires a specialized wheelchair and feeding instruments \"to have a normal day,\" Knox said. \"He didn't even eat Monday,\" because the wheelchair and other equipment were consumed in the fire, she said. \nKnox said Jed's teacher, Olivia Mayszak, has set up a gofundme page for the family, which had raised $1,500 by Tuesday afternoon. Scullen employees are trying to get a discount on a replacement wheelchair, and Special Spaces officials \"have already approved redoing the bedrooms\" once the house is rebuilt, \"so that's super-exciting,\" Knox said. \nSaeed Jellouli said he and his family will live with relatives until the ruins are torn down and the house rebuilt, a process he said he expects to take at least six months. \nKnox said donations to the family can be made at www.gofundme.com/jellouli .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:43:52.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
