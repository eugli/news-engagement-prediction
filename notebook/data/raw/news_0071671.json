We take a look at the new Pinarello Dogma F10 Henao used at the Tour Down Under last month, his first race since crashing out of the final stages in the Rio Olympics, and will be using for the 2017 season. Related Articles Tour Down Under: Team Sky rue bad luck but remain united behind Henao The latest incarnation of the Pinarello Dogma arrived earlier this year, claiming to be lighter, stiffer and more aerodynamic than the Dogma F8. The F10 was designed specifically for the latest Shimano Dura-Ace 9150 Di2 groupset, with an E-Link system on the downtube allowing updating and charging of the electronic groupset. Whilst the shifting, levers and brakes equipped on Henao’s bike are from the new groupset, the crankset is an older Dura-Ace 9070 series due to a shortage of chainrings for the latest groupset. It is expected Team Sky will have the full complement of the groupset in time for the spring races, including the new 9100 series wheels. The Colombian climber opted for Dura-Ace C35 wheels on his 465mm frame. Standard gearing of 53-39T chainrings combined with a Dura-Ace 11-28T cassette were paired with 170mm cranks.
