But he also represents a threat to language itself. Whether it’s his iterative, rambling, accusatory spoken dialogue; his terse, pugnacious Twitter musings; or the apocalyptic vocabulary used by his speechwriter and boss Steve Bannon, he uses words to fundamentally refigure meaning, creating a world in which he is right, America is first, and everything else is bad. \nAn article today on The Awl proposes , convincingly, that the anti-Trump resistance movement and its elected allies must adopt the rhetoric and language of Trump in order to combat it. That’s what a slate of countries in Europe is already doing. Last week a television show in The Netherlands parodied Trump’s “America first!” slogan with a “Netherlands second” video, turning his own hotheaded, insult-riddled linguistic choices against him. Dutch has “all the best words,” it claims, and the Netherlands features “the best ponypark in the world”: \nIt’s being joined by many other countries, each abusing Trump’s rhetoric in order to promote themselves. Each was produced by its country’s satirical late-night talk shows. Here’s Switzerland, “the sexiest country in Europe”: \nGermany claims to be “the orangest country in Europe”: \nDenmark attempts to sell Trump on the deliciousness of rye bread and the lovability of actor Mads Mikkelsen: \nPortugal heralds its triumph as the world champions of “the real football”: \nBelgium uses alternative factuality to claim that it brought us ABBA, whose members are actually Swedish: \nLithuania gets in on it: \nYou still there? It sucks that the U.S. president has inspired the entirety of Europe to shit on him. Here’s Luxembourg: \nMorocco, too, is the best kingdom: \nThey’re all being collected on Every Second Counts, which has spaces open for every other country in Europe . Which one will get the coveted nod from Trump as the official, arbitrary second-best country in the world? The winner will presumably be announced in a prime-time special hosted by Omarosa and soundtracked by the best band, 3 Doors Down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:41:49.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
