Email news@dompost.co.nz NZTA \nThe expressway runs for 18 kilometres through central Kapiti, and includes a second bridge over the Waikanae River. \nThe opening of the road between Mackays Crossing and Peka Peka on the Kapiti Coast marked the completion of a project that started in late 2013. \nREAD MORE: \nKapiti resident Maree Gately drove the expressway on its opening day and was pleased at how speedily it got her from A to B. MARK COOTE/SUPPLIED \nThe Mackays to Peka Peka section of the Kapiti expressway, from Poplar Ave, with a pedestrian overbridge. \n\"It's money well spent – it took about four mins to get from Waikanae Beach to Paraparaumu off-ramp – it takes more than that to get from Waikanae beach to Waikanae village. Otaihanga roundabout is a nightmare, so pleased we can avoid this bottle-neck. Looking forward to seeing how it copes with Friday traffic. So pleased it is finally open.\" — NZTA Wellington (@NZTAWgtn) February 23, 2017 \nThe project was dogged by controversy as residents were forced to make way for the four-lane road, while others were unexpectedly left living near a major thoroughfare. Good morning Wgtn! Traffic is flowing well on the new MacKays to Peka Peka expressway this morning. ^MF pic.twitter.com/BRqHX0S4R1 — NZTA Wellington (@NZTAWgtn) February 23, 2017 \nIt runs for 18 kilometres through central Kapiti, and includes a second bridge over the Waikanae River. Ad Feedback \nOn Friday morning, NZTA tweeted that it was open, and advised people to take care and follow the signage as they got used to the new road. \nMotorists gave their reviews on the NZTA's Facebook page – many saying they had made a faster trip between towns, and giving the new route the thumbs up. Others were concerned about the new traffic noise. \nThe NZTA encouraged drivers to familiarise themselves with the new entries and exits to the expressway . \n\"We're thrilled that the expressway is now open and everyone can enjoy the benefits of safer and easier journeys in Kapiti. We know that people are excited to see the expressway open and in use, and we're urging everyone to be considerate and courteous as we all get used to moving around the district in different ways,\" NZTA State Highways Manager Neil Walker said. \nWork was continuing around the Poplar Ave Interchange at the south end of the expressway over coming months, as well as the Peka Peka Interchange at the north end of the expressway, and some other roads in the area. Additional roundabouts were still being built, and road surfacing and barrier installation needed to be completed. \n\"While this work continues, traffic management, lane closures and speed restrictions will occasionally be in place,\" Walker said. \"We're thankful that people have been patient and understanding with the works to date, and we're asking people to bear with us a little longer as we finish off these remaining works.\" \nThe expressway would now become State Highway 1 while the old route would eventually become local roads. Both new and old routes would give passage through the district. \nIt will form the central section of three projects: the $850m Transmission Gully route in the south, and a $330m section from Peka Peka to north of Otaki being the others. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:03:46.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
