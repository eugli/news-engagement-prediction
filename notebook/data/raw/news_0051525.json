The Vegetative State (2007) – \"People tend to think positively of couples,\" says Choi. \"It was said that society needs to be 'one,' almost like propaganda.

It's little surprise then that the Seoul-born South Korean declares: \"If one feels uncomfortable physically or mentally when viewing my work, I would say it worked.\" The fine detail and often grotesque style of Choi's work has helped him stand out among South Korea's increasingly diverse contemporary arts scene. But in May he will make further inroads internationally, showing an exhibition at New York's Doosan Gallery , where he is presently completing a six month residency. Read: Astonishing photo-realistic portraits are actually painted by hand \"There is a thread of fine craftsmanship that runs through his work, exquisite rendering,\" says author of the 2012 book \"Korean Contemporary Art\" Miki Wick Kim. \"And of course, good artwork embodies so many different things coming together -- it can't just be a tangibly gorgeous surface, it needs to have context and relevance.\" Read More \"Islet of Asperger Type 6\", by Choi Xooang Political roots Choi, who studied sculpture at Seoul National University and held his first exhibition in 2002, has often had the relevance of his work tied to his country's political history.
