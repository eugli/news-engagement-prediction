Simi said several documents and credit cards were seized by the MACC to assist in the probe. \nThe suspect will be taken to the court for a remand order today. \nMAHB, in a statement last night, said: “We have been made aware through various media reports on the arrest made by MACC on one of our employees. \n“Malaysia Airports had given full co-operation to MACC on this investigation and will continue to do so until it is concluded.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:51:11.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
