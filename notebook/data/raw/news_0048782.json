The project has already hired Dexter alum Scott Buck as the showrunner on the new project, and this week it looks like Inhumans is moving forward at an even faster rate. The show has found one of its lead actors, and it's a wonderfully notorious Game of Thrones fan-favorite that folks just love to hate. Iwan Rheon, who formerly played Ramsay Bolton on the HBO fantasy epic is now set to play the role of Maximus on Marvel's developing Inhumans show. \nMarvel.com has officially made the exciting casting announcement, confirming the Welsh actor as the first member of the Inhuman royal family that will be at the center of the series. At this time, there are very few details available regarding what we can expect from the character or really the show as a whole, but if the comics are any indication, Iwan Rheon's part should eventually develop to become one of the series' main antagonists - and Maximus is the power-hungry sort who doesn't love the fact that his older brother, Black Bolt, sits on the throne. \nCreated by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby as one of the original Inhumans introduced in 1966, Maximus Boltagon - a.k.a. Maximus The Mad - is one of the most powerful members of his alien society. Like the other Inumans, he was given abilities after being exposed to the alien Terrigen Mist, and specifically possesses a genius intellect and is a remarkable inventor. As noted in the official press release, he is extremely loyal to the people of Attilan - the secret city where Inhumans live - but is distracted by his desire to be the king. It's very possible that he won't fully appear to be a villain at the start of the series, but his antagonist nature will almost surely show itself before the first run of episodes is done. \nMore to come...
