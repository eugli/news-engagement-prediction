Article continues below Chelsea's XI on FIFA 10 vs FIFA 17: Ratings show there's only one winner \nWenger's men have fallen at the first hurdle of the knockout stages in Europe in each of the last seven campaigns, so few Gooners will be anticipating a shock Champions League victory this campaign. \nAnd to compile further misery on Wenger, their back-to-back defeats to Watford and Chelsea have done nothing to help earn the 67-year-old a new deal that will keep him at the Emirates beyond the end of the season. Huge boycott anticipated \nSo when Hull arrive at the Emirates for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, Arsenal Supporters Trust spokesman Tim Payton warned that as many as 10,000 fans could boycott the Premier League tie in protest of yet another season going stale. \n“With the composition of the fanbase these days, the most likely protest will be in the form of empty seats,” Payton said, as per the Sun . \n“Fans I talk to are extremely frustrated but there is no great desire for organised protest aimed directly at Arsene Wenger given all he has achieved at the club and the result is that many fans simply can’t face going every week. \n\"Add in the fact it is a lunchtime kick-off on a cold weekend at the start of half-term against modest opposition and the crowd could be 10,000 below capacity.” Wenger: Be more like Tottenham \nWenger has called on Arsenal fans to be more like Tottenham and get behind their team, which would have undoubtedly not pleased the Gunners faithful whose side currently trail their north London rivals by three points in the Premier League. \nAnd Payton admits even the club's most loyal of supporters are being selective about what games they attend. \n“A significant number of season ticket holders now pick and choose the games they come to,” Payton admitted. “Some of this is the driven by apathy and the sense the club has gone stale but it also reflects the change in the fanbase.\" \nJust last season, a protest was held inside the Emirates ahead of their game against Norwich, with some fans urging Wenger to resign, while others sang his name in support. \nBut it seems the latest fan activism coming from the Emirates will be done far more respectively, considering it could well be Wenger's 21st and final year in charge of Arsenal. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
