Buffalo Trace Distillery , which makes Old Rip Van Winkle, Pappy Van Winkle and other bourbons, will release 710 bottles of this product in April, according to a news release. This bourbon will be two years older than the hard-to-come-by Pappy Van Winkle 23-year-old bourbon that often gets bourbon fans blood pumping. This 25-year-old release of Pappy Van Winkle will be available in April for a suggested… more Buffalo Trace Distillery The barrels were distilled in the spring and fall of 1989 and stored on the lower levels of a metal clad warehouse at the Van Winkle family distillery in Shively, Ky. In 2002, the barrels were moved to Buffalo Trace Distillery, where they continued to age for another 12 years. In 2014, the Buffalo Trace team took the bourbon out of barrels and put it into stainless steel tanks to halt the aging process. This bourbon is bottled at 100 proof. Suggested retail pricing is $1,800 for a 750-milliliter bottle. But you'd get more than an old bourbon for that price. The special release is coming in handmade decanter-style bottles from Glencairn Crystal Studio in East Kilbride, Scotland. The bottle information is engraved on each decanter, individually numbered and hand finished. A glass top for the decanter also is included. Each decanter is packaged in a handmade wooden box crafted in North Carolina. And the lid is constructed with oak staves from the 11 barrels that held this bourbon. The outside of the box bears a metal plaque with the Old Rip Van Winkle logo and states “asleep 25 years in the wood.” “This is a once-in-a-lifetime offering, and the beautiful decanter and wooden box just take it to the next level and make it something in which I’m very proud to be associated,” Old Rip Van Winkle president Julian Van Winkle said in the release. There was no mention in the release of where the bourbon will be sold. David A. Mann covers these beats: Restaurants, beverage industry, manufacturing, distribution/logistics, unions.
