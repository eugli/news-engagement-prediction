(AFP) \nAt least two attacks by the Islamic State group near a Syrian town just captured by Turkish forces and Syrian opposition fighters have killed more than 60 people, including civilians and two Turkish soldiers. \nThe attacks happened yesterday, as ISIS retreated from one of its last remaining strongholds in northern Syria, Turkey's news agency and Syrian activists said. \nIn a hallmark ISIS attack, a suicide car bomb went off outside a security office operated by the Syrian opposition in the village of Sousian, 8km north of al-Bab, killing 60 people. \nMost of those killed were civilians who had gathered seeking permits and escorts to return to al-Bab, a day after it was liberated from the extremist group, a Syrian military commander in the city said. Members of the Free Syrian Army have worked to clear land mines from al-Bab. (AFP) \nAt least six fighters were among those killed in the attack, according to Turkey's Prime Minister, who spoke in Ankara. \nHours later, another car bomb attack was reported in Sousian, claiming the lives of at least eight, according to activist groups. \nThere were no further details on the attack, and the Aleppo Media Center later removed the report from its website. \nDespite the violence, Turkey's chief of military staff said his country had \"achieved the goals\" it had set for its military operation in northern Syria. \nThe Turkish military earlier announced that its troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters are in full control of al-Bab but efforts to clear it of mines and explosive devices were still ongoing. \nGeneral Hulusi Akar spoke during a visit to the border with Syria, a day after Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition forces captured the town. \nHe did not say, however, if Turkey would end its operations in northern Syria or move on to liberate other areas. \nThe Turkish military said that it currently controls 1925 square kilometers in northern Syria since its incursion there last August. \nThe Turkey-backed operations have been aimed at creating a safe zone along the border, by deterring ISIS militants as well as Kurdish rebels it sees as an extension of its own insurgent group. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials have spoken of plans to move the Turkish forces east toward the town of Manbij that is held by US-backed forces that include Syrian Kurdish fighters in a bid to oust them from the area. \nTurkish leaders have also suggested that Turkish troops could take part in operations to liberate the Islamic State group's de facto capital, Raqqa. \nGeneral Akar said that Turkey would provide \"every kind of support\" to help life in al-Bab return to normal and for the local population to return to their homes. \nYesterday, civilians attempting to return to al-Bab were hardest hit. \nMohammed al-Tawil, a leading Syrian opposition fighter north of al-Bab, said \"these people have suffered a lot\". \n\"They have been waiting for this moment\" to return home, he said. \nMr Al-Tawil, a member of the opposition al-Bab military council, said about four fighters manning the checkpoint had been killed in the attack. \nMr Al-Tawil, who was at the security office at the time of the explosion, said the rest of the casualties were civilians from al-Bab. \nTurkey's Anadolu news agency said at least 41 wounded were taken for treatment to the Turkish border town of Kilis. \nAl-Bab had been controlled by ISIS since late 2013. \nThe militants finally retreated on Thursday after more than two months of intense fighting. \nAl-Bab had a prewar population of about 60,000, many of whom were displaced to neighboring areas, including during the most recent clashes. \nISIS militants remain in control of areas around the town. \nThe Sousian security office was supervising the issuing of permits and providing escorts for civilians wishing to return to al-Bab. \nMr Al-Tawil said at least two groups of about 150 civilians had already left early on yesterday for al-Bab, accompanied by a mine sweeping unit run by Syrian opposition fighters. \nFootage emerging from al-Bab revealed the severe damage to the town's streets and buildings. \nMustafa Sultan, a resident of al-Bab and a media activist who was in the town Thursday and yesterday, said it was laden with land mines and remains largely deserted. \nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least seven opposition fighters have been killed since Thursday in the town by land mines left behind by IS — a trademark of the retreating militants. \nYesterday's deaths Friday bring the total number of Turkish soldiers killed in Syria since August to 70. \nIn Geneva, the UN's Syria envoy, Staffan De Mistura, held his second day of meetings with government and opposition delegations in a bid to move closer to a political solution to end the war. \nNassr al-Hariri, the opposition's delegation head, told reporters he had insisted on a transitional government for Syria in line with earlier UN Security Council resolutions and said it was the opposition, not sitting President Bashar Assad, which was most fit to fight terrorism. \nHe said the government was attacking opposition-held territory in the country while rebels were fighting ISIS in al-Bab. \n\"We are the ones who place the priority on countering terrorism,\" he said. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:55:18.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
