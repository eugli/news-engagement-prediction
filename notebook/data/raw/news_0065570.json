FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Selwyn River near Christchurch is polluted, running a green colour at times. \nThat will mean an extra 10,000 km of swimmable lakes and rivers - or 400km extra each year. \nREAD MORE: \nIn a key move the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management will be changed to replace \"wadeable\" with \"swimmable\". LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ \nEnvironment Minister Nick Smith announces the new water target. \nOther changes included clarifying the consideration of economic opportunities and requiring limits for nitrogen and phosphorus. \n\"This ambitious plan to improve the water quality in our lakes and rivers recognises that New Zealanders expect to be able to take a dip in their local river or lake without getting a nasty bug,\" Smith said. \nThe plan was backed up by national regulations requiring stock to be fenced out of waterways, new national policy requirements on regional councils to strengthen their plan rules, on issues such as sewage discharges and planting riparian margins, a new Freshwater Improvement Fund and new maps that clearly identify where improvements are needed. FAIRFAX NZ \nSouthland's Mataura River is polluted by freezing works and a dairy factory. \n\"This 90 per cent goal by 2040 is challenging and is estimated to cost the Government, farmers and councils $2 billion over the next 23 years. It will make us a world leader in water quality standards for swimming, and that's important for New Zealand's growing tourism industry. It will return our rivers and lakes to a standard not seen in 50 years while recognising that our frequent major rainfalls mean a 100 per cent standard is not realistic,\" Smith said. \nThe target covers the length of rivers over 0.4m deep and the perimeters of lakes greater than 1.5km, which total 54,000km. \nRegional targets to achieve the national goals would be worked through with regional councils by March 2018. JEREMY WILKINSON \nGreen spokeswoman on water Catherine Delahunty says the new water targets just shift the goalposts. \n\"Some regional targets will need to be greater than the 90 per cent and others, where it is more difficult to achieve, will be less.\" \nThe plan was about improving the frequency that we can swim in our lakes and rivers, noting that even our cleanest rivers breach swimming water quality standards during storms.\" \nPrimary Industries Minister Nathan Guy said to ensure the changes were practical for farmers exclusions would be staged, starting this year through to 2030, \"depending on the stock type and land slope\". SUPPLIED \nA stream in North Canterbury which Fish and Game Council claim is polluted by by dairy farming. \nThere were long term benefits for the primary industries and wider economy. \n\"Overseas markets and consumers increasingly demand a strong environmental performance over and above regulatory requirements. In this context, protecting New Zealand's natural advantage has never been more important.\" \nThe 'Our Land and Water' National Science Challenge was investing $96.9m over 10 years into this. ROBERT KITCHIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nEnvironment Minister Nick Smith announces new swimmable fresh water targets. \nBut the Green Party said New Zealanders who want swimmable lakes and rivers have been let down by the announcement. \nThen party's spokesperson on water, Catherine Delahunty, said the standards had simply been re-labelled. \n\"The Prime Minister thinks he can pull a fast one on New Zealanders by just shifting the goalposts and calling what was 'wadeable' now 'swimmable',\" she said. \n\"New Zealanders asked for rivers clean enough to swim in, not a re-branded version of 'dirty'.\" The announcement would not stop the pollution of rivers from dirty dairying, or the damaging effects of irrigation. \"By saying that a river with a grade of 'excellent' can be so polluted that 1 person in 20 gets sick from a waterborne disease, Bill English is deceiving our kids and grandkids, who are missing out on clean rivers.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:19:53.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
