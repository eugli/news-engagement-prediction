Stewart, who's made some fiery and impassioned appearances on The Late Show in the past, came out dressed as Trump -- rocking a six-foot-long red tie, ill-fitting blue suit and literally a dead, stuffed animal strapped to his head. The longtime collaborators could barely keep a straight face while talking about Stewart's costume, and watching the pair chat felt like being in the room with two best friends reconnecting for the first time after years apart. WATCH: Jon Stewart Impersonates Donald Trump While Joking Around With Stephen Colbert on 'Late Show' After goofing around, Stewart got down to business, reading off three (satirical) executive orders he said Trump is getting ready to sign in the coming days. The first order will ask China to give us their Great Wall, so that we don't have to build our own. As for how to get Mexico to pay for it? \"When the Great Wall arrives at the southern border, we shut the lights out and pretend we're not home,\" Stewart said, playing the role of Trump. \"It's [cash on delivery], Mexico has to sign for it, boom, they have to pay for it. Done.\" As for Trump's second order, Stewart says he's going to declare one official national language, and it's not English. \"The new official language of the United States is bulls**t,\" Stewart read from the fake executive order. \"I, Donald J. Trump, have instructed my staff to speak only in bulls**t. And by the way, none of that, 'Sure, I'll speak bulls**t at work, but at home I'm going to use facts and real information.' No! Bulls**t all the time! Immersion is the only way to be fluent.\" WATCH: Stephen Colbert Shares Emotional Reaction to Election Results, Cheers on Anti-Trump Protesters Finally, Stewart got a bit more serious with his final fictitious executive order, which he once again read from the perspective of the president. \"I, Donald J. Trump, do declareâ€¦ that I am exhausting,\" Stewart deadpanned. \"The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public.\" The former Daily Show host showed a hint of the razor wit and deep political passion that made his time on the Comedy Central program so popular when he delivered what amounted to an impassioned plea to the people, explaining, \"It is going to take relentless stamina, vigilance and every institutional check and balance this great country can muster,\" to keep Trump from \"going full [Emperor] Palpatine.\" WATCH: Stephen Colbert Brings Back 'Colbert Report' Persona to Say Goodbye to President Obama \"No one action will be adequate. All actions will be necessary,\" Stewart added, speaking directly to the camera. \"And if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight, and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact, then [Trump] will have demonstrated the greatness of America. Just not the way [he] thought.\" Last July, Stewart made a surprise appearance on The Late Show where he (briefly) took over Colbert's desk to deliver a blistering attack on Trump and some of his most extreme public advocates.
