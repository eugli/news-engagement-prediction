A club statement said: 'Bristol City can confirm that it made an offer over the weekend to Bristol Rovers for an undisclosed fee for Matthew Taylor and that offer was accepted.' The furore generated by Taylor's move led to a police presence around his home after the transfer was announced. The deadline day transfer of Taylor is set to be the subject of a Football League investigation It is already an issue for the All England Club that their men's singles final in 2018 is going to clash with football's World Cup final. The Wimbledon showcase starts at 2pm, as per tradition, and FIFA have brought forward the kick-off of the final in Moscow to 6pm — 4pm in the UK — to suit global broadcasting schedules, leaving the strong possibility that the tennis will overrun into the football. The BBC will have to decide which to prioritise on BBC1, though viewing figures will be affected either way. And what if Andy Murray is in the Wimbledon final and a home nation reaches the final in Moscow? The 2018 World Cup final will clash with the Wimbledon men's singles final next summer NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is known to be concerned that Lady Gaga might use her half-time performance in Sunday's Super Bowl to make a statement against Donald Trump. Gaga has a good conduct clause in her contract but Goodell knows she could easily do what she likes on stage. American superstar Lady Gaga is preparing for half-time performance in Sunday's Super Bowl Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan isn't waiting until he returns to football to go on the front foot on social media when his own forthright views are challenged. Gary Neville was called 'an ignorant, arrogant jumped-up little backroom lawyer' and Stan Collymore was reminded: '...Bit like me dragging up you booting Ulrika Jonsson down the stairs in France.' Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan hit back at Stan Collymore on Twitter RFU tackle the pirates The RFU are promising to crack down on pirate corporate hospitality following their plan to spend £66million refurbishing the East Stand at Twickenham to improve their official facilities. The aim is to host the entire prawn sandwich brigade in one place inside the stadium rather than in marquees outside. And to make the most of a project whose costs have already risen by £13m, the RFU need to kill off unlicensed competition to the re-branded England Rugby Hospitality. The same measures used during the 2015 World Cup to protect the official hospitality suppliers will be implemented again. RFU plan to spend £66m refurbishing Twickenham's East Stand to improve official facilities The word at the Sport Integrity Forum held in London this week is that FIFA are set to disband their integrity unit following the departure of German police chief Ralf Mutschke, who had led the fight against match-fixing in particular. Such a move, suggested by a number of delegates, would follow FIFA abandoning their control of agents and their anti-racism task force, bizarrely declaring their work 'completely fulfilled'. However, a FIFA spokesman claimed there were no plans to stop the integrity work and that a successor to Mutschke, who left in December, as head of security would be appointed in due course.
