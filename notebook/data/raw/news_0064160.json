In fact, the ability to link between pages and sites is what created the \"web\" in the first place. \nUnfortunately, clicking a link is always a bit of a gamble. On the other end of a link could be the information you want to see, or it could be a malicious website, virus-filled download or inappropriate content. \nSometimes the only way to know for sure is to click. However, there are some important questions you can ask first that will give you a good idea if the link is safe or not. 1. Where did the link come from? \nPerhaps the most important question you can ask is how you got the link in the first place. Was it in an unsolicited email or text message? Did you get it in a Google search? Was it in a friend's Facebook post? \nAs a rule, if a link is unsolicited, you don't want to click on it. Hackers send out malicious links in emails and texts daily. They're especially good at putting links in emails that look like they're from legitimate companies . If the link is from someone you know, check with them first to make sure they really sent it, and that their account wasn't hacked. \nGenerally, links you find yourself are going to be safer, but you still need to be cautious. A Google search is a good example. Hackers use a tactic called \"search engine poisoning\" to get malicious links to the top of a Google search for popular words and topics. \nThe same goes for Facebook. In general, the links your friends post should be OK, but one of them might have been tricked into sharing a malicious link, or they installed an app that does it for them. \nKeep reading and we're going to look at some other questions that will help reveal those dangers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:45:48.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
