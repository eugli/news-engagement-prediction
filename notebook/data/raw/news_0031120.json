He's a full patch member of the Mayans MC, Santo Padre. He lives with the burden of being the \"lesser son\" in a proud Mexican family who loves few and trusts even fewer. \nCardenas' credits include ABC's American Crime and the upcoming feature East Los . He's repped by Abrams Artists Agency. \nCardenas joins a cast that includes Edward James Olmos , who is set as Felipe Reyes, the family's formerly strong patriarch who, after years of being crushed by bullets and labor, struggles to keep his past buried and lead his sons down a lawful and righteous path. \nSutter will co-write the spinoff alongside Elgin James as well as direct the pilot. \nPicked up to pilot in December, the SOA spinoff was first revealed by Sutter in a cover story for The Hollywood Reporter in August 2015 prior to the launch of his period drama The Bastard Executioner . He said the spinoff would be a different show and that \"tone, pace, storytelling will be unique.\" (The spinoff will not be set in Northern California, as Sons was.) \n\"I wanted to find a strong, unique Latino voice. Because I didn't think a white guy from Jersey should be writing about Latin culture and traditions. Elgin is that voice,\" Sutter said at the time.
