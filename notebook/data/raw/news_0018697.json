Netflix announced a new racist anti-white show called \"Dear White People.\" Would it be OK to make a show called dear black people? No. \n\"Irresponsibly igniting more race conflict, stop the division! Shame on u @netflix. This is disgusting propaganda,\" one user wrote on Twitter. \nA nother said: \"You really want to give me another reason to cancel my account. Done.\" \nThe response prompted a fierce debate on social media, not just about the film but also race relations in the US . \n\"People protesting \"Dear White People\" are the reason there is a movie and TV series called, \"Dear White People\",\" one Twitter user wrote. \nAnother tweeted: \"'Black People: Dear white people...'
