Am I the only one who doesn't know what a daith is? I wondered. I decided to poll some friends and coworkers to see if they knew. I received a few bizarre answers like \"a type of cake\" or \"a villain,\" and I also got a few answers that were a bit warmer like \"a piercing on that top part of your ear.\"\n But out of everyone I asked, only one person knew exactly what a daith piercing was and that's because she wants to get one. In short, it's a piercing on the part of your ear above the tragus called the crus helix. After finding out what it is and looking through photos of daith piercings, I now want to get mine pierced too.\nBrian Keith Thompson from Body Electric Tattoo told Refinery29 this specific piercing style is blowing up in L.A. right now, which is easy to see because it looks cool. Thompson also says it's easier to heal than other piercings since it's tucked in the ear. Don't know about you, but I'm sold.
