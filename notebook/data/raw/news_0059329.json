Prepare yourselves, the corny food jokes only get worse from here! \nAnthony Bourdain, the hottest silver-haired grumpy TV food person not named Geoffrey Zakarian, has been single for a few months. He split up with his wife of nine years back in September. Nine years is a lot of years, and you’d think he’d want to make up for lost time by twirling his fork around as much random spaghetti as possible. But apparently he’s already off the market again. Page Six says that 60-year-old Anthony is head-over-veal (show me the door) for 41-year-old actress Asia Argento, who is Dario Argento’s daughter. Anthony and Asia have been papped in Italy walking hand-in-hand and making out while grocery shopping. Page Six says that one Italian news site has declared they’ve “ fallen in love. ” \nAnthony filmed an episode of Parts Unknown in Rome late last year, and he claimed that it wouldn’t have been possible without the help of Asia. No word on if they got together during filming or after. I’m going to choose to believe it happened during, if only because it’s fun to think of a crusty prick like Anthony Bourdain on a romantic Eat Pray Love -style spiritual journey. \nBoth Anthony and Asia like Italian food and what more do you need in a relationship? Someone to sex on and then eat pasta with sounds nice. And in between that, they can laugh about how her daddy makes movies that terrorize people’s nightmares, and now she’s dating a dude who lives to terrorize Guy Fieri .
