Feb.11, 2017. (AP Photo/Alvaro Barrientos) Real Madrid returned to the top of La Liga after winning a testing away clash against Osasuna 3-1 on Saturday thanks to goals from talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, midfielder Isco and substitute Lucas Vazquez. Osasuna striker Sergio Leon cancelled out Ronaldo’s 24th-minute opener in the 33rd after defender Tano had been carried off with a sickening double leg break. Isco restored Real’s lead in the 62nd and Zinedine Zidane’s side added a third through Vazquez with the last kick of the game.\nReal goalkeeper Keylor Navas needed to produce a string of quality saves to preserve their advantage before Vazquez sealed only a second league win in seven visits to the perennial La Liga strugglers. Real top the standings on 49 points, leapfrogging Barcelona on 48 after the champions thrashed Alaves 6-0 on Saturday. Zidane’s side have two games in hand on their arch rivals as they bid to win the title for the first time since 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:45:09.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
