(Susan Walsh / AP) Lisa Schencker after its $89,000 price tag shocked patients and members of Congress.\nMarathon Pharmaceuticals' deflazacort, used to treat patients with a fatal muscle wasting disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week. \nBut many have criticized its $89,000-a-year price, noting the drug has been available outside the U.S. for years, and some Americans have been importing it for as little as $1,200 a year. \nMarathon CEO Jeffrey Aronin said in a letter Monday to the Duchenne community, posted on the company's website, that he expected patients would pay a standard copay of $20 or less per prescription — and Marathon had good reasons for pricing it at $89,000. \nBut he also said Monday the company would pause its \"commercialization efforts\" in order to meet with \"community leaders\" to further discuss the issue. \nThe about-face followed a scathing letter sent to Marathon on Monday by Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in which they called the pricing \"outrageous.\" \n\"Exorbitantly pricing potentially life-saving medications that should be widely available for a fraction of the price hinders patient access and drives up cost for the entire health care sector,\" they wrote. muscular dystrophy — only the second FDA-approved drug for the disease and the first for everyone with the disorder.\nMarathon Pharmaceutical's deflazacort,... \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a Northbrook pharmaceutical company's drug to treat a deadly form of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy — only the second FDA-approved drug for the disease and the first for everyone with the disorder. \nMarathon Pharmaceutical's deflazacort,... (Lisa Schencker) \n\"Marathon's apparent abuse of government-granted exclusivity periods and incentives to sell what should be a widely available drug for $89,000 a year is unconscionable.\" \nBabar Ghias, Marathon chief financial officer, last week told the Tribune the price was low compared with other drugs treating rare diseases that affect a similar number of patients. The top 100 orphan drugs — medications used to treat rare diseases — in the U.S. cost an average of $111,820 a year per patient in 2014, according to a report by Evaluate, a market research firm. \nIn his letter Monday, Aronin said Marathon set the price at $89,000 based on the resources it invested to bring the drug to market and complete clinical studies, as well as to fund future research and ensure broad patient access through insurer reimbursement and its own assistance programs. \nBut Sanders and Cummings accused Marathon of \"abusing\" the nation's orphan drug program, in which companies get exclusive rights to sell a drug for seven years. The idea behind such exclusivity is to encourage research into treatments for rare diseases, not to reward companies for bringing drugs to market that already have been available for decades, the lawmakers wrote.

Deflazacort, which will be sold in the U.S. under the brand name Emflaza, is a steroid meant to improve muscle function, so those with the disease might be able to feed themselves, control their wheelchairs or walk longer. \nIt's the second drug approved by the FDA for treating Duchenne — the first one was just approved last year. Many patients also have been using a different steroid called prednisone, though prednisone is not specifically approved for treating Duchenne. \nTwitter @lschencker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:47:07.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
