He thought he was so clever getting away with it, but he wasn't.\" \nThe pair met five years ago at a Muslim speed dating event and married in 2013, before having son Hashim, now three. But around a year ago she noticed he was going out more, getting frustrated at being at home with the family, and spending more time \"at the gym\".
