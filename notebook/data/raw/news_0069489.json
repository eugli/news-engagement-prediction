Image 24 of 24 Food & Wine visits the last traditional barbacoa place in Texas left standing 1 / 24 Back to Gallery It’s no secret that one of the Texas’ favorite delicacies is barbacoa, a delicious treat traditionally made from whole cow heads.\nA food writer from Food & Wine recently spent some time with one of the best barbacoa cooks in the state of Texas for a story.\nTHE TEXAS TRINITY: 5 things newbies should know about Texas barbecue\nThe outlet goes all over the world looking for the best bites, even all the way south to the bottom of the Lone Star State.\nBetsy Andrews went to Brownsville and Vera’s Backyard Bar-B-Que, an establishment that has been in business since 1955. At Vera’s their barbacoa is cooked the traditional way – under the ground – and made from actual cow-head meat and not rump or oven-roast, Andrews writes, like some other places.\nHouston Chronicle barbecue expert J.C. Reid wrote in 2015 that Vera’s is the last in Texas and likely the United States where you can get barbacoa cooked in an underground pit. Gotta love the grandfather clause.\nVera buys nearly 50 cow heads a week for processing. They are cooked inside industrial aluminum foil for 12 hours in a specially-made pit.\nTOTALLY HOU: Things all Houstonians have said at one time or another\nSounds like we’re due for a trip down to Brownsville.\nOwner Mando Vera even got Andrews to enjoy a well-cooked and seasoned cow’s eyeball, which older patrons prefer a little bit more than the younger ones. They've had longer to develop a taste for it we guess.\nHere in Houston, Reid writes, Gerardo's Drive-in on Patton Street makes what is arguably the best barbacoa in the city.\nFor more meat worship check out Tony Freemantle's HoustonChronicle.com visit to Gerardo's back in 2013.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717458/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717447/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717456/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717457/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717451/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717441/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717462/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717462/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717445/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717443/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717442/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/03/51/8141396/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717460/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717457/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717455/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717447/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717453/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717443/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717459/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717444/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717450/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717448/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717460/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717452/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717455/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717445/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717441/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717461/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717463/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717463/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717454/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717451/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717454/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717453/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717448/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717452/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717461/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717444/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/restaurants-bars/bbq/article/Barbacoa-and-the-tradition-of-Tejano-barbecue-6192235.php", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717458/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/columnists/chronicles/article/Gerardo-s-will-shake-the-barbacoa-blues-4874242.php", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717456/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717449/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/03/51/8141396/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717459/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.foodandwine.com/travel/a-day-with-pitmaster-mando-vera", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717450/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717449/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/22/8717442/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-21T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:04:25.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
