According to PEP News, the couple's silence about the real issue between them sparked many rumours recently, with some accusing Matsunaga of using Gonzales to gain popularity, while others are saying that Gonzales might have been cheating on him behind his back. Concerned about the speculations, Matsunaga recently addressed the issue and denied all the allegations against them. In a comment section of his Instagram, the actor responded to a fan's message, saying, \"This is already getting out of control. What you guys read has nothing to do with what happened between me and Erich.\" \"Even after everything that happened between the two of us, we both respect each other and there is nothing like that. Nonsense! I know Erich and she would never do such a thing. And to all the haters, I just pray that God changes your heart. God bless you guys,\" he added. Rumours of trouble in paradise sparked last week when Netizens noticed that Gonzales has removed photos of her and Matsunaga together. Matsunaga later admitted that the two of them were going through some personal issues.
