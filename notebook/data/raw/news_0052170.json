(Brian McHugh/CBC)\nLeif the Lucky is everywhere during Carnival, from the moment he bursts out of his snow hut to light the carnival flame for the opening ceremonies, through a week of talent shows, games, dances and … dinners. Lots of them.\n\"Surviving the varieties of food\" is one of the hardest things, said Elms.\nA hefty bit of eating Everybody wants Leif at the table, and a typical week's fare includes chili for lunch and cabbage rolls for supper one day, Swedish meatballs and Jigg's Dinner the next, and baked beans the day after.\nThen there's the challenge of wearing a heavy, thick costume, consisting of sealskin boots, a fur coat, mittens, a shield and a helmet with the classic horns — indoors and out. Elms says it can get pretty hot in there.\nBut the payoff is the reaction he gets from children who get a thrill to see Leif coming.\n\"The eyes pop open, the jaw drops down, and if they haven't seen me before, they're thinking, 'Is he friendly, and why is he carrying that big sword?'\"\nDave Elms says \"surviving the varieties of food\" is the toughest part of his Winter Carnival duties. (Corner Brook Winter Carnival)\nWhen Elms began playing Leif in 1993, he was hooked right away: \"Who's going to turn down a chance to play a Viking?\" he told CBC's Corner Brook Morning Show .\nIn those early days, he was cautious about committing so much time to the carnival, especially since he and his wife, Sandra, had two young children at the time. Elms was working full-time, and he could be away from home for days at a time.\nGetting young people involved He decided to just go year to year with his commitment, but he keeps coming back.\n\"It's been an absolute honour, pleasure and thrill,\" he said.\nA naturally sociable type, whose volunteer activities have included the Children's Wish Foundation, The Janeway Children's Hospital Foundation and Corner Brook community television, Elms enjoys taking in as many Carnival events as he can.\nElms is especially proud of the annual Leifling Gala, an event that he and his wife, Sandra started.\nA Leifling is a young person chosen to be a kind-of Leif the Lucky apprentice, who follows him around to learn the ropes. Elms says the event has helped encourage young people to get involved and become carnival volunteers.\nSo for Dave Elms, will it be another 25 years playing the guy with the sword and the horned helmet?\n\"You never know,\" he said.\nDave Elms, seen during the Corner Brook Winter Carnival of 2011, started playing Leif the Lucky in 1993.
