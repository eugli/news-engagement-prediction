But wouldn't it also be unfair to not mention Snape in a conversation about Rickman? \nThe actor whose demise in 2016 left a lingering sorrow in the hearts of Potterheads across the world immortalised the character of Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts professor and helped us see the him for the human he was. \nOn Alan Rickman's birth anniversary today, let's remember him with these five dialogues from the Harry Potter series that he immortalised. \n1. When Snape produces the patronus same as Lily's and Dumbledore realises he still loves Potter's mother. \n\"'After all this time?' 'Always,' said Snape.\" \nAlso Read: This was the secret JK Rowling told Alan Rickman about Snape during the filming of Harry Potter \n2. When Severus Snape discovers that Harry Potter is to be killed \n\"I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter..\" \n3. When Snape decided to be his usual, sarcastic self \n\"Oh, very good. Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent.'\" \nAlso Read: Life at Oxford not scary, all thanks to Harry Potter \n4. On the art of potion-making \n\"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death--if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\" \n5. On Legilimency--the art that muggles can refer to as 'mind-reading' \n\"The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader.\" Let's all raise our wands for Alan Rickman, shall we? \nTo get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
