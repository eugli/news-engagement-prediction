Getty Images This illustration is one artist’s idea of what the surface of a planet called Proxima B might look like Reuters 3 A Nasa illustration of an exoplanet, the name for any alien world orbiting another star \nNASA has been stingy with the details so far but the press conference is being touted as the biggest news related to exoplanets since the announcement last year of an earth-like planet orbiting our closest sta r, dubbed Proxima Centauri. \nThe information to be revealed by NASA will be simultaneously published in the journal Nature on Thursday and is embargoed until the start of the press conference. \nHowever US tech publication CNET claims to have seen the findings and said; “Let’s just say it could very easily provide us with new settings for many future works of science fiction.” \nTake from that what you will, but judging by the experts that will be in attendance for the conference, it’s probably going to be noteworthy. Getty Images 3 Drawing issued by the European Southern Observatory showing the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri \nThose giving the public briefing include Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Sean Carey, the manager of NASA’s Spitzer Science Center at Caltech and Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nThe foreshadowing of the event has led to intense speculation online. \nThe press release issued by NASA made it to the front page of reddit where at the time of writing it has attracted more than 1650 comments and sparked a lengthy debate about what NASA might reveal. \nOn the basis of the scientists scheduled to conduct the press conference, one reddit user speculated that the announcement could have something to do with the collection of atmospheric data from a potentially promising exoplanet.

They found exoplanets (maybe even earth like) and were able to get atmospheric data (maybe oxygen) from its observation,” they wrote. \nOthers wondered if it might have something to do with Proxima Centauri. \nThanks to NASA’s Kepler Telescope which has been busily scanning 150,000 stars for signs of orbiting bodies in recent years, we’ve discovered that on average every star has at least one planet if not many more circling it. \nIn May last year, the space agency revealed it had found a further 1284 new planets, more than doubling the number of known exoplanets in the universe. And the most important part: nine of them could theoretically be habitable. \nThe public will be able to ask questions during the NASA briefing later this week via Twitter by using the hashtag #askNASA and scientists will conduct an AMA (ask me anything) on reddit following the press conference. \nThe event will air live on NASA Television and the agency’s website. \nWe pay for your stories!
