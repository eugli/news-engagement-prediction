(Supplied: Dan Broun) \n\"Unfortunately it's all at risk if logging upstream commences and the sediment and siltation that we've come to expect from logging comes down that catchment and impacts on these animals.\" \nThe Bob Brown Foundation tagged and released about eight crayfish over two days, but said Mr Jordan said it is not known exactly how many crayfish were in the area, and that available research was limited. \n\"What we do know is that it's a very healthy catchment and it's a catchment where the lobsters are breeding at a much younger age and the blue coloration is particularly unique to this catchment,\" Mr Jordan said. \n\"These animals have been wiped out in many catchments across northern Tasmania because of the impact of siltation in the streams.\" \nThe group has previously expressed concerns about the threat to wedge-tailed eagles in the same area. \n\"It's not the only issue facing this logging operation, we've got known eagle nests on the site of the proposed coupes and we know we have species like the masked owl and the spotted tail quoll and the Tasmanian Devil on this site,\" Mr Jordan said. \n\"If logging goes ahead, all of those species are going to be impacted.\" \nPreviously Forestry Tasmania said exclusion zones would be established around any wedge-tailed eagle nests discovered to prevent disturbance to breeding. \nThe environmentalists fear the area could be logged within weeks and have stepped up their campaign to have the area taken off Forestry Tasmania's logging schedule. \n\"We of course don't think there should be any logging in the Tarkine, we believe the Tarkine needs to be protected as the Tarkine National Park and a World Heritage area and we think that is the best way forward,\" Mr Jordan said. Logging impact concerns dismissed by minister \nThe Resources Minister, Guy Barnett, described the concerns as a stunt to drum up publicity. \n\"The Government is committed to the protection of all threatened species, including the giant freshwater crayfish,\" he said. \n\"The Forest practices code includes rigorous measures for the protection of all threatened species and offers guidance through the threatened fauna adviser, which is used to inform forest practices plans. \n\"Where appropriate, Forestry Tasmania's forest practices plans include a range of provisions for the protection of the giant freshwater crayfish, including streamside reserves. \n\"These reserves meet, and in most cases exceed, all requirements under the forest practises code.\" \nA spokesman from Forestry Tasmania said no decision had been made about harvesting the coupe. \nThey declined to respond to concerns about the freshwater crayfish population.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:10:12.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
