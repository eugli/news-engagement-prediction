(Photo: Linda Källérus) \nSplit, about an ex-soldier (played by James McAvoy) with 23 personalities who kidnaps three teenage girls, ends with a news report that describes the arrest of Kevin Crumb (McAvoy), comparing it to the capture of Unbreakable baddie Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). Bruce Willis, who played superhero security guard David Dunn in that movie, is seen seated at the counter of a diner, watching the televised report. \nThe ending came after the movie was largely completed. \n“People who saw it early were like, ‘You know what? This really reminds me of Unbreakable .’ And I’m like, ‘Really, that’s interesting,’ \" Shyamalan told USA TODAY. \"When they see the movie, they’ll be like, ‘I knew it!’ Maybe they’ll even think they gave me the idea.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:48:05.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
