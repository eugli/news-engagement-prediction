Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email It's been a big week in the history of Leicester City. \nThe Premier League champions (we still have to fact-check that on Wikipedia, even nine months on) produced a brave performance in Spain, going down 2-1 to Sevilla in their Champions League first-leg. \nIt felt like the springboard Claudio Ranieri needed to kickstart their season, even this late on. \nThen he got sacked in the side room of a hotel (no jokes please). \n(Photo: Clive Rose) And tonight sees them play their first game without their now legendary gaffer, as they host Liverpool. \nWe've looked into the Row Zed crystal ball ahead of the fixture, and conjured up these things which are bound to happen...\n1) Sky Sports go over the top with their Ranieri montage (Photo: Getty) It'll probably take about 20 minutes for the first word to be uttered on Monday Night Football, once their epic montage intro is finished up.\nThe video editors must be gutted they've just missed out on Oscars season.\n2) Gary Neville to go on an epic rant Once they eventually start talking, it won't be long before Neville gets fired up about Ranieri's treatment. \"I just can't believe the man who's won them - WHO'S WON THEM - the Premier League has been treated this way.\"\nAt some point, Jamie Carragher will interject to say the following:\n3) \"I never once went to see the board when I was a player!\" (Photo: AFP) Carra will then go on to say how a player's focus should be \"solely on the pitch\" and probably drop in how much football has changed since he started out, just for good measure.\n4) Leicester City fans singing Ranieri songs non-stop A Leicester fan with a Claudio Ranieri mask (Photo: Action Images via Reuters / Tom Jacobs) The fans will want to make their feelings known to the board right from the off, so expect chants aplenty in the Italian's honour.\nThat'll probably quieten down if they find themselves 4-0 up, mind.\n5) Someone to say \"Ranieri deserves his own statue\" (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) This could happen at any point - and said by a presenter, pundit or commentator - but it will definitely happen. You can be sure of that.\n6) A message to Ranieri on a player's shirt (Photo: Plumb Images) If one of Claudio's more loyal charges sticks it in the back of the net, there's every chance they'll show a message on their vest. \nSomething like \"HONESTLY CLAUDIO, IT WASN'T ME WHO WENT TO THE BOARD!\" may be a fitting tribute.\n7) \"We're sure Claudio is watching wherever he is\" (Photo: Plumb Images) The commentator will blatantly drop this in at some point, probably when the Foxes are losing - hinting at the Italian being a little pleased they're still struggling without him.\n8) If Leicester win... (Photo: Reuters) ...Jurgen Klopp will bemoan his side's defeat and say it's because Leicester players came out with \"a lot of extra fight, you know\" after their turbulent week. It won't be nothing to do with their poor form in recent months, oh no.\nEven though it'll be predictable, we can't wait for it.\nBring it on. poll loading Who will win this one? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Leicester Liverpool Draw Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Liverpool FC Newsletter Follow @MirrorRowZed Subscribe to our Liverpool FC newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Claudio Ranieri Leicester City FC Liverpool FC Premier League Jurgen Klopp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:48:13.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
