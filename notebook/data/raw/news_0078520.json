SpaceX to send two people on manned mission around the moon next year \nWe think you’ll want to make space in your bathtub… even though she’ll eventually weigh 3,000lb. \nFiona required critical care 24 hours a day after she was born on January 24, and was too weak to stand or feed normally from her mum Bibi. \nBut she’s now doing much better, and has become globally famous after Cincinnati Zoo shared a sweet video of her getting her sea legs in a plastic paddling pool. Fiona was born six weeks premature (Picture: Cincinnati Zoo) \nHere she is trying to stand for the first time, shortly after she was born: \nAnd here she is now, all grown up in the Big Kid pool: To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Fiona continues to do better with bottle feedings. She weighs 59 pounds, 30 more than when she was born! #TeamFiona #fionafix pic.twitter.com/C0CSh4xagB \n— Cincinnati Zoo (@CincinnatiZoo) February 26, 2017 \nAt the moment, she is still too weak to be able to reunite fulltime with her mum Bibi and dad Henry. Woman, 96, dies after being badly bitten by bed bugs \nThe average female hippo weighs 3,000lb while males weigh between 3,500 to 9,920lbs. \nFiona weighed just 29 pounds when she was born, the lightest ever recorded hippo birth. The normal range is 55-120 pounds. \nShe previously made history from the womb when scientists captured the first ever ultrasound image of a Nile hippo fetus. Fiona's diary \nStaff at the zoo have started a blog to give updates about Fiona’s condition. Thursday, January 26, 2017: Fiona monitored in intensive care \n‘Our two-day-old baby hippo, born six week early, is hanging in there. Her care team continues to give her 24-hour attention, which includes tube-feedings, vet checks and keeping her warm and moist. \n‘This morning she got her first pool experience. Most hippos are born in the water, but they can’t actually swim. Pool time will help her build muscles and balance and maintain an optimal body temperature of 96-98 degrees.’ Tuesday, January 31, 2017: Fiona gets a name, meaning ‘Fair’ \n‘Even though Fiona’s not out of the woods yet, every baby needs a name and her animal care team thought the name was a perfect fit for their ‘fair’ little girl,” said Christina Gorsuch, curator of mammals at the Cincinnati Zoo. \n‘They have been with her 24 hours a day and think this name suits her personality.’ Friday, February 24: Fiona needs a new pool \nStaff at the zoo bought a new pool for her, using donations from the public, after she already outgrew two of them. \n‘Now that her IV has been removed, vets have given her the okay to resume supervised pool time. Hippos don’t actually swim. They float and are able to hold their breath for long periods. Spending time in the pool will help Fiona build muscle and lung strength, keep her skin moist and let her act like a hippo. \n‘Her new pool is set up close to mom and dad so she can hear and smell them.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:53:01.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
