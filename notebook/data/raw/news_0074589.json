Not everyone was outraged with the menu however and one ethnic minority student said he was thankful to Pembroke catering staff for 'trying' to serve dishes from across the world. He added: 'I urge people to look around and realise there’s a lot more to life than complaining about fruity chicken. Grow up.' The row began with a post on the university's Grudgebridge complaint page on Facebook A menu from Pembroke's Buttery dining hall, featuring the controversial 'Jamaican stew' The issue was brought up at a meeting of the college's food committee and the bursar, Andrew Cates said the complaints were being taken seriously. In an email to student news website, The Tab , the committee said catering staff had taken the concerns on board and will be aware of them in the future. The message read: 'The naming of the dishes has been discussed. 'The head chef appeared upset that he had offended people and they said they will aim to do more in future to avoid offending anyone else.' Several other students also took to social media to issue their grievances with the menu Mr Cates told The Times : 'As a ­college which prides itself on the high standard of our cuisine and wants all our students of diverse backgrounds to feel a valued part of our community, we encourage our catering staff to take the views of any of our students seriously.'

In March last year the institute's Jesus College removed a controversial bronze cockerel, that had been looted in a 19th Century colonial expedition, from its dining hall after students called for it to be repatriated to Nigeria. And a student from Pembroke College, Ronald Coyne, 18, sparked outrage earlier this month after he was filmed burning a £20 note in front of a homeless man.
