Australia's minimum wage is $17.70 per hour. It is not known how many are Malaysians.\nThey were underpaid between $13,880 (RM47,000) to $45,182 (RM153,200) each (totalling $148,710) between November 2011 and October 2014.\nThe report said Judge Salvatore Vasta, who imposed the fines in the Federal Circuit Court on Monday, said the fact that both the accused had exploited employees of a similar cultural background was particularly disturbing.\nThe judge reportedly said that \"it would seem that if someone from a particular culture comes to Australia and is employed by somebody else from the same background, there would be an automatic level of trust and comfort in that fact.\"\n\"There is an obligation on them to ensure that workers from a similar culture to the employers are not exploited,\" he said.\nThe report quoted Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James as saying that overseas workers were entitled to the same pay as Australians.\nIn their submission, the accused said they had little business experience in Australia and were naive about how to set up a business in the country.\nBut the judge disagreed, saying \"it does seem that for people with a level of naivety, they were able to set up one business and then incorporate and set up another business and then incorporate and set up a third business, so the level of naivety has to be seen in that light.\"\nSBS has contacted the owners for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:22:38.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
