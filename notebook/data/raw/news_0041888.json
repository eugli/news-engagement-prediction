A post shared by Lauren Akins (@laur_akins) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:32pm PST Thomas Rhett and his wife Lauren made the announcement earlier in the week that they were having a baby, and adopting one as well. } Today, they shared a video on social media - where they were gathered with friends to find out the gender of the baby. Thomas cut the pink and blue cake, to find the out they were having a baby girl! We are so excited for them, and know she will be daddy's little girl. So many of Thomas's songs have been written about his wife, so we cannot wait to hear what he writes for his little girl. Congratulations guys! We'll catch up with Thomas in a few weeks when we performs at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles. \"âœ¨... how we wonder what you are...\" â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ guess what we're doing tonight :) ðŸŽ€ðŸ’™ ðŸŽ‚: @crumbdelacrumb A post shared by Lauren Akins (@laur_akins) on Feb 18, 2017 at 11:55am PST }", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:42:11.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
