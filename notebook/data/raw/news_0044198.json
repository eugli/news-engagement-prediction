The original Tamma Tamma featuring Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit was choreographed by her, the makers of BKD invited everyone but forgot to invite Saroj ji which left her upset. She quoted to the media, “Maybe they felt since my assistant Madhuri Dixit was there, they didn’t need me around. You have to ask them why I wasn’t invited. I don’t mind not being invited.The new version of any of my dance numbers have to be of some standard for them to invite me to watch it.” \nThis led to a new controversy , in fact Varun Dhawan was highly apologetic for not inviting her. Recently Varun apologised the choreographer saying, “I would want to apologize to Saroj Ji, but it wasn’t in my hands. I didn’t have her number and I don’t know her personally. I had asked dad (David Dhawan) for her number, but by that time he had gone to London. I know this is not an excuse. I really take her as an inspiration and even her songs. I know Sanjay sir and Madhuri mam, so I took that lead.” \nAlso read: Radio Mirchi Music Awards 2017: Badrinath Ki Dulhania actors Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt are twinning and we are going INSANE (see pics inside) \nAfter Varun, now Alia was quizzed about Saroj ji being upset she said, “She is absolutely right. No-one can match the steps of Madhuri. Whatever she said is right.. aise koi keh sakta hai ki main Picasso jaise paint kar sakti hun? (Can anyone paint something and then compare their work to Picasso?).” However Alia refrained to talk on not inviting her for the song launch. All we just hope this matter gets resolved ASAP. \nTalking about Varun and Alia, this is the third time they have come together and the trailer and songs are getting fabulous response from the audiences. So far everyone is raving about the actors and we all are looking forward for the release.
