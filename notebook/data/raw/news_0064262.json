Or next week. So you might as well get on with it.” \nThe original plan had been for Michael to spend the morning with us at their famous estate in West Ilsley, which featured in the Doomsday Book and was sold to Channon by the Queen, but he is rushing off to Doncaster where they have a runner. It is a worrying development for two reasons. \nThe first is that I wanted to speak with Channon Jnr for longer about his book, How’s Your Dad?, which is a superbly funny and moving memoir not just of working at the elite end of racing but what it was like growing up in the shadow of the England football captain, trying (and failing) to make it as a professional and having people like Alan Ball and Kevin Keegan as your childhood friends. \nThe second reason for wanting Channon Jnr to stay is simple. Having visited them once before, I recall his uses as a buffer to one of the most ferociously-tongued characters in sport. Channon is variously described in his son’s book as “aggressive”, “perpetually demanding” and “a grumpy old b d” but is actually all smiles as he breezes into his office and takes a seat beneath a large picture of Ball. “Ask me anything you like,” he says, placing his flat cap on the desk. We are here, ostensibly, to talk about Southampton’s League Cup final against Manchester United on Sunday. Mick Channon and David Peach parade the FA Cup around Wembley after 1976 triumph \nC hannon is Southampton’s all-time record goalscorer and would stand with only Matthew Le Tissier and Terry Paine in any sensible debate about the club’s greatest player. He also played for Saints in the 1976 FA Cup final against Manchester United when they won their only major trophy and, for all his respect for the “big lump” [Zlatan Ibrahimovic] and Jose Mourinho [“like Cloughie”], he says that Southampton “have a great chance”. \nYet Channon Jnr has already advised that, “in Mick’s world, a conversation is an opportunity to agree with him”, and he duly does become most animated once the discussion wanders into random directions. Stories about David Beckham’s rage at not receiving a knighthood are again in the papers. \n“B s. A load of s---e,” he says, shaking his head. “You had to live to 70 to get a ----ing knighthood in the old days. It’s all about Brand Beckham. ----ing stupid. All this b s about charity. You do things for charity for nothing don’t you? If you’ve got to tell people, you shouldn’t be ----ing doing it.” \nSo he’s not a fan of the honours system? “It’s just taking the ---- out of the public basically. Saying that the rest of us are a bunch of ----s.” As this stream of consciousness unfolds, it crosses my mind that Channon – one of the country’s leading flat trainers and one of the select few Englishman with more than 20 international goals – might have some letters after his name himself. He looks shocked at the mere suggestion. “---- off,” he says. “Too many skeletons, boy.” Southampton 1976 FA Cup winners: Where are they now? \nC hannon finds it hard to sit still for long and, while we are talking, has got into his Range Rover and ushered me into the passenger seat. We are now driving at speed over the fields that rise towards the gallops and he is shouting instructions to his work riders. Channon says he trains horses on “feel”, and a constant theme of Channon Jnr’s book is that his dad’s man-management rather lacks nuance. “If the big stick is not working, he will reach for the bigger one with a nail on it,” he says. \nChannon Snr looks perplexed by the suggestion that his approach could be modified. “My bark is far worse than my bite,” he insists. “If there are important things that need doing, I want them done now. And, if that means saying to someone, ‘Get off your ----ing arse and do it’ I don’t think that’s wrong. How are you meant to say it? ‘Would you please? [speaking like the Queen]. B s to that. \n“Just get on and ----ing do it. I don’t know how else you get it across. Political correctness is just ----ing stupid. You get sacked now on one of those ----ing things [pointing to my phone]. Texts. There is not the decency there was.” \nHis observations on modern life somehow bring us on to the subject of the England team and why we have repeatedly failed at tournaments. Sir Alf Ramsey gave Channon his England debut in 1972. “I don’t think we have had a team since Alf,” he says. “He was the last one given carte blanche. Now every England manager is told what to do by everyone else.” \nChannon then protests he’s “not half the ----ing beast I used to be” and, for one short period during our morning together, there are no swear words. “You do mellow,” he explains. “It’s not that you become smarter. You just think there are more important things. Your health. Your family. I’ve had operations. I’ve been smashed up a few times.” \nM ost serious was the car accident in 2008 that killed his friend Tim Corby and left both Channon and his younger son, Jack, in intensive care. He suffered fractures to his ribs, arm and jaw, as well as a punctured lung, but was still issuing instructions to Channon Jnr from his hospital bed within four days. “Don’t show the ----ers any weakness,” was one nugget of advice for dealing with the opposition in his absence. Does he remember the accident? “I remember waking up in the car and being cut out,” he says. “I could hear the drills. \n“I remember the medic saying to me, ‘Just breathe, Mr Channon’ and I was thinking, ‘I can’t breathe’. I heard someone say, ‘We have got a fatality here’. They cut me out and air-lifted me. Then I don’t remember a couple of days. More lucky was my son, who was 14. If I’d gone it wouldn’t have been the end of the world. I’ve had a bit of life. He hadn’t. Does it change you? It slowed me up but I still want to do the same things. I love training horses and living with horses. It’s fascinating. What makes some go fast? Why do you have Messi and Ronaldo and then so many ---- players? Same applies to horses.” \nChannon Jnr predicts that his dad will “retire in a box” and, ahead of his 70th birthday next year, there is no hint of him slowing down from daily 5.30am starts. He remains surrounded by family living on the estate – including his amazing 95-year-old mum, Betty – but there is daily sadness at the thought that Alan Ball should be by his side. \nBall was in the process of moving to West Ilsley when he suffered his fatal heart attack in 2007. “I spoke to him that evening,” says Channon. “He told me that moving house was the most stressful thing he’d done. Bally was an enthusiast in life. A football nut. The same as Keegan.” \nHe mentions a third name when I ask if they were the best he ever played with. “Terry Paine was another great player, Bally was a great player and Keegan made himself a great player.” \nChannon goes similarly quiet when thoughts turn – as they inevitably will this weekend – to Bobby Stokes. It was Stokes who scored the most famous goal in Southampton’s history when they beat Manchester United 1-0 in the 1976 final. He died of pneumonia at the age of 44. “Stokesy was a close friend, like a member of the family,” says Channon. “He won a car for scoring in the Cup final and never did learn to drive.” Is winning the EFL Cup a blessing or a curse? A glance over the past 20 winners \nI ndeed, once Channon Jnr could drive, he would ferry Stokes around between his hero’s shifts at the Harbour View Café in Portsmouth. Channon points out that many of his old team-mates are struggling and highlights the contrast to the wealth and power of the modern player. “They are there now for a year, have a good season, and then want to ---- off to Man United,” he says. “I don’t want to go back to the dark ages and I haven’t got a problem with the players earning the money. What I have got a problem with is nobody honours a contract.” \nChannon then recalls his advice to the family after Southampton sold Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana in one summer. “I always remember my daughter saying, ‘I’ve been out and bought the season tickets.’ I said, ‘Have you not been reading the ----ing paper? You must be barmy. We’ve paid £3,500 for these season tickets and we haven’t got a ----ing team. We’ll be relegated next year’.” \nHe then rocks back on his chair, chuckling. “Anyway, it worked out we had an even better season! So she did the right thing. I enjoy going four or five times a year to The Dell; I think it’s St Mary’s or something now. But I won’t take the place of the kids at Wembley. I can go up the pub and watch it, have a couple of pints. That will do me. You just hope football has got it right. Is it too greedy? The whole culture has changed. Foreign managers don’t give a ---- about the Cup. They’ve made a mockery of it. People pay a lot of money for season tickets and they are taking the ---- out of fans.” Southampton faced Man Utd in the 1976 FA Cup final \nC hannon also dislikes how football is often now so po-faced and serious. He began training horses when he was still playing and his old manager, Lawrie McMenemy, recalls how he might arrive for training in wellington boots stinking of manure. Amidst a half-time rollicking from McMenemy, he famously once cut his manager dead. “Gaffer,” he said. “What you must understand is that this is my ----ing hobby.” Yet the Southampton team of the early 1980s, containing Channon, Ball and Keegan, is still regarded as their finest. “Training was the most boring thing I ever ----ing did in my life,” he says. “I loved playing. It was me against you.” That deep competitive instinct is now channelled through racing and he is clearly utterly unconcerned by what people think. \nHis reaction to discovering that his son had secretly written a book about him is instructive. “I read the first edition and he said, ‘What do you think?’” recalls Channon. “I said, ‘It’s what you think, it’s not what I ----ing think’. That’s the way he sees it. No problem. I think it’s brilliant. I don’t give a ---- about what he’s said about me. He knows I’m a grumpy old ----er. That’s the way it is, but there are so many families who can relate to it. He is very independent. He’s got my name and says that was a bloody life sentence when I gave it to him. I don’t cuddle and kiss him but…I’ve always loved him. If you know what I mean?” \nThe largely unspoken affection is quite obviously mutual. Channon Jnr says he is asked the same question everywhere he goes by whomever he meets. ‘How’s your dad?’ And he ends the book with his answer. “He’s hard working, barking mad, sometimes insufferable but, ultimately, he’s just incredible. I love my dad. Don’t tell him, though. That would be showing weakness.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:02:06.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
