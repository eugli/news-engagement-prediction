We later removed the post to avoid any misperception that the USG [US government] endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.\" \nWhat were those awful comments they didn't want to be associated with? \nFarhadi himself did not attend in protest of the Muslim ban but did send a prepared statement calling the ban \"inhumane\" and said: \n\"Dividing the world into the 'us' and 'our enemies' categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.\" \nYes. Because why would you want to be associated with a statement embracing peace and denouncing hatred?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:50:39.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
