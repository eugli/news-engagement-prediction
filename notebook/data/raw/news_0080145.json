SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nWaitara woman Gaye Mullin is dwarfed in height by her stand-out succulent. \n\"I can't believe how much its grown,\" the Taranaki woman said. \nAlong with its impressive stature, the plant is starting to flower, with yellow petals beginning to peek through. \nREAD MORE: SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nYellow flowers are starting to bloom on the plant. \nThe plant is a native of Mexico, but Mullin bought hers in 2008 from the Ellerslie Garden Show when it was still held in Auckland. \nThe Agave Geminiflora is also known as the Twin Flowered Agave and its flowers are tiny, yellow and grow from the stalk in pairs. \nAbout four weeks ago, she noticed the stalk had sprung out from the middle of the succulent, which sits among the lush greenery of her garden in Waitara, north Taranaki. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nThere has been worldwide interest in Gaye Mullin's towering Agave Geminiflora, which is growing at a rate of 15cms per day. \nMullin checked on its growth every day and still believed it had the potential to get even taller. Ad Feedback \nThe unusual plant had also attracted its fair share of attention after Mullin shared photographs of its towering height last week. \nShe has fielded phone calls from different media outlets in Australia and the United Kingdom and been interviewed on the radio. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nThe sky's the limit for this plant! \nFriends had also popped in for a look at the sturdy stalk, which is showing no signs of drooping any time soon. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:28:30.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
