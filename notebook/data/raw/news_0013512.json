In his motion before the Sandiganbayan's First Division, Revilla requested pemission visit former senator Ramon Revilla Sr at hospital from 6 am to 12 pm on February 8, and from 2 pm to 8 pm on February 9. Revilla's plunder trial is scheduled at 8:30 am on Thursday. He is accused of pocketing P224-million worth of kickbacks from his Priority Development Assistance Fund, in what is known as the PDAF or pork barrel scam. Revilla said his father is is scheduled to undergo a heart surgery at around 9 am on February 8 and that the older Revilla “specifically requested Senator Revilla to be at his side before the surgery.” “Senator Revilla thus feels it is his obligation to come to the aid of his father, who is very close to him, even by his mere presence, and cannot disregard a son’s natural urge and desire to visit and be with his ailing and weak father, and spend a few moments together, to provide former Senator Revilla Sr the needed assurance and support,” the motion said. Sevilla Sr has been diagnosed with \"severe aortic stenosis\" that requires valve replacement, according to his son’s motion. In the past, the Sandiganbayan granted Revilla's request to leave his detention cell in Camp Crame for the following reasons (READ: Let out of detention: Is the Sandiganbayan consistent? ): In March 2015, to visit his son Jolo at the Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Mandaluyong City, after the Cavite vice governor sustained a gunshot wound in the chest In July 2015, to visit his father at the same hospital in Taguig In August 2015, to undergo dental crowning procedure at a clinic in Makati and again on October 2015, for a post-dental checkup \n– Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
