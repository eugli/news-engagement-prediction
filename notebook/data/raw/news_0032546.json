Image caption BBC News NI's Angie Phillips explains that the unusually dry weather was linked to high pressure over North West Europe \nHigh pressure over Scandinavia in January had the same impact, but brought much colder conditions across Europe too. \nHowever, in Northern Ireland, the severely cold weather did not arrive - temperatures were actually almost one degree above average. \nThis dry weather has been beneficial to arable farmers. \nRobin McKee, a potato farmer in Comber, said it had been \"a great spell for potatoes and root vegetables in general, and it's been much easier for the farmers and for harvesting crops\". \nAs far as water levels go, Alison McCrystal of NI Water said a small number of reservoirs, including Silent Valley, had lower levels than usual for this time of year. Image copyright NI Water Image caption Reservoirs such as the Silent Valley have had lower levels than usual for this time of year, however not critically so \nHowever, she said this was not at a worrying level and after more than an inch of rain fell on 30 January, the levels have already started to rise. \nThe story might be more concerning if the drier weather comes in the summer months, with higher evaporation from the sun coupled with low rainfall amounts. \nThat is still a way off though, so no sign of hosepipe ban just yet...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:46:27.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
