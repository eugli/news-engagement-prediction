Fox is firmly on the hot seat, having taken the Bulldogs to just two NCAA tournaments in seven full seasons. \nAfter the 82-77 win for the Wildcats, Calipari made sure to stick up for Fox, whose team has suffered some tough losses throughout this season… \n“We’re firing coaches at mid-season, Calipari says. Are you [expletive] me? We’re firing coaches in mid-season. You know what I’m putting in my contract? You can fire me at mid-season, but you’re going to have to pay me $3 million. Oh, you’ll let me stay now, won’t you… \n“Every coach in the country: Put it in your contract. What if [fired North Carolina State coach] Mark Gottfried goes on a run and gets to the NCAA tournament — which he was in four out of five years; two Sweet 16s, which isn’t done at North Carolina State? What happens now if he wins and he gets another team [there]?” \nIt’s admirable that Calipari is defending a friend, but nobody is going to cry for college coaches. They know that if their team isn’t winning, their jobs will be in jeopardy. And you don’t see Calipari taking up for players who get benched because they’re not performing up to expectations. He’s certainly not criticizing coaches for leaving schools mid-contract. \nFox has had plenty of time to build Georgia into a consistent program and just hasn’t been able to do it. As for Gottfried, sure, he was fired unceremoniously (and probably unfairly given his record at N.C. State) but he’ll still make the estimated $2.28 million he has left on his contract. Oh, what a travesty. More NCAAB! ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:30:55.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
