Mark Gottfried (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:56 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:56 p.m. ET \nThe fine people at N.C. State are not alone in their inability to hire a basketball coach who can either: A) Advance deep in the NCAA Tournament; B) Inspire popularity among the fan base; C) Depart the position without some degree of failure or acrimony. Given all that’s been accomplished in the program’s history, though, the stakes are greater than with most. \nIt’s always something at State. Les Robinson lost so much they nicknamed the ACC Tournament play-in game in his honor. Herb Sendek didn’t beat North Carolina and/or Duke with the required frequency. Jim Valvano’s program got busted by the NCAA. Mark Gottfried’s teams played with a smidgeon of defensive commitment. \nSporting News always has defined the beginning of college basketball’s modern era as the 1985 expansion of the NCAA Tournament field to 64 teams. State has not had a single coach in that period leave for a better job or retirement. The administration ought to look back at this history and consider George Costanza’s “opposite” approach . \nFAGAN: Adjusting the Field of 68 \nWhat they’re doing isn’t working. The people they’re relying upon for advice, whether inside the program or out, are not helping. In announcing Thursday that Gottfried will finish the season as coach but not continue beyond, State now has a headstart of at least three weeks on just about everyone else. It can use that time to continue the due diligence it began earlier in the week. \nMore than anything, though, what the people who will be making the hire must do is identify what makes a successful college basketball coach generally, what peculiarities make the State job unique and what sort of coach will be necessary to excel there. They need to understand the process. \nThe last time the Wolfpack needed a coach, following Sidney Lowe’s failed tenure from 2006 to 2011, the administration careened through a list of “name” candidates lacking an understanding of who would not be interested (Shaka Smart), who required an extraordinary sales job (Wichita State’s Gregg Marshall, who wisely passed and wound up in the Final Four two years later) and who could not be trifled with (Cincinnati’s Mick Cronin, who was offended by a low-ball offer after Smart had been offered more and re-upped with the Bearcats). \nThe time before that, they got played by John Calipari simply looking to scare Memphians/remind them that they had a desirable coach, and got turned down by Steve Lavin after he’d spent three years in broadcasting. \nThis transition will be as easy as ordering the tortilla chips at Chipotle if Archie Miller is interested in leaving Dayton to return to Raleigh. Miller, though, has been patient and well-compensated as he continues to position himself for an ideal next job. He played for N.C. State, and his wife Nicole ran track there. That helps the cause. \nAs was the case with Miller’s brother Sean, though, when he declined the chance to return to Pitt last spring, the pull of the alma mater is not as important as being in a job with all of the advantages available to the elite. Miller has the best job in the Atlantic 10. He is not going to sacrifice that to take a risk. N.C. State would have to convince him their job isn’t, and that will not be easy. The odds are greater that he will pass and continue waiting at Dayton. \nWhich will mean this process will require ingenuity, creativity and an abiding understanding of the college basketball landscape. The program that seeks such answers primarily through a search firm seems as likely to be disappointed as not. Remember that Billy Gilllispie at Kentucky and Kelvin Sampson at Indiana were search-firm hires, as were Kim Anderson at Missouri and Kevin Stallings at Pitt. \nMORE: After three decades, N.C. State title team gets White House visit \nN.C. State has an opportunity here that is unique to its woeful history of coaching hires. Through more than three decades it has been the least of the three high-level programs in the Research Triangle. That will not be altered in the near future. However, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski just turned 70, and North Carolina’s Roy Williams will be 67 in August. It would be lovely if they both coach forever. That remains highly unlikely. \nWe do not know how many seasons remain for either, but can surmise that the next N.C. State coach should have an opportunity to be coaching through the transition at one or both schools. If the university gets this one right, that coach could have a program in place that becomes more prominent should either of the others fumble its process. \nThat is a selling point for the Wolfpack. It is not their only one. There is not a large collection of schools with championships won under multiple coaches. It can be done at State, but only if State gets the right guy.
