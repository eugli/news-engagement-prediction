It’s the latest pet cause of right-wing groups looking for a backdoor to violate anti-discrimination laws and actively discriminate, especially — but not only — against women, gay men and lesbians, and transgender people.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below If you’re thinking, Wait a minute, I thought we already had religious freedom in the form of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, you would be correct. The First Amendment protects both the right to practice your own religion and to be free of government forcing a particular religion on you. This is why you can wear a yarmulke or a hijab or a cross in a public high school, and say grace before you eat in the dining hall of your state university; it’s also why your public elementary school teacher didn’t force the whole class into a morning prayer (or at least shouldn’t have).\nBut what the First Amendment does not protect is the right to impose your religious values on others, or the right of owners or employees of secular businesses to discriminate. So for example, a Muslim EMT who believes touching someone of the opposite sex violates his religion can decline to shake hands with a woman in his off time but he can’t refuse to treat women his ambulance picks up for emergency care; an evangelical Christian waitress who believes the Bible forbids interracial marriage can decide not to attend interracial weddings as a guest but she can’t refuse to serve a mixed-race couple at her diner; a Jehovah’s Witness nurse can refuse a blood transfusion for herself but she can’t block a patient from getting one. Fair enough, right? Not according to those on the far right — and they have a champion in our president . Religious freedom as outlined by the First Amendment was already expanded by the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which gave more expansive protections to those seeking to practice their religion — it more or less said that even generally applicable laws may be impermissible if they impose a disproportionate burden on one particular religion.\nIf signed, Trump’s religious freedom executive order would go even further. It’s an extension of a legal theory being pushed by conservative groups that would give individuals wide latitude to claim the religious freedom to do basically whatever they want — including individuals who want to refuse to provide certain forms of health care or business owners who want to discriminate in who they serve. The executive order allows “any organization, including closely held for-profit corporations” to claim religious freedom “when providing social services, education, or healthcare; earning a living, seeking a job, or employing others; receiving government grants or contracts; or otherwise participating in the marketplace, the public square, or interfacing with Federal, State or local governments.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below In other words, as long as you have a religious justification, you can refuse to do your job, serve any individual, employ any individual or do really anything at all, and you will face no penalties — the government can’t pull a contract with you, a person can’t sue you for discrimination, your employer can’t fire you for refusing to comply with company rules.\nThere have already been wins on this front, like when the Supreme Court held in the Hobby Lobby case that even for-profit companies don’t have to include contraception in their health-care plans, in violation of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate, if women using modern contraceptives to plan their families violates the boss’s religious beliefs. When it comes to providing health care, most states have conscientious objection laws that allow doctors, nurses, and other health workers to forgo performing or assisting abortion procedures if they have moral qualms.\nBut there have been some losses for the right’s religious chauvinism too, most recently in Washington state , where the state Supreme Court ruled that a florist violated the state’s civil rights law barring discrimination against gay people when she refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. Alarmed by the prospect of having to treat gay people like anyone else, religious groups are pushing hard for the kind of expansive protections Trump’s executive order promises. And it even sounds kind of reasonable: If a florist opposes same-sex marriage, why make her choose between her belief and her business?\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The short answer is that’s what anti-discrimination laws do — if individual business owners were free to discriminate at will, a lot of lunch counters would still be racially segregated. Companies could still refuse to hire women, or fire them when they got married or pregnant. Protecting religious expression is important, but so is protecting people from discrimination, and when those two ideals conflict, we need to decide how to balance them. Trump’s draft executive order gives all the weight to any individual’s claim of religious belief and virtually none to protecting people from bigotry.\nAttempts to use religion as a cover to discriminate are not new. In Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court case that invalidated laws barring interracial marriage, some states that barred that practice claimed they did so because of religious belief. Bob Jones University barred interracial dating until the 21st century, claiming in its own Supreme Court case that the “rule against interracial dating is a matter of religious belief and practice” (the Court held that the government’s interest in combatting discrimination was a compelling one and the university lost the case; instead of changing its rule, though, it chose to continue its ban and lose its tax-exempt status).\nWhile expressly discriminating against someone because of their race is currently out of vogue — it’s still common; discriminators are just less vocal about it — discriminating against someone because of their sexual orientation or their gender is still in. These expansive and nearly unlimited religious freedom laws, though, open the door to all kinds of discrimination — based on race, gender, sexual orientation, you name it. And while it may be tempting to feel for the florist who doesn’t want to offer flowers for a same-sex wedding, it’s worth asking yourself if you would feel the same way if she had a religious objection to an interracial marriage — and why that’s any different.\nThese laws are conceived of to protect religious Christians, and for the most part, that is what they will do. They seek to protect, for example, the pharmacist who won’t give a rape victim Plan B or fill a young women’s prescription for birth control or give a man the HIV medicine he needs. They seek to protect the public school administrator who fires female employees pregnant out of wedlock or the teacher who refuses to teach about Islam, Buddhism, or other non-Christian religions.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below But America is a diverse and pluralistic society, and what religious Christians pushing “religious freedom” aren’t thinking about is that this law won’t just give Christians a free hand to discriminate. The same people who claim to be worried about radical Islam are apparently not thinking very hard about how these same laws could protect extreme interpretations of any religion. Do we want to say it’s OK for an ultra-Orthodox Jewish female doctor to refuse to treat male patients because she doesn’t touch men? For a religious Muslim taxi company owner to refuse to employ female drivers or pick up female passengers with uncovered heads?\nEveryone should have the freedom to practice their religion, so long as that practice is peaceful and doesn’t harm or interfere with the rights of others. This is precisely what the framers of the Constitution intended. And architects of anti-discrimination laws intended to make sure that all Americans, no matter their race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, are able to rent an apartment, buy a house, eat at a restaurant, and get medical care without being treated differently solely because of what they look like, who they love, or what they believe.\nAllowing rampant discrimination isn’t “religious freedom.” It’s freedom for bigotry.\nFollow Jill on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-the-religious-rights-trojan-horse.html?_r=0", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/17/washington-state-supreme-court-rules-against-florist-who-turned-away-gay-couple/?utm_term=.ca67d014c19c", "https://www.thenation.com/article/leaked-draft-of-trumps-religious-freedom-order-reveals-sweeping-plans-to-legalize-discrimination/", "https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic", "https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/deja-vu-all-over-again-religious-objections-to-interracial-marriage-and", "https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services"], "published": "2017-02-22T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:57:12.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
