Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront\" the media reports necessitated an \"independent, bipartisan investigation.\" \"With every passing day, it gets more and more disturbing, and more and more evidence that there was collusion,\" Wasserman Schultz said. \"This requires, it begs, it cries out for and independent, bipartisan investigation. And Donald Trump should be the first person asking for one, but since I think he likely was part of it, it's not surprising that hasn't happened.\" . @DWStweets tells @ErinBurnett it's not yet time to talk about impeachment https://t.co/7ryr0iwsYg https://t.co/Zsfu18QSOj — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) February 16, 2017 Trump declined to answer questions about the matter at the White House on Wednesday. CNN has reached out to the White House seeking response to Wasserman Schultz Wednesday evening. Earlier on \"OutFront,\" Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, told Burnett \"it is entirely possible that there were people on his campaign that were talking with people that may have been inappropriate to talk with and he didn't know it.
