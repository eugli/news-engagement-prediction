While plenty of history is ready to be made at the 89th Academy Awards, this year's pool of nominees have already set several records. \nTo start, the reigning queen of the silver screen, Meryl Streep , earned her 20th nomination this year for her performance in Florence Foster Jenkins . If she wins, the icon will officially tie with Katharine Hepburn 's record for the most wins by an actress with four statues. However, Streep already leads the pack with the most Oscar nominations of any actor or actress ever by eight. The second most nominated stars are Hepburn and Jack Nicholson with 12 nominations each.

If his last time is any indication of potential success this year, he took home the statues for Best Director and Best Picture in 1996.

While the Hamilton creator has already earned an Emmy, Grammy and Tony, he garnered his first Academy Award nod this year for his original song, \"How Far I'll Go,\" from Moana . \nThough we're still days away from finding out the winners, the cast and crew of La La Land have plenty to sing and dance about since Damien Chazelle 's movie musical tied for the most nominations ever received by a film at the Academy Awards with 14—the same as Titanic and All About Eve . Perhaps this year's ceremony will be all about the movie of stars. \nFor more fun stats on this year's ceremony, check out E!'s video above.
