Gordhan has broken the law. He is expected to fight corruption; he is expected to act when unlawful activities are reported to him. He has done none of that... He is serial lawbreaker,\" Mngxitama said.\nMngxitama accused Gordhan of defending those who stole from the Reserve Bank during apartheid.\n\"R206bn was stolen during apartheid and a report came out. Gordhan has done nothing about it instead he is actively defending and protecting those who have stolen from the Reserve Bank...We have a minister entangled in organisations where he has shares,\" he said.\nBLF application a 'political ploy'\nMngxitama filed a notice of motion with the High Court in October last year in which he called on Gordhan to comply with recommendations in the controversial CIEX report, Fin24 reported.\nThe report spelled out how Absa should repay a bailout for Bankorp, which Absa acquired in 1992. Bankorp received the R1.5bn bailout from the South African Reserve Bank in the 1980s and 1990s.\nGordhan's responding papers to the BLF's motion asked that the BLF's application be dismissed.\nGordhan said the CIEX report risked failing to abide by the Constitution and described it as a \"26-year-old unsolicited document prepared by retired M16 spies\".\nGordhan also said that the BLF's application is a \"patent political ploy\" and \"unprecedented in its political intrigue\".\nThe CIEX report, which was put together in the late 1990s, outlined how the new South African government could recoup monies that were lost because of alleged apartheid-era looting or illicit activities.\nThe 52-page report was drawn up by former British operative and founder of CIEX, Michael Oatley. CIEX is based in the UK and specialises in recoveries.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1409973532&t=artid%3d9251d655-892b-48ef-af17-5d55f18db20b%26Companies%3dblf%26People%3dpravin%2cgordhan%26Places%3djohannesburg%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1409973532&t=artid%3d9251d655-892b-48ef-af17-5d55f18db20b%26Companies%3dblf%26People%3dpravin%2cgordhan%26Places%3djohannesburg%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://www.fin24.com/Economy/bid-to-revive-report-on-apartheid-looting-a-polticial-ploy-gordhan-20170130"], "published": "2017-02-23T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:26:35.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
