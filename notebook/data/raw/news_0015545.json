It released a list of 78 incidents dating back to September 2014, while also reframing Trump's very clear remarks as meaning that the incidents were insufficiently covered rather than ignored entirely, as the president had said. \nThe list itself is borderline satire, starting with don't-they-have-spell-check-at-the-White-House typos like \"attaker,\" repeatedly, instead of \"attacker.\" More: The list contains incredibly high profile attacks that got saturation coverage, like the San Bernardino (also misspelled) shootings, the Pulse nightclub attack and the November 2015 mass attack in Paris. And its omissions are striking as well: The Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting and the recent Quebec mosque attack (which Trump has largely ignored), for example, were not on the list . And as the Maddow Blog's Steve Benen notes , \"Some of the entries on the White House list don't appear to be examples of terrorism, and other incidents produced zero causalities.\" \nOverall, per Buzzfeed's Jim Dalrymple II : The White House did not point to any attacks on the list that supported Trump's contention that terrorism is \"not even being reported.\" BuzzFeed News researched all 78 incidents on the list and found Western news coverage for all but seven of them. The other seven were likely covered as well, but the White House provided too little information to narrow them down. \nSo between the president indulging in crazed conspiracy theories and his staff trying vainly – and clumsily – to back him up, there's plenty of which to be frightened. That's especially true when you view this latest assault on the press in the broader context of Trump's assaults upon the institutions of public life which figure to stand against him. \nBut then there's also the explanation underlying the whole sorry affair. Trump \"felt members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Monday. Per The Washington Post, Lindsay Walters, another White House flack, also complained that \"these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T22:07:13.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
