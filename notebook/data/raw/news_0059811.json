Then star halfback and captain Kieran Foran walked away from the game. That was bookended by player scandals of different kinds. \nAnd, to top a horror 2016 off for the club, Jarryd Hayne slipped through their fingers. \nFrench admits it’s been a tough 12 months. \n“It was a pretty sh**ty year but we took those positives out of it,” French said. \n“That stuff going on at the club was out of our control, out of the players’ control. The rest of the players too, we developed quite a strong bond. \n“We couldn’t control what happened and everyone could have chucked in the towel, but we went out each week and fought till the end. media_camera Bevan French of the Eels scores a try. \n“We didn’t play for any points but we still came away with quite a few wins. It showed the attitude we had, even in that pretty sh**ty time, everyone stayed strong. That’s what we took out of that.” \nFrench is confident the Eels have weather the storm and are out the other side. \nSo confident is he that the club is on the up, he’s even prepared to bring his brothers into the fold. \nA FAMILY AFFAIR \nBevan is one of four French brothers. He’s the first of them to play rugby league professionally. \nHis two younger brothers — Luke and Dion — were invited down to train with Parramatta towards the end of last year. \nLuke — the elder of the two — made the trip down from the family’s home in Tingha prior to Christmas to meet and train with the Eels. He opted not to pursue the opportunity. \n“He loves playing footy but he has other passions, his artwork and stuff like that. He made the decision not to continue with it,” Bevan explains. \nDion French — still with a couple of years to complete in high school — has been making the trip down from the north coast to train in development programs.
