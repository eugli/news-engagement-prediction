He joined the network 37 years ago.\nIn addition to the NFL playoffs and the Triple Crown, Costas will have a role in other programming with NBC.\n“They’ve been kind enough to call it the Brokaw phase of my career,” he said on “Today,” referencing the legendary NBC newsman Tom Brokaw who still has a presence there.\n“So I’ll be to sports what Tom has been for the last several years to news. I’ll show up when it’s appropriate for me to show up, including sometimes on the Olympics or the Kentucky Derby or the Super Bowl. Or on this show.”\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics from PyeongChang opens one year from today.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:14:59.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
