Top advisors to the City watchdog warned that households are being ‘bombarded with information which they cannot understand’ because of red tape passed down by Brussels. They said reams of jargon-filled paperwork leave people confused and ‘can lead to poor decisions’ – such as signing up to expensive deals, risky investments or useless insurance cover. the report said reams of jargon-filled paperwork leave people confused and ‘can lead to poor decisions’ – such as signing up to expensive deals, risky investments or useless insurance cover The report, by the Financial Services Consumer Panel, also found that EU regulations have undermined the safety net offered to savers to protect them if banks go bust. This is because the level of protection is set in euros – and changes when it is converted into pounds due to fluctuations on the currency markets. In another damming assessment, the panel said families have been put at risk by a host of poorly regulated European firms operating in the UK thanks to rules that allow cross-border business to take place. ‘While the UK has worked hard in Europe to bring about some good outcomes for consumers, it has often had to compromise on its position,’ the report said. ‘If the UK takes control of its financial services legislation there is an excellent opportunity for government and regulators to improve consumer protection regulation.’ It added: ‘On occasion, the UK has been held back by EU legislation.’ The Consumer Panel, which advises the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, hit out at ‘shortcomings’ in EU rules and said Brexit was ‘an opportunity to get rid of legislation that is preventing markets working better consumers’. The report highlighted areas where ‘the UK has been prevented from providing better protection’ to households because of rules written up in Brussels. It criticised the way in which the amount of savings protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if a bank goes bust has changed. The EU has set the limit at 100,000 euros but fluctuations on the currency markets mean the amount protected in pounds has varied.
