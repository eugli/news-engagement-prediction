While in New York recently to present her latest collection, Beckham sashayed through the streets in everything from track pants to chiffon skirting , while less than a week later the It Brit took to the ski slopes in Whistler en famille in snow-white shades .

The look could be considered an evolution from September, when Beckham sported exposed-button trousers and slouchy-fit denim . We’ve seen hints of Beckham’s latest silhouette earlier this year, as in Paris when she wore a self-tie belt style with Adidas shell toes , but today’s look was a new direction for the designer.
