Quick fix \nIn an explanation of how the bug arose, Mr Fratric said he was reluctant to reveal more details until it was patched. \nHe said he had expected Microsoft to address the bug before the 90-day deadline had expired. \nThe problem is found in Internet Explorer 11 as well as the Edge browser and arises because of the way both programs handle instructions to format some parts of web pages. \nIn a statement, Microsoft did not comment directly on the bug and its significance but said it had a \"customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible\". \nIt added it was involved in \"an ongoing conversation with Google about extending their deadline since the disclosure could potentially put customers at risk\". \nSo far, there is no evidence that malicious attackers are exploiting the problem unearthed by Mr Fratric. \nThe publication of information about the browser bug caps a difficult period for Microsoft and the security of its software. \nEarlier this month, it cancelled a regularly monthly security update without explaining why. \nThe update was expected to include fixes for several significant vulnerabilities. \nIn the same month, other security researchers released information about a way to exploit a vulnerability in some Microsoft server code. \nNo fix has yet been released for this vulnerability.
