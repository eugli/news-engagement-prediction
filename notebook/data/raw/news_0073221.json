Chesya Burke Updated February 27, 2016 . \nChesya Burke is a woman writer on the rise. Over the past decade she has written and published nearly a hundred stories and articles within the realms of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Noted science fiction author Samuel Delany has praised Burke's acclaimed short story collection, Let's Play White , and has called Burke \"a formidable master of the macabre.\" Burke is also an avid scholar who is currently completing doctoral studies in English at the University of Florida . \nBurke's recently released first novel The Strange Crimes of Little Africa is a historical mystery set in the vibrant streets of the Harlem Renaissance . The novel centers on Jaz Idawell, an anthropology student who just happens to be best friends with Zora Neale Hurston, who stumbles upon a murder mystery that involves those closest to her. \nWomen's Issues sat down with Chesya Burke to discuss her writing style, her latest project, and her plans for the future. \nWI: Tell us about the inspiration behind your latest work. \nCB: The Strange Crimes of Little Africa is a historical mystery set in 1920s Harlem. I got the inspiration from a fellow author friend as we were brainstorming ideas. We both loved the idea of a black woman detective during the Harlem Renaissance. \nWI: What sort of research did you do for the novel? \nCB: I did a lot of research for the book. I spent time in Harlem, explored the streets and the city and did research in the Studio Museum . I also talked with my professor about the project and we worked together to design a class focusing on black mystery writers and characters. So, I read a lot of Walter Mosley, Barbara Neely, and, of course, Chester Himes. \nWI: You're a well-known horror and sci-fi writer, what made you turn to mystery? \nCB: Good question, because, you’re right, mystery is mostly outside of what I had written before. But I do often write historical short stories and novellas. I just think that mystery was a natural fit for me because, like other speculative genres, it allows for the exploration of odd and even sometimes fantastic characters, places, and eras. \nWI: What's your writing process like? \nCB: I’m a notorious procrastinator. I like deadlines because they keep me on target, but even so, I’m still usually that writer that is up at midnight the last day doing corrects and rewrites to make sure I submit on time. The good thing is that I write relatively fast. I don’t usually outline and if I do, I don’t follow it. Mostly, I just sit down and see where my imagination takes me within the constraints of the era and character motivations. \nWI: What are some of your upcoming projects? \nCB: I’m working on a few things that are pretty hush hush, which is always frustrating and exciting at the same time. I’m told I do so much “vague-booking” on Facebook that my friends have started a pool to see who can guess when the next seemly-awesome-but-no-one-can-quite-tell-for-sure post is coming. But I’m also going to be working on a sequel to The Strange Crimes of Little Africa this summer and we’re hoping for an early release next year. I’m also working on a few contracted short stories and articles. One of the most interesting things I have in the works is a comic miniseries that I hope will be out sometime in the future. \nWI: What advice would you give to a fellow woman writer who wants to try her hand at genre fiction or just writing in general? \nCB: It’s not easy. I’ve been writing for ten years or more and I’m just getting my first novel published (though I’ve had dozens and dozens of short stories published before this). But it’s exciting and we are in a great time, when lots of new and diverse writers are emerging on the scene. But mostly, I’d give the same advice that I’d give anyone else. Read a lot, and write a lot. Read widely, in every genre and not just the one that you want to write in. But it’s important that you understand that this is not a quick process. Anyone can write, but it takes a well-disciplined writer to learn to write well. It’s about learning your craft and developing your voice as a writer. Invest the same time you would to become great in any professional field. It often takes years. But also, don’t give up. Don’t give up. Don’t give up.
