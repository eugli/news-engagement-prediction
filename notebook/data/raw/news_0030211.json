Hield should expect a call from the NBA to assess his impending fine. \nBefore this incident, Cousins was issued his 17th technical foul this season after inadvertently catching Pelicans center Donatas Motiejunas in the face with an open-handed slap. \nCousins immediately went to the locker room to cool down after being given the foul. \nThe Kings' center is also now just one technical away from another NBA suspension after missing Wednesday's win over the Celtics due to league suspension over his 16th technical foul. He will earn a one-game suspension for every two technical fouls accrued the rest of this season. \nAt least Cousins left this situation with his dignity still intact.
