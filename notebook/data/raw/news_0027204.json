If you want someone to be good at leadership, it's better to get them young so that by their 40s they're not just easing their way in, but are very experienced Reverend Dr David Hilborn \nO n Wednesday the synod, which is the governing body for the Church of England, will also vote on whether to \"take note\" of a controversial report produced by bishops last month about the Church's stance on gay marriage. \nThe report has been criticised by both liberal and conservative wings of the church, and LGBT rights groups have urged members to reject it. \nFollowing the Archbishop's speech, and ahead of the vote, bishops will be questioned by members about the report and the church's position on gay rights and homophobia. \nThe synod, which is the Church of England's governing body, meets to vote on new legislation and discuss issues affecting the Church.

What is the General Synod? \nR everend Dr David Hilborn, principal of Anglican training college St John's Nottingham, said that the lack of experienced clergy was partly caused by church policy. \n\"The Church used to say to the youngest who applied that they should go away and get some life experience. \n\"But if you want someone to be good at leadership, it's better to get them young so that by their 40s they're not just easing their way in, but are very experienced,\" he said. \nThe measure has been introduced now because more older clergy are able and willing to continue past the age of 70. \nOne quarter of clergy are in their 60s and the number of paid ministers has fallen from 8,006 in 2012 to 7,661 in 2015. \nFigures also show that 555 ministers left the clergy in 2015, while 457 joined - leaving a deficit of 98. \nA report published in September by the Church suggested that if clergy retired one year later than they currently do, this would help slow the decline. \nBut it said the Church must also recruit more young ministers in order to halt the falling numbers. \nDr Hilborn warned that the Church faces a struggle to train enough clergy to replace retirees. \n\"We need to increase our vocations among younger ordinands by 50pc over the next five years or so, and that's a tall order,\" he said. \nIf approved the new rules are due to come into force in July. The change would not affect the age at which clergy can collect their pensions, which will stay at 68.
