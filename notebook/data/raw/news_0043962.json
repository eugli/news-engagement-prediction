All told, upstate communities took in nearly 95 percent of the some 5,000 refugees New York accepted during the last fiscal year, according to the state’s Bureau of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance. Perhaps nowhere has that impact been more profound than in Buffalo, the self-described “City of Good Neighbors,” where about 10,000 refugees have been placed over the last decade.

At right, Mayor Byron Brown of Buffalo said one of the reasons that the city was getting stronger “is because of the presence of our immigrant and our refugee community.” Credit Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times “One of the reasons that Buffalo is growing, that Buffalo is getting stronger, that Buffalo is getting better, is because of the presence of our immigrant and our refugee community,” Mayor Byron W. Brown, a Democrat, told several hundred recent arrivals at a town-hall meeting in early February. The stance of Mr. Brown and other upstate leaders sharply contrasts to President Trump’s remarks casting refugees as potentially “very bad and dangerous people ,” bent on bringing “death and destruction ” to America. Other critics, while less hyperbolic, note the new arrivals often cost the government money in the form of food stamps, cash assistance and Medicaid benefits, as many begin new lives here below the poverty line. Schools also sometimes struggle with language needs and some school districts have been the subject of embarrassing, and costly, lawsuits relating to their treatment of refugee students. Still, economists say that such upfront costs are usually mitigated by immigrants’ long-term benefits to a community, a desire amplified by their often traumatic pasts. “The drive for citizenship and the drive for a permanent home is a pretty powerful drive,” said Paul Hagstrom, a professor of economics at Hamilton College, who has studied the impact of refugees on upstate cities. And unlike native upstaters, they tend to stick around. “My kid and every other kid here graduates from college and moves somewhere else,” Mr. Hagstrom said. “Refugees, they stay.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The impact has been felt in cities like Rochester that are still reeling from the departure of keystone businesses. “Northwest Rochester was Kodak country,” said Michael Coniff, the executive director of Rochester Refugee Resettlement Services. “As a neighborhood, we lost 50,000 jobs” as the film maker’s fortunes declined. The exodus of residents that followed, however, has been partly stemmed by new arrivals. “So it’s a very positive thing,” he said. That attitude is also evident in Buffalo, where Mr. Brown established a city liaison to the growing immigrant community, and the impact of the new arrivals is readily apparent on Buffalo’s West Side, a low-income neighborhood separated from Canada by a slim sliver of Lake Erie.

New businesses reflect that new diversity: The West Side Bazaar, “an international small-business incubator” teeming with food stands, does a healthy business, as does a local grocery offering fruits, vegetables and “worldwide money transfer.” A new local newspaper, The Karibu News , publishes in at least six languages. While Mr. Trump’s order has been stayed by federal courts, the turmoil surrounding it has nevertheless unsettled both the refugee and the resettlement communities. Dennis C. Walczyk, chief executive of Catholic Charities of Buffalo, said that the president’s order had spread suspicion among new arrivals. “They’re questioning us,” Mr. Walczyk said, adding: “Even though we’re all independent, nonprofit, nongovernmental agencies, the connection seems to be being made by some of our clientele, that, ‘Well, you’re an arm of the government.’” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
