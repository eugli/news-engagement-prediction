The ruling noted that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in District of Columbia v. Heller excluded such protection under the Second Amendment.\nFor the full story, see The Associated Press.", "external_links": ["http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GUN_CONTROL_MARYLAND?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"], "published": "2017-02-22T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:51:36.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
