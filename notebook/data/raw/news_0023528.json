These \"travelers\" assume the lives of seemingly random people, while secretly working as teams to perform missions to save humanity from a terrible future. \nMcCormack stars as FBI Special Agent Grant MacLaren, the team's leader. The cast also includes Mackenzie Porter, Nesta Cooper, Jared Abramson, Reilly Dolman and Patrick Gilmore. \nWright, who co-created Emmy-nominated Stargate SG-1 and its follow-ups, Stargate: Atlantis and SGU , serves as showrunner. Nick Hurran ( Sherlock )directed the pilot. \nA return date and episode count were not immediately available. \nThe renewal for Travelers comes at a busy time for McCormack, who is poised to reprise his role in NBC's 10-episode Will and Grace revival . The NBC comedy, which was picked up straight to series after an election-themed reunion video went viral, will work around McCormack's commitment to Travelers .
