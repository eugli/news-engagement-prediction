Reichle did it efficiently, hitting 20 of 25 shots, including 9 of 13 from 3-point range. Reichle also had eight rebounds, six assists and five steals, and went 7 of 7 from the free throw line. \nBilly Gates | The Oregonian/OregonLive ZACH REICHLE POURS IN 56 IN WILSONVILLE VICTORY \nSaid Wilsonville coach Chris Roche of the 6-5, Oregon State-bound forward: \"It's not like he came out and fired 35-40 shots to get his points. He actually did it totally within the team flow of the game... well, until he really got going, then all bets were off and he was attacking.
