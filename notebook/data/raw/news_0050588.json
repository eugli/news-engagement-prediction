Some fans are dubbing it as Future‚Äôs form of Beyonce‚Äôs LEMONDAE or Drake‚Äôs Take Care because of its heartfelt lyricism. HNDRXX is Future's version of \"Take Care\" \n‚Äî Chris P.

He also acknowledged that a particular song on HNDRXX may become a source of controversy. \n‚ÄúIt might get more attention than I want it to get,‚Äù he told Lowe. ‚ÄúIt might get the wrong attention, it might get great attention. Who knows? I just know it‚Äôs a song I feel good about. This is me not holding anything back.‚Äù \nThe first cut off HNDRXX , ‚ÄúMy Collective,‚Äù immediately addresses his relationship with lean and his son, saying neither one has to do with the other coinciding with Future‚Äôs goals of being as honest as possible with this record. He also goes on to address his relationship with Ciara , lawsuits, betrayal and falling in love throughout the 17-track album. \nCheck out Twitter‚Äôs reaction to Future‚Äôs soulful trap album HNDRXX with tears and gifs below. how FUTURE and HNDRXX got me feeling pic.twitter.com/m8QFFBtRTY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:13:49.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
