One person's junk is another person's treasure. Jeremy Scott transformed ordinary items — bubble wrap, UPS boxes, magazine cutouts, trash lids — into wearable runway looks. The first set of models wore beige dresses, tops, and shirts inspired by the packages we use (and toss out) every day. Words like \"fragile\" and \"caution\" were splashed across the clothes, while small boxes doubled as hat fascinators to drive home the point. \n\"Yes, we totally see where this is going,\" we thought as Kendall Jenner and Gigi and Bella Hadid walked out in similar looks. The designer had appeared to use the post office as inspiration. But folks, that wasn't all. \nJeremy still had plenty of magical creations up his sleeves, including dry-cleaning bags turned into dresses, duct-taped gowns, and hip-hop-influenced outfits. Models went from having '60s-inspired haircuts to wearing oversize gold medallions and colorful snapbacks. More nontraditional items were turned into hats, and a dress covered in literal garbage was sent down the runway. The designer could have chosen to stop there, but this is Moschino we're talking about. \nAs a quick juxtaposition to all the \"trashy\" outfits, the designer created a set of eveningwear that spoke to glamour and opulence. Suits and long-sleeved appliqué gowns appeared on the runway, reminding us there are two ends of the spectrum to what is beautiful. And every person has their own version of what's cool. If anyone was left still confused about Jeremy's message, however, postshow the designer stepped out in a shirt that read, \"Couture is an attitude.\" There you have it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:41:19.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
