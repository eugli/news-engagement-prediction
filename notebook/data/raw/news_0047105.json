It’s a revelation to me – a beautiful seaside town full of diverse well-preserved Georgian town houses. It’s dinky and quiet which I find refreshing, a great alternative to a heaving metropolis like London where I live. The people are friendly, it’s easy on the eye – and it’s a place where I go to write music and, more recently a play, without the many everyday distractions of home life. Anything special I should pack? \nIt’s Britain, so bring your wellies and also your beach gear – and maybe some bubble wrap, should you buy anything from the antique shops there. Britains 14 best seaside piers What do you miss when you’re away? \nBeing able to walk around such beautiful streets, which are largely empty and so evocative of another era, and imagining I’m a powdered wig-wearing chap out on a stroll 200-odd years ago, to get some sea air. Also the locals, who are so polite and friendly. Deal or no Deal? Seaside town in Kent renames itself after voucher website What’s the first thing you do on arrival? \nStand on the beach and look out at the sea. Then I wander around the bric-a-brac shops, trying to discover something that will change my life. \"I like to stand on the beach at look out at the sea\" Credit: AP Where’s the best place to stay? \nThe Royal Hotel (01304 375555; theroyalhotel.com ), on the seafront, which has spacious rooms and very friendly staff, as well as Dunkerleys (01304 375016; dunkerleys.co.uk) . It’s also on the seafront, serves great food and has a comfy restaurant area with, of all things, part of an old telephone switchboard in the back bar. A room at the Royal Hotel in Deal The best hotels in Kent Where do you meet friends for a drink? \nBloody Mary’s (01304 371305; bloodymarys.co.uk ) on the north end of the High Street, which can get very buzzy of an evening if you’re suddenly missing metropolitan atmosphere. Le Pinardier (01304 372788; facebook.com/pages/Le-Pinardier ) is also great. It’s basically a wine shop with a few tables but has an old school bistro feel. It often has live, jazzy music. — Le Pinardier Ltd (@Le_Pinardier) February 17, 2016 Where is the best place for lunch? \nAt the end of the modest pier, which has no amusement arcades – take note, Brighton – the clean and comfortable Jasins (01304 366820; jasinsrestaurant.com ) offers all-day breakfasts and mixes British and Mediterranean fare; liver and bacon and, alternatively, Turkish salads, which are delicious. The light and airy room offers not only a fab vista of the sea but also of Deal’s frontage. And for dinner? \nThere are, inevitably, two or three chippies. I know it’s not strictly dinner but my favourite is the outstanding Middle Street Fish Bar (01304 364738; 78 Middle Street) which has, bizarrely, bookshelves full of best sellers. If the weather is nice I’ll go and sit on the beach and eat. For proper sit-down dinner Frog And Scot (01304 379444; frogandscot.co.uk ) has good food and is relaxed and friendly or for something slightly more posh try Victuals & Co (01304 374389; victualsandco.com ) just off the High Street. Victuals & Co Where do you take a first-time visitor? \nIf you’re interested in the history of the Kent coast or even if you’re not, Deal Castle is worth a visit. I’ve never seen a castle like it. It’s like something out of a film by Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio. Also don’t miss the excellent music shop, Mark 1 Music (01304 372020; 12-16 Victoria Road). Few music shops like this exist any more and it has everything, from sheet music, saxophones and kids’ drum kits to vinyl records and violins. I think everyone should learn an instrument. \"Deal Castle is worth a visit if you're into history\" Credit: AP What should I avoid? \nEven empty shops on the High Street have a certain mystique about them to me but the lower level of the pier is in need of some TLC. What should I bring home? \nA handful of stones from the beach and a sense of ease. The most beautiful spots on the British coast (chosen by Robson Green) Public transport/taxi? \nDeal is tiny – you can walk the length of it in 20 minutes, unless you want an excursion to the Dover cliffs for which there are buses.

This is a small safe town but have a bit of cash ready if you visit the Saturday market and something antique-y takes your fancy. 25 perfect ways to enjoy the British seaside Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? \nUnless I get asked to film there I have no intention of ever going to Las Vegas, which represents almost everything that’s wrong with the world. Yuck. \nJeremy Swift’s debut album, Everything’s a Joke, is released on March 10.
