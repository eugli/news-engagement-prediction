With so many reboots and blockbusters overflowing your news feeds and time lines it's easy to miss out on the many indie gems that don't cause much commotion in the mainstream outlets. Lucky for you, that's where I come in. \nCheck out these 10 upcoming indie horror and thriller movies you won't want to miss: 1. 'Capture Kill Release' \nLoosely inspired by the crimes of Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo a.k.a. \"The Ken and Barbie Killers,\" #CaptureKillRelease is a real treat for deranged lovers and found footage suckers (like myself). If you are a fan of movies like House with 100 Eyes or Natural Born Killers, than I am certainly pleased to let you know that Capture Kill Release is for you. 2. 'Bloodrunners' \nA film noir-styled treat featuring longtime music mogul and crime series hero Ice-T, #Bloodrunners is a Prohibition era vampire thriller from writer/director Dan Lantz. In the midst of a power struggle between a local brigade of crooked coppers and a gang of moonshining business is an enterprise far more booming and bloody than boot legging. Also, because Bloodrunners is a period piece, you can certainly expect some pretty catchy tunes to keep you on your toes as well — enjoy! 3. 'Penance Lane' \nStarring #indie film scream queen Scout Taylor-Compton (RZ's Halloween, Wicked Little Things ), television star John Schneider ( Smallville, The Dukes of Hazzard ) and actor/producer Tyler Mane (RZ's Halloween, X-Men ), Penance Lane has been in the works since 2013 and is the second full-length feature to be backed by Tyler Mane's own production company, Mane Entertainment. 4. 'Strange Nature' \nStrange Nature is a disturbing exploration into the real-life epidemic of frog deformities occurring across the US and the potential root cause of their outbreaks. Admittedly less of a horror film than it is a thriller, #StrangeNature features an intimate, cinematic look into a very real and chilling issue with the added comforts of a fictional story and a cinematic escape. 5. 'Anders Manor' \nStarring Rachel True ( Half Baked, The Craft ), Danielle Guldin ( Almost Mercy, The Weekend ), wrestling personality Kevin Nash and Godsmack front man Sully Erna, #AndersManor is another Rhode Island blood bath from writer/producer Tom DeNucci and Woodhaven Media. Set for release this coming fall, Anders Manor is one horror film that damned well needs to be on your watch list. 6. 'Slasher.com' \nI knew something was up the first time I sat down and enjoyed Slasher.com. I was suspiciously intrigued by the film, but for some reason I couldn't stand the unlovable fuck-tarded main characters, who for some unknown reason could not seem to get a clue. Jack (Ben Kaplan) and Kristy (Morgan Carter) have never met in person but have formed an intimate relationship online. To escape the inner city chaos during the reign of a still unidentified serial killer, these two naive dopes venture into the country for a weekend getaway where they can finally meet and get to know each other. \nWith no way of knowing what insanely delicious and twisted perils they are in for, Slasher.com is a surprisingly clever and stupendously satisfying tale of seduction and betrayal that even seasoned viewers didn't see coming. Check out Slasher.com and I bet by the time you reach the conclusion your mind is changed about the helpless Jack and Kristy, and you will adore our ferocious lovebirds just as much as I do. 7. 'BB' \nTruly a twisted gem, BB is a reluctantly fabulous and insightful thriller from director C.J. Wallis that probes uncomfortably deep into life of a webcam worker and the mind of her unknown and violently obsessive No. 1 voyeur. The cast of BB are previously unknown actors and the movie itself was shot with a two person crew and financed from the very pockets of director Wallis himself. \nRecommended for fans of Creep and Megan is Missing, BB draws its fear from the very taboo reality the film showcases. It's nothing far fetched, from not only the dangers of working in adult entertainment but the underestimated strength of a jaded woman. 8. 'The Black Room' \nFor those who may be in need for a little Satanic-panic in their lives, Rolfe Kanefsky's new indie horror The Black Room is just what you need. Loaded with much adored faces such as Lin Shaye ( 2001 Maniacs, Insidious ), James Duval ( Donnie Darko, SLC! Punk ), Nick Principe ( Seed 2, Almost Mercy ), Tiffany Shepis ( Tales of Halloween, The Violent Kind ) and many more, the cast is basically a \"who's who\" of indie film. Reminiscent of some of our most haunting pleasures like American Horror Story, The Black Room is a whirlwind of supernatural and erotic energy that may just very well indeed leave you feeling ashamed — in the best way, of course. 9. 'Cut Shoot Kill' \nMy first thought upon viewing the trailer for #CutShootKill was that it made me feel nostalgic for films like The River Runs Red, I Spit on Your Grave and the '90s JapaneseGuinea Pig series. If pseudo-snuff is what you are into than be sure to check out writer/director Michael Walker's upcoming masterpiece Cut Shoot Kill . 10. 'Raw' \nOne of the most highly anticipated horror films of the year, #Raw promises to be the most gut-churning and horrifying films of 2017, as well as fresh challenge for us restless and insatiable gore-hounds. Gaining quite a nefarious reputation during its run in the festival circuit for its extreme and graphic content (causing many movie goers to faint), I think it's safe to assume the bloodthirsty horror community will be quite pleased with acclaimed writer/director Julia Ducournau's presentation of human addiction. Mark your calendars, as Raw 's March 10th release date is almost here — can you taste it? \nWhat are some of the movies you are looking forward to this year?
