Media caption One volunteer said \"people from all over the world\" were helping to try to save the whales \n\"Fingers crossed, the new whales are going to lead them out into deeper water,\" said Andrew Lamason, the department of conservation's regional manager. \nHowever, he added that there was still a chance that they might turn back into Golden Bay. \nMr Lamason said improved weather and clear waters also helped with the latest rescue attempt, but added that he had to warn volunteers about the possibility of stingrays and sharks after one of the dead whales appeared to have bite marks. \nOfficials on Saturday were also considering how best to dispose of the whale carcasses. Mr Lamason said that simply towing them out to sea could be problematic as they may become gaseous and buoyant and float into populated bays. Why do whales end up on beaches? \nScientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. \nBut it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. \nWhales that become beached will send out distress signals attracting other members of their pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide.

Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. \nIn February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves at the same location, of which at least half died.
