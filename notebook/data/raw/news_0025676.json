He offered Kyi Lin 800 to 1,000 lakhs kyat (US$58,000-US$73,000) to kill Ko Ni.\" \nPolice have identified Aung Win Khaing from CCTV images at the airport, which show him asking for flight arrival times before Ko Ni was shot. \nThey gave no reason why the former army officer, whom the statement said had voluntarily retired in 2014, ordered the murder. - AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:56:09.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
