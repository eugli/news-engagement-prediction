We still did not see any leaks regarding the Google Pixel 2, and rumors have been quite scarce as well, nothing concrete has popped up thus far. Well, while you’re waiting for rumors and leaks to start flowing, you can at least check out a concept design of the Google Pixel 2 which was shared by a YouTube channel called ‘Concept creator’, a source that shared quite a few concept designs in the last couple of months. \nIf you take a look at the embedded video down below, you’ll get to see a metal-clad smartphone with chamfered edges, which is nothing new, though this phone does look really nice. It has Google’s understated branding on the back, and no physical button on its front side. Its power / lock key lies on the right side, while the volume up / down buttons are placed on the left. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the back of this device, right below the rear-facing camera and the dual-LED flash. Side bezels are almost non-existent on this phone, and it comes with a bottom-firing speaker, or speakers, as there are two cutouts down there. A Type-C USB port is placed on the bottom of this phone as well, along with a microphone. The source shows off a couple of different color variants of this phone, including its Blue, Gray and Candy Red variants. \nNow, the designer of this smartphone also envisioned its specifications. So, the Google Pixel 2 also comes in two variants, at least this imaginary version does. The smaller device features a 5.1-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) 2.5D curved glass AMOLED display, while the larger model comes with a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) 2.5D curved glass AMOLED panel. The rest of their specs are identical, actually. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor fuels the Google Pixel 2 devices, while these two phones come with 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 64GB / 128GB of expandable internal storage. A 16-megapixel camera (1.65um pixel size, f/1.7 aperture) is placed on the back of the Google Pixel 2, and even battery packs were not mentioned by the source, quick charging certainly was. A 3.5mm headphone jack is also a part of this package, and it is placed on the very top of these two Google Pixel 2 smartphones.
