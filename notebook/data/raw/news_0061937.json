But today, they're back with a track that's explicitly designed to do just that. \nIn an email to THUMP, Loudpvck say that \"Traffic\"—their new collaboration with the Montreal duo Botnek—was conceived in order \"to figure out how to break the most speakers possible with one song.\" It delivers on that promise; piercing dog-whistle static builds up to nauseating hardcore breaks, heavy-lidded raps about drug trafficking, and a drop that feels like a jackhammer to the sternum. It's heavy stuff, and you'll definitely want to check it out below in advance of its proper release on Friday, February 24.
