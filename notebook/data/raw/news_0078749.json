The actor found himself being dragged into the eye of the storm after applauding a tweet by Virender Sehwag , which saw the cricketer taking a jibe at Kaur for her recent post that had her holding a placard that said, \"Pakistan did not kill my father. War did!\"\nThe Indian cricketer later shared a picture of himself posing in a manner similar to Kaur's, with a message on a placard that read, \"I didn't score two triple centuries, my bat did.\" The post, which is believed to have tickled Randeep's funnybone, earned an applause from the actor. Soon, Randeep and Sehwag were referred to as 'bullies' by social media users and were bashed for being insensitive towards the martyr's daughter.\nRandeep took to Facebook on Monday to clarify his stance saying that he wasn't being insensitive to the daughter of a soldier, who gave his life for the country. He further defended himself saying that standing up for Sehwag was not a justification of the violence that broke outside Ramjas College.\nHis note is as follows:\nDon't hang me over a laugh!\nViru cracked a joke and I admit I laughed. Damn! He is so witty and this is one of the other million things he's said that has made me crack up. That was it!\nBut now, lo and behold, I'm being held responsible for instigating hate threats against a young girl, shockingly by the girl herself. That's absolutely untrue. That was never our intention and our tweets are not the source of all the hate she might be receiving.\nShe spoke up, she stood for something she believes in, so then, she must also have the courage and fortitude to listen to the voices against it. To point fingers at someone else (in this case me) and hold him responsible for the reactions to her actions is not right. I have absolutely nothing against her and strongly believe that violence is wrong. Threatening a woman with violence is an even more heinous crime and the perpetrators should be brought to task for with the most severe punishment.\nI like her video of peace between warring nations. It's noble. But that's not the point of contention, is it? She has the right to protest against what she feels is wrong and it's also Viru's right to make a joke about it. We live in a democracy and enjoy the right to freedom of expression. Accusing us of bullying and trolling the girl is wrong.\nShe wasn't tagged in his joke nor in my amusement. But some journalists, among others, are trying hard to give this all kinds of colours to malign us and prove their point. They want to attach labels to us to further their agendas. That's bullying and if you think you can bully us, you have another thing coming.\nHow's the DU violence connected to her appeal against war? How's Viru's wit connected to supporting violence? The point is that it's not, but is very pointedly being manipulated into being so.\nThis girl's voice is important, but not more important than every other citizen. She is in no way representing all the martyrs and their children. It's her personal opinion and should be taken as such. And it is my personal opinion that people shouldn't fire their guns from young, impressionable shoulders. Students should study, debate and learn from these exchanges. They are the future of our nation and I'm not worried about our future because we have such brave and outspoken youngsters around.\nAs for being insensitive to a martyr's daughter, let me tell you that six of my classmates have sacrificed their lives for the nation and so have many others, senior and junior to me. Every village in my state has martyrs who have been saluted for more than two centuries. Yes, war is wrong but we didn't start it or persevere with it. We don't back down from protecting our borders even if it takes our loved ones away. How do we deal with it? With ironical humour!\nWith this, I'd like to end my engagement with this particular topic.\nJai Hind", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:01:34.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
