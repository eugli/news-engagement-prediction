Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Trafford Centre has been a beacon for the shopping masses since it opened in 1998. \nThe scene of many family days out, meeting up with mates and of course, shopping, it is one of the biggest retail centres in the UK. \nPeople flock from miles around to be wowed by the range of shops, bars, restaurants, marble lions and that dolphin fountain thing that shoots water REALLY HIGH in the air. \nAnd we really, REALLY love it. \nBut there are some things you only know if you've been there (especially on a Saturday in half-term). You will lose all sense of time \nIs it still daylight? What day actually is it? No one knows. \nYou headed into the Trafford Centre at 10.30am just to pick up a few bits, but suddenly it's 4pm. Or is it? You have no idea what time it is. Your mobile battery died hours ago. Your only guide is how hungry you are. \nAnd how much money you've spent. Ooh, look - the bars are open. \nIt's the only place you can visit 24 shops, have a three-course lunch, three pints, watch a film and end up in Laser Quest. On a Tuesday. Inappropriate clothing is everywhere \nYou start out wearing a coat and gloves because it's freezing and raining outside and you had to walk a whole five minutes to the entrance. But by the time you're inside and reach the turn off for the Orient, you've stripped off to a vest top and bought a pair of shorts because SWEATING. \nIt's so tropical you contemplate jumping into one of the fountains to cool off. Only you can't, there's too many people taking pictures and you don't want to accidentally end up on YouTube. Read More Revealed - the best places to go shopping in Greater Manchester \nSo you end up having to lug your winter coat, scarf and hat with you round all the shops and go for a cool down in the freezer aisle in M&S Food. Until you dehydrate so much you tell yourself you have to go for a pint. Bumping into people out of context \nYou are guaranteed to bump into someone you know. Whether that's your aunt, a mate from school, someone you've been avoiding, an ex, your neighbour or - worse - a colleague. And it's always awkward seeing someone you don't expect out of their usual enviroment. \nAnd hiding behind one of those fancy pillars doesn't help either. You will always get spotted, usually as you're tucking into a Millie's Cookie. \nSo, you end up having to do some small talk. \n'What you up to?' \nSilence. \n'Well, I'll let you get on'. \nThen you walk away. Only you realise too late you're now walking in the same direction and at the same pace as the other person. To the same shop. \nSo you violently change course, hurdling two prams and annoying the hoards of people you've just cut up, and go into the first shop you see. Which is how you end up buying an Oriental rug and 57 tea lights. Getting lost Trafford Centre \nIn theory it should be almost impossible to get lost in the Trafford Centre. You're always either at the Debenhams end or the 'posh' John Lewis end. Or perhaps in the food bit. That's how you gauge where you are. But then you decide to go upstairs and pop into a couple of shops, and when you emerge you have no idea where you are. \nSo, you head off in the direction of the flow of foot traffic, confident you'll soon see something familiar. Only you realise too late you're walking along with dozens of lost dads who've been circling the upstairs bit since 9.30am, wide-eyed and clutching the pair of socks they broke off to buy, frantically trying to find their families (who are all having the time of their lives in Paradise Island Adventure Golf). Walking for miles Trafford Centre \nThere is one thing that's guaranteed in any visit to the Trafford Centre; you will walk for miles (and complain repeatedly about your feet killing you). Whether you popped in for one item, or a hundred, you'll get your weekly exercise quota done in one go. \nBut the best bit is you don't even notice how far you're walking - because there are hundreds of shops to look at along the way. And again on the way back. And all those times you get lost and have to double back on yourself. \nAdd to that all the shopping bags you have to carry, then you might as well abandon your gym membership. Unless, of course, you hit the food court ... The Orient is mental The Orient inside the Trafford Centre \nNo shopping trip would be complete without a stop at The Orient. The food court/1930s ocean-liner - with huge TV, a pool (that you're DEFINITELY NOT allowed to swim in) and dozens of fast food outlets - is always busy, always loud, and impossible to avoid. \nYou tell yourself you've earned that burger and chips as you've walked the equivalent of a marathon* (*probably an exaggeration). But there's no way you can pass by the Orient without smelling the food and heading in. Well, shopping is hungry and thirsty work. Read More Trafford Centre bars and restaurants: The ultimate guide \nFrom Maccy D's to the biggest Wagamama in Europe, hours can be lost here. And the all-you-can-eat buffet at Pizza Hut can get pretty tense at peak times. But it's Wetherspoons where many an ambitious shopping trip has been merrily cut short. And many have ended up having to get the bus home. You will have an opinion on the decor \nIt is quite fancy in the Trafford Centre isn't it? Those people expecting the usual bland white shopping mall with strip lighting are always surprised when they walk in and find statues, gold railings, marble staircases, huge glass domed ceilings, decorative pillars, murals of cherubs and skies, and dozens of palm trees. \nAnd it has (what is claimed to be) the world's biggest chandelier in the Great Hall. What's not to love? \nThe Trafford Centre decor is so grand in fact it was dubbed the 'people's palace' when it first opened. \nBut there are some, mainly on TripAdvisor, that have said it's like walking into a 'nautical Greek tragedy'. \nWhatever your view, you can't deny it has quite an impact, regardless of how many times you've visited. And very shiny floors. Don't be surprised to see people taking pictures of everything! You will lose your car \nYou know where you parked it. But come 9pm when you finally emerge bleary-eyed and laden down with shopping, you have lost all your bearings. \nCue frantic circling of all the car parking bays. Angry exchanges with your other half, shaking your fist at inanimate plant pots and announcing you'll never ever go shopping again and will have to start a new life in car park 5A. Eventually, in exasperation and defeat, you declare it must have been stolen. \nOnly it wasn't. It's exactly where you left it. In the car park on the other side of the Trafford Centre. You just came out the wrong end. Off you go back through Debenhams. View gallery The long walk to home(wares) \nAs well as the actual TC, there is Barton Square. The longer-than-it-looks-bridge will take you to a cornucopia of homeware delights. Did you want a massive silver chest that only costs £250 instead of £400? Well, it's too late, because you've gone and bought it now. DAMN YOU HOMESENSE BARGAINS. \nIf it all gets too much, you can sit on the incongruously placed carousel and weep as you shovel a slice of Patisserie Valerie cake into your tragic little face. \nUseful tips: M&S cafe does a decent cream tea and Sea Life has a massive turtle in it. \nGood luck.
