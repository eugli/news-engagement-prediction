The state government, subsequently, appealed the judgment and is yet to conduct the court-ordered election till date. \nIn a fresh suit, marked FHC/L/CS/198/2017, the NCP is seeking for a declaration that only elected officers are entitled to run the affairs of all local governments in the state. \nThe suit, which was filed on behalf of the party by human right lawyer and activist, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, want a declaration that the state is not entitled to benefit from the federation account since it has refused to conduct local government elections. \nThis came as Philips promised that the commission would ensure a free, fair and credible election among parties. \nLASIEC boss made the remarks yesterday, at a stakeholders’ forum, organized by the commission to sensitize public on the forthcoming council poll, held at Alausa, Ikeja. \nDr. Oladosu Mudasiru, who was the Guest Lecturer at the forum, urged stakeholders to encourage internal democracy within their parties and also adopt an ideology. \nThe meeting was well attended by stakeholders from majority of the political parties in the state, such as; All Progressives Party, Peoples Democratic Party, National Conscience Party, NCP, All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, among others. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:35:51.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
