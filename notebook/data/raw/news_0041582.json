Later in the article, you will see how much the water level has increased at this S. Sacramento levee.\nThe pounding of the Oroville Dam area by a series of storms has begun in earnest. Rains are heavy and the stress on the dam is great. Governor Brown has replaced the local workers at the dam site with his own union-affiliated workers so that he can control the flow of information. Governor Brown is eerily silent.\nThe Danger to Sacramento Increases Exponentially Local flooding in Sacramento due to the present series of storms coming through the city are flooding out many of the areas in the city. At the present rate, there will be only one way out of the city and that is to the East.\nThe levees are failing, see the link below for a video of the distressed condition of the Sacramento flood control.\nPaul Preston Interview I interviewed Paul Preston regarding the increasing danger to both the Oroville Dam and the lack of functional flood control in Sacramento. In this interview, Paul Preston clearly lays out the danger to both areas. I would respectfully ask that all forward this interview with Paul Preston to as many people as possible. The dangers are real and California has a governor that is acting with complete depraved indifference toward the people.\nPaul Preston is self-evacuating very soon. Paul Preston badly needs to be wrong about his assessment of the situation. If he is right, he will live his home.\nThe People Speak Out I have received dozens of emails from people in the impacted areas and there is a growing awareness that Governor brown is not doing his job.\nDave Hodges,\nI live across the road from the Feather River. It is running swift and high. Many of us are leaving\nWe respect the job you are doing. Up here we all know what’s going on and Brown doesn’t give a dam about the people. Brown spends 25 billion dollars on illegals and nothing on protecting dams that could save lives. Did you know Brown replaced locals working on the dam with his own people? He doesn’t want people to know what is going to happen. I would like to get away from Governor Moonbeam, but I cannot afford to move. Keep telling the truth brother\nDear Dave,\nI talked to one of the Sheriff’s Deputies and he says it is only a matter of time until the dam fails. Many are evacuating themselves. Some still don’t get it. We do not know what to do with our animals.\nThanks for all that you do.\nDave Hodges,\nI live Sacramento. You know that our levees are failing. Parts of the city are already taking on water. Sacramento is going to be flooded out even if the Oroville Dam does not break.\nMany people here have laughed at the idea that we are in danger. When our TV reporters started covering the problems, many got scared. I have taken a weeks vacation and am leaving with family until we see whats going to happen with these storms that are rolling through.\nAuthor’s Note: This is is what this reader is talking about. Paul Preston was sent a disturbing video yesterday afternoon and it shows how bad of a shape that the flood control is in near S Sacramento.\nFROM PAUL PRESTON’S SITE: AGENDA21RADIO.NEWS\nUpdated February 17, 2017 at 6:10 pm Video Removed A video shot in Chico, CA near the Oroville Dam site in Butte County proves there is a mass ‘re-evacuation’ underway has been removed!\nA Facebook video made by “ Lyric Little ” around midnight on February 16, 2016 at a Chevron gas station off highway 70 in Chico, CA captured a conversation she had with a National Guardsman who told her there was a re-evacuation and that the National Guard was setting up evacuation centers as far south as Merced. Evacuations are to be starting within a day.\nRio Vista, CA Levees Cresting, Water on the Rise at the Confluence of the Sacramento and America Rivers February 17, 2017 In the mean time the word coming out of Sacramento, CA is that the American and Sacramento Rivers have joined together and are on the rise to the tops of the levees on both sides of the Sacramento River in downtown Sacramento. Below is a Facebook video by Pastor-Jess Foglesong shared Rvbridgeman ‘s video . of the levees cresting south of Sacramento in Rio Vista, CA at the The Helen Madere Memorial Rio Vista Bridge .\nTo view the video regarding the dire condition of the levee in S. Sacramento, click here .\nMr. Hodges,\nI wrote to you a few days ago and told you that you full of s***. I apologize sir, I was wrong. Jerry Brown wants us all dead.\nSkip Benson", "external_links": ["http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/08/CSS-Offical-New-Logo2.jpg", "http://www.agenda21radio.news/2017/02/16/dam-failure-is-near-re-evacuation-evacuation-centers-as-far-south-as-merced/", "https://www.facebook.com/rvbridgeman/videos/1276845169048586/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVpaIUxWgi4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque", "https://www.facebook.com/PastorJKFoglesong001", "https://www.facebook.com/little.jolyric", "https://www.facebook.com/ggmanrvbridgeman/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED", "https://www.facebook.com/rvbridgeman/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2017/02/sacramento-levee-failure-1024x576.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-18T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:02:51.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
