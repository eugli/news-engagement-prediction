Quebec electoral changes would impact gay village \nOnce fully operational, Pride Home will have space for five youth and two full-time staff, including a live-in support mentor. \nAccording to OUTSaskatoon, one-third of youth accessing shelters in the city are members of the LGBTQ community and 40 per cent of the non-profit organization’s youth group have experienced homelessness or precarious housing. \n“The reason that we started looking into creating Pride Home was because of stories that we heard both from older folks that access our services and from the youth … who said that people are still getting kicked out when they come out,” OUTSaskatoon executive director Rachel Loewen Walker said. \n“The second reason that we looked into this is that the available youth housing in the city if often gendered and so it’s really important to have a space that’s not gendered and that’s not a boys’ home or a girls’ home but is gender-inclusive.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon police headquarters opens gender-neutral washroom \nLoewen Walker said they know already there’s greater need and could have more homes down the road. \n“If you think about those critical years of growing up, being a teenager is hard enough as it is. Imagine coming out at the same time, imagine transitioning at the same time, imagine not being accepted by your community – so to not have a place that you get to go to that’s safe and welcoming at home … that speaks for itself.” \nIn the coming weeks, OUTSaskatoon is launching a community fundraising campaign to cover operations and programming for Pride Home. \nCurrently, two of five rooms are occupied. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
