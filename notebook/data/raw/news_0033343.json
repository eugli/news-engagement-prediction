Picture: Mark Scott. Clare Graham Central Coast Gosford Express Advocate Share Share on Twitter \nMILLIONAIRE ad mogul John Singleton is the latest big-name investor looking to make his mark on Gosford, one luxury development at a time. \nMr Singleton’s first high-rise project, Bonython Tower, is set to transform the main street of the neglected city centre with an impressive $35 million development on the existing Dutton’s Tavern site in Mann St. \nThe Mount White-based tycoon is calling it “the beginning of the Central Coast boom”. \nIn an exclusive interview with the Express Advocate , Mr Singleton — who is No. 155 on the BRW Rich List with a $416 million fortune — said he was “sick and tired of waiting” for the Coast’s capital to take off. \n“I want Gosford to be a part of the future rather than a part of the past,” Mr Singleton said. \n“Bonython will be as big a shock to Gosford as Bells was to Killcare — it’s going to be that good.” \n“Bells proves a point that Killcare, and the Central Coast for that matter, can sustain a world-class facility.” Bonython Tower will make a stunning and sophisticated statement in the heart of Gosford once completed. Source: Supplied \nOff-the-plan sales have already taken off for the “world-class” venture which includes two penthouse apartments with water views being snapped up at $1.3 million each. \nDutton’s Tavern is expected to be demolished as soon as April and replaced with 56 high-end apartments. \nThe 13-storey tower will also offer 1300sq m of new commercial office space in the heart of the city. \nMr Singleton said the development would also have a restaurant and bar on the ground level, rivalling fine dining establishments in Sydney and Melbourne. \n“As long as we can and at whatever cost, we’re going to revitalise this place,” he said of Gosford. \n“It’s not going to be a poker machine palace, it’s going to be a restaurant and bar where if you pay $1.5 million for a penthouse you’re happy to take your friends there for dinner. \n“At the moment, there’s nowhere to live in the main street of Gosford opposite the railway station and we want to change that. \n“You look at Liverpool, Kogarah, Parramatta and Penrith — you’re starting to see vibrant life all around the railway station, except Gosford and Wyong.” Two penthouse suites have already been snapped up by an unnamed wealthy businessman for $1.3 million each. Source: Supplied \nMr Singleton also recently snapped up the Montys fish and chip shop site opposite Gosford waterfront and is planning a seven-storey luxury apartment development worth $18 million. \nA first-class seafood and steak restaurant is also on the cards. \nMeanwhile in Mount White, an “up-market cafe” adjoining a rainforest walk is another project the John Singleton Group development company have in the pipeline for the Princeton Nurseries site. \nSINGO SICK OF WAITING \nThe cashed-up property, radio and horse racing kingpin has taken aim at all levels of government, blaming lack of “decent leadership” as the single biggest thing holding Gosford back from no longer being “Lithgow in the 1950s”. \n“Leadership and vision is the biggest thing holding Gosford back,” Mr Singleton said. \n“We’re looking at some major developments in Newcastle because it’s too hard to get anything through the amalgamated council here. \n“The Premier, the Ministers, the local members ... Can someone please give a damn? \n“They’re just fobbing us off. \n“As long as we can and at whatever cost, we’re going to revitalise this place. \n“We’re going to make it a place where you can raise your kids, where they can get an education and a job, where they can get something to look up to, where they will have more than a waterfront with a pie shop. \n“We’ve started the engine we’ve got to keep the train going.” Bonython Tower will offer a “world class” dining, commercial and residential precinct for the Coast. Source: Supplied \nCBD PRIORITY FOR NEW PLANNING MINISTER \nNewly appointed Planning Minister Anthony Roberts and 2GB radio shock jock Ray Hadley were two big names who attended the recent sales launch of Mr Singleton’s Bonython Tower. \nMr Roberts — who owns a holiday home in Killcare — praised Singo for his vision and commitment to “turbo charge” the region and said change was imminent. \n“Gosford CBD is depressing and it could be so much more,” Mr Roberts said. \n“If it means breaking eggs and kicking heads, then you’ll see a bit of that. \n“It really should be a jewel of the Coast. We can’t afford to wait. \nTRUMP’S SECURITY ADVISER MICHAEL FLYNN QUITS Trump's security advisor Michael Flynn quits 2:24 \nPresident Donald Trump's Security Advisor Michael Flynn has resigned over ties to Russia. February 14th 2017 2 hours ago /video/video.whimn.com.au/News/ \n“There is now an opportunity to do for the Central Coast what we’ve done for Newcastle. \n“For far too long the Coast has been neglected. It’s been betrayed by the previous Government who did very little or nothing to the place. \n“Part of me is a Coastie, it’s in my blood, and we’re going to fix it.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:08:16.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
