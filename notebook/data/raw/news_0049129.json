By Chris D'Angelo \nA platform of hatred. A plethora of racist, misogynistic and transphobic remarks. But through it all, many stood by far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos , often defending his right to free speech. \nOver the weekend, however, the Breitbart editor finally crossed what may have seemed a non-existent line, sending the American Conservative Union, publishing house Simon & Schuster and others who once supported him running. \nThe breaking point: defending pedophilia. \nVideo surfaced Sunday in which Yiannopoulos appears to condone sexual relationships between adults and 13-year-old boys , saying, ‚ÄúWe get hung up on this kind of child abuse stuff.‚Äù \nDespite a ‚Äú note for idiots ‚Äù on Facebook in which Yiannopoulos attempted to clarify what he said, and a subsequent post in which he took some responsibility for his comments, the fallout has been swift. \nHe was disinvited Monday from ACU‚Äôs annual Conservative Political Action Conference , where he was scheduled to speak along with Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and President Donald Trump‚Äôs strategist Steve Bannon. The group‚Äôs president, Matt Schlapp, said Yiannopoulos‚Äôs response on Facebook was ‚Äúinsufficient.‚Äù \nSimon & Schuster announced later Monday that it had decided to cancel the publication of Yiannopoulos‚Äô upcoming book, Dangerous . \nAmong his other deserters was ‚Äú alt-right‚Äù Twitter personality ‚ÄúBaked Alaska.‚Äù I am Milo's former manager.I have defended Milo for standing up for free speech on many occasions.Today, I cannot defend Milo anymore. ‚Äî Bakedü•õAlaska‚Ñ¢ (@bakedalaska) February 20, 2017 \nYiannopoulos‚Äô offensive verbal assaults have been plentiful. Among the more memorable was a racist attack against ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù and ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù star Leslie Jones , for which he was permanently banned from Twitter. \nViolent protests this month shut down his planned appearance at the University of California, Berkeley, campus. \nUnsurprisingly, many took to Twitter on Monday to blast the ACU and others, pointing out their willingness to ignore Yiannopoulos‚Äô bigotry ‚Äï up to a certain point. @AdamRothberg @simonschuster @threshold_books so to clarify: racism and transphobia = worthy of a book contract. pedophilia = not? ‚Äî Richard Lawler (@rjcc) February 20, 2017 So the line is pedophilia.
