Leonard, on the other hand, lives a quiet life in the relative obscurity of San Antonio. \nAs far as their teams go, the Spurs and Knicks couldn't be more different, either. Under coach Gregg Popovich, San Antonio has won five NBA titles since 1999 while the Knicks haven't claimed an NBA championship since 1973 and have had 11 different head coaches since 1999. \nBut Sunday afternoon's game between the two squads wasn't about history - it was about Leonard and Anthony going head to head in a battle of elite forwards. \nA quick glance at the box score would seem to show that Leonard got the best of Anthony - his 36 points led all scorers and dwarfed Melo's 25. \nHowever, when the game was on the line, Melo rose to the occasion, turning in a clutch performance that used to be commonplace for him. Of his 25 points, he scored 21 in the second half and iced a 94-90 Knicks' victory by scoring seven of New York's final 11 points, including the shot below, which came off a beautiful pick-and-pop play with Derrick Rose: \nWith a performance like that, Anthony showed why he's still one of the game's best players. Try as he might, Leonard simply didn't have enough left in the tank to hold off a trademark Carmelo fourth-quarter performance. \nLeonard has nothing to be embarrassed about, of course - his numbers speak for themselves and his Spurs are a championship-caliber team that currently sports a 41-13 record. Melo, meanwhile, could be on his way out of New York before the trade deadline. \nStill, Melo proved that he remains an elite player and whatever team he ends up with in March and beyond is getting a winner. If Melo is shipped to a Western Conference team (the Clippers, maybe?) seeing a playoff matchup between him and Leonard would be exciting for basketball fans everywhere.
