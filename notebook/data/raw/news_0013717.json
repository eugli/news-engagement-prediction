However, when a new villain, played by Charlize Theron, who’s making her debut in the franchise, seduces Dom into a world of crime he can’t seem to escape, the family will face a new set of trials. \nAnd as evident from the tagline of the trailer, the rules have certainly changed. The footage even shows Dwayne Johnson’s Hobbs and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw joining forces… begrudgingly. \nTheron joins fellow series newcomers Helen Mirren and Kristofer Hivju. Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris will also be returning. The franchise has proved a reliable bet for Universal, with the previous film “Furious 7,” grossing $1.5 billion worldwide. That 2015 film was also the last installment to feature late star Paul Walker. \nDirector F. Gary Gray also enters the franchise with “Fate.” Gray directed “Straight Outta Compton” and action flicks “The Negotiator” and “The Italian Job,” which starred Theron. \n“The Fate of the Furious”   April 14, 2017. Watch the trailer below. The rules have changed.
