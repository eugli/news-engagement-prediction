He was to lead a two-member delegation. \n“I was not given any reasons. After a four-hour wait, I was simply informed by the visa office that my application could not be entertained,” Hamdullah said. \nHaideri and Hamdullah belong to the same JUI-F party. \nThe JUI-F, headed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, is a coalition partner of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party. \nFazl’s party is known to be inclined towards Taliban and critical of US policies in the region. This could be a possible reason behind the visa denials to the politicians. \nHaideri’s case is being linked to the controversial immigration policy of US President Donald Trump. But the case suggests that the policy of strict vetting of visa applicants from religious parties was in place even during the previous Obama administration. \nThe US embassy did not comment on Hamdullah’s case, citing ‘privacy laws’, according to the report. \nAnd there has been no official reaction so far from Pakistan government or the Foreign Office. \nThe cases have come to light days after a US court refused to reinstate US President Donald Trump’s ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThose countries, however, did not include Pakistan. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:29.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
