Adam Madera says officers were on patrol Jan. 19, in the historic Indian Village neighborhood, when they noticed something strange. \n“The observed an individual walking around the home with what looked to be an incinerator device in her hand, and they observed her throwing it at the house area,” Madera said. \n“I don’t think it actually caught the house on fire — I think it actually caught the grass on fire — and they were able to put it out.” \nThere were no injuries and no serious damage was done to the home. \nKizzy Nickerson, 39, was arrested at the scene and is facing multiple charges, including explosives – placing offensive substance with intent to injure, a 20-year felony, possession of a bomb and arson. \nPolice would not immediately confirm reports that Nickerson deliberately targeted Harlan, whom she felt was somehow responsible for Detroit’s crime rate. \n“It’s not something that we want to get into, exactly why somebody would do something,” Madera told WWJ’s Sandea McNeill. “Just that officers were able to be on scene and react quickly, and prevent anybody from getting hurt.” \nRecords show Nickerson has served prison time for retail fraud and assaulting a police officer. \nHarlan left her job at WDIV Local 4 in November, 2016, after 28 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:30:09.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
