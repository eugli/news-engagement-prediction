No? Well, too bad because Instagram is set on giving you exactly that. \nThe app formally introduced a new feature that allows users to attach up to 10 photos and videos to a single post. In other words: you can turn individual posts into photo albums. SEE ALSO: Instagram just ruined Instagram \nFirst spotted in the beta version of the app earlier this month, the feature is rolling out now and will be live in all countries over the next couple weeks. \nUploading an album works much the same way as any other photo or video post only now you can select multiple photos and videos by tapping a new \"select multiple\" icon from the upload screen. \nOnce you've picked the photos and clips you want to include, you can edit and add filters to each image, though the company is only allowing square-cropped photos in albums for now. You can also rearrange the order the photos and videos will appear by holding down and dragging. \nAfter you post an album, your followers and others can view the posts by swiping across, carousel-style, just like they would on Facebook (Facebook owns Instagram). \nIn addition, Instagram is upping the number of photos and videos that can appear in one of its \"carousel ads\" so advertisers can also take advantage of the new format. \nLike so many recent Instagram updates, the move is likely to controversial. Instagram purists have already criticized the feature as one that could ruin the app. As Mashable Tech Editor Pete Pachal summed it up , \"albums are destined to turn Instagram into a place where tedious photo sets from vacations, bar mitzvahs and holiday parties are interspersed with the images users actually want to see.\" \nAs with so many other Instagram updates, it's all about engagement. \nBut the company likely has its own reason for adding the feature other than its stated (and extremely vague) motivation of making it \"easier to share your experiences with your friends.\" Again, as with so many other Instagram updates, it's all about engagement. \nAs the company has pared down the number of posts that appear in feeds with its new algorithm, adding photo albums into the mix gives the company a new way to encourage users to spend more time in the app without actually increasing the number of posts you see at any given time. It also stands to boost to engagement metrics like time spent and the number of photos being shared in the app, stats that hadn't been that great prior to the advent of Stories . \nSpeaking of Stories, if Instagram's success with the once-mocked feature is any indication, the app's albums will likely prove to be a hit as well, despite the expected backlash. \nIn any case, Instagram's 400 million daily active users should get ready for a more crowded feed.
