Mr Justice Cobb analysed the case at a private family court hearing in Sheffield earlier this month and announced his decision in a ruling published today (February 16th). He said the couple could not be identified.\nThe couple, who are in their 20s and have mild learning difficulties, said they had been unaware of the Huddersfield family court hearing.\nThey said their human rights to a fair trial and to respect for family life had been infringed, as had the human rights of their son.\nCouncil bosses accepted that staff had not informed the couple of the court hearing.\nMr Justice Cobb said the couple and their son, who is now 15-months-old, had been given legal aid to fund damages claims. He said the case would see taxpayers picking up a bill of more than £130,000.\n Money West Yorkshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:45:54.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
