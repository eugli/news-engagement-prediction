As a result of infractions committed during Hugh Freeze 's tenure and that of former head coach Houston Nutt, the school announced a self-imposed bowl ban for the 2017 season, according to Neal McCready of RebelGrove.com. College Football Talk's Bryan Fischer tweeted the one-year ban will mean Ole Miss loses out on the $7.8 million it earns for its share of the SEC's postseason bowl purse. Despite taking the step of removing itself from bowl consideration for a year, Ole Miss isn't out of the woods yet. Fox Sports' Bruce Feldman reported the NCAA charged the school with lack of institutional control. The school shared statements from Freeze, Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter and Ross Bjork, Ole Miss' vice chancellor for intercollegiate athletics, addressing the investigation: Former Rebels basketball player Marshall Henderson seemingly reacted to the news: marshall henderson @NativeFlash22 2/22/2017, 10:03:30 PM Yahoo Sports' Pat Forde first reported on the Rebels' violations in January 2016, with the infractions covering not only the football program but also the women's basketball and track and field teams. In August, Forde wrote the NCAA's investigation was nearing its conclusion until former Rebels offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil admitted on the NFL draft's first night that he accepted money from Ole Miss. The NCAA then visited multiple SEC schools, including Mississippi State and Auburn, to interview players whom Ole Miss recruited. Feldman reported an Ole Miss staffer connected a prospective recruit to boosters, who then paid $13,000 to $15,600 before the recruit ultimately signed with another school.
