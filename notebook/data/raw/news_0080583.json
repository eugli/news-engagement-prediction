That includes making sure that UK products remain competitive and continue to comply with the standard currently in place.\nFinally, it calls on the Government to ensure that the UK maintains access to the European Investment Bank to prevent a “funding cliff edge” and that it does everything it can to avoid a return to “hard borders” with Northern Ireland that would hinder the free movement of people and goods.\nAt an event hosted by the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) in London last week, experts warned that whatever the outcome of negotiations on trade , British firms will face expensive queues at customs borders after Brexit.\nThe experts said that while it might be legally possible to conclude new customs arrangements, this would not eliminate the need for firms to demonstrate to customs officers they are exempt from rules of origin and various product standards checks.\nThose checks would inevitably lead to considerable disruption relative to the current frictionless cross-border goods trade with the EU.\nCampaign group Open Britain threw its weight behind today's report, saying that businesses across Britain have repeatedly stressed that leaving the EU with no deal would be damaging for the economy, hit trade and cost jobs. \n“If it proves impossible to agree a good free trade deal with Europe at the end of the Article 50 process, it is essential that we arrange a transitional deal that will maintain our current terms of trade and prevent the economy from going over a cliff edge,” said Anna Soubry, former small businesses minister and a leading supporter of Open Britain.\nWhat experts have said about Brexit 11 show all What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond The Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit\r “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” \r “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.”\nReuters\n2/11 Yanis Varoufakis Greece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave. The proof is Theresa May has not even dared to trigger Article 50. It's like Harrison Ford going into Indiana Jones' castle and the path behind him fragmenting.

The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction”\nGetty\nShe said that this “underlines why MPs should have a meaningful vote on the final deal once negotiations have been completed”. \n“We cannot be allowed to crash out with no deal at all without parliamentary approval.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:08:31.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
