The team said it planned to announced a free-agent signing during a news conference at its Arizona spring training complex. \nNapoli was seen in Surprise, Arizona, on Wednesday, when he was set to take a physical. He will get a $6 million salary this year, and the agreement includes an $11 million club option for 2018 with a $2.5 million buyout. \nA member of the Rangers in 2011 and 2012, Napoli spent the final two months of the 2015 season in Texas, signed with Cleveland as a free agent and hit a career-high 34 homers last season, when \"Party at Napoli's\" became a team rallying cry. \n___ \nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
