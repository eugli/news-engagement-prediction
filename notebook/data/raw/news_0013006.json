They haven’t done so in their last seven trips to the big game, but Sunday’s slow start against the Falcons may be too much to overcome. \nThe Patriots fell behind 14-0 in the second quarter. That may seem like a large deficit for a normal game, and it’s even bigger in the Super Bowl. Why? Because the largest comeback in Super Bowl history is 10 points. Largest SB comeback: 10 pointsWAS vs. DEN – down 10-0, won 42-10NO vs. IND – down 10-0, won 31-17NE vs. SEA – down 24-14, won 28-24 \n— Reuben Frank (@RoobCSN) February 6, 2017 \nThe last time that happened was in Super Bowl XLIX, when the Patriots came back to beat the Seattle Seahawks. \nNew England went into the locker room at halftime down 21-3 after it settled for a field goal with a few seconds left in the second quarter. Teams holding an 18-point lead at halftime in the postseason are 67-2. In @SuperBowl era (Since 1966 season), teams are 67-2 in the postseason when holding a lead of at least 18 points at halftime \n— NFL Research (@NFLResearch) February 6, 2017 \nSo, if the Patriots are going to complete this comeback, they’re going to make history in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:53:07.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
