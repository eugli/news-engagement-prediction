We’re consuming more frozen pork belly than pig farmers can provide. \n“Today’s pig farmers are setting historic records by producing more pigs than ever,” said Rich Deaton, president of the organization. “Yet our reserves are still depleting.” \nIn December of last year, the amount of frozen pork belly we had waiting for us to pig out on was 17.8 million pounds, which is the lowest level since 1957 according to the Department of Agriculture. Due to the shortage, you may have noticed that makin’ bacon is a bit more expensive than it used to be. The price has indeed shot up about 20 percent last month. \nBut don’t panic. Deaton assures us that there will still be plenty of pork to partake in, saying “While bacon may become more expensive for consumers, rest assured the pork industry will not run out of supply.” \nSo relax, have some bacon, and contemplate the fact that our amazing nation actually has bacon reserves.
