If cars came in boxes. It’ll happily launch from 0-62mph in three seconds flat, and rock on to a top speed of 199mph, where permitted of course.\nSo what Gemballa has achieved here is nothing short of frightening. Internet, today we bring you a small bit of news about a big bit of car: meet the Gemballa ‘Avalanche’. That name referencing the effect its acceleration will likely have on the environment.\nFor this modified Porsche 911 Turbo (honestly, who modifies a 911 Turbo?), packs a whopping 809bhp. Which is an entire Peugeot 308 GTI more powerful than a regular Porsche 911 Turbo. If you’re fond of big torque, then you will be pleased, because it has Big Torque: 709lb ft.\n“The Gemballa Avalanche is an indefinable creation of engine sounds, power and acceleration to blast you across the horizon,” explains Gemballa, and we’re frightened. And though no acceleration or top speed figures have been Quote: d, well, you don’t have to guess too hard.\nThere’s literally no more information other than that which you have just read, and the two rather purple renders you have just seen. You’ll spot the new bonnet, front bumper arrangement, new wheels, new exhausts, and, um, what we think is a rear wing but could very well end up being some kind of inter-planetary communications system.\nAh, there is one more snippet. The Avalanche - so named after Gemballa’s original 1984 Porsche 911 Turbo with 385bhp - will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show next month, joined by another similarly-powered sibling. “We will be presenting two supercars in Geneva,” explains Gemballa boss Steffen Korbach, “the Gemballa Avalanche and Gemballa GTR 780 Evo-R, which both set new standards in performance and style.”\nCryptically, he added that both cars are “set to break some records”. Hmm…\nTake all the time you need to process this information. We’ll be back in due course with more information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:18:55.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
