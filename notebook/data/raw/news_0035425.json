The Las Vegas-based promotion revealed the 170-pound pairing on Friday. UFC 210 takes place at the Keybank Center in Buffalo on April 8 and is headlined by a light heavyweight championship rematch between Daniel Cormier and Anthony Johnson . Alves attempted to make his first lightweight foray at UFC 205, but the Brazilian tipped the scales at 162.6 pounds for a clash with Jim Miller . Alves would then lose a unanimous decision at the Nov. 12 event. The majority of his career has taken place at 170 pounds, as Alves won nine of his first 10 Octagon appearances before falling to Georges St. Pierre in a title bout at UFC 100. In his most recent welterweight appearance, “Pitbull” suffered a second-round doctor stoppage defeat to Carlos Condit at UFC Fight Night 67. Cote, a former middleweight title challenger, has compiled a 5-2 mark since changing divisions. “The Predator” is coming off a third-round technical knockout loss to Donald Cerrone at UFC Fight Night 89 last June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:36:23.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
