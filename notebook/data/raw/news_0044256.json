Author Roxane Gay even canceled a book with Simon & Schuster after the imprint inked a book deal with Yiannopoulos, who is permanently banned from Twitter after engineering a campaign to harass actress Leslie Jones. Over the weekend, however, things fell apart after audio emerged of interviews in which Yiannopoulous appeared to condone pedophilia . His book was canceled by Simon & Schuster , and he was disinvited from the upcoming Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) . \nAuthors didn’t miss the chance to ding Yiannopoulos. J.K.

Gay and Jones also chimed in. Check those out below. \n— J.K.
