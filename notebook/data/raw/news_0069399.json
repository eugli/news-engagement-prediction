Photos \nKaty asked, \"Do you like my new hairstyle ?\" to which the fan responded, \"Yes, I love it!\" \nHowever, the lie detector test said that was a lie. \n\"Alright, well it's a wig,\" the pop star responded in surprise. \"I can take it off. Fine, sure! I'm just experimenting. Why can't I live?! Wow, I didn't know this was going to be so intense for me, too. I wasn't prepared!\" \nDanielle went on to admit that she has illegally downloaded one of Katy's songs, but when she promised she's never disliked one of the singer's ensembles , the lie detector test said otherwise. \n\"You coming for me!?\" Katy joked. \"I was going to let you borrow this outfit!\" \nNeedless to say, the game was hilarious for Danielle, Katy and listeners alike.
