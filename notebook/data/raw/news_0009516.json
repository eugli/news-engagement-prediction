He'd be perfect. #doctorwho!'\nTime to go: Peter Capaldi announced his decision to quit as the twelfth Doctor on Monday night\nThe theory proved popular as the news spread that Marshall is leaving the role of Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman.\n'So Kris Marshall leaves #DeathInParadise, just as they're starting to look for a new #DoctorWho... #Coincidence...?? ;-)' a fourth person theorised.\n'Huh so Kris Marshall leaves Death in Paradise around the same time Peter Capaldi leaves Doctor Who.
