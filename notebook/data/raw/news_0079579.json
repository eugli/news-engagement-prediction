Former Benue State Governor, Gabriel Suswam, has been invited by the Department of State Services, DSS. \nVanguard learned that there were frantic efforts early in the day by friends and associates of the former governor to secure his bail but the move reportedly hit a brick wall, leaving him at the mercy of his host, who believe strongly that he had a criminal case to respond. \nIt was learned that apart from the illegal possession of arms and ammunition, the security agency was also contemplating handing him over to the anti-corruption agencies to investigate and possibly prosecute for the vast property and valuables discovered with him. \nA source close to the DSS confirmed that the former governor was still being interrogated as at 9:30 last night and that there were indications he would not be going home last night. \nThe DSS, on Sunday, alerted the nation of the arrest of Suswam following the discovery of what it called ‘incriminating items’ from two exotic cars belonging to the former governor which it also confiscated. \nThe items found by the DSS were Glock pistol with two magazines and a total of 29 rounds of ammunition; Mini-Uzi with two magazines containing 10 rounds and 4 rounds respectively; 42 extra rounds of ammunition contained in a pack; and one AK-47. \nOther items recovered were 21 Certificates of Occupancy (C of O) and one Offer of Statutory Right of Occupancy; 23 Luxury designer watches; and 45 keys to various exotic cars. \nThe DSS said: “Following this discovery, the Service launched further investigation which revealed that the cars and the recovered items belong to the former Governor of Benue State, Gabriel SUSWAN who has already been invited by the Service and presently helping in the investigation. \n“It is in the light of this latest development that the Service wishes to sound a note of warning to persons and groups that it will no longer tolerate any acts of lawlessness by those who ought to be law abiding and responsible citizens”. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:49:20.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
