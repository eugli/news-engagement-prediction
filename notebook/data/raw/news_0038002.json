But tackling the world's highest mountain on skis wasn't the only mind-boggling feat Granheim achieved that day, more than a decade ago. A clip shows Granheim niftily navigating Everest's North Col The sharp-edged pass carved by glaciers is found in the ridge connecting Mount Everest and Changtse in Tibet Another frame of footage shows the adventurer whizzing past the camera at high speed - he was on Everest's North ridge at this point, zipping along at around 23,950 feet He also managed to summit the peak in one day. He rapidly ascended the mountain from the Tibetan side, scarpering up from Advanced Base Camp - 20,997 feet above sea level - to the 29,028ft summit. The gruelling trek, known as the Mallory route, usually takes climbers around five days to complete. However, the adventurer revealed at an event attended by MailOnline Travel recently that his 'dream' adventure soon turned into a nightmare when his Swedish skiing companion, Tomas Olsson, fell to his death while making the nail-biting descent. Recalling the chain of events, Granheim, 42, said: 'We managed to climb Everest with our skis from the Tibetan side in a day to the summit. 'It's like magic when you reach the top and so beautiful you just want to stay up there. Granheim said he wishes he had more footage from the adventure that took place ten years ago, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today Video footage captures Granheim's skiing adventure down Everest, with a group of mountaineers seen ahead Tragically Granheim lost his skiing partner, Tomas Olsson, during the ski run and was forced to make his way down the slopes alone 'But we also had the urge to ski off the summit. We managed to ski down and follow the Great Couloir, negotiating our way through the crevices. 'We passed a bunch of mountaineers and they didn't know what to make of us. They thought we were crazy. 'To do this project was a big dream for me and my friend Tomas. 'I thought it would be the best day of my life but it wasn't. 'At about 27,000 feet my friend fell off the mountain and of course he didn't make it.' While he started his story with a cheeky smile and a sparkle in his eye, Granheim suddenly took a more grave tone as he touched on the traumatic day, adding that 'it was really tricky to move on from the experience'. Apparently Tomas Olsson had been rappelling down a 150ft rock cliff at around 27,887 feet when a snow anchor broke off and he slid down the wall and vanished from view Granheim talked about his Everest adventure at an event in Norway recently in front of a packed audience With no way of being rescued from the high-altitude mountainside, Granheim had to descend the slopes of Everest alone. When he reached lower ground he immediately told his support team about the fatal accident. Amazingly they managed to locate Tomas' body four days later in the snow and they arranged for the first ever helicopter rescue from Everest's Tibetan side. Apparently the Swede had been rappelling down a 150-foot rock cliff at around 27,887 feet when a snow anchor broke off and he slid down the wall and vanished from view. Despite the devastating incident on May 16, 2006, Granheim didn't put his daredevil activities to bed. Most recently he made headlines for being the first Norwegian to summit all 82 peaks of 13,123 feet or above in the Alps. He pushed on at lightning speed, summiting 18 of the technically challenging mountains in just three days. Most recently Granheim made headlines for being the first Norwegian to summit all 82 peaks of 13,123 feet or above in the Alps Revealing where his passion for adventure started, Granheim, who grew up in a small village outside of Oslo, said: 'I've always been very inspired by people who are pushed to their limits. 'I remember one thing that really inspired me was this Rolex advert on the back of a National Geographic magazine. 'When I saw this ad I saw a man climbing into the unknown and I wanted to be this man.' In a video for one of his main sponsors, Bergans of Norway, Granheim explains that mental strength is the main quality needed when traversing the unknown. He also notes that it's important 'to have a very solid respect for the limits'. Next up for Granheim? Watch this space!
