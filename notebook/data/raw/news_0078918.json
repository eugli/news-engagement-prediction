Probably for the best when it comes to certain brands . This week at Mobile World Congress , two companies are attempting to reignite those good feelings after a decade of disappointment. \nTen years ago, Nokia and BlackBerry were flying high. Both were among the most trusted and purchased names in mobile, only to have those numbers drop off a cliff, when a single handset came along and changed the game forever . \nThe brands share similar trajectories over the past decade, filled with foot dragging and belated attempts at reinvention, and this week at the world’s largest smartphone show, both will be reborn at the hands of third-parties. HMD, in Nokia’s case, a newly formed Finish company born at the hands of former employees, looking to bring the one-time mobile leader’s name back to the smartphone space. \nBlackBerry has the decidedly more enviable position of a licensing partnership with TCL, a billion dollar Chinese corporation best known for its TVs, that has managed to make some headway in the States with its Alcatel sub-brand. For BlackBerry, the partnership is a well-timed lifeline — the company has struggled to keep its head above water in recent years. For TCL, it’s simply a chance to capitalize on good memories and expand its smartphone portfolio into the enterprise. \nIt’s an interesting bet for TCL and HMD, and a broader test of brand loyalties. Can good feelings from a decade ago trump recent disappointments? And do names and logos mean more to consumers than the actual companies and people calling shots behind the scenes? A tale of two dusty brands \nIt seems like TCL’s BlackBerry ambitions are pretty modest. “We asked if people would consider a physical keyboard,” TCL/BlackBerry Mobility GM Bruce Walpole told TechCrunch yesterday. “25 percent of people said they would consider it.” He added that if half of that 25 percent picked up the KeyOne , the company would be plenty satisfied. The company even tossed around the word “niche” a few times during our conversation. \nPerhaps those modest expectations come with having the backing of a multi-billion dollar corporation. If the KeyOne fails, it likely won’t have a tremendous impact on the company’s bottom line. HMD, on the other hand, has entered this week’s show with far more bluster. The company has been talking up its Nokia relaunch as an announcement of game changing proportions. \nAnd while the company hasn’t necessarily delivered on its promise of disruption, it’s certainly delivered on volume, with three new phones. The company already unveiled the Nokia 6 for the Chinese market recently — this phone will soon be going global too. Latest Crunch Report Watch More Episodes \nHMD is all-in with the Nokia brand because it has to be. The company was created with the primary purpose of distributing Nokia-branded handsets. If these devices fail to entice the smartphone buying public, then HMD will likely fail along with it. It’s a lot to hang on brand loyalty as a key differentiator in an already overcrowded market. \nNokia lost this fight once already, a sentiment perfectly captured in 2011 by the company’s then-CEO, Stephen Elop, who penned a memo to his staff that was equal parts hopeless and hopeful. The “Burning Platform” memo describes a company at the end of its rope, likening the experience to man trapped on an oil rig in the in the middle of the ocean. \n“There is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the North Sea,” Elop wrote. “He woke up one night from a loud explosion, which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire. In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames.” \nOf course, we know how the story ends. Nokia didn’t jump in time. The company, which boasted a global smartphone market share of around 50 percent the year the iPhone arrived on the scene, was nearing single digits by the time the memo was issued – and the bleeding would only continue from there. The company referred to the KeyOne as BlackBerry’s first device without “compromises,” an implicit acknowledgement that all previous devices had fallen short of consumer expectations in one way or another \nBlackBerry/TCL, for their part, seem to acknowledge that they have lost the hearts of a once rabidly loyal fanbase when it failed to keep up with the promises of the iPhone. In our conversation, the company referred to the KeyOne as BlackBerry’s first device without “compromises,” an implicit acknowledgement that all previous devices had fallen short of consumer expectations in one way or another. \nThe physical keyboard is certainly a key part of the device’s appeal, both in terms of hoping to recapture users who still miss the feature after years of going touchscreen only, while heavily playing into a sense of nostalgia. With the arrival of the device formally known as the Mercury, which pays more than a passage homage to earlier devices, it seems we may have finally entered the era of smartphone nostalgia. Here’s to simpler times \nHMD’s 3310 reboot is even more on the nose than BlackBerry’s offering. It’s a device whose primary raison d’être is playing upon all of those warm-and-fuzzy feelings Nokia diehard fans have for their old devices. It’s a fairly novel concept for a space so defined by a constant drumbeat toward innovation. But nostalgia alone won’t be enough to keep the brand afloat. \nBut smartphones are not diners. People aren’t driven by the same impulses when buying smartphones and hamburgers. Red meat will fill up your belly for the rest of the day. A good handset should last a few years.
