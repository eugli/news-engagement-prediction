There were two other children in the family, but they were not mentioned in the court case. \nRobinson had custody of the four kids for about a year after the children’s parents split up, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. \nRobinson was arrested in October 2014 after she took the child to a hospital claiming she could not control the girl anymore. \nPolice were called because t he girl looked malnourished and had burns and bruises all over her body, according to KFOR. \nThe victim’s ankles had cuts that were infected and her wrists “ had the appearance of possibly being bound,” according to the police report. \nProsecutors said that Robinson engaged in these acts of abuse while dressed as a witch named Nelda, The Oklahoman reported. \nHer 31-year-old boyfriend, Joshua Granger, reportedly would wear a demon costume and call himself Coogro. \nGranger pleaded guilty to one count for assisting and “causing mental injury” to the girl, according to The Associated Press. \nAccording to a court document obtained by The Oklahoman, the victim told a counselor that Nelda “goes into” her grandmother and makes her “do mean things,” and she said “Nelda eats bad kids.” \nRobinson told the court Thursday that she is being treated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia while in jail and that she was treated for mental illness in the 1970s in Texas. \nBoth Robinson and Granger will be sentenced March 28.
