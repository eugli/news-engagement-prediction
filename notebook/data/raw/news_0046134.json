Founder of World Hijab Day shares what wearing the hijab really means for women \nAt just 22-years-old, the Central St Martins graduate has already designed outfits for some of the world’s biggest stars, including Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, and Miley Cyrus. \nAnd fresh from his first runway show at New York Fashion Week last week, his latest brief has been to redefine what we think of our favourite fashion staple. \nThe jeans, modelled by Toby Huntington-Whiteley and others, just have one pocket instead of the usual five. A post shared by Miranda Larbi (@mkyl500) on Feb 15, 2017 at 2:07pm PST \nIt’s the exact shape and size of the Pixel phone. \nThat’s because Google says we do everything on our phones – so all you need to carry around is your phone (although what you do with your keys is another question). \nYou can now use your mobile to pay, work remotely, take photographs, navigate your way around, read, watch…saving you the faff of carrying umpteen gadgets.

(Picture: Google) \n‘I went through endless colour matches to make sure they were exact because obviously, no one’s ever done it before so it took a bit of time to get it perfect,’ explains Christian. \nAnd you too can get your hands on a bespoke pair, by contacting Christian directly. He’ll apparently give you a price upon the primary fitting. \nYour dusty old Wanglers will never look that blue again.
