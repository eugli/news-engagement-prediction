Is this the envelope that caused the mix-up? Well, no (Photo: Getty) \nAs we now know, the confusion at the end of the awards show all came about because Warren Beatty was given the wrong card - which announced Emma Stone in La La Land as Best Actress. \nSo, naturally, people thought that the card Leo was holding earlier in the night somehow wound its way back on to the stage again. Read More The way Andrew Garfield looked at ex-girlfriend Emma Stone during her Oscars speech is breaking hearts \nThey started blaming him for keeping hold of the card and \"putting it down somewhere\" where it was later picked up mistakenly and used for the Best Picture announcement. \nSome even accused him of sabotaging the awards show because of his long history of, well, not winning. \nBut we want to clear Leo's name once and for all. Here's why Leo isn't to blame \nThere is video evidence of Emma Stone holding the red card as she came off the stage at the awards. Read More \nIn the clip, Leonardo DiCaprio guides her through a crowd of photographers and she can clearly be seen holding the red envelope. See! Leo gave the card to Emma straight away (Photo: Getty) \nShe also told reporters she didn't let go of the card the whole evening. \nBeatty explained to the audience how the card he had opened said \"Emma Stone, La La Land\", which is why he hesitated after he opened the envelope. \nReports claimed that two cards are made for each awards category and two workers stand at either side of the stage alternating between who has the responsibility of handing them out. \nSo it's entirely possible there were two cards and they got mixed up. (Photo: AFP) \nIn a statement, the accountancy firm responsible for handing out envelopes apologised to everyone affected by the embarrassing blunder. \nA spokesperson PricewaterhouseCoopers said: \"We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,\" \n\"The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\" The cast of \"Moonlight\" and \"\"La La Land\" appear on stage (Photo: AFP) \nPWC concluded by thanking the nominees, the Academy, ABC, the network that aired the show, and the Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel for how they reacted. \n\"We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T22:18:48.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
