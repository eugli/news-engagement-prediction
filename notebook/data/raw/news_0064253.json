Steve O'Keefe swept the rug out from under India's feet while delivering a surprising statement to his detractors. \nThe left-arm orthodox was under the spotlight as the second spinner alongside Nathan Lyon but was loving the limelight as he sparked a 7-11 capitulation by India. \nThrown the ball in the second over of the day, he failed to get an early breakthrough and it was left to the seamers to take the first three wickets, including Virat Kohli for a duck, before lunch. \nBut after the break and a change of ends O'Keefe became unplayable in the 33rd over. \nFirst, having reached 64 and guided India to 3-94 with some dogged batting, opener KL Rahul skied O'Keefe to David Warner in the deep, injuring his shoulder in the process. \nTwo balls later, a cracking Peter Handscomb catch at second slip removed Ajinkya Rahane, and O'Keefe ended the over by finding Wriddhiman Saha's outside edge, which ricocheted off Matthew Wade and to skipper Steve Smith. \nLyon got in on the act three balls later when Ravi Ashwin bunted a ball on to his own toe and Handscomb was on the spot to take another superb grab at short leg. \nO'Keefe finished off the innings with one wicket in each of his final three overs, removing Jayant Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav, allowing Australia to start its second innings with a 155-run lead.

(AP: Rajanish Kakade) \nThe first innings' top scorer could not open because his illness forced him to spend too much time off the field while India was batting, but he seemed unfazed as he and captain Smith knuckled down. \nBut, having succumbed to gastrointestinal turmoil on day one , Renshaw was eventually felled by a vomiting spell brought about by copping an Umesh delivery to the arm. \nSoon after, he took on Jayant Yadav and found the waiting hands of Ishant Sharma at long-off. \nBut Smith and the much-maligned Marsh made it through to stumps with a lead nearing 300 and three days remaining to wrap up what would be a shock victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:10:27.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
