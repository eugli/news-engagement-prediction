(credit: Parker County Sheriff’s Office) \nOfficials with animal control believe the horse was intentionally dumped at the site, since it’s seemingly impossible for a large animal to get on the property. “Due to the extensive nature of the mare’s injuries, there was no possible way she could have wandered passed a cattle guard and a locked gate,” explained Animal Control Supervisor Karen Kessler. \nThe mare taken to a local veterinarian who determined the injuries too severe and humanely euthanized her. Animal Control scanned the mare for a microchip but didn’t locate one. \nOfficials believe that up until recently the horse had been well taken care of and say it had been very well-groomed. \nAnyone who recognizes the mare or has information of the owner is asked to contact the Parker County Sheriff’s Office at 817- 594-3213. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:55:47.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
