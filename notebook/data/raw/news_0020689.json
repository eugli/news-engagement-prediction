Image copyright EPA Image caption China's press has responded angrily to Mr Trump's comments on Taiwan \nMr Trump caused serious concern in Beijing when he accepted a telephone call from Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen. \nThough the US is Taiwan's main military ally, no US president or president-elect had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader for decades. \nUnder the One China policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. \nMr Trump then appeared to suggest that US policy could shift, saying: \"I don't know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\" Clear commitment - By Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor \nThe content of the phone call between President Trump and President Xi will be celebrated in Beijing as signalling a return to the traditional framework of the US-China relationship. \nThree weeks into the new American administration, after a score of phone calls between Mr Trump and other world leaders, China's absence from the list was becoming ever more conspicuous. \nTwo months ago it looked as though Mr Trump might be willing to reshape the relationship between the world's two biggest economies. Not only did he warn that he would consider 45% tariffs against China and brand Beijing a currency manipulator; from Beijing's point of view, far more shocking was his willingness to take a phone call from the president of Taiwan and his suggestion that the status of Taiwan might become a bargaining chip in negotiation for some other American objective. \nBut many Chinese citizens see Taiwan as the last piece in China's territorial jigsaw. Any further move towards independence and international recognition for the island would have represented a dangerous humiliation for Mr Xi. \nWith the presidential phone call, Beijing can draw a line under such fears. Three weeks in, it has won a clear and unequivocal commitment from the Trump administration to honour the One China policy. And after all the threats and promises Mr Trump made about China on the campaign trail, it is not clear what, if anything, the Trump administration has won in return. \nThe new president and his officials have also caused consternation in Beijing with combative comments on trade practises and China's military build up in the South China Sea. \nDuring his nomination hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US should block access to islands being built by China in disputed waters. \nTo date Beijing has responded cautiously, expressing \"serious concern\" about Mr Trump's position on the One China policy and pledging to \"defend its rights\" in the South China Sea. \nBut state media outlets have been less restrained and have issued strongly-worded rebukes, blasting Mr Trump for \"playing with fire\" on the Taiwan issue. \nTaiwan, meanwhile, said it would maintain \"close contact\" with the US, in response to the Trump-Xi telephone call. \n\"Maintaining good Taiwan-US and cross-strait relations [with China] fulfil our national interest and are key for regional peace and stability,\" Presidential Office spokesman Alex Huang said in a statement.
