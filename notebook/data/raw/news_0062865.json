Farmers are finding them in places they've never been seen before.\" Ability to reproduce quickly \nMr Chambers estimated the population in the south-west was in \"the tens of thousands\", with authorities encouraging landholders to employ management methods including trapping, baiting or shooting. \n\"The issue is feral pigs have a very high rate of reproduction and they have the ability to double their population within 18 months,\" Mr Chambers said. \n\"They grow very quickly, reach sexual maturity at a young age and can produce a lot of offspring, so in that sense we are fighting their biology in a lot of ways.\" \nMr Chambers said of concern was the ability of pigs to harbour and spread diseases across farmlands in the south-west and beyond. \n\"They often affect the quality of water in dams, for example, where they also tend to stir up mud and damage reservoirs while they forage,\" Mr Chambers said. \n\"The biggest concern though is their ability to act as a reservoir for serious diseases such as foot and mouth, which we are fortunate not to have but it is a concern none the less.\" Pigs are smart and adaptable \nDepartment of Food and Agriculture, Western Australia development officer Peter Adams said feral pig numbers were having a major impact on agricultural areas across the south-west. \nHe said farmers and landholders were doing their best to control the spread by baiting, shooting, trapping or fencing the pest, but conceded a broader approach was needed to impact the population. \n\"Pigs are very smart and certainly adaptable to a range of circumstances,\" Dr Adams said. \n\"Small localised efforts are not going to have an impact on the populations. We need a broader approach across the region.\" Photo: Feral pig numbers are increasing in WA's south-west. (Supplied: DAFWA) \nDr Adams said feral pigs were smart and adaptable to the varying control methods typically used by farmers and landholders, and often caught on quickly when baits or traps were deployed. \nHe said shooting, a common and cheap method employed by farmers, often had a reverse impact on pigs. \n\"We have evidence of when you go in and try to shoot a mob of pigs, it won't take long for them to learn the risks of people hunting them,\" Dr Adams said. \n\"More often than not, if you shoot one, the other nine will disperse over the hill. \n\"They're not necessarily [going to] move away but they are going to change their habits, and that will make it harder for you to control those pigs in the future.\" 'Very good at hiding' \nManjimup truffle farmer Fabio Deitos said he had been struck by how elusive pigs had been when the farm he managed found itself hosting a mob of 10-15 pigs. \nMr Deitos said the pigs typically dug around the base of trees searching for immature truffles, but had been dispersed from the property after he employed a team of shooters and trappers. \n\"It certainly surprised me just how cunning they are,\" Mr Deitos said. \n\"They are very good at hiding, and won't come out of the surrounding bush until it's dark and they can sense they're not being watched.\" \nMr Deitos said the pigs caused a \"couple of thousand dollars\" worth of damage. \n\"We were lucky because we managed to get on top of them quite quickly,\" Mr Deitos said. \n\"In terms of all the types of pests farmers face, you wouldn't want to be stuck with a mob of pigs. They can do a lot of damage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:04.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
