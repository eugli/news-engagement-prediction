Check out the videos travel Updated: Feb 09, 2017 18:50 IST IANS Manali Vikas Kumar and Tashi Dorjee claim to have constructed India’s first “igloo” in Manali at an altitude of over 3,000m close to Hampta Pass. (www.keylinga.com) \nAt first glance, it looks like a Mexican shack from a movie about the Wild West. Then you realise it’s made out of snow blocks. Welcome to what is being claimed as India’s first “igloo” constructed by two local skiers at an altitude of over 3,000 m close to Hampta Pass overlooking a picturesque tourist resort in Himachal Pradesh. \n“We have constructed an igloo for the first time; it has a ceiling height of nine feet,” said Vikas Kumar, who built the igloo with Tashi Dorjee. The 12’x10’ structure with a 12-foot-high frontage can accommodate a snow bed, a table and a chair. Kumar said the igloo could easily acommodate three people. \nHe said initially they constructed a six-foot tall igloo at his house in Manali two years ago. But that one melted in a few days owing to flaws in the construction technique. The present igloo is built in Sethan village, 12 km uphill from Manali, an area known for growing delicious apples. \n“It’s quite cozy inside as the temperature is around zero degree when it’s minus 10 degrees Celsius outside. We are not promoting it commercially. But any visitor to the village could stay for a day,” he said. \nAccording to Kumar, the area where the igloo was set up has more than three feet of snow. “If the present climatic conditions continue, we are hopeful the igloo will not thaw till March-end,” he added. \nHis co-architect Dorjee, who is from Manali, said they constructed the igloo by learning the technique on YouTube. \n“It’s (construction of igloo) related to skiing. We are doing skiing since childhood. We along with our friends constructed this magnificent structure in 20 days,” he said. \n“It was really a mammoth task. Village elders also helped us in identifying the right snow, how to cut through it to make snow blocks and stack them in such a way that enables excellent insulation from the freezing winds,” Dorjee said. \nTheir initiative has brought cheers on the faces of members of the hospitality industry. They feel renting out igloos to the tourists will boost adventure-related tourism in the Kullu-Manali region, a hot spot for tourists. \nPrem Thakur, a prominent local hotelier, said the state should promote such ventures as the construction material for an igloo causes no pollution.
