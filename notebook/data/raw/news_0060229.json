Palmerston North \nA mum turning a stove on to spot cannabis caused a tragic house fire in Palmerston North that killed a her young daughter and the girl's grandmother. \nEunice Felton, 6, and Bessie Tokona, 61, died on September 3, 2015, when a fire erupted in their two-storey state house on Exeter Cres in Palmerston North. \nCoroner Tim Scott released his findings on Wednesday and said a report by a specialist fire investigator found the most probable point where the fire started was the stove's back left element. \nEunice Felton and Bessie Tehuia Tokona died in the fatal fire. \nHe found the two back elements on the stove were left on high by Eunice's mother Nechia Tokona and that when the fire started, flames had reached and melted a fan about the stove. \nREAD MORE * Fatal Palmerston North fire: Bodies believed to be grandmother and 6-year-old girl removed \nThis caused the motor to fall into or on to a pot full of cooking oil at the left hand rear of the stove, which fell to the floor and caused the fire to spread. \nScott said the only evidence as to how the elements would have been turned on was Nechia Tokona saying she left them on after spotting cannabis. \nScott was surprised at the revelation. \n\"She was under no pressure to disclose this information.\" \nInitially, he thought she was trying to protect her son, who was the most likely candidate, prior to her admission, for leaving on the stove. \n\"However, I changed my view because it was obvious to me and others that Nechia was extremely upset and crying. \n\"Her reaction seemed genuine.\" \nScott said he believed Nechia Tokona had turned both elements on, one by mistake, for spotting cannabis, and said there was no other explanation as to how they came to be on. \nHe said it was not possible to determine why Bessie Tokona and Eunice were unable to escape, but they were the two most vulnerable of the family. \n\"Had there been an escape plan, it would likely have included at least two other whanau members tasked to see to the safety of others.\" \nBut the coroner said this plan would probably have failed, simply because by the time anyone realise the house was on fire, it was full of smoke and the internal stairways were blocked. \nFIREFIGHTERS NEEDED RESCUING \nBy the time emergency services arrived at the scene the house was well ablaze. \nScott said Nechia Tokona was trying to fight the fire with a garden hose, but was pulled away by police who said it was too dangerous. \nWhen the fire brigade arrived, two firefighters were directed to enter the house using breathing equipment to attempt to rescue the two family members who were still inside. \nEunice was found in her bedroom, but appeared to be dead. \nScott said her grandmother could not be located. \n\"Within a short period of time the firefighters themselves came under threat and needed to be rescued themselves. \n\"Although they attempted to take Eunice from the building, they were unable to do so.\" \nThe coroner said firefighters did their best in the circumstances and only abandoned their attempts once it was established Eunice appeared to be already dead and their lives were at considerable risk. \nScott said had it not been for the actions of Nechia Tokona's oldest son, Aperahama Maurierere, 'sâ€‹ actions the inquest would not just be looking at two deaths. \nHe said Maurierere was brave and unselfish and while the death of two family members was a tragedy, nine family members escaped. \nEXITS IN HOUSE BLOCKED \nScott said family members were thwarted in their escape efforts as upstairs windows in the house were fitted with safety latches, so they could only be open a small distance. \n\"This is a deliberate precaution...to prevent the very young members of the whanau from possibly falling from an open window.\" \nHe said this measure, designed for safety, actually had the opposite effect and resulted in it being much harder for the family to escape. \n\"They were unable to use internal stairways because of the thick overpowering smoke. \n\"They broke the windows to escape.\" \nFamily members jumped from the second storey to escape, while others clambered down a wooden ladder that was fixed outside the house as a fire ladder. \nAnother one was removed earlier by Housing NZ because it had rotted and was not replaced. \nScott said it was not replaced because Housing NZ's policy was that fire escape routes needed to be user-friendly for everyone. \n\"The escape routes from this house were designed to be the two internal stairways and the three doors from the ground storey.\" \nSpecialist fire investigator Michael Finucane said the Fire Service preferred to see external ladders, but Housing NZ's policy was acceptable and the main thing was households needed good working smoke alarms and an escape plan. \n\"There was no evidence given about an escape plan and I strongly suspect that there was none,\" Scott said. \nThe coroner understood why Housing NZ would want fire escapes to be used by everyone and he could understand the reasoning for the window safety catches. \n\"However, while I can understand the reasoning, I do not accept it.\" \nThese policies could have resulted in more fatalities he said. \n\"When it comes to fires, surely the more escape routes the better, even if some of these cannot be used by all people all of the time,\" the coroner said. \n\"It seems to me that in respect of a fire safety catches on windows [they] are potentially death traps.\" \nSMOKE ALARMS NOT AS APPEARED \nScott said another problem with the house was the smoke alarms. \nHousing NZ thought it had installed combined alarms known as iophic. \nThere are two types of smoke alarms, ionisation alarms, considered to be good at detecting flaming fires, but bad at detecting smouldering fires, and photoelectric alarms, good at detecting smouldering fires, but not so good at detecting blazing fires. \nThe iophic alarms installed were though to be a combined alarm, with wording on the box stating they combined both photoelectric and ionisation technology. \nAdrian Butler, a former firefighter who now works as a fire-extinguisher supplier in Australia, told Scott the alarms in the house were only ionisation alarms. \nThe Consumer Institute indicated the alarm tested gave a poor response to smouldering fire and the manufacturers instruction manual clearly referred only to ionisation alarms. \nSenior specialist fire investigator Peter Gallagher, from the Fire Service, said the importer for the alarms fitted at Exeter Cres told them the alarms did not have both sensors. \n\"There were not dual alarms as was initially thought by the Housing Corporation and by the Fire Service and, I might say, also by me,\" Scott said. \nScott said he suspected to many people a fire alarm was a fire alarm and they did not see the difference. \nHousing NZ's smoke alarm policy was reviewed in 2015 and it recognised smoke alarm technology had changed and improved. \n\"As a result, a roll-out programme to replace alarms started in February 2016. \nAlso, because of the this fire, Housing NZ reviewed safety at 74 houses nationwide that were two storeys or had six or more bedrooms. \nIndividual alarms in these properties would be replaced with interconnected alarms, so when one went off, it would trigger every alarm. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:40:36.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
