Lokur and U.U. Lalit referred to the loss of reputation and dignity of women and children who became victims of sexually abusive videos uploaded on websites. \nSajan Poovayya, counsel for Google, said content was catalogued and objectionable ones were deleted when spotted. The lawyer said the inflow of information online was huge, and it was near impossible to filter and block content before they were uploaded. He submitted that the government’s nodal agency could help Internet service providers. \nThe court referred to the Information Technology Act, and asked how the service providers abided by the guidelines to regulate Web content. \nThe court observed that the time lapsed to remove objectionable videos or material led to loss of reputation and dignity of the victims. “Will it or will it not be conducive to prevent the uploading of such contents,” the court asked. \nThe court will hold further hearing in the case on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:13:54.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
