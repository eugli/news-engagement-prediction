I know some of the cast already so I'm sure we're going to have a lot of fun.' Ryan's venture into the land of soaps comes after bandmate Duncan James joined the cast of Hollyoaks last year as handsome policeman Ryan Knight. True Blue: He rose to fame with (l-r) Antony Costa, Simon Webbe and Duncan James as a part of the chart-topping boy band Blue EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor said in a statement: 'I'm delighted to welcome Lee Ryan to Walford as \"Woody\" Woodward. 'Woody is a man who has worked hard and played hard in bars, clubs and pubs around the world and has finally decided to stop wandering and put down some roots. 'He's going to ruffle some feathers and obviously break some hearts, so there's a great deal to look forward to as soon as he bursts onto the square. Work perks: He follows in the footsteps of Duncan, who joined Hollyoaks six months ago 'Lee is a perfect casting for Albert Square and we knew straight away we wanted him for the role.' While his bandmate Duncan has been able to jump into some gritty storylines and receive an NTA nomination for his role on Hollyoaks, he revealed it was a steamy smooch with his co-star that has been the highlight. Speaking on ITV's This Morning last month, the 38-year-old singer revealed: 'I loved snogging Jen Metcalfe! It’s a nice way to start the day!' Steamy: Speaking on an episode of ITV's This Morning last month, the 38-year-old singer revealed, 'I loved snogging Jen Metcalfe! It’s a nice way to start the day!' Duncan had to kiss Jennifer as his character Ryan Knight has been cheating on his fiancée Amy Barnes with Goldie and Mercedes McQueen (Metcalfe). Discussing his antics, Duncan said: 'He is a very naughty man. You would think that he would be bit more clever with it because he is a detective, but no.' Discussing the transition from stage to small screen, the former Blue star, said: 'It’s been very scary! I've done theatre all my life but TV acting is very, very different it’s a great learning curve.' As seen on screen: Duncan plays Detective Sergeant Ryan Knight on the Channel 4 show He was nominated for a National Television Award for Best Newcomer for his role. However, he nearly didn't start the role after having to undergo two emergency spinal surgeries. 'It was touch and go,' he revealed, adding that his mother had to stay in Liverpool with him to help out whilst he slowly recovered. Duncan is still feeling the effects, however, and still experiences numbness in his right leg and limps when walking. But it hasn't slowed him down, as he revealed he's still jetting around the world with his group, Blue. He said: 'It’s always so nice to get back with the boys. After all these years, 16 years, we’re still like best friends, we've been through so much as a band and we still love working together.'
