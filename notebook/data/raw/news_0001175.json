But having lost his brothers and bandmates Maurice and Robin , it’s no surprise he is worried about dying. \nBut it’s not just a recent phenomenon. The bearded, oldest Bee Gee has revealed he always keeps away from anything that can harm him – having been scalded by boiling water as a child and scarred for life. \nBarry, 70, says: “I avoid boiling water, to this day. I avoid fire too. \n“My sister caught fire once. That was a terrifying experience so I am really aware of what those things can do. \n“If I get near boiling water something happens and I have to back off. It isn’t just age, anything can happen. \n“So I don’t do things like go on rollercoasters, I’m a safety-first type of person.

That’s all down to that accident.” \nBarry, who sold more than 220 million records with the Bee Gees, has had to cope with the loss of all three brothers over the past 25 years. Each one affected him deeply. \nYoungest sibling Andy, a star in his own right but not part of the band, died in 1988, aged 30, after years of drug abuse. \nThere was more heartbreak in 2003 when Maurice, 53, died in hospital after he suffered complications from a twisted intestine. And Robin died from colon and liver cancer at the age of 62 in 2012. \nSpeaking to Piers Morgan on ITV’s Life Stories, Barry opens up about the pain of losing them and how they remain in his life in many ways. \nHe says: “I still always see the four of us together, it was always brothers battling for attention. I never stop thinking about those days and their ­characters. Robin was constantly humorous, Maurice was very open and sociable, and you put us all together and that’s what we were, not just writing songs but singing in harmony.

It happened with Andy in his 30s. That was a heartbreaker for the whole family because we really hadn’t witnessed losing anyone. \n“We dealt with it, it’s a void. I don’t remember how we did it, we just got on with it but I don’t think we were ever the same as three brothers. \n“You can’t explain it, you just feel different about everything. It broke my mother and father’s heart. Your youngest is always the toughest. Dad passed away a few years after but really from a broken heart. Andy was his little light. Maurice was the next one we lost at the age of 53, I think. \n“Then the whole family began to settle into the fact that death is a real thing. You lose someone and you don’t get over it, it stays with you all your life. \n“Maurice may have known he was ill but within two days he was gone. \n“It was so quick, it was crippling emotionally, it’s not something you can understand, very difficult. All I can say is that I haven’t cried since I cried at his funeral. I cried when Andy died, I didn’t cry on the day of Robin’s funeral, it was just not something I could take in, it was just wrong.” \nAnd Barry reveals Robin kept his illness from him.

I never knew he was ill but he looked ill. \n“We always got, ‘No, nothing’s wrong’. But I saw a picture of Robin in the paper. It really disturbed me. \n“I took that picture to my doctor because no one would tell me, especially Robin. I showed my doctor the picture, he took one look and said, ‘cancer’. \n“He could see it in the gums and the skin. Why didn’t Robin tell me? I think he didn’t want to be seen as an invalid. My doctor said he had about six months. That was a real shock, so I went to see him. \n“Robin and I were always in conflict, he was intensely creative and we both wanted the attention. If we didn’t get it, we would compete for it.” \nSpiritual Barry, who lives in Miami, also insists his brothers have reappeared as ghosts in his family’s life. He believes he has been visited many times. \n“Linda, my wife, saw Andy, so did my mother,” he continues. “I’ve seen Robin in my house, he walked across from the front door to the bar. I went to look and there was nobody there. Maybe it’s in your head but it was Robin. It was a nice ­experience, it wasn’t scary.

It sounded like one of my brothers. So I don’t know whether one of them was affirming something. I feel them guiding me, I can’t say how but I believe in everything from UFOs to ghosts, things you call people crazy for. \n“We could always feel each other’s breath on our necks, that’s how close we were. \n“I always relive it, when I’m on stage they are still around me. At the Royal Variety I could feel their presence. I don’t know how it works or why you feel that but I am never without them. They never go away.” \nBorn on the Isle of Man and raised in Manchester before moving to Australia, the brothers Gibb formed their first band the Rattlesnakes in 1955 before becoming the Bee Gees in 1958. \nThey were behind some of the biggest pop songs of all-time, including Stayin’ Alive, Jive Talking, Tragedy, You Should Be Dancing and How Deep Is Your Love. \nBarry has enjoyed a career alongside many other greats and counted Michael Jackson among his close friends. And he tells how he does not believe sexual abuse ­allegations against the late star. \nHe also blasts the witch hunt against another close pal, Sir Cliff Richard, who was ­investigated over historical sex abuse claims dating back decades before the case was dropped.

I don’t think anyone has the right to do that. Can you imagine someone saying that about you when it might have been 30 years ago and you can’t prove they were wrong or fight it? \n“The public has a way of saying, ‘It must be true because someone said it’. That’s the great danger in our culture today. Cliff is one of my closest friends and I’m astounded by it. I’m disappointed that people can go that far without having conclusive proof. I never saw it with Michael or Cliff, I think it’s appalling.” \nNow, after a career spanning seven decades, Barry is finally preparing for retirement. He revealed he can now barely hear anything without a hearing aid, which makes it more difficult to write music. \nAnd the father of five, reportedly worth up to £40million, has handed over the rights of the songs to his children. \nHe adds: “I just know that once I feel I’m going down and not up, then I’ll take a seat, pick up the remote and give up the idea of being a pop artist. \n“I just don’t think that applies to ­somebody once they get past the age I am now, so it’s very close. I just want to be ­remembered as one of the Bee Gees.” Piers Morgan’s Life Stories: Barry Gibb is on ITV at 9pm, Friday.
