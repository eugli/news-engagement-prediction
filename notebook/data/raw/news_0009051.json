LOUIS • A Belleville man who was drunk when his pickup truck rear-ended a St. Louis University professor's stopped vehicle last year was sentenced on a misdemeanor charge Friday to two years on probation and electronic alcohol monitoring. \nChristopher Seals, 35, pleaded guilty to a count of excessive blood-alcohol content in the April 27, 2016, crash that killed Donnie Patten, 48, an assistant professor of theology from Oakville. \nIt happened about 8:30 a.m. at the Vandeventer Avenue exit from westbound Interstate 44. Officials said road conditions were slick on a rainy morning, and Patten's 2001 Isuzu Rodeo stopped on the ramp after a minor collision with another car. \nSeals' lawyer, Will Goldstein, said a police accident reconstruction revealed that the brakes on his client's 1966 Ford pickup had failed. \nSeals originally was charged with involuntary manslaughter, but in November a grand jury returned a lesser charge because of the bad weather and brakes. The pickup also hit and critically injured a man standing near the stopped vehicles, but Seals was not been charged with injuring him. \nOfficials said a blood sample taken after the crash measured Seals’ blood-alcohol at 0.131 percent; the legal limit is 0.08. \nAdditional conditions imposed by Circuit Judge Dennis Schaumann, who accepted a plea agreement, include 100 hours of community service and alcohol treatment. \nPatten had joined at St. Louis University as an adjunct professor in 2012. He is survived by his wife, Sherri Patten, a son, 12, and a daughter, 18. \nAt Friday's hearing, Sheri Patten told Seals that her husband was special not only to her family but to the entire university community. She told him she forgave him and believes God's plan includes Seals turning his life around. \n\"I think as a family, we've grown closer and stronger,\" she said in an interview. \"It makes us have to rely on each other more. As for Chris, I hope this changes his life around and maybe he'll do something great for others in similar situations.\" \nGoldstein said Seals is remorseful and that his \"heart goes out to the family. This is a new lease on life for him and his family.\" \nSherri Patten and her two children have filed a wrongful-death civil suit against Seals and his employer, ACE Pipe Cleaning , alleging Seals was on the job at the time of the crash. Seals and the company have denied that claim. The suit, pending in St. Louis Circuit Court, seeks unspecified damages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:11:24.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
