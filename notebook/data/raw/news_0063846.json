LIC Market Posted by Eater on Thursday, February 23, 2017 Every sustainably minded meat eater’s dream is to be able to consume the entire animal: The nose to tail movement — or in this case, nose to fin — is all about not wasting a thing. When it come to eating animals, this can mean indulging in some, shall we say, less Instagram-friendly cuts. In this week’s episode of Fresh Catch , Eater’s live seafood explainer series, Adam Gerringer-Dunn of Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Co . explains how to prep and enjoy cod milt, also known as shirako , also known as the sperm sacs of an adult cod. Milt isn’t commonly served in the U.S., but it’s widely eaten in Japan. The best way to find milt in the U.S. is to work with a local fishmonger. Even though it can be a difficult ingredient to track down, it’s not difficult to prepare. Gerringer-Dunn served the milt two ways: Pan-fried in butter with a little hot sauce, and in a more traditional steamed dish with dashi and roe. Once it’s cooked, the resulting dish isn’t fishy at all. It’s mild and custardy, and pairs well with bolder flavors. To see this process in action, check out the video above. For more lessons in seafood, head to Eater’s Facebook page Thursdays at 11 a.m. to catch new episodes of Fresh Catch . Each week Geringer-Dunn will walk live viewers through preparation of a sustainable fish, mollusk, crustacean, or bivalve. Can't get enough of Eater? Sign up for our newsletter.
