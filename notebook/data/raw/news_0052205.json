Just like I wouldn’t understand somebody who had a desk job and how to do that. I couldn’t,” she says. “I literally am incapable of being in the real world and surviving.” \nAlthough the performance sent her into a brief social media and media hiatus, Carey says that she dealt with it by simply accepting that what happened, happened. \n“I used to get upset by things,” Carey says. “This was out of my control, and had everything not been such a total chaotic mess, then I would have been able to make something happen. Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the fucking stage. I’m sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal.” 11 Photos » \nNow that she’s pushed past the beginning of 2017, Carey continues to acknowledge that she and her former backup dancer, Tanaka, are in a real relationship . \n“I don’t think we’re being public in a way that my relationships have been public before,” she says. “I really don’t. To me, the best thing of this is to keep it a little more private. But I’m not going to not go places with him and enjoy our lives because everybody thinks, ‘Oh, it’s too soon!’ kind of thing. We all saw the freakin’ show. This is not a surprise.” \nTanaka and Carey are currently traveling in Dubai together as she gears up for her performance at the Emirates Airline Dubai Jazz Festival. A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Feb 21, 2017 at 3:10pm PST \nRolling Stone reports that Carey doesn’t have plans to record a follow-up album to her 2014 record Me. I Am Mariah… the Elusive Chanteuse , but she’s working with DJ Khaled and Travis Scott on “conceptual stuff” in the studio and plans on recording singles when she isn’t busy with Lionel Richie on their upcoming tandem tour.
