Beefsteaks were basically enormous private banquets, with row after row of tables lined with hundreds of men eating thousands of pounds of steak in a single sitting. This feasting format -- a bastardization of Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon traditions brought over the Atlantic by immigrants -- became a gluttonous, masculine, essentially New York ritual in the mid-19th century. Fraud, graft, and political patronage made it so. To consolidate and maintain their hold on the city’s government, political and social clubs threw regular beefsteaks, packing banquet halls with thousands of voting-age men, enormous quantities of beef and beer, and not much else. “Knives, forks, napkins, and tablecloths never had been permitted,” wrote Mitchell. Furniture was sparse. Flatulence was not. “Who wants white table-cloths? That’s femme stuff, pussycat,” says Betty Fussell, food historian and author of Raising Steaks: The Life and Times of American Beef , mimicking a would-be beefsteak host. “The point was to eat big,” she explains, and to celebrate the fraternity of working-class manhood. When the men went to the polls, they were primed to cast their ballots for whichever candidate had thrown the most recent, most rousing beefsteak. As it turned out, New York’s most prolific beefsteak host, Tammany Hall, introduced gender-neutrality to the tradition in the 1920s. Prohibition had given rise to covert co-ed drinking, and women’s suffrage had made women newly attractive to Tammany’s poll-packers. An unnamed chef remarked to Mitchell in 1939 that “[w]omenfolks didn't know what a beefsteak was until they got the right to vote.” This change marked the beginning of the beefsteak’s end. “As the women joined the dinners [...] the whole gluttonous tenor of them starts to really calm down,” explains Debra Schmidt Bach, a curator at the New-York Historical Society. Belching, once encouraged, went out of vogue. Shrimp cocktail found its way onto the menu, along with actual cocktails for beer-averse diners. Silverware appeared, as did side dishes. “Most beefsteaks degenerated into polite banquets at which open-face sandwiches of grilled steak happened to be the principal dish,” Mitchell lamented. New York’s beefsteak tradition was growing up, and the New York City steakhouse would be its next form. Smith & Wollensky New York City Move to the modern steakhouse Danny Kissane barks the word “charred” like it’s a person’s name, and that person owes him 20 bucks. It’s somewhere between a growl and a bellow. The A sprawls; the Rs wander off; a W shows up, seemingly out of nowhere. “We like our steaks ch- AAUWD, ” booms Smith & Wollensky ’s stout, butcher-coated purchasing director. “But not too much.” Kissane has worked at Smith & Wollensky for 35 years, starting shortly after Alan Stillman opened it in 1977. Between his Bronx accent, raspy chuckle, and crass, easy friendliness, he’s every casting director’s vision for “timeless New Yorker.” When he talks, it’s easy to imagine Babe Ruth coming to Smith & Wollensky for a steak dry-aged by Kissane’s grandfather. Standing in the dining room -- a stately, shabby-chic split-level clubhouse with well-worn brass plaques adorning its walls and ancient memorabilia hung from the ceiling -- it seems like Smith & Wollensky has been around since the beefsteak days. Delmonico’s Restaurant Delmonico’s , opened on William St in 1827, actually has. Sort of: Though it spawned a series of New York City steakhouses, popularized the “Delmonico’s cut,” and currently operates as a steakhouse at the William St location, the original Delmonico’s started out as America’s first fine-dining, French-style restaurant. Beef was largely absent for its first few decades. “For the most part,” says Paul Freedman, a Yale history professor and author of Ten Restaurants That Changed America , Delmonico’s early menus featured “game [...] wild ducks, terrapin, and French dishes of an elaborate and elegant sort.” But as beefsteak dinners disappeared in the first half of the 20th century, and Prohibition vanquished Delmonico’s wine revenue, the city entered a golden age of steakhouse dining, and the Franco-first fine-dining restaurant found its second life as a steakhouse. Like Delmonico’s, the original NYC steakhouse that originally wasn’t , each longstanding establishment has contributed its own defining paradox to the archetype that Ruth Reichl, writing for the New York Times in 1994, codified as “a gruff, comfortable sort of place where people could revel in everything they liked about themselves.” Peter Luger (1877) developed what Fussell calls “the contradiction alive and well in Brooklyn,” wedding high-end steak to low-end manners to achieve “that wonderful combination of the most chic and the most prole.” Keens (1885) perfected the gentleman’s club ambience that inspired a bevy of copycats, but it actually began admitting women 15 years before they won the vote. (Though, to be fair, it took a lawsuit.) The Palm (1926) hung caricatures of its celebrity customers on its walls, which drew hordes of non-celebrity customers hoping to catch a glimpse. Gallaghers (1933) put its dry-aging cooler out front, a brilliant touch of Broadway showmanship (it’s in the Theater District, after all) that nevertheless makes it harder to regulate the meat inside. Sparks (1966) was a mob joint, and for a time, legitimately dangerous -- Gambino crime bosses were gunned down on its steps in 1985, allegedly on John Gotti’s orders -- so of course it was a thrill for regular folks to dine there. Smith & Wollensky’s paradox is anachronism. Despite its heritage-heavy decor, in his mid-50s, Danny Kissane is older than the joint itself, making it a mere adolescent compared to the more aged New York City steakhouses. This is by design. “We want you to think it’s been there for 150 years,” says Michael Stillman, president and founder of Quality Group, the establishment’s parent company. (It’s probably no coincidence that Stillman’s father, Alan, founded Smith & Wollensky after creating T.G.I. Friday's, the chain that, until recently , commodified nostalgia as a differentiating factor for its strip-mall pubs.) So why do this city’s steakhouses tend to cluster on the fault line of paradox? “America is contradictory about everything,” says Fussell, and as one of its oldest traditions, NYC’s steakhouses are witness to that. How many steakhouse customers, she ponders, even “know where their steak comes from, or care? That’s part of it. They don’t want to know, they just want the bragging rights: ‘I went to Peter Luger’s last night.’” Mark Schatzker, a producer and author of Steak: One Man’s Search for the World’s Tastiest Piece of Beef , agrees -- a steakhouse steak is often secondary. “The best steak you get in a city will not be at a steakhouse,” he says. “Most of the steakhouses in New York source what I would call ‘commodity beef,’ from the major packers,” which means it’s finished on corn, rather than grass. Commodity beef isn’t necessarily “bad”; in fact, it’s what allows you to walk into Smith & Wollensky, order a 2lb rib steak that Danny Kissane has lovingly dry-aged for 30 days, and get out for under $60. It’s all the convenience of American consumerism, in meat form. But in the past 30 years, tastes have changed. According to the US Department of Agriculture, Americans are eating less red meat than ever before. When they do, they’re paying attention to its provenance. “Local” & “grass-fed” are in; “anonymous feedlot” is out. That puts NYC steakhouses in a “no-win” situation, says Schatzker. “They have to serve so much steak [to make a profit] there’s not a large enough source of what I’d consider really good beef, for them to serve. And if there were, it would be very, very expensive, and that sort of busts their model.” In New York, the cultural shift away from steakhouses is even more poignant. Your Instagram feed, for example, is probably not crammed with porterhouse porn. And to more critical eaters, the false equivalency of age and quality wears thin. “Peter Luger? You can have it,” wrote Anthony Bourdain in a 2010 essay for The Guardian . “Just because it's a ‘New York institution’ doesn't mean you want to eat there.” So where does that leave the NYC steakhouse, and -- as Schatzker jokes to me -- the “somewhat ossified, Trumpian institution” it has become? Beatrice Inn | Cole Saladino/Thrillist Innovation period “I remember going to Keens when I was younger, with my dad,” recalls Angie Mar, executive chef and owner of the West Village’s iconic Beatrice Inn , which on her watch has earned newfound acclaim as a meat mecca. (Not to mention an exultant two-star review from Pete Wells.) “I love Keens. I love Smith & Wollensky. These are New York institutions.” Her voice rises slightly. “They have to survive.” It’s not a weird thing to hear, but at first glance, it might be weird to hear from her . Mar, Thrillist’s 2016 New York City Chef of the Year, specializes in innovative meat that, frankly, could qualify as sacrilege in NYC’s more dogmatic steakhouses. Her dishes “play with masculine and feminine influences”: big hunks of meat served with smoked vanilla butter, say, or bone marrow crème brûlée. Hardly the “totally macho... combination of violence and nostalgia,” which is how Fussell, the historian, characterizes the New York steakhouse’s cultural appeal. Then again, neither is Quality Eats . Opened in 2015 by the Quality Group, the West Village grill serves plenty of fine beef, but it feels damn near antithetical to its NYC steakhouse pedigree. That’s intentional, says Michael Stillman. “We tried to keep some of those classic steakhouse tropes, but make it a little smaller, more accessible, and make it fit with what I call the Whole Foods generation,” he says. That means its excellent steaks (mostly off-cuts) are not dry-aged, and much less expensive: A $26 skirt steak is the top of the line here, whereas at most true-blue steakhouses, the roasted half-chicken costs more than that. It also means the packaging -- from the cheeky doodle designs on the plates and menu, to the raw wood and bright painted-brick interior -- is decidedly void of the Bacchus-meets-bond trader gravitas of its big brother, Smith & Wollensky. Reviewing Quality Eats for the New Yorker last year, Shauna Lyon issued a call: “Reformed gluttons unite.” Mar, whose revamp of the Beatrice Inn was as much a repudiation of its Graydon Carter-era pomp as anything else, is quick to point out the symbiosis between the city’s contemporary meat focus and its carnivorous foundation. “Just because my restaurant isn’t that classic New York City steakhouse, and we push the boundaries, doesn’t mean I think everybody should push the boundaries,” she says. In other words, she can hang a WhIsBe gummy-bear painting over the fireplace because Keens hangs pipes from the ceiling. The fact that Peter Luger doesn’t serve -- would never serve -- a massive tomahawk steak dry-aged in whiskey-soaked cloths for 120 days and smothered in cherries, is precisely why at the Bea, she’s able to. related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:21:57.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
