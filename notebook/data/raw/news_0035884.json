An alliance is always between two political parties and ideologies. This is an unholy alliance and looks like an alliance between two corrupt families.\" \n\n\"By forging an alliance of two corrupt families, Akhilesh Yadav has already conceded defeat,\" he said. \n\nShah also said Ram Manohar Lohia, a socialist, fought Congress throughout his life, but SP forged an alliance with the same party. \n\nTaking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP chief said, \"If he was that confident of winning the assembly elections solo, he would have never joined hands with Congress. By doing so, he has accepted defeat even when elections are not midway through.
