Credit Cartoon by Edward Koren/The New Yorker The Sunday wedding announcements in The New York Times have long been a fertile hunting ground for writers of parodies, hate-reads and other forms of snark.\nThe best explanation of why our wedding pages make such a tempting target was provided by Robert Baedeker, one of the authors of “ Weddings of The Times ,” a 2009 book parodying our reports, during an interview on National Public Radio.\n“The wedding announcements in The Times are so perfect and polished, and the inspiration comes from that sort of primal feeling one gets when one sees a perfect picture, which is to scribble a mustache on it or draw some sunglasses on it,” Mr. Baedeker said.\nSuch scribbled mustaches abound. The website Gawker, before closing last year, routinely took shots at us, including a post by Ravi Somaiya (who later worked at The Times) imagining our staff at work:\nI envision, just so you know, a room of ladies peering skeptically over their bifocals at announcement submissions, occasionally pausing to consult worn leather bound address books — “I could have sworn Swoosie Remington was from Darien and not New Canaan,” they sniff — while Bob Woletz sits in his office lighting copies of Town & Country on fire.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story (For the record, Mr. Woletz, the weddings editor, lights up copies of Architectural Digest, not Town & Country.)\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The comedian and writer Selena Coppock has an NYTVows Twitter feed parodying the wedding pages. Here is an example:\nThe groom is a Mayflower descendant and was educated at Eton College and The University of Oxford.\nBOW DOWN, YOU FILTHY PLEBEIANS.\n— NYTimes Vows (@NYTvows) Sept. 9, 2016 In an interview, Ms. Coppock said, almost convincingly, that she does not really hate us. So why do people like her pick on us so much?\nIt’s partly jealousy, she explained, and partly the idea of so many big shots marrying each other. “It seems almost comical, just Ivy League upon Ivy League, the Mayflower and so on,” she said. “People get a kick out of hearing about these important families marrying into these other important families.”\nThe Times has grown more egalitarian through the years — the sons and daughters of truck drivers, waitresses and maintenance workers have graced our pages. ( O ne of our most recent brides , an art teacher for an after-school program, bought her wedding dress for $6.) But that patrician reputation is hard to shake.\nThere have been other parodies and commentaries aplenty: Jena Friedman has created videos poking fun at us , and Zach Miller’s “Veiled Conceit,” a blog from years ago, was the most elaborate. L.V. Krause wrote a memorable piece about why she keeps reading us, angrily .\nHere in the weddings section, we don’t mind an occasional insult thrown our way. Much. Just spell the names right, as the saying goes. Sometimes we even chuckle — in a dignified, Thurston-Howell-III sort of way.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Terri Pous of BuzzFeed was so mortified by our prose that she produced a 20-question quiz last summer asking readers whether an excerpt actually came from our pages or from her own fanciful mind. Following is a real one followed by a fake one:\n• “Before she started, she asked her new boss, Christine Riordan, then the provost of the university, if a boyfriend came with the job .”\n• “The bridegroom had never eaten a hamburger, a fact he delightedly recounted on their first date in between bites of flash-fried seitan and kohlrabi.”\n2. Last summer, Colin Nissan, writing in The New Yorker , projected a gruesome future for a bride who graduated summa cum laude and a groom who was just magna cum laude:\nThis disparity in achievement will be a recurring source of tension for the couple, first rearing its head during their honeymoon, in Belize, when the groom will take a little too long to calculate a tip and the bride will step in to “summa the situation” — a phrase the groom will coin in that moment and continue to employ for years to come, with diminishing amusement.…\nMarla Maples’s Engagement Ring From Donald Trump was auctioned off for $300,000 in 2016. Video by Uncensored 3. We even parodied ourselves in this 1993 article in The Times’s Metro section about the wedding of a fellow who has been in the news quite a bit lately. Georgia Quote: :\nMarla Ann Maples, the daughter of Ann Ogletree and Stanley Maples, both of Dalton, Ga., was married last night at the Plaza Hotel to Donald John Trump , a son of Mary and Fred Trump of Jamaica Estates in Queens.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The bridegroom’s previous marriage ended in divorce. …\nDr. Arthur Caliandro of the Marble Collegiate Church performed the ceremony in the Grand Ballroom, on an altar decked with white orchids and white birches. Dripping from the birches were cut-glass teardrops.\nOther than that, as the writer Julie Baumgold remarked after the ceremony, “There wasn’t a wet eye in the place.”\nThe bride is taking her husband’s name. The bridegroom is keeping his name, The Donald, a legacy from his former wife, Ivana.\nIvana Trump is keeping her cool on the ski slopes of Aspen.\n****\nThis article is part of the series “ Committed: 165 Years of Love (and War ) in The New York Times Wedding Announcements .”", "external_links": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/terripous/is-this-from-a-real-new-york-times-wedding-announcement-or-n?utm_term=.rp5d4LKv9#.llW8d2P9o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhh4kA90ZQQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI1w3cwcUPY", "https://twitter.com/NYTvows/status/774321247391981568", "https://twitter.com/NYTvows", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/fashion/00WP-PARODY/00WP-PARODY-master768.jpg", "http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-06-22/entertainment/0606210037_1_veiled-conceit-weddings-section-blog", "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js", "http://www.kasperhauser.com/books/weddings-times", "http://www.npr.org/books/titles/138206005/weddings-of-the-times-a-parody", "http://gawker.com/5503889%2Fscoring-sundays-nuptials-you-can-ring-my-bell", "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/wedding-announcement-by-colin-nissan", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/fashion/00WP-PARODY/00WP-PARODY-superJumbo.jpg", "http://thoughtcatalog.com/l-v-krause/2015/11/why-i-hate-the-new-york-times-wedding-announcements-but-i-cant-stop-reading-them/"], "published": "2017-02-21T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:26:50.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
