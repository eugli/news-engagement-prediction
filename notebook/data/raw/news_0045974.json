The first half focuses partially on Norra and Sloane's journeys on Jakku, which move slowly as they build to the inevitable series of confrontations.\nSloane — one of the most fascinating characters introduced in recent novels — has the stronger of the two tales here. We find her in a very different situation to where she's been before, filled with rage over the direction that Rax is taking her beloved Empire.\nIt's cool to learn more about the harsh environment on Jakku, which is almost a character in itself, and some of the groups that run the planet — the loathsome Niima the Hutt and her cult-like following have a major \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" vibe about them.\nThis section also takes us off Jakku to reveal how the New Republic leadership was left shaken by the events of \"Life Debt.\" This plot proves to be as compelling and frustrating as politics should be, but it's great to see Chancellor Mon Mothma getting a bigger role — making it clear that she deserves a novel in the style of the Leia-centric \"Bloodline.\" \n‘Star Wars: Aftermath’ reveals never-ending battle: review \nSome fans may be disappointed to learn that Leia and Han don't play as big a role as they did in \"Life Debt.\" However, they still make plenty of appearances and we see one vital development for them.\n20 photos view gallery 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' posters Of course, the novel's biggest draw is the much-hyped Battle of Jakku, which leaves the planet in the state we found it in \"The Force Awakens\" (and provides Rey with her livelihood).\nWe've seen a narrow perspective on this conflict in \"Lost Stars\" and even had the chance to play it in \"Battlefront,\" but Wendig finally gives us the main event in all its glory in the book's latter half.\nThe pace really picks up in the final major confrontation of the Galactic Civil War, with plenty of tension and personal sacrifice in the various narrative threads, and Wendig's writing style lends itself well to action here.\n'Star Wars Rebels' S3 Episode 13 Recap: 'Legacy of Mandalore' \nIt's here that we finally learn about Rax's role within the Empire — Wendig infuses the villain with plenty of fun megalomania while building up anticipation for his ultimate goals. Fans won't be disappointed by the revelations in store here.\nAs with the previous two \"Aftermath\" novels, the interludes provide many delicious side-stories that build up a picture of the rest of the galaxy. These are often completely unrelated to the main plot, but draw excellently from the rich \"Star Wars\" universe — one divisive character's appearance is well-judged and proves surprisingly poignant.\nUltimately, \"Empire's End\" provides fans with a vital part of the puzzle that links the Original Trilogy and \"The Force Awakens\" as it finally tells us how a brutal regime came crashing down.\n\"Star Wars Aftermath: Empire's End\" by Chuck Wendig, published by Random House, hits shelves Feb. 21. \nSend a Letter to the Editor  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:26:43.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
