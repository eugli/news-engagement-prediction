It’s the way they would treat the rest of us if they had a half the chance. \n“It seems to me a week where the debate has coarsened. Trying to get rid of John Bercow because of the way he spoke out. The Prime Minister accusing Jeremy Corbyn of using ‘alternative facts’. This seems to be part and parcel of this harshness.” \nOf the “Dubs scheme”, he added: \n“We have to ask ourselves: what kind of country are we? Are we going to turn away from our responsibilities to the world? Or are we going to step up and do what we said we were going to do and take all 3,000 of these refugee children?” \nMinister for Immigration Robert Goodwill used a written statement to announce the Government had “reasonably” met the “intention and spirit” of the amendment added to the Immigration Bill following a public outcry. \nOn the show, Labour MP Owen Smith said the move was a “shameful day for our country”, and claimed the Home Office had failed to check with councils about capacity as his local authority could take four times as many children as they have. He said: “I don’t believe for a minute that councils are phoning up the Home Office saying they can’t take any more.” \nTory MP Claire Perry said the criticism was “over-shadowing” the UK’s “incredibly good track record of humanitarian support in one of the world’s toughest regions”.
