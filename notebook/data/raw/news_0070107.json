For more information, check out the Montreal Canada Day Parade website . \nThe First Canada Day Parade in Montreal \nMontreal began hosting a Canada Day Parade in 1977, just months after the separatist political party, Le Parti Québécois, first came to power back in November 1976. \nInitiated by Montreal cardiologist Roopnarine Singh , the first Canada Day Parade in Montreal was no more than a few cars tooting their horns around the city, a pale comparison to Canada Day festivities outside of the province and a conspicuous reflection of Quebec's political division: the sovereigntists versus the federalists. \nBut this didn't stop the parade from carrying on. Its processional size and public participation grew as several of Montreal's ethnic communities showed a strong presence: Chinese, German, Armenian, Indian, Hungarian, Iranian, Greek, Italian, Turk, Indonesian, Polish, Philippino, Danish, Persian, Malagasy, Dutch, Sri Lankan, Irish and Japanese are just some of the cultures represented. \nAnd the grass roots parade keeps growing, with crowds of 40,000 or more attending one of Montreal's most beautiful parades. It's personally one of my favorite, if only for its celebration of the city's -and Canada's- diverse melting pot of cultures who, together, have created the home we live in today. \nWhy Did the Parade Route Keep Changing? \nIt's not entirely clear if Montreal's Canada Day Parade route variations are a matter of logistics, politics or both. \nOrganizers were not particularly forthcoming in addressing this question in years past, suggesting politics are involved. Concerns that the parade might offend sovereigntists and lead to uprisings may be some of the reason the parade's route kept changing in the past but in 2010, 2014, and 2015, it was changed over ongoing construction to Place du Canada that led to the route extending itself several blocks, reaching Phillips Square. \nAnd ironically, uncertainty concerning federal funding from Heritage Canada was also an issue threatening the viability of holding a Montreal Canada Day Parade altogether.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:43:37.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
