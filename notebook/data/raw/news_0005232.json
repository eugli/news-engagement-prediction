We're still looking into it. We're looking everywhere.\" \nDiagnostic conundrum  In June 2016, Landeweer admitted himself to a Victoria psychiatric ward on the advice of a crisis line he called during one of his episodes.\nHe spent three weeks in hospital and was discharged with a prescription for anxiety medication. \nMore recently, according to his lawyer, Kirk Karaszkiewicz, Landeweer was assessed by a court-appointed psychiatrist.\n\"That psychiatrist's report resulted in the language to the effect that 'it's a diagnostic conundrum'. There was no definitive diagnosis,\" said Karaszkiewicz.  \n\"It seems without a diagnosis nobody steps up with a course of treatment.\"  \n\nJail time  In September 2016, Landeweer pleaded guilty to one count of uttering threats.\n\"The threat that he uttered — to the police by the way — was that he had a feeling and an urge that he had to kill his stepbrother,\" said Karaszkiewicz.\nWilliam Landeweer was born in the Netherlands and moved to Vancouver Island in 2012 with his parents, who live in Nanaimo, B.C. (Michael McArthur/CBC)\nA provincial court judge sentenced Landeweer to a conditional discharge.\n\"That means at the conclusion of his three year probation, if he doesn't get into trouble, that initial charge would be dropped,\" said Karaszkiewicz. \nIn December, Landeweer had another urge and called police again. \n\"He told the police, as I understand it, I have this urge and I'll be outside the house and I have a knife in my hand and that's where you will find me,\" said Karaszkiewicz. \nThe police responded and arrested Landeweer — not for uttering a threat but for breach of probation.\nAccording to Karaszkiewicz, Landeweer's probation conditions stipulate he is not allowed to have a knife except for eating food. \nLandeweer pleaded guilty to the breach and was held in the Vancouver Island Regional Correction Centre  until his release on Wednesday. \n\"It's been a hard 30 days. I'm just relieved to see my grandmother again and I can't wait to see my family,\" said Landeweer.\nHe remains on probation and will live with his grandparents in Ladysmith, B.C. \nBroken promise  \"We don't want, as grandparents and 70-year-olds, to have to be the jailer and psychiatrist for our grandson because there are no mental health treatment beds available,\" said Tysdal. \nTysdal blames the provincial government for the lack of care for her grandson and countless others. \n\"This government promised 500 new mental health beds. They have not delivered. People have to hold them accountable,\" she said. \nTysdal is planning a day of action on May 6 to bring attention to people with mental illness in the prison system. \n\"It's like the 18th century out there in terms of mental health care in British Columbia. We should be ashamed of ourselves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:39:37.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
