Image: Steve Meddle/REX/Shutterstock By Karissa Bell 2017-02-23 19:25:10 -0500 \nWe may have a few more details about what the new version of Nokia's classic 3310 will look like. \nThe handset will ship with a color display and have feature phone capabilities, according to information from Chinese site Vtech , which claims to have leaked information about the upcoming handset. SEE ALSO: The Nokia 3310 might come back and people just really want to play Snake \nThe original 3310 was released in 2000, back when people were still burning CDs and loading up Microsoft Encarta. \nThe new version looks like it won't disappoint longtime fans. According to Vtech's sources, the new 3310 will look very similar to the original but will have a slightly updated design that's lighter and thinner. \nThe phone won't be as 'dumb' as before. \nIts buttons will have more or less the same layout as the original, but may also sport a more modern look â€” the site says the key size will be \"adjusted.\" The new 3310 will also reportedly come in a few different colors, including red, yellow and green. \nThe phone won't be as \"dumb\" as before. It will reportedly be a feature phone, meaning it will have limited web browsing and other data-enabled capabilities. It will not, however, be a full-fledged smartphone (which is to be expected given its size and reported price tag of $63). \nThe display will be both larger and color, which is somewhat of a relief. \nOf course, we still have a little longer to wait before we get the official details. Nokia's new phone is expected to launch at an HMD event at Mobile World Congress on Feb. 26. Mashable will be reporting live from Barcelona so be sure to check back for more information in the coming days.
