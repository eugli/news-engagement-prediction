His repeated vows to \"Drain the Swamp\" were music to the ears of the disaffected masses who have grown increasingly frustrated with the ineptitude of their elected officials over the years. Pay-to-play. Collusion. Cover-ups. And now bribery? So CROOKED. I will #DrainTheSwamp . https://t.co/FNzMit7mD8 \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2016 \n\nTherefore, in light of the promises above, we thought it might be useful to take a look at who exactly is spending the most money to \"buy influence\" among our elected officials. According to data provided by The Hill , just the top 50 companies and industry groups in the country accounted for nearly 25% of all federal lobbying dollars spent in 2016. \nFifty companies and industry groups shelled out more than $716 million to lobby the federal government and Congress last year, according to data provided to The Hill by the Center for Responsive Politics. \n\nThe eye-popping total represents nearly a quarter of all federal lobbying dollars in 2016 and a slight increase over 2015, when the 50 biggest spenders doled out $715 million. \nAnd here's a look at the top 25 spenders: \n\nAs The Hill notes, with companies finding it difficult to \"read\" the new Trump administration, spending on lobbying efforts by America's largest corporations is unlikely to slow materially in 2017. \nAnger at lobbyists and special interests was a focal point of the presidential campaign, most famously expressed in President Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington. \n\nTrump has signed an executive order seeking to slow down the “revolving door” between administration jobs and the private sector , but few expect the deluge of lobbying to slow down under the new administration. \n\n“Everyone across the board believe there’s going to be lots of activity in Washington,” Marc Lampkin, the managing partner of the Washington office at law and lobby firm Brownstein Hyatt -Farber Schreck, told The Hill last month. \n\n“Corporate America has been seeking relief from the overreach of the Obama administration, so there will be activity on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue,” added Lampkin, a former aide to former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). \nThere are variety of reasons that companies seek to \"buy influence\" in Washington D.C., Dow Chemical, for example, seems to like spending their \"advocacy\" budget to help politicians \"better understand\" the merits for their massive M&A transactions. \nSome of the companies and groups that boosted their lobbying spending last year did so in response to major legislative and regulatory fights. \n\nDow Chemical, which is seeking to merge with DuPont, boosted its advocacy spending by 26 percent, to $13.6 million. \n\nOther companies that increased their spending included Prudential Financial, which paid lobbyists $9.4 million in 2016, an 18 percent increase over 2015; AbbVie, an industry group for medical device manufacturers, which spent 39 percent more on lobbying; and T-Mobile, which spent $8,089,900, an increase of 32 percent. \n\nAmazon significantly expanded its footprint in Washington last year. The company spent $11.4 million on advocacy, a 20 percent increase. \n\nSome of the increases in advocacy spending were driven by the 2016 election. \n\nThe two groups that spent the most, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors, included all political spending in their lobbying reports, which includes things like campaign advertising. Most entities do not report election activities in their total. \n\nThe Chamber’s spending totaled close to $104 million, while the Realtors spent almost $65 million. \nOf course, if Trump is really serious about \"Draining the Swamp\" then the only way to truly do that is by imposing term limits to restrict our easily corrupted elected officials from building the influence they are then all too eager to sell to the highest bidder ...as long as there is influence to be purchased you can rest assured their will be plenty of eager buyers. \nFinally, here is the full list of the 50 largest lobbying spenders in 2016 that spent over $700 million in aggregate. \nNone of them own Trump. \n\nI always thought we should just take a list like this, and simply cut the Federal budget using it for relative shares. The goal would be to roll back spending to 1980 levels. \n\nOh and by the way here is my revised, more polite health care proposal. I seriously think we need this level of action, so take it and run with it Team Trump: A Competitive ‘Big Bang’ for U.S. Health Care Reform: Joint Operations-Premium Yield (JOPY) Fund February 2017 Washington D.C. The 2016 Presidential election has created a unique moment in American politics. The ground has shifted and the apple carts of both major parties, as well as the national media, have been upset. Health care is directly in the new Administration’s sights. There is immense appetite for change. If the next reforms fail, systemic collapse or a national single-payer scheme become by far the most likely outcomes. Facing this extreme strategic risk, it is clear that the President-elect has an opportunity to bring in the executives of the Nation’s health care insurers, major care providers, and pharmaceutical firms. He can make, and expect to win, very tough demands and come to very big deals with these executives. The question is—what does he ask for? Replacing the Affordable Care Act has been an elusive quest for the establishment Republicans. On the Democratic side, a mix of timid incremental fixes rests uneasily with an urge to socialize the entire health care sector. Now is the time for a fresh proposal—one based on the fundamentally American and bipartisan tenets of liberty, free markets, and the quest for innovation. A proposal that blows by the status quo and the short-sighted strategies of the industry powers that be. A proposal, most importantly, that can be implemented quickly, offer premium relief to Americans, and create a permanent shift in an industry that makes up 20 percent of the U.S. economy. The basis of this proposal is twofold: First, that the executives of the industries can and will make major changes under existential threat (indeed, this is the only means to induce such change); and second, that significant cost efficiencies are possible in health care delivery and administration, but have not been incentivized due to the baroque, opaque, and often nonsensical regulatory tangle that both stifles competition and allows profiteering to those who learn to game the system. What the President-elect should demand is the creation of a $100 billion fund, paid for up front by the industry. We call this the Joint Operations-Premium Yield fund or JOPY. This fund would be used to pay the profits for those elements of the industry that demonstrate significant efficiency gains over the following three years. In other words, profitability would become conditional on meeting performance targets, rather than gaming the system. For the first time, corporate boardrooms would be seeking lean and efficient cost structures rather than padding and gold plating (to inflate or hide excess profits). Insurance companies, hospitals, medical partnerships, and patients would all share a common goal, to meet needs at the lowest cost. In practice, the key notion is to embed bidding and arbitrage throughout the system. At least five competitive sources should be sought, or if necessary created, for as many cost points as possible. Foreign providers and procedures should be allowed to compete in open marketplaces. Rewards, bonuses and other incentives should be developed at many levels to spur innovation and efficiency. In this manner, one three-year ‘big bang’ would be the genesis of a culture of competition and, one can hope, excellence in service delivery. The notion of a ‘big bang’ transition to competition is not unique to this proposal. The finance and energy sectors in several disparate countries and regions, from the City of London to the Asian financial markets to the European electric power market, have used similar strategies. This is the possibly unique time and political climate for the U.S. health care sector, and the American public, to seek the benefits of a tested yet radical approach to competition and reform. But there will be another use of the $100 billion JOPY fund. Immediate and significant premium relief for Americans can provide the Trump Administration (and bipartisan backers) with their critically needed big win. It is also fair, and well deserved. A $100 billion fund would be sufficient to bring $1,000 of premium relief to every American household. But not all households use private insurance. So even more would be available to those that do, at least $100 per month, perhaps double that. What if the industry succeeds in bringing competitive efficiency to play, but the JOPY fund has been used already for premium relief? In that event, further sources of funds would be considered, such as a bond securitization. But if this plan succeeds, so much productive investment and cost-cutting would be unleashed that industry profitability should be greatly enhanced. Perhaps the JOPY fund is an investment that pays for itself. The scale and inefficiency of the U.S. health care system today certainly suggests the possibility. Other reforms are also called for. Catastrophic care should be paid for directly via a Federal cost reimbursement model, with long term lifestyle and wellness approaches prioritized. The ‘long tail’ of catastrophic risk needs to be cut off so the vast majority of Americans can have more choices, including the choice of no insurance coverage, in a normally functioning free market. Incentives can be provided to make self-insuring against catastrophic risk an attractive deal, without forcing its purchase. Pharmaceutical companies have been parasites on all of us for long enough. The proposal outlined here is not for them. The Trump Administration should simply demand an immediate discount sufficient to wipe out the past five years of excess revenue (not ‘profit’ since the drug firms tend to hide excess revenues in their research and development programs, among other games). The new small-p politics of the big deal make this another immediate win that can, along with significant premium relief from the JOPY fund, turn a true guns and butter issue into a turning point in American political economy. We offer this proposal for the use of all participants in the health care debate. For an idea like this to succeed, industry participation is vital. Congress and the Administration must work with the executive leadership of the health care industry—encompassing providers as well as insurers—to develop the JOPY funding mechanism, establish valid competitive performance metrics, and target interim premium relief. States may need to participate, or under certain circumstances be asked to stand aside. Profitability limits may need to be superseded as the transition takes place. Structural change to allow or ensure depth of bidding markets for specific goods and services will be critical for long-term success. Reform that delivers the power of competitive arbitrage in the service of greater efficiency is, simply, no longer an option in the U.S. health care system. It is ‘do or die’. By using the JOPY fund and the concepts already in practice in other economic sectors, we believe the time is ripe to ‘do’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:28:47.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
