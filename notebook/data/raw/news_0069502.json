Source: Getty Images \nHeal isn’t officially on one of the eight rosters — each featuring five players — but he’ll have the opportunity to show his worth in a combine held in April. Player captains, co-captains, coaches, and executives will watch the draft players compete in scrimmages, drills, and strength and conditioning workouts, before the league holds its draft. \nHeal, a four-time Olympian and NBL Champion, is currently a commentator for Fox Sports Australia’s coverage of the NBL. \nThe inaugural season of this new league is set to tip off on June 25, 2017 (AEDT), in the United States.
