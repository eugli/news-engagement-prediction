As the camera did not capture audio it is not known what the men said but within moments the altercation became physical. \nThe situation escalated further when Smith tried to arrest Funk. Other officers are seen jumping into the scrum as Smith wrestles Funk to the ground. \n“Deputy Funk has been suspended with pay until his court appearance,” Allen said. “This will be handled and processed through the judicial court system.” \nIn a statement to police, Funk said he did not follow Smith’s commands because he did not understand why he was being arrested. Photos provided to WAVE-3 News in Kentucky shows Funk with a bloody nose, swollen lip, sore neck and bruising on his hand following the altercation. \nFunk was charged with menacing, resisting arrest and assault. Allen told reporters that Funk was not held inside a corrections facility after his arrest for fear his status as a corrections officer would make him a target for other inmates. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
