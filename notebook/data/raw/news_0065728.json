Wales' Six Nations bid over - Howley \nJones felt the momentum shift started before the interval when Leigh Halfpenny missed a chance to give Wales a 10-point lead and man of the match Finn Russell cut the gap to four points with the last kick of the half. \n\"At the tail end of the first half they took an opportunity and then into the second half, but we coughed up possession a little too easily,\" he said. \nJones said he wanted Wales to improve their discipline for their next game against Ireland on Friday, 10 March in Cardiff. \n\"We gave away one or two soft penalties and Scotland did a good job of disrupting us at the breakdown in the second half,\" he said.
