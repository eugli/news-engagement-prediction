Four people are taking me to Singapore. I don’t know what I will do when I land. \n“I called my sister in Singapore and she said she cannot put me up, so I just don’t know. \n“How can I stay anywhere? I don’t have a wallet with me, I’ve got about £12 in my pocket. \n“I don’t even have my clothes, they are at home. I just have what they took from the detention centre.” \nFormer gas fitter John, 50, who relied on his wife for full-time care, told how she had ‘nowhere to go’.

The mum-of-two was held at Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire (Photo: Daily Record) \n“But suddenly it has. Who is this helping? There are so many people coming into this country illegally so why deport someone with roots and a loving family, in the place she has lived for so many years? \n“I just don’t understand it and I think we’ve been terribly let down by the Government.” \nHis sister Angela Clennell, 51, added: “They just came and removed her without prior warning. \n“It’s unbelievable.” \nIrene married John in 1990 and was given indefinite leave to remain. \nBut she fell foul of foreign office red tape when she returned to Singapore to care for her sick parents in the late 90s. \nThey have since died. \nShe fought to regain indefinite leave to remain here, and was granted it by the Home Office in October 2008. \nThroughout all this time the couple, who met in a London pub in 1988, have had a home in the UK, and were living in Ouston, Co Durham. Their son John is 26 and has a year old daughter, Alana. Their younger son Sonny is 24. \nIrene was sent to Dungavel House Removal Centre in Lanarkshire after a routine appointment with the immigration service in Middlebrough six weeks ago. \nA Home Office spokesman said: “All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. \n“We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.” \nLib Dem Shadow Home Secretary Brian Paddick warned the case highlighted the ‘irrationality and inhumanity of our immigration system’. \nHe added: “When the rules are this arbitrary and rigid, anyone can find themselves on the wrong side of them. \n“This Conservative government’s lack of empathy is destroying Britain’s reputation as an open and tolerant country. \n“The Home Secretary must intervene immediately to bring Mrs Clennell home, give her the opportunity to appeal and prevent any further distress being caused to her and her family.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:32:22.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
