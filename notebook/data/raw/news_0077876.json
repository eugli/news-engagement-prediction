Credit Francois Durand/Getty Images Jesse Williams, actor, ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Before “Grey’s Anatomy” catapulted Jesse Williams into household name status, he taught history to Philadelphia high school students. Black history has always been a part of his life — 365 days a year (“nothing changes in February”) — so he understands that it was created for us by us. Still, he is unapologetic in his view that in its current state, the month itself is “a Band-Aid on a completely unnecessary wound of selfishness in American culture.” One way to change this problem, he says, is to restructure how history is taught in public schools. “You’re vilifying us for six months, then you’re going to give us a little black-and-white photo of Martin Luther King, give us two stanzas from ‘I Have a Dream’ and move on,” he said. “That’s a really condescending and exhausting experience for black people in school.” Teaching truthful history amid what he says he hopes is a “fleeting and short Trump era” is pressingly urgent, he adds. “It’s 2017 now,” he said. “We don’t need to coddle white America this much. We’re conditioned to believe black and brown people have not contributed to society. Then we wonder why they’re mistreated.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story What’s important, Mr. Williams’s says, is to get busy concerning ourselves with the daily work of honoring black lives. “A lot of these holidays are in memoriam, a way to look back and not forget,” he added. “So let’s treat Black History Month that way and make sure we don’t forget and spread the word about all of the rest of our ancestors that have made great contributions who are outside of the great five. We need to keep demonstrating and fighting for justice and to be seen and to be heard by ourselves and others. That doesn’t go away because the emperor has no clothes. It actually becomes more important.” \nAdvertisement — BENÉ VIERA Photo Raven Wilkinson, left, and Misty Copeland at a 2015 screening of “A Ballerina’s Tale,” a film about Ms. Copeland. Credit J. Countess/Getty Images Raven Wilkinson, former dancer, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo “Maybe it’s the political climate, but we’re paying a lot of good attention to it this year,” the ballet dancer Raven Wilkinson said. “Some people wonder, ‘Why do we need to have a Black History Month?’ We should use every chance to celebrate the hard-fought democracy for our country by everyone. We should celebrate and remember that it is a country of immigrants.” As an African-American dancer with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the mid-1950s, Ms. Wilkinson, 82, has perspective. “You have people with very divergent attitudes and ideas, and the minute they get the upper hand there’s a sense of fear and apprehension,” she said. “There has to be someone to blame and somebody to resent. I felt that very much in some of my experiences in traveling.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It was during a tour stop in Montgomery, Ala., that Ms. Wilkinson found herself locked inside her hotel room for her safety and watching a cross burning through the window. The company’s tour coincided with a Ku Klux Klan convention. “You couldn’t see the sidewalk for all the sheets roaming around,” she recalled. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At lunch, in a hotel dining room filled with families, Ms. Wilkinson noticed sheets and hoods on a nearby chair. “The thing I realized when I saw those — it was dirty linen,” she said. “The air went out or something. Just those tousled old sheets on a chair, it made me realize how empty this was and what a shame it was. They were very simple people and yet they could get this power by putting on these sheets and hoods and being in a mob. I always thought that was so sad. I didn’t fear them anymore.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Even now, amid President Trump’s push for a travel ban on refugees, among other issues, Ms. Wilkinson doesn’t fear that the country is going back in time. “We go so far and we take two or three or four steps backward, because that is what progress is,” she said. “We’ve achieved so much, yet we slide back to some of the most primary, ridiculous things. But I’m not discouraged. You’ve got to live through it. And just take breaths.” — GIA KOURLAS Photo Janet Mock, whose forthcoming book is titled “Surpassing Certainty: What My 20s Taught Me.” Credit Julie Glassberg for The New York Times Janet Mock, author, ‘Redefining Realness’ Janet Mock wishes she had known the work of the black transgender activists Marsha P. Johnson and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy , who were instrumental in the Stonewall riots, as a black transgender kid growing up in Honolulu. The power of being able to see yourself through representation can help you look past the cruelty that ignorance can breed. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Black History Month, Ms. Mock says, reminds her of the hard work of her ancestors and “to continue to say the names of not only my forbearers but also my contemporaries who are linked in arms with me doing this work.” Long gone are the days when Ms. Mock, who was among the only black students in her school, “cringed” during Black History Month because of the laserlike attention it drew. Her multiple histories — black, woman, transgender, Native Hawaiian — are always front and center. February only makes her say black revolutionary women’s names that much louder.
