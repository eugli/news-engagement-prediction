(Getty Images) \nEric Bailly admits Manchester United will need to keep a close eye on M’Baye Niang during the clash with Watford on Saturday. \nThe 22-year-old joined the Hornets on loan from AC Milan in January and has made an immediate impact by scoring a goal and registering an assist in the 2-1 win over Burnley last weekend. \n‘He’s a good French forward, with extraordinary speed – we’ll watch him closely,’ Bailly told United’s official website. Bailly is wary of Niang’s ‘extraordinary speed’.
