Brown Brought To Tears After Heartbreaking 'This Is Us' Episode We were crying, too. \nSpoiler alert: If you haven’t watched Tuesday night’s episode of “This Is Us,” then you may want to stop reading. Spoilers ahead. \nWe knew it was coming. But it still hurts. Guess in a way, just like real life. \nOn Tuesday night’s episode of “ This Is Us ,” beloved character William Hill (Ron Cephas Jones) dies from cancer. William grabbed us from the start of the show, and as we learned more about his past and got to know his personality and his interests, including his love of music, we liked him even more. It was also lovely to watch William’s relationship grow with Randall Pearson, his biological son, played by Sterling K. Brown . \nSo, if you were tearing up during Tuesday night’s heartbreaking episode of “This Is Us,” you were not alone. Even Brown, 40, got emotional ― and that was after after multiple viewings. A teary-eyed Brown did a Facebook Live chat after the show ended. \n“I’ve seen this episode a few times now and it still gets me,” he said, adding, “Proud of this show. Proud of the work. So happy, so happy to be a part of something like this. I’ve been doing this for a while and these kind of opportunities don’t come along all the time.” NBC \nBrown said it’s not his goal to bring the audience to tears, noting how crying is a “byproduct” of what the actors do on the hit series about family life. \nThrough tears, he stressed the importance of connecting with loved ones, saying, “If you have family that you haven’t talked to in a while or friends that you feel that you have gotten out of touch with, then call them up. And let ‘em know how much you love them and how much you care because tomorrow is not promised …But it’s not, and you gotta let let the people know while they’re here how much they’re appreciated and how much you love them. So, that’s what I’m happy about with this show. I’m happy that we get to do that.” \nBrown’s fellow cast members also took to social media about the episode.
