Given these circumstances, the Institute asks faculty and supervisors for flexibility, as employees and students may arrive later than usual. For hourly paid staff, the Excused Lateness Policy will be in effect on Friday (Personnel Policy Manual Section 5.7.2 ). Thursday, February 9, 2017 3:50 PM \nThe emergency closing has been extended through tonight. Non-essential night shift employees are not expected to come to work. We expect that the Institute will re-open at 7 a.m. on Friday, February 10. \nAny further changes will be announced on this page, on the MIT homepage , and on the Snow Line (617-253-7669 or 617-253-SNOW). Thursday, February 9, 2017 12:40 AM \nDue to the snowstorm, MIT will be closed for all non-essential personnel on Thursday, February 9, beginning at 7 a.m. Classes will also be canceled. We expect that the Institute will re-open at 11 p.m. on Thursday, February 9. \nAny further changes will be announced on this page, on the MIT homepage , and on the Snow Line (617-253-7669 or 617-253-SNOW). Wednesday, February 8, 2017 6:15 PM \nA significant snowstorm is forecast for the Boston area on Thursday, February 9. As of now, MIT expects to be open. As we continue to learn more about the path of this storm, we may have additional information. If the decision changes, an announcement about closing will be made on this page, on the MIT homepage, and on the Snow Line (617-253-7669 or 617-253-SNOW). \nWe encourage employees to discuss with their supervisors whether they can effectively work from home on Thursday, and we encourage supervisors to grant those requests where possible. Essential personnel, of course, must report to work. Other employees who cannot work from home, but who cannot get to work due to the storm, may use any accrued vacation time or personal time. \nIf MIT will be open as usual, we encourage everyone who can to leave their cars at MBTA or commuter rail stations and take public transportation. If the commute is slow, MIT will follow its policy of Excused Lateness by Institute Notice for tomorrow ( Personnel Policy Manual section 5.7.2 ). Under that policy, employees who are late in reporting to work because of the snow will be paid for the hours they were normally scheduled to work, and no disciplinary action will be taken for tardiness. No special code is used, and the hours of excused lateness are simply recorded as hours worked. MIT is committed to the safety and security of every member of the MIT community. In the event of a campus emergency, news and information will be posted to this site and to the MIT home page .
