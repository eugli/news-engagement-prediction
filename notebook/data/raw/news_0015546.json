There are some similarities between Melenchon's platform and Le Pen's, as both are sceptical of the EU and globalisation, but they differ sharply on other issues including migration. \nDuring his speech, Melenchon mentioned the Socialist party's presidential candidate Benoit Hamon, who has called on left-wing forces to unite. \n\"Everyone wants to abolish El Khomri (a labour law), including the Socialist candidate. I wonder what holds him back?\" said Melanchon, who has between 11 and 11.5 percent support, according to Friday's BVA poll. \nThe Socialists, weakened after the deeply unpopular presidency of Francois Hollande, have no chance of getting beyond the first round of the election in April, according to the latest polls. \nThe poll by BVA of voting intentions on Friday gave Hamon between 16 and 17 percent in the April 23 first round, behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen on 25 percent, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron on 21-22 percent and conservative Francois Fillon on 20 percent. Around 12,000 persons assist to the meeting of Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of \"France Insoumise\" (far left wing) in Lyon on February 5, 2017.[Photo/VCG] Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:15:57.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
