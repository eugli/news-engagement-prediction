I want to enjoy life.\" \nCassidy's publicist said his comments were accurate but gave no further details. \nHis comments followed videos taken by fans of the singer struggling to remember words to some of his old hits at small venue concerts in southern California on Saturday and Sunday. \nAt one point, he appeared to fall off the side of a small stage before climbing back up. \nCassidy, whose hits \"Cherish\" and \"I Think I Love You\" had teenage girls swooning in the 1970s, has struggled with drinking and financial troubles in recent years. \nIn 2015, he had to auction his Florida home after a bankruptcy filing. He was arrested three times for drunken driving between 2010 and 2014, and was ordered to rehab as part of his sentence in 2014. \nCassidy appeared in several stage shows after his career as a solo singer declined. He played an aging former teen heartthrob in the short-lived 2009 TV comedy \"Ruby & the Rockits\" and was a member of the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality TV show in 2011. - Reuters <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:48:00.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
