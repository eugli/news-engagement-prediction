The status means that those long-time loyalists can enjoy all the perks of being a volunteer (like entry into concerts and access to the wine garden) without actually having to work volunteer shifts. It's a big perk that also comes with a gold pin and a little extra swagger in your step.\nBut as the number of volunteers has grown — from about 13,000 in the early 2000s to 33,000 this year — so too has the number of lifetime volunteers. In 2012, there were 3,417 lifers; in 2016, the number was up to 4,209. The rodeo estimates that if the policy were to stay as is, there would be 20,228 by 2030. Combine that with the number of active volunteers, and you're looking at 50,000 people trying to score a seat at the 2030 Willie Nelson tribute tour before you even factor in paying customers.\nMUSICAL OFFERINGS: Concert lineup announced for RodeoHouston\nIt's unsustainable. So the HLSR has changed its policy, requiring volunteers to log at least 20 years of service and wait until they're at least 60 years old to earn the lifetime pin. Here's the video in which Rodeo CEO Joel Cowley explains the situation to volunteers:\nFor thousands of volunteers, the change means that the goal post is moving before their eyes. For example, if you began volunteering at the age of 25, and are now 50 with 25 years under your belt, you'd be eligible for lifetime status this year under the old rules. Under the new rules, you have to log an additional 10 years.\nFor some committees, such as Rodeo Express, in which thousands of volunteers monitor parking and crowd flow, on their feet for hours at the time, rain or shine, this means aging volunteers who thought they'd get to sit down in a few years time would need to log more years of relatively demanding physical work.\nScroll through the above gallery to see the lineup for 2016 RodeoHouston\nMembers of the Harris County Sheriff's Office and the Pony Express Riders made a stop at the Capitol before the Houston rodeo. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stopped by but didn't talk about them afterward. Instead, Patrick spoke about sanctuary cities and Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez.\nMedia: MediaOS Video In the video above, RodeoHouston riders stop by the statehouse during the buildup to the big event.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/41/52/7740038/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/44/57/21/9630829/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/43/71/02/9408695/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/13/24/7648556/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157780/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/45/51/10902129/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/17/8790978/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zixm_m6-Zos", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/01/51/8133240/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/53/62/63/11480284/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/00/60/10750976/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157797/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/00/60/10750976/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/16/32/12117657/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157773/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157792/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/12/00/8167472/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/44/61/46/9640370/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/43/71/02/9408695/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/17/8790978/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/44/61/46/9640370/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/11/72/67/2600391/39/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157773/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/22/17/8987638/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/16/32/12117657/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/44/57/21/9630829/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/16/12157869/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/45/51/10902129/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/53/62/63/11480284/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/42/22/17/8987638/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157814/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157814/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157813/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/41/52/7740038/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/01/51/8133240/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/16/12157854/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/11/72/67/2600391/39/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/13/24/7648556/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157780/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157792/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157813/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/16/12157854/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/15/12157797/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/30/16/12157869/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/12/00/8167472/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:57:06.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
