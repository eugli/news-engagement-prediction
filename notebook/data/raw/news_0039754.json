Sorry but who is going to pay me for it?\" she said.\nA recharge during a 15-minute coffee is still fine. More than that will add to the bill.\nThe fee applies also to laptops and tablets and it is multiplied by the number of devices being recharged.\n\"I run a cafe, not an internet cafe,\" she was Quote: d by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\"It's getting more and more extreme. People come and think everything is accessible and free... You don't even open your eyes in the morning for free.\"\nMs Pokorny thinks hers was the first cafe to introduce such a fee in Austria, which came in last year - it only came to light this week when a newspaper reported on the \"bizarre bill\" containing the \"electricity\" charge.\nAnd while some say the fee is fair, others may argue its cost is too high. Last year, technology website ZDNet calculated how much it costs to charge a smartphone during a year: $0.84 if you're in the US (£0.67, €0.79).\nYou may also like Spanish 64-year-old gives birth to healthy twins in Burgos Google CEO Sundar Pichai writes back to girl, 7, who wants a job But Ms Pokorny is far from being the only one angry at customers who consume more in internet and electricity than coffee.\nSome owners also complain about the poor atmosphere created by busy professionals absorbed in their phones, rather than friend and family get-togethers.\nIs the party over for free wi-fi in cafes?
