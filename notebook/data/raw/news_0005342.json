Bob Farley/f8FPhoto,Bob Farley Sen. Del Marsh (R-Anniston) said today that he intends to be a part of drafting legislation to revive and improve the Historical Rehabilitation Tax Credit program during this year's Alabama Legislative session. Marsh, who held up passage of a bill to renew the program in last year's session, told media Tuesday that the results of an independent evaluation of the program gave it a 'B' rating. He said he intends to work with Sen. Jabo Waggoner (R-Vestavia Hills) in drafting the legislation to reinstate the program. The evaluation, conducted by the University of Tennessee, was commissioned by the Alabama Department of Revenue at the request of Marsh. The Pizitz is one Birmingham project that benefited from the tax credit. Bob Farley/f8FPhoto,Bob Farley In a conference call with reporters, Marsh said the study shows the program is a benefit to the state, and that he intends to work with colleagues in the Alabama Legislature to address a couple of issues and institute some best practices to get it to an 'A' rating. “Overall the historic tax credit is a good program that could be a great program with a few modifications. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the regular session as we attempt re-establish the tax credit with the suggested improvements.” Marsh said in a statement. The study recommends that the historic tax credits be made refundable, and that the evaluation process be moved away from the Alabama Historical Commission to an outside entity. “I want to thank Sen. Marsh for looking into this program. There is no doubt that the historic tax credit is vital to the revitalization of downtown Birmingham as well as many cities and counties across Alabama,” Waggoner said. “I am confident that we will have legislation that will re-establish the historic tax credit and we will continue to see the economic advantages that come along with it.” Results of the historic tax credit in Birmingham include projects such as the Lyric Theatre and the Redmont Hotel, and ones like the Pizitz building, the Empire Building and the Historic Federal Reserve building. Marsh said he doesn't envision hurdles like the ones faced in 2016 that would hold up passage of historic renovation tax credit legislation in the session, which begins Feb. 7. The study also evaluated Alabama's CAPCO program, which received a D rating. The CAPCO program provides insurance premium tax credits to insurance companies that invest in certified capital companies, which are typically venture capital entities.
