Only half of survey respondents said they reported their sexual abuse or assault to police themselves or through another individual.\nMore recently, the case of an Alberta judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn’t keep her knees together sparked outrage across the country and highlighted the need for more education on the issue within the justice system.\nJustice Robin Camp is currently waiting to see if the Canadian Judicial Council will agree with a disciplinary panel's decision and recommend that he be removed from the bench.\nThe accused in the case was acquitted in a retrial.\nRelated Stories Judge in 'knees together' case seeks review of judicial council decision Woman says 'justice' in sexual assault case came at personal cost Ontario funding sexual violence response projects Related Links The JUST Act", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:00:14.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
