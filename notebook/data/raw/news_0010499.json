There was a close-up of a very much alive Eleven, a glimpse of the boys dressed in Ghostbusters costumes (!), and a glimpse at the new multi-legged big bad, as the the words “the world is turning upside down” flashed across the screen. \nThe teaser also revealed a release date for the new season: Halloween 2017. \nNetflix has remained tight-lipped about the details of the second season, but we do know that it will pick up in 1984, one year after the close of the first season. \nAccording to executive producer Shawn Levy , “The Demogorgon was destroyed but evil wasn’t.” \n“Stranger Things” Season 2 debuts on Netflix in 2017.
