Ben Loewnau, STLhighschoolsports.com \nBRUSSELS • Baylee Kiel had a point to prove. \nAnd she did it — more than 2,000 times. \nThe Brussels High senior holds the all-time girls basketball scoring record at the tiny Calhoun County school with 2,072 points over her four-year career, which began with plenty of determination and grit. \nThe 5-foot-10 winger did not start her first game as a freshman, much to her dismay. \n\"I wanted it so bad,\" Kiel recalled. \nExplained senior Grace Stephens, Kiel's friend and long-time teammate: \"We had a few seniors and the coach didn't know what she was capable of yet.\" \nSo when Kiel finally entered the game against North Greene late in the opening quarter, she did so with a chip on her shoulder. \n\"All she really wanted was to show people that she could play,\" said her mother, Robyn. \nKiel did just that, pumping in 25 points on 10-for-12 shooting in the 74-42 loss. \nShe has not slowed down since. \nThat performance was a portent of things to come for Kiel, who has become one of the most feared small-school offensive weapons in the state. \nThe Raiders, with Kiel and a veteran starting lineup leading the way, take a 20-9 mark into the Class 1A Greenfield Regional this week. They open with a regional semifinal at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday against Carrollton. \nOn the horizon is a potential meeting with defending state champion Hardin-Calhoun (21-5) in the regional championship Thursday. \nKiel does not fault then-coach Steve Schulte for not putting her in the lineup from the outset. Even she had some doubts about her ability. \n\"I think maybe I needed some confidence to show me where I fit in,\" Kiel said. \"Nobody knew that I was going to play the way I played. I didn't even know.\" \nKiel has been filling up the scoresheet since day one. She is averaging 18.2 points per game and is second on the team in steals, assists and rebounds. She is a wizard on the defensive end as well. \n\"She just has a head on her shoulders when it comes to playing basketball,\" Brussels coach Doug Meyer. \"It's natural for her to do the right thing out there.\" \nKiel has done it all in front of a large contingent of adoring fans. Buzzer-beaters, half-court shots. Everything. She scored a career-high 38 points in a game against Payson-Seymour last season. \nThe pride of the small community of Golden Eagle, Kiel is a celebrity in this area. She poses for pictures, especially with adoring little girls after most games. Fans young and old consistently approach her to congratulate her on her exploits. \n\"When she approached the (2,000-point) milestone, everyone really started appreciating what she's done and what she means to this area,\" Brussels athletics director Mark Hillen says. \"Everyone came out because they knew this would be the last time to see something like her in a while.\" \nKiel passed the coveted mark Jan. 30 with a 15-point performance in a 50-42 win at Payson-Seymour. When play was stopped and her feat was announced, the visiting crowd stood and cheered, stunned that he had passed the 2,000-point plateau, not 1,000. \n\"Then it was hugs all around,\" Stephens said. \"It was a great moment for her and she really deserved it.\" \nKiel has scored in double figures in 105 of 111 games. Her career average sits at 18.7. \nA straight-A student, Kiel sports a bubbly personality. \n\"Never a dull moment with her around,\" Robyn said. \nExplained Kiel: \"Sometimes, I can be a little goofy.\" \nShe can also be free-spirited. Kiel recently got a tattoo on her rib-cage that reads \"She flies with her own wings\" in Latin. \n\"That sums it up,\" Kiel said. \nA softball pitcher as well as a hitter on the volleyball team, Kiel felt like softball would be her future back in junior high. But basketball gradually moved up the ladder. \nKiel, the oldest of four siblings, is unsure if she wants to continue to play basketball in college. Lindenwood-Belleville is among the schools that have shown the most interest. \nBut she would like to become a nurse and is anxious to get started in that direction as well. \nThe small-town girl plans on staying that way. She feels right at home in the bucolic setting of Calhoun County and said she does not expect to move out of town even after she graduates from college. \n\"Athletes like her don't come around too often,\" Meyer said. \"We're happy to have been able to watch her do the things she's done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:00:16.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
