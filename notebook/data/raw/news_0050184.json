Internet in meltdown as Nirvana frontman 'spotted' FOOTAGE of a singer performing a Nirvana song has emerged leaving the internet baffled because he looks and sounds EXACTLY like Kurt Cobain. / Published 20th February 2017 \nThe Nirvana frontman – who would have been 50 today – famously committed suicide on April 5, 1994, at the age of 27. \nBut the manner of his death has often been disputed, with some conspiracy theorists claiming he was murdered. \nMany still believe Courtney Love – the singer’s wife – killed him, particularly given the fact Cobain carried a note in his wallet that mocked his wedding vows and called his wife a “b**** with zits.” \nAnd a video of another singer – Ramiro Saavedra – performing the rock band’s song Come As You Are has even led some to believe Cobain is still alive. \nYOUTUBE/GETTY SPITTING IMAGE: The singer looked and sounded exactly like Kurt Cobain \nWith guitar in hand, Ramiro has the grunge singer’s iconic long hair and note for note sounds exactly like him. \nIt was originally taken in April 2012, but has been reposted on social media site Reddit and caused a stir among fans. \nUsers have been so convinced by the performance they have claimed the singer is actually Cobain. \nOne wrote: “OMG Kurt Cobain from Nirvana is alive!” \nYOUTUBE BIZARRE: He had the same long hair and played a guitar just like the Nirvana frontman \nAnother simply added: “He is alive!” \nBut others were less than convinced, with one saying: “Not bad, bit weird and unoriginal, but not bad.” \nIn fact, Ramiro was competing on Peruvian talent show Yo Soy (I am) – where contestants cover songs from their favourite singers.
