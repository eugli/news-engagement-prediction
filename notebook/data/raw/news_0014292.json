Reds cop most shocking loss yet \nKlopp said: “A week ago I spoke about expectations and said we were still allowed to have a positive look on the situation because we are still fourth in the league. \n“But after a game like this we have to take all the criticism because we expect more from ourselves and we have to show more than we did today, and it is my responsibility to make it possible. Doubt creeps in for Klopp 0:41 \nEPL: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is beginning to have some doubts about the teams preparations after another embarrassing loss. February 5th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/EPL/ Doubt creeps in for Klopp \n“The Champions League is a big, big target but it is so difficult because there are so many challengers. After today’s performance we don’t have to think about this - we have to show now that we can work together and be ready to go for everything.” \nThe Reds boss added: “I can understand why you ask that if we have the record we have against these teams and another record against the others. \n“We produce our own problems. Obviously, we are doing it now. My mistake, our mistakes. In a few days we have another opportunity to play and we need to show we are ready for all the other games.” \nKlopp insisted he saw some positive reaction early in the second half with a spell of intense pressure, but accepted he was still at a loss to find a reason for Liverpool’s display in the opening 45 minutes. \n“We didn’t play the first half as we should have played,” he said. “When you saw them in the second half you thought, if we had played from the beginning like this, it would have made it more difficult for Hull to cope. \n“Usually after a few minutes or half an hour after a game you feel better because you have had the chance to think about things and then you start answering questions. But this time I don’t feel better.” \nHull boss Marco Silva hailed a growing belief within his squad that they can beat the drop but insisted he would not be getting carried away despite this week’s four-point haul against Klopp’s men and Manchester United. Tigers pounce on woeful Reds 1:27 \nEPL: Liverpool have continued their miserable run of form with an embarrassing loss to Hull City. February 5th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/EPL/ Tigers pounce on woeful Reds \n“Of course I’m happy with our performance - my team showed a fantastic attitude and fantastic spirit, and the important thing is to keep focus and continue to take more points,” he said. \n“We need to keep sight of our goal because we have only won three points and nothing more. But this shows the players that this is the right way and they can believe. This is important because when the players don’t believe it is impossible.” \nNew boys N’Diaye and Kamil Grosicki played a significant part in the Tigers’ success and Silva admitted he had handed the pair their full debuts earlier than he might have wished. \nThey took their places in the starting lineup four days after completing deadline-day deals along with Italian Andrea Ranocchia, who was only upgraded from the bench after Michael Dawson sustained a calf injury in the warmup. \n“I would have preferred to give our new signings more time to work with the team but we didn’t have the time,” Silva said. \n“N’Diaye and Grosicki only worked with me for two days and normally I wouldn’t put them in the first 11, but we need these players to improve our squad. Of course I know that in the next games they will improve like all the other players.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:36:43.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
