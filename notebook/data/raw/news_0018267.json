Eugenie Bouchard dresses as 'naked Kim Kardashian' for Halloween \nWhile watching the Super Bowl on Monday, 20-year-old marketing student John Goehrke noticed a Tweet from the Canadian tennis star. \nWith the Atlanta Falcons leading the New England Patriots 21-3 late in the game, Bouchard wanted to let everyone know she predicted a Falcons victory. I knew Atlanta would win btw — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nBut the game wasn't over, and Goehrke thought he'd try and turn the cocky tweet in his favour, replying 'If Patriots win we go on a date?' @geniebouchard if patriots win we go on a date? — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nIncredibly, Bouchard agreed, and the Patriots went on to pull off the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history for a remarkable win. \nAnd as it turns out Bouchard is a woman of her word. So...where do you live? https://t.co/mfucQ0C9VL — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \n\"I thought maybe there was a chance she would respond, but I thought there was no chance she'd actually agree to it,\" Goehrke told the Kansas City star. \n\"Once the game ended, that's when everything started blowing up.
