Where once we might have awaited the next consignment of pre-loved kiddie wear from friends and neighbours, parcelled in an unpromising black bin liner, today we go online and select just what we want from the infinite number of second-hand items on sale. And when we’re done with our own babies’ clothes? We no longer pass, but sell, them on. \nThe internet has transformed our approach to children’s wear, turning us into both perspicacious consumers and canny saleswomen.\nMothers hit by spiralling childcare costs see selling on their children’s outworn garments as a way to earn their crust from home Y et not everyone is happy about this - least of all Laura Tenison, founder of upmarket baby clothing chain JoJo Maman Bebe (said to be favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge). Posting on a Facebook group , where her garments are sold on by mothers, she took exception to users paying almost full price for second hand items and allegedly exploiting her company’s intellectual property by reproducing images. \nThough she later apologised and said she loved the Facebook group, the outburst offers an insight into both how retailers can lose control of their brand in today’s democratised online marketplace, as well as the thriving ‘black market’ for baby wear that has sprung up in recent years.\nPeer-to-peer selling has become big business for so-called ‘ mumpreneurs ’, allowing a quick buck to be made on what was once a haphazard and unprofitable process of passing on pre-worn items.\nLaura Tenison's Facebook post - now deleted Credit: Facebook R achael White, the founder of an eBay shop called Thingimijigs , is among the success stories. Since 2004, when she and her husband started selling clothes and shoes their three children had grown out of online, the company has expanded from their home in Burnley, Lancs, to a larger premises and now boasts a £1.3 million turnover and eight members of staff.\n“When we started, on eBay, I was looking for some shoes for my toddler,” she says. “When they’re young, they grow out of them so quickly, and I thought, ‘there’s nothing wrong with their old shoes. I’m looking to buy the next size up, so surely other people will be in the same position.’ So we started selling things our children had outgrown.”\nSimilar businesses from Mum 2 Mum Market and Poppy & Pickles Nearly New Family Sale have since emerged. In many cases, mothers hit by spiralling childcare costs see selling on their children’s outworn garments as a way to earn their crust from home. Indeed, White attributes the growth in the market for second hand items in large part to financial pressures.\nThere is, of course, another side to growing up with social media: it encourages us to curate an enviable version of our lives “A lot of it is the cost of new clothing,” she says. “Children grow out of clothes before they’ve worn out and if people think they may be able to make half the money back, that’s cash in their pockets. Twenty years ago people would have gone to the market stall or car boot sale to do this. Now, with social media, it’s easier and more acceptable to sell on used clothes.”\nI n place of old-fashioned jumble sales, or adverts placed in weekly newspapers offering bundles of clothes for a few bob, is what White calls “the modern-day way” - something new parents in their twenties and early thirties have grown up with.\nThere is, of course, another side to growing up with Facebook and other social media: it encourages us to curate an enviable version of our lives to present to the outside world. And for millennials, it is a picture in which our children often take centre stage. For our lives to look desirable, our kids must look good.\nSo with these pressures mounting, the growth in boutique-style baby clothes is hardly surprising, whether it’s from brands like JoJo Maman Bebe and The Little White Company or - at the top of the range - from designer labels such as Burberry and Ralph Lauren, which both have their own lines of children’s wear. \nWatch | Veuve Clicquot winner Laura Tenison on surviving the downturn 06:01 Y et not everyone can afford to pay full whack. Kerry Marfleet, 32, from Sale in Greater Manchester, is a member of the Facebook group JoJo Maman Bébé New and Preloved Buy & Sell that attracted Tenison’s ire.\nThe mother of a seven-year-old, four-year-old and 20-month-old twins says: “When you’ve got four children, buying new is not always possible. When we were kids we had a lot of knitted stuff, but brands like JoJo are desirable now and have a more boutique [look].\n“I use social media a lot for my business [running Hive, a forest nursery] and you want people to think you’re doing well. If your kids look well dressed, that helps.”\nIn an age when we do almost everything else online, the buying and selling of outgrown baby clothes was always bound to end up there too.\nBut perhaps not everything is ripe for reselling. Whether any of my old sweatshirts would have ever found a buyer? I guess we’ll never know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:46:45.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
