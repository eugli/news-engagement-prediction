However, the group does not feel the same way about sororities, the Daily News reported: \nEngender does not currently have an official position on whether sororities should be gender-integrated. McGrew said that whereas fraternities deliberately cultivate themselves as social spaces, sororities tend towards intimate associations and do not affect wider social trends at Yale in the same manner. \nThe Department of Justice offers protections to exclusive organizations — like fraternities — in its Title IX rules. “Title IX exemptions include the membership policies of certain university-based social fraternities and sororities,” the DOJ manual reads. \nEngender was able to coordinate the allowance of women and non-binary students into Sigma Phi Epsilon rush events after several female students expressed interest in joining. \nIn an uncommon turn, the fraternity leadership said that — while they wouldn’t allow women to officially join — they wanted to show an inclusive spirit by allowing both men and women to participate in January recruitment events, according to the Daily News : \nTyler Morley ’18, the president of SigEp, declined to comment for this article, but told the News in a statement last week that his organization hopes that the inclusion of women at rush events will allow the fraternity to become a more welcoming place while adhering to the bylaws of their national organization that confer membership only to men. \nEngender said that the effort was intended to get people to start talking about inequalities that exist in Yale’s Greek life. \n“Engender supports open access to social events for Yale students regardless of gender, race, class or sexuality,” the group said in a statement. “We hope to work with as many of Yale’s fraternities and other student groups as possible to develop a more inclusive and equitable campus climate.” \nThere were, according to McGrew, between five and 10 women who attended the recruitment events, and it didn’t go very well for some of them. Ry Walker, one of the women who attended the rush events at Phi Sigma Epsilon, felt her interactions with male attendees was more awkward than she expected. \n“It was interesting to see how people that I interact with on a daily basis would not even acknowledge my presence,” she told the Daily News. “It made for a weird situation.” \nRegardless, each of the women who participated in the rush events submitted requests to join Phi Sigma Epsilon. They were all turned down. Engender, of course, is hoping for a rule change to allow women into any fraternities. \nThe advocacy group contacted leadership at other fraternities on campus, but none of them allowed women to participate in rush events. \nEngender, of course, is hoping for a rule change to allow women into any and all fraternities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:01:06.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
