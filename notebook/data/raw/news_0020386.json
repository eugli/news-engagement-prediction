A free throw in the last second for the Wizards made the score 117-120. \nWith literally three seconds left the ball was launched forward to King James and the 32 year old sunk an incredible three pointer with less than a second left to tie the game. This is an UNBELIEVABLE shot @KingJames ! pic.twitter.com/5JW63i7U33 - NBA UK (@NBAUK) February 7, 2017 \nBefore last night the legendary small forward had only sunk one of his previous 17 attempts at game tying three point shots in the last five seconds of a match. \nThe Cavs went on to win 140-135 and had James to thank for their success despite the fact that the four time NBA MVP didn't finish the game after his five personal fouls. \nIt was some moment for an incredible player!
