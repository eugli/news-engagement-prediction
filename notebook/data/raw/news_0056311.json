Posted February 23, 2017 21:29:05 Map: United States \nA good party is never complete without a goodie bag, and the Oscars are no exception. \nBut what on Earth do you put in a gift bag for the rich and famous who seem to have it all? \nAs it turns out, the unofficial goodie bags are less about goodwill and more about good business. Companies pay hefty prices for a spot in that bag. \nFor 15 years, the company behind the gift bags has been Distinctive Assets. \nEach year leading up to the awards ceremony, the company sends those nominated for an Oscar in acting and directing categories an Everyone Wins gift bag. \nAfter finding out what is included in the bag, there is no doubt that everyone does in fact win. \nThe extravagant freebies range from luxurious vacations, to cosmetic procedures, to non-browning apples. \nSo, what exactly will the likes of Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Dev Patel, Viola Davis, Casey Affleck and Meryl Streep be gifted this year, and how much are the gifts reportedly worth? \nHere are some of the highlights: Three-day mansion stay at the Lost Coast Ranch, $40,000 One week at the exclusive Golden Door spa, $8,850 Five-night stay in a Hawaii beach villa, up to $4,270 Head-to-toe laser skin treatment for \"imperfections\", up to $4,446 Three-night stay in a luxurious hotel in Vittoria, Italy, $5,000 Ten personal training sessions with a celebrity trainer, $900 14K solid gold and diamond encrusted bracelet $375 'Smart' home security system, $599 \nOh, and let's not forget the non-browning, GMO-free, extra crunchy apples, crayons, serums and moisturisers, sweets, shirts, earrings and underarm sweat patches. Yes, underarm sweat patches. \nLast year, Forbes reported the total value of the gift bag as about $232,000 â€” $6 million in total. \nBut this year, Distinctive Asset teased to a six-figure value on this year's collection. \nThe company's founder, Lash Fary, remained coy about the exact cost of each bag and insisted the company was not aiming to increase the value each year. \n\"A great gift has nothing to do with the price tag,\" he said. \n\"We are desperately trying to move the conversation away from that point ... especially when outlets simply make up alternative values to suit a headline.\" \nMr Fary maintained the pampering was well-deserved. \n\"At the end of the day, the movie industry is about allowing viewers to escape reality and enter a fantasy world,\" he said. \n\"We hope we do that in some small way for these hard-working nominees ... help them relax, unwind, unplug and indulge after one of the most intensely hectic weeks of their lives.\" Oscars party poop on goodie bags \nDespite delivering the goods to celebrities for over a decade, Distinctive Assets landed themselves in hot water last year when they were sued by the Academy for using its trademarks on the bags. \nThe two sides were able to settle the issue under the condition that Distinctive Assets would make it clear the Academy had no association with the gift bags. Bagging a spot \nCompanies are scrambling to get their product or services included in the luxury gift bags, with some paying up to $4,000 to be included, according to Forbes. \nSome could think these luxurious freebies are wasted on the rich and famous, but the companies do not do it out of the goodness of their heart. \nFor a business, there is much to gain from a celebrity using a product. \nAs Mr Fary told Forbes in 2016: \"We are gifting them for the same reason that they are paid upwards of $20 million for a single film ... because their personal brand has value as a commodity\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:47:27.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
