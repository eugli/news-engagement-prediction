A post shared by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Feb 14, 2017 at 10:35am PST \nDalbesio begins by admitting to making “smug judgments” about her model colleagues and the idea of glamour models out of frustration about the lack of meaningful opportunities heading her way when she first entered the industry in her early twenties. \nShe admits her personal growth as a comfortable feminist has only come in recent years and it is the reason she is now comfortable flaunting her beauty in the iconic Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. A post shared by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Feb 3, 2017 at 11:25am PST \nShe says it’s not her problem if you don’t believe feminism and bikini modelling can co-exist. \n“A traditionalist may imagine that identifying as a feminist while simultaneously desiring to be a near-naked model in Sports Illustrated must bely some level of cognitive dissonance,” Dalbesio wrote for si.com . \n“Two seemingly conflicted ideas, standing in opposition to one another. You can’t fight against the oppression of the male gaze while simultaneously volunteering yourself as subject to it. Or can you? The first time I went in for a casting I struggled with that very question. It was 2012, Kate Upton was on the cover and Crystal Renn was contorting inside. A post shared by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Jan 31, 2017 at 12:48pm PST \n“I was channelling my frustration with the industry-imposed limitations of my modelling career into performance art, posing as a stripper and performing durational topless faith-healing sessions in the back of a Chelsea art gallery. I was sceptical and angry, annoyed with years of being told I was too fat, then too thin, with photographers and agents and empty promises of change, only to incur disastrous arguments when I tried to assert myself. \n“I had just terminated my relationship with my acting agency, after they expressly chastised me for turning down an audition for an Axe commercial that I thought was demeaning.” \nFive years later and she is back for another crack, this time with a clear conscience. A post shared by MYLA DALBESIO (@myladalbesio) on Jan 31, 2017 at 9:19am PST \nShe says the magazine has changed. It’s role as a powerful social influence is a real thing. \nIn 2015, Robyn Lawley featured on the cover of the magazine to become the first woman above a size six to be made the cover girl. \nLast year UFC superstar Ronda Rousey was also featured on the cover of the 2016 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition. \nDalbesio says it is one of the reasons she returned to Sports Illustrated, but the biggest reason is that she has conquered her body image issues. \nAs a result of that she has conquered her issues about unfairly judging others in the industry. \nShe says women’s sexuality should be celebrated by the women who want to celebrate it. No woman should ever be told how to feel about their own sexuality. \n“It’s hard to hear someone say that I am being objectified by participating in things like the Swimsuit issue,” she said. \n“It feels insulting, implying that I am somehow being taken advantage of, that I am not empowered in my own decisions. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I embrace my body and celebrate it, and for me that is what this issue represents. \n“When I strip down and roll around in the sand, I’m not doing it for men, I’m doing it for me. I’m doing it because I worked for a decade to get here, went through countless trials and tribulations over my body image, and now I am proud to represent women my size. \n“I am proud to show that you can be strong, smart, and sexy. I am proud to defy outdated and incorrect expectations of what feminists look and act like.” \nShe told foxnews.com last week , her priority is for women to simply accept each other. \n“I hope that I can encourage women to continue to see the light in each other and bring each other up and band together,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:00:33.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
