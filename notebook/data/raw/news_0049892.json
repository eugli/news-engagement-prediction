The offensive was announced by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday morning.\nBut the layout of Mosul’s west side could make liberating the city especially challenging, military experts and human rights advocates have said.\n“An estimated 350,000 children are trapped in western Mosul, and the impact and other explosive weaponry in those narrow, densely-populated streets is likely to be more deadly and indiscriminate than anything we have seen in the conflict so far,” Maurizio Crivallero, Save the Children’s Iraq Country Director said in a statement . “This is the grim choice for children in western Mosul right now: bombs, crossfire and hunger if they stay; or execution and snipers if they try to run.”\nMeanwhile, commanders have noted that military vehicles will be unable to pass through many of the narrow, winding streets, according to Reuters.\nIraq forces recaptured the eastern side of the city last month. Mosul’s two sides are divided by the Tigris River and normally linked by bridges. During Iraq’s assault on IS-posts in the eastern side of the city last month, U.S.-led coalition airstrikes targeted some of the bridges to prevent militants on the west side from sending reinforcements to their eastern counterparts.\nAfter Iraqi forces successfully recaptured the east, IS militants reportedly destroyed remaining bridges in a “desperate act” to delay the government’s advance, according to a U.S-led Coalition spokesperson. The lack of bridges has made Iraq’s plan to liberate Mosul’s western region more challenging.\nIraq's EDRcelebrate their first success in the west mosul campaign, taking Alignatra village. 13 IS killed, four car bombs detonated. pic.twitter.com/wZRDrWhhn1\n— Quentin Sommerville (@sommervillebbc) February 19, 2017\nMosul fell to Islamic State group in June 2014.\nCover: ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": ["https://t.co/wZRDrWhhn1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Iraqi", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mosul-isis-threatens-to-kill-350000-children-trapped-in-city-west-casualties-civilians-iraq-a7553151.html", "https://twitter.com/sommervillebbc/status/833290156492861440", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/19/torture-videos-cast-shadow-over-iraqi-forces-west-mosul-offensive", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39018984", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Firaqi-forces-launch-assault-on-west-mosul-to-take-back-control-from-islamic-state-group", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKBN14R08Q", "https://www.savethechildren.net/article/save-children-statement-launch-offensive-western-mosul", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38442811"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:10:41.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
