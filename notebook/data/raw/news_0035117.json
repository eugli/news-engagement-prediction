I understand that Raj and Sheldon experienced epiphanies, but their progressions fell a little flat for me. Luckily, the last few minutes had an unexpected revelation that made me giggle. \nLet’s start with Raj. We know he’s a spoiled child who doesn’t take care of his own financial needs. When Dr. Koothrappali voices his concern for his son, stating that no woman wants a man who can’t get by without an allowance from daddy, Raj is upset. His father no longer wants to force an arranged marriage? How mean! \nRaj processes this rejection using retail therapy. He buys Halley a brand new crushed velvet baby cape from Gucci. It’s just what she’ll need should she go yodeling in the Alps. Raj explains to his friends that his father has officially given up on him. He surveys the group see if he indeed is a spoiled little rich kid. \nSurvey says? A resounding yes. \nRaj doesn’t pay his rent, his car note, or his credit cards. He doesn’t know what he spends on food because the housekeeper does all the shopping. Let the judging begin! Howard and Leonard assure him that he can live on his salary if he just makes some changes to his budget. Or better yet, he should actually make a budget. \nThe obvious place to start is for Raj to find a cheaper place to live. Option one is to move in with Bernadette and Howard. Stuart already lives there. What’s one more vagabond? Howard puts the kibosh on that idea and offers up option two: Raj can move into Sheldon’s old bedroom. Penny falls on her sword and is quick to let Raj know he is welcome at Hotel Hofstadter any time he wants to stay. Raj politely declines. CRISIS AVERTED! \nThe next time we see Raj, he’s brown bag lunching it in the cafeteria. He’s ditched his dog walker and is ready to live the life of a normal person. We’ll see how long this lasts. \nNEXT: Sheldon and Amy’s first big fight Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:06:14.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
