Investigations have revealed that Pakistan-based counterfeiters have managed to copy most of the security features of the newly introduced Indian notes. IndiaToday.in | Edited by Shashank Shantanu 11 out 17 security features of new notes have been copied by counterfeiters. 2 Pakistani organisations involved in pushing fake notes into the country through Bangladesh border. 3 The RBI had claimed that the new 'high security' notes were hard to fake. \nOn numerous occasions since November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed that his move to ban circulation of old Rs 500, 1,000 has broken the back of terror organisations. The PM has also been highlighting about the security features introduced in the new Rs 500, 2,000 currency notes. \nHowever, the recent seizures of fake notes from Bangladesh border and other parts of the country point out that it took Pakistan-based establishments just two months to copy the 'high security' notes. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) while introducing the new notes had claimed that they were hard to fake. \nThe booming trade in fake Indian currency notes using the porous Indo-Bangla border especially in the Malda-Murshidabad district of West Bengal, was believed to have taken a hit after demonetisation of Rs 500, 1,000 notes. \n11 OUT OF 17 SECURITY FEATURES COPIED \nBut alarm bells rang when counterfeit Rs 2,000 notes, which have replicated nearly 50-60 per cent of the security features, were seized. Security agencies pointed out that Pakistani counterfeiters have managed to copy 11 out of the 17 security features of the new notes. \nAccording to police and security officials, the notes that have been recovered have copied the geometric patterns and the colour scheme both on obverse and the reverse side including watermark, and the exclusive number pattern of the Rs 2000 currency. \nIn genuine currency, there are 13 features on the front side including two for visually impaired and four on the reverse. \nRECENT SEIZURES \nThe central security agencies and police intercepted few consignments of Rs 2,000 notes between December 2016 and January from areas near Malda district. \nOn February 8, West Bengal Police arrested a youth with 40 fake Rs 2,000 currency notes from Murshidabad district, which is termed as the biggest such haul from the porous Indo-Bangla border region post demonetisation. \nAccording to intelligence officials, the trade of fake notes along Indo-Bangla border, under the patronage of terror groups, is considered to be a financial bloodline for terror modules operating in India. \nThe enormity of the illegal trade in Indo-Bangla border can be gauged from the fact that BSF since January 2015 to November 2016 seized fake Indian currency notes with face value of Rs 3,96,72,500 and had apprehended 42 smugglers. \n(With PTI inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:12:53.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
