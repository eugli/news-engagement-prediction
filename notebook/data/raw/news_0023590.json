UN envoy 'alarmed at failed humanitarian access' On Tuesday, a UN spokeswoman said that, despite the fall of the Syrian city of Aleppo to government troops, January was the worst month for humanitarian access to the country in almost one year. Some areas of the country had been starved of humanitarian aid for over three months, spokeswoman Yara Sharif said. \"Out of 21 requests for convoys to access a total of 914,000 people, only one convoy was delivered for 40,000 people,\" she said. \"While all of the formerly besieged neighborhoods of east Aleppo city have now become accessible to humanitarians, reports of unexploded ordinance and other remnants of war continue to hinder access and delivery of assistance to some areas. \"There is a grave concern that since 14 January an estimated 1.8 million people in Aleppo city and rural eastern Aleppo have been cut off from their main source of water, Khafsa, which is under ISIL control,\" she said, using another name for ISIS.
