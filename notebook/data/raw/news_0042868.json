This article contains mild spoilers about The Walking Dead series seven Rick Grimes didnâ€™t notice the weird thing (or things) flying behind him but viewers did (Pictures: AMC) \nWalking Dead fans were left squinting at their TV screens last night, trying to work out what theyâ€™d just seen flying across the sky behind Rick Grimes. \nAfter an epic fight scene with some kind of weird creature, hero Rick was seen catching his breath and grinning in the middle of a junkyard wasteland. \nBut viewers were somewhat distracted by a dark, UFO-looking dot flying up into the sky behind him. @AMCTalkingDead What's behind Rick? UFO? Plane? Bad editing? #TWD pic.twitter.com/SqQbuyeMxB \nâ€” Angel Luis (@bigricanman) February 20, 2017 \nA close-up of the clip, uploaded to Twitter, even appears to show three separate dots flying from the right side of the frame towards Rickâ€™s head. \nWeirdly, Rick and his junkyard pals didnâ€™t notice any of this, leading some viewers to suggest the dots might have been caused by a special effects error. What is that then? (Picture: AMC) \nWell, itâ€™s either a mistake or some kind of tiny parasite has now made its way into Rickâ€™s hair to eat his brain. \nViewers also claimed that earlier in the episode they could see cars driving in the background, which seems unusual for the WD universe. So are we just gunna ignore the ufo on tonights episode of walking dead? +cars driving in the backgroundðŸ™„ðŸ¤”) @hardwick #twd #thewalkingdead pic.twitter.com/EXsBIFwqaD \nThe action in last nightâ€™s episode was brutal by all accounts, and itâ€™s no surprise Rick was smiling at the end. \nHeâ€™d just beaten up a very hostile, undead cutlery draw in trousers. Rick was fighting some kind ofâ€¦ trouser-wearing hedgehog with alopecia? (Picture: AMC) \nElsewhere on the episode, Carol and Daryl were reunited for the first time since Daryl was separated from the group in the first episode. \nThe scenes left viewers ridiculously emotional.
