Search and navigation options Maxthon has several useful features that aim to help you improve navigation. For example, there is an undo button for any tabs that you have accidentally closed, and a search toolbar with eight different search engines, new private window and new session options. Snapshots and external tools Capturing an image, a whole webpage or a region doesn't require installing an add-on (as other web browsers usually do) because now you have a single button called Snap (exports file as PNG, BMP, or JPG). External Tools offer quick launch to any software on the computer, such as Paint or Calculator, and there is a built-in notepad that runs faster than Windows' Notepad, which you can use to write notes, or even scripts and run them in Maxthon. Translation, mouse gestures and other handy features Resource Sniffers features show page history and detects whether a page contains video, audio, images or just plain text (and you can download any of them too), while a translate button redirects you to a specified link for language translation purposes (the default is Google Translate). By pressing F10 you activate split screen for easy navigation between webpages (similar to Total Commander for file managing), and the most fun part about Maxthon probably relies within mouse gestures (for example, by simply dragging a link from any webpage, you can open it in a new tab). Ad blocker, RSS reader and download manager When it comes to security and convenience, Maxthon comes with a built-in Ad Hunter blocks unnecessary ads, images and pages, a Feed Reader ensures that you have all your news at hand, whereas the Download Manager can help you easily access all the items you grabbed. A reliable web browser Maxthon is likely to surprise you with its simplicity and efficiency, especially in this highly competitive market. Furthermore, everything about Maxthon is completely customizable, so you can create your own web browsing experience.
