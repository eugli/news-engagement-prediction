The only way to reach there is by boat. \nThe nearest human inhabitation, Noakhali's Hatia Island, is at least 18 kilometres away. It takes two hours by a trawler to reach there from Hatia. Thengar Char Island is situated in the middle of Hatia and Swandip islands on the Bay of Bengal. Photo: Google Earth Almost half a million Rohingya refugees, including the newly arrived 69,000, are living mainly in Cox’s Bazar in two registered camps and makeshift settlements after fleeing persecution and communal violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State.\nBangladesh officials claim many of these Muslim Rohingyas are involved in criminal activities. \nForeign Minister AH Mahmood Ali said recently that human trafficking and narcotics smuggling networks have emerged in Cox's Bazar region due to the \"vulnerable nature\" of the refugees. \nHe said the relocation would help refugees, including undocumented Myanmar nationals, “to have better access to the humanitarian assistance.” \nAlso read \n'Floods, pirates haunt Rohingya island' \nThe government also sees the refugees as a problem for developing the Cox's Bazar and St Martin's Island as a tourism hub. \nNow Dhaka plans to move them to the uninhabited Thengar Char Island in Noakhali, about 250 km northwest of the border camps in Cox's Bazar. \nAmong the communications between government departments, a report by a Noakhali-based forest department officer, which was sent to his superiors, describe the island 'yet to be suitable for human inhabitation.' \nIn his report, Jamal Uddin Bhuiyan, in charge of the Nalchira Range of Noakhali Coastal Forest, cited four factors -- non-availability of drinking water sources, regular inundation due to high and low tides, poor soil condition and natural calamities -- as major obstacles for human inhabitation. The report by Nalchira Ranger Bhuiyan. Noakahli's Divisional Forest Officer Amir Hossain Chowdhury said they have sent their opinion on relocating Rohingya refugees to their headquarters on the first week of February.\n\"There's no human inhabitation in the island. The major problems are natural calamities, like storms and cyclones, high tide, lack of embankments, proper establishments and drinking water. These issues need to be addressed immediately,\" he told bdnews24.com. \nIt will take 15-20 years for the island to be habitable, but that can be expedited through artificial means, added Chowdhury. \nThe Chief Conservator of Forests says they are ready to take all measures to make the island habitable if the government goes ahead with its plans for relocation. \n“It will be necessary to ensure safe drinking water, build protective embankments and infrastructure, and ensure security. We are prepared to support the project,” top forest department official Mohammad Safiul Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Friday. \nHe, however, could not confirm his office receiving the report sent by the Noakhali Coastal Forest Department.

The government has already tasked the army to set up new camps for Rohingyas in the island, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam has said.\nThe report by Nalchira Ranger Bhuiyan provides details on Thengar Char's situation and recommended Hatia Island’s Ghashiar Char as an alternative. \nBut his superior, Divisional Forest Officer Amir Hossain says it's not a realistic option. \n“We had proposed Ghashiar Char as an alternative, but dropped it later,” he told bdnews24.com. “Because it's too close to the human inhabitation and the same problems in Cox's Bazar would persist.” \nThe forest department now believes Thengar Char is suitable. \n“Thengar Char is quite remote,” said Amir Hossain. “Once the project is complete Rohingyas will be fairly isolated and unable to engage in criminal activities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:46:28.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
