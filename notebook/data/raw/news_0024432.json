He angered China by taking a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, the first involving a US President or President-elect in decades.\nChina sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland, if force by necessary. The US cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979.\nChina's gamble for global supremacy in the Trump era Is Taiwan a bargaining-chip for Trump on China? Chinese Year of the Rooster marked with huge Trump sculpture \"President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China,\" the letter said, according to the White House.\nMr Trump also wished the Chinese people \"a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster\".\nThe Chinese are currently celebrating the Lunar New Year, and the official celebration period will end on Saturday with the Lantern Festival.\nBeijing has yet to respond to his latest letter.\nChina has been angered by Mr Trump's comments on the One China policy concerning Taiwan The conciliatory tone is in stark contrast to previous statements by Mr Trump, whose presidential campaign was marked by anti-China rhetoric that continued after winning the election.\nIn December, before his inauguration, Mr Trump posted a series of tweets criticising China for its exchange rate policy and its operations in the South China Sea.\nHe also questioned the One China policy, which is the diplomatic acknowledgement by the US of Beijing's position that there is only one Chinese government, following his call with Taiwan.\nShortly after he took office on 20 January, his administration vowed to prevent China from taking territory in the South China Sea.\nBeijing has so far responded cautiously, expressing \"serious concern\" about Mr Trump's position on the One China policy, and urging the US to maintain close ties with China.\nIt also lodged a protest over the phone call with Ms Tsai, dismissing it as a \"petty trick\", and maintained it would \"defend its rights\" in the South China Sea.\nBut state media outlets have been less restrained and have issued strongly-worded rebukes, blasting Mr Trump for \"playing with fire\" on the Taiwan issue.\nThey also warned of serious action and a \"resolute battle\" against Mr Trump.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38285354", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38754047", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4022/production/_93581461_7149fb76-8899-4f87-b103-ee9c6ccb9b50.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38282825", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38456410", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38191711", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1070F/production/_94234376_8a7d1a18-913c-47d8-9d18-b0199d0bbd89.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38633257", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38729207", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38167022"], "published": "2017-02-09T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:36:13.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
