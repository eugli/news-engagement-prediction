A glance at the table will tell you as much. \nA further delve will tell you their total of 56 points is the fourth-highest ever at this stage of a Premier League season. Their nine-point lead is the sixth-greatest ever after 23 games. They have been utterly dominant and probably won't be caught by May. \nAnd yet what stands out from this brilliant Chelsea team's statistics for the season is the fact that they don't dominate the Premier League in any particular way. Rather, they have enjoyed success so far, equaling the Premier League record of 13 consecutive wins in a single season, as a result of their being an absolutely devastating sum of their parts. In the main individual statistics they rank mid-table across the board. \nThey don't have tonnes of possession, they don't create a great deal of chances, they don't hit the target particularly often and they aren't the best finishers in the league. There has been barely any stopping Chelsea in recent months Credit: Rex Features \nI ndeed, they rank seventh for possession share, with 53.9 per cent, which is less than each of the five other teams challenging for the title and Southampton. Those same six teams have all created more chances than Chelsea and five of them have had more of what the statisticians at Opta call 'big chances'. Chelsea's total of 39 big chances is only three more than strugglers Crystal Palace and four more than Leicester City and West Ham. \nLiverpool, Everton, Sunderland, Bournemouth and Tottenham have all hit the target with more of their shots. Both Arsenal and Liverpool finish their chances with greater efficacy. Dominant Chelsea? \n11 teams make more tackles than Antonio Conte's side, including five of the six teams that also have more possession than them. That is, the reason they rank poorly for tackles cannot be explained solely by how they dominate the ball. \nT he same can be said for interceptions, where Chelsea rank ninth. \nAnd yet they have the best defensive record in the league, alongside Spurs, with just 16 goals conceded. Chelsea also allow their opponents the fewest shots on target. Without doing too much defending - making many defensive actions - they are incredibly difficult to break down. Chelsea vs Arsenal: We rate the players to one decimal place \nI n the 3-4-3 formation Chelsea switched to after the 3-0 defeat at Arsenal in September , they are brilliantly organised and Conte gets more from his players than many thought possible at the beginning of the season. \nMan for man, he does not have the best squad in the Premier League. Yes, he has some incredibly talented players in Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and N'Golo Kante in particular but, on paper, most Chelsea fans would agree that improvements could be made in several positions. \nVictor Moses and Marcos Alonso have both been outstanding this season, but Conte will see the wing-back positions as an area to strengthen this summer . Moses is not a natural wing-back and Alonso was a late signing in September that could surely be improved upon.
