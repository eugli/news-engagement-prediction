Today was High-Five Friday at Ryan Rd School! We all had a great time! Happy Friday everyone! #highfivefriday pic.twitter.com/cT7MKY9yYc \n— Northampton Police (@NorthamptonPD) December 16, 2016 Today we started \"High-5 Friday\". Leeds School hosted week 1.

When police Chief Kasper attended a meeting with the public about the program, they expressed their concerns. \nThe police described what happened on their Facebook post. \nAbout 12-15 people attended the meeting. Concerns were shared that some kids might respond negatively to a group of uniformed officers at their school. People were specifically concerned about kids of color, undocumented children, or any children who may have had negative experiences with the police. After the meeting, Chief Kasper and Superintendent Provost spoke and decided to stop the High Five Friday, but they remain committed to exploring alternative programs. \nAnd just like that, the program was cancelled. \n“It’s very important to take care of the kids’ emotions and be sensitive towards it. But I think that maybe stopping it abruptly maybe wasn’t the best way to go forward,” said Liza Maharjan of Northampton. \nThe program lasted only two months, but the police say they will continue to explore other ways that police and kids can interact positively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:12:33.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
