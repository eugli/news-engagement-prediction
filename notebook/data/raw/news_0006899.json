Read more Russian boxer Povetkin tests positive, fight with Canadian Stiverne cancelled – WBC \nIt was originally intended that the results be disclosed on January 6, but this date was moved by the World Boxing Council (WBC) to Tuesday. \nFollowing the disclosure in LA, Andrey Ryabinsky, head of the World of Boxing promotional company which handles Povetkin, stressed the need to conduct independent tests. \nThose tests were conducted in an independent laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland. Ryabinsky contested that, while the samples given in LA tested positive, the independent results proved otherwise. \n“An American laboratory confirmed ostarine was found in Povetkin’s ‘B’ sample. The tests given in an independent laboratory in Lausanne [Switzerland] are clean,” Ryabinsky claimed in a tweet . \nHe added that the concentration of the banned performance enhancing drug was “minimal.” \nWorld of Boxing later claimed that just Povetkin’s December 6 sample contained just 0. 1 g of ostarine and that samples given on November 15 and December 13 showed no traces of doping. Povetkin’s sample (Dec.6) has only 0, 1g of Ostarine! Nov.15 & Dec.13 samples are clean @Ryabinskiy @WBCBoxing @boxingscene — World of Boxing Rus (@worldofbox) December 23, 2016 \nThe tests relate to Povetkin testing positive for ostarine in the lead up to his proposed bout with Canadian Bermane Stiverne on December 6, 2016, for the WBC international heavyweight title in Ekaterinburg.
