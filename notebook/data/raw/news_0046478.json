External Link: James Brown Funky Drummer \nRolling Stone magazine said it was sampled on over 1,000 songs and served as the backbeat for countless hip-hop tracks, including Public Enemy's Fight the Power, Dr Dre's Let Me Ride, LL Cool J's Mama Said Knock You Out and Run-DMC's Run's House. \nIt even turned up on Ed Sheeran's Shirtsleeves and George Michael's Freedom '90,the magazine said. \nHannon said Stubblefield saw \"very little\" in royalties and never expected them. \nBut Stubblefield was held in high esteem by his fellow musicians. \nWhen Prince got wind in 2000 that Stubblefield was deep in debt from a fight against bladder cancer, he personally paid $90,000 to cover his bills, she said. \n\"Clyde was considered his favourite drummer,\" she added. \nStubblefield was \"a very nice southern gentleman\" from Chattanooga, Tennessee, but had lived in Madison, his wife's hometown, since the early 1970s, she said. \nHe had long been a fixture on the local music scene. \n\"He played here one time with James Brown and just fell in love with it,\" she said.
