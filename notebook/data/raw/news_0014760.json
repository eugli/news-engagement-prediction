AVOIDING THE WWE \nSpeaking to Guide Live , the former Intercontinental Champion revealed watching WWE makes him mad, so he now avoids it. \nHe said: “I mean, unless somebody asks me specifically to watch – a lot of my buddies, we’re in one massive group text so there’s a lot of griping and chatting about gossip. \n“[It] feels like I’m still in the locker room half the time, and I miss that – but right now, it’s not really for me. \n“It wasn’t really for me the last few years I was there. Not that I don’t love WWE. I had such fun there, I met my wife there. \n“Just the product being PG and being so watered down with such super talented guys on it, it almost makes me mad to watch it. So, I avoid.” \nRhodes might be right on the money with his comments, but fans will be quick to remind him the only reason he’s in the position to make those comments is because of the WWE’s belief in him at one point. \nWhat do you make of Cody Rhodes’ comments on why he doesn’t watch WWE programming?
