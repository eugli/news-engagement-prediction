And this version features plenty of both of those teams, including Patriots quarterback Tom Brady accusing his teammates of stealing nickels from his locker. \nWho knew Ben Roethlisberger was such a good singer? \nIf you’re looking for a little break from the media hoopla leading up to the big game, then you can check out the 2014 , 2015 and 2016 editions of NFL “Bad Lip Reading,” too. \nThumbnail photo via Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:22:46.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
