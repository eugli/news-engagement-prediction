PUBLISHED: 00:06, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 00:27, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 GETTY Eurocrats are set to allow nation states to impose border checks \nIt comes as mainland European nations have been targeted in a spate of terror attacks over the course of the past 18 months. Some of the deadliest attacks happened in major cities across the EU, notably Paris, Berlin and Nice. \nThe proposals, brought forward by Germany and France , come as both countries face crucial general elections later this year which could shape the future of the EU.

GETTY France has been a major victim of terror attacks in the past 18 months \nUnder the current Schengen regulations, EU nations are only allowed to reimpose national border checks for no longer than two years in the face of what is deemed a serious security concern. \nFrance has been allowed to reestablish border checks until mid-July after a series of deadly terror attacks throughout the country. \nBerlin has also announced plans to impose temporary border controls due to the Christmas market attack which left 12 dead and more than 50 others injured. \nThe letter also pleads for closer cooperation and data sharing between EU states to track suspected terror targets who have abused the Schengen agreement and moved between European states.
