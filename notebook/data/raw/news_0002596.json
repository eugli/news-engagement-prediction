Monday night. Photo: USGS Image 3 of 11 Earthquake magnitudes measure the energy released by a tremor, but are not meant to calculate how intense the shaking is for those near the epicenter. To measure how forceful a quake felt to someone or something near the epicenter, geologists use something called the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. The following slides explain what it means when you see a roman numeral representing intensity on USGS readings and color-coded intensity maps.
