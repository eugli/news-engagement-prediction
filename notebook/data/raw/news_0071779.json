McAllister's abiding memory of Liverpool's Uefa Cup win is a sex toy \nThe former France international teamed up with the likes of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs during his time in Manchester, winning four league titles and two FA Cups in the process. \nHowever, when asked to name the best player he ever played alongside, Cantona harked back to his days in Yorkshire and chose McAllister, who turned out for two of United’s fiercest rivals. \nMcAllister stayed on at Leeds for four further years following Cantona’s departure, eventually leaving for Coventry City in 1996. \nThe Scottish midfielder left Highfield Road upon Coventry's relegation from the Premier League in 2000 and, at the age of 35, signed for Gerard Houllier’s Liverpool on a free transfer. \nMcAllister then enjoyed a brief but successful spell at Anfield, scoring key goals in the 2001 ‘treble’ of League, FA and UEFA Cups.
