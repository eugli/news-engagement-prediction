Queensland scientists performed computer simulations \nThe researchers, led by Dr Bulent Kiziltan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the United States, relied on computer simulations by the Queensland scientists to look for clues in space. \n\"An intermediate-mass black hole at the cluster's centre acts like a cosmic 'spoon' that stirs the pot, causing the stars near it to slingshot to higher speeds and greater distances, imparting a subtle signal that astronomers can measure,\" Dr Baumgardt said. \nBy employing simulations of stellar motions and distances, and comparing them with visible-light observations, the team found evidence for just this sort of gravitational stirring. \nHe said the second line of evidence came from pulsars, compact remnants of dead stars with radio signals that were easily detectable. \n\"These objects were also flung about due to the gravitational influence of the central intermediate-mass black hole, causing them to be found at greater distances from the cluster's centre than would be expected if no black hole existed,\" Dr Baumgardt said. Black hole hid in 12-billion-year-old star cluster \nThe discovery was announced today in the journal Nature, revealing the black hole hid at the centre of the 12-billion-year-old globular 47 Tucanae star cluster. \nIt is 13,000 light years from Earth in the southern constellation of Tucana the Toucan.

(Getty Images: Space Frontiers) \nIt contains 3 million stars and holds about two dozen pulsars that are important targets of this investigation. \nIn their paper, the researchers said 47 Tucanae had been examined previously for a central black hole, without success. \nDr Kiziltan said in most cases, a black hole was found by looking for X-rays emanating from a hot disk of material swirling around the black hole. Are black holes portals to other worlds or monsters gobbling up everything in sight? Here are some common myths that you'll never be sucked into again. \nThis method only worked if the black hole was actively feeding on nearby gas. \n\"The centre of 47 Tucanae is gas-free, effectively starving any black hole that might lurk there,\" Dr Kiziltan said. \n\"A supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way gives clues to its presence by its influence on nearby stars. \n\"Years of infrared observations have shown a handful of stars at our galactic centre whipping around an invisible object with a strong gravitational tug. \n\"But the crowded centre of 47 Tucanae makes it impossible to watch the motions of individual stars.\" \nThis was why the hunt for the \"missing link\" across the cosmos was so challenging, he said. Life in the universe remains a mystery \nHowever, the discovery would not help find out more about life in space, Dr Baumgardt said. \n\"What we have found is not telling us anything about life in the universe, because a black hole is a place where there should be no life, but it tells us something about the evolution of galaxies on a large scale,\" Dr Baumgardt said. \n\"Anything which comes too close to the black hole will basically fall into the black hole and have no chance of ever getting out again.\" \nThe researchers said their discovery would help them unlock the link between the smaller mass black holes and super ones that could be found in the centre of galaxies. \n\"Of course we got very excited because we've been looking for black holes for a very long time,\" Dr Baumgardt said. \n\"We are already working on a second cluster to find a second 'middleweight' black hole.\" \nResearchers said the fact this black hole had eluded detection for so long suggested black holes of similar masses could be hiding in other globular clusters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:04:54.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
