Korean official has diplomatic immunity \nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will have to ask North Korea to lift the diplomatic immunity on Second Secretary Hyon Kwang Song before the latter can be called in by the police. \nDiplomatic officials said that until the North Korean regime complies, no action can be taken by the police, as the rules governing the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 states. \nThey said the Convention protected all diplomatic grade officers from prosecution under civil and criminal laws. \nSuch officers are those listed as Third, Second and First secretaries, counsellor, minister counsellor and finally the top post of ambassador, in a diplomatic mission. \nDefence and trade attaches posted to a particular mission were also considered diplomats and enjoy immunity. \nHowever, staff members such as clerks, helpers and drivers were not covered. \nA senior diplomat said the regime was unlikely to cooperate with Malaysia. \nHe said there were several courses of action open to Malaysia. \n“One will be to declare Hyon as persona non-grata (PNG) and expel him from Malaysia. \n“But this will not help with investigations,” the official said. \nThe official said if relations worsened, Malaysia could cut off ties with North Korea and order its ambassador and all diplomats out within 24 hours. \n“If they do not comply with this order, then the police can step in,” he said. \nThe official said other than the ambassador or high commissioner whose posting is first vetted by the host country, all other diplomatic officials are sent in without background checks. \nHe said such officials could only be ordered out later on if they were suspected to be involved in activities detrimental to the host country. \n“So in the case of Hyon, he would have come in without any background vetting by Malaysia,” the official added. \nFormer Bar Council chairman Datuk Param Cumaraswamy said diplomatic immunity was not personal to a diplomat, but an immunity of the state. \nHe said that if the country concerned did not consent to waiving the immunity, there was nothing the host country could do. \nThe former UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers said it would then be safe for the host country to declare the diplomat PNG and the sender country would have to recall the diplomat. \n“That is the provision under the Vienna Convention. \n“Generally, all those from a foreign country working at the embassy would be covered under the convention,” he added. \nBar Council Human Rights Committee co-chairman Andrew Khoo said Hyon, as the Second Secretary, was covered by diplomatic immunity. \n“The only thing the Government can do is to expel him from Malaysia. \n“There are no avenues to compel him to cooperate, not without breaking international laws,” he added. \nSenior lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said that diplomatic immunity depended on the category of the official concerned. \n“He can be a diplomatic (grade) officer, but that does not mean immunity can be extended to him. \n“The host and sender countries must agree on who is to be recognised (to enjoy such immunity),” he said when contacted.
