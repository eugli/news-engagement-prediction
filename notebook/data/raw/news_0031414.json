Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSlumped on the desk with her messy dull hair covering her eyes, Karen Matthews looks defeated as she bombarded by questions over daughter Shannon. \nThe game was up - and Karen, who had gone from worried mum to an arrested suspect, knew it. \nGrainy footage, which BBC bosses used as a basis for latest drama The Moorside, paints a disturbing picture of the mum-of-seven - who easily admits she lied to police, her family and the nation. \nHer arrest was a crushing blow to the Dewsbury community who worked tirelessly to search for nine-year-old Shannon in 2008. Karen Matthews interview with the police Karen Matthews interview with the police \nAnd, in chilling interviews Karen shows complete disregard for daughter's welfare, looking more sorry for herself. \nWhen she is asked \"What did you hope to achieve [from the plot]\" bleary-eyed Karen fails to understand the meaning of the sentence. She admits, in a slurry voice, that she couldn't tell police where Shannon was because \"everyone would have a go\" at her.

A list of rules, presumably written by Micheal Donovan give some clue as to what Shannon did to occupy herself during those long 24 days.

You must not make any noise or bang your feet \n\"You must not go near the windows. You must not get anything or do anything without me been here (sic).

You can play the Super Mario games and you can play some DVDs and you can play the CD music.\" \nIt is signed off with the initials I.P.U - which is thought to stand for 'I promise you' - a threat Karen used against Shannon. \nAnd, here is the dingy sparsely furnished room in the top floor flat rented by her stepdad's uncle - where Shannon was kept, after being lured away from safety by Donovan, who told the innocent girl she was going to the seaside.

(Photo: PA) Officers strip Donovan's flat bare after the discovery of Shannon (Photo: PA) \nBut a handful of clues in these pictures of the room show how she may have occupied herself as the massive search went on around her. \nAn electronic keyboard and, bizarrely, a glue gun lie on top of a metal framed double bunk. \nUnderneath there is a CD by Busted, one of Shannon's favourite bands, and a leaflet giving details of a range of Sold Out action PC games. \nNear a smoke alarm case there is a copy of Arrive Alive, a colourful highway code book for youngsters.
