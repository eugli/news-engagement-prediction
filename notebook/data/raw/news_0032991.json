Controversial pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli used a speaking appearance at UMass Boston on Thursday to defend the high cost of some rare disease treatments, including a drug developed by Cambridge-based Biogen. The talk came one day after Shkreli gave a similar address at Harvard University. Both appearances were organized by student groups, not the universities. And both sparked protests by dozens of students who objected to Shkreli’s decision in 2015 to raise the price of a life-saving drug more than fiftyfold. He was later indicted on unrelated securities fraud charges and is now out on bail. Enlarge Shkreli speaks at an event on UMass Boston's campus on Thursday, Feb. 16. During Thursday’s event, Shkreli verbally sparred with some attendees over his company’s decision to buy Daraprim, a treatment for a parasitic infection, and raise the price from $13.50 per pill to $750. One protester was escorted from the auditorium by campus security after shouting an obscenity at Shkreli and calling him a “murderer.” For the most part, though, the largely male audience appeared supportive of Shkreli — an avid social media user who earned the nickname “pharma bro” and was recently kicked off Twitter for allegedly harassing a female reporter. Shkreli argued Thursday that many large pharmaceutical companies charge even higher prices for rare disease drugs than Daraprim without drawing much public condemnation. He said that companies that develop truly groundbreaking novel drugs should be “rewarded richly.” Shkreli singled out Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) for its recently-approved rare disease treatment Spinraza, which costs $750,000 for the first year of use. “That’s what the drug industry is all about,” he said. Shkreli also lamented his public image as a corporate villain in the wake of the Daraprim controversy. “You see it on the news and say, ‘Yeah, that guy sucks. I want to slap that guy in the face,’” Shkreli said. “Spend 15 years studying chemistry and making medicines and then let me know that you have moral superiority over me.” In January, a speaking event featuring Shkreli and right-wing editor Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California at Davis was canceled amid angry protests, sparking a debate over free speech. Thursday’s event was organized by a UMass Boston chapter of the libertarian organization Young Americans for Liberty. Its treasurer, Marcelo Guadiana , said in an interview prior to the talk that the group did not endorse Shkreli, but hoped that his appearance would encourage “political debate” on campus. He added that Shkreli was not paid for the speech. “When we saw he was coming to Harvard, we figured he could maybe come to UMass as well,” Guadiana said.
