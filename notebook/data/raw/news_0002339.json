I'm concerned criminal law is properly used, not to stop people swearing at each other. 'To call someone a pussy is impolite. It's not an offence. It's unpleasant but not a criminal act. 'If that's the case there's an awful lot of criminals about.' Prosecutor Christopher Lester said Mr Smalley, from Hereford, had previously been declared bankrupt when he owed Nigel Jones £10,000. He was only able to pay back £2,000 and Mr Jones mentioned the matter to Czachowska, who worked for him assembling kitchen units. The case went before a judge at Worcester Crown Court who was shocked prosecutors were bringing cases about people swearing at each other She was shown a picture of Mr Smalley on Facebook, found his number on the page and took responsibility for collecting the debt. Mr Lester said: 'Mr Smalley was very distressed by that, saying he was bankrupt and there was nothing he could do.' The defendant also telephoned again, speaking this time to the complainant's wife who told her they had nothing and were still dealing with the bankruptcy. Mr Lester added: 'The defendant then phoned and left an answering machine message on the phone. 'It effectively said Mr Smalley was allowing his family to deal with these things for him.' The judge declined to grant a restraining order against the defendant in respect of Mr and Mrs Smalley and made no order for costs.
