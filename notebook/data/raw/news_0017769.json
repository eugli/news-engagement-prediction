Good, because we’ve got big news: Apparently, Harry Styles will soon be blessing us with his solo album. \nFor those of you who have maintained consciousness, here are the details. Columbia Records CEO Rob Stringer chatted with Billboard about Styles’ first solo venture, and he couldn’t have been more positive about the album. \n“We’re close and we’re very excited,” Stringer told Billboard. “We have a record we’re incredibly excited about and it’s not far away from being ready.” \nStringer added that he has high hopes for Styles’ solo career. \n“We obviously want everything to be beautifully done, because we think he’s here to stay,” Stringer said. “Harry has stepped up with the vision of someone who’s authentic.” \nStringer did not reveal an exact timeline for the album, but it sounds like Styles’ music will be here sooner rather than later. We can’t wait to dance all night to the best album ever.
