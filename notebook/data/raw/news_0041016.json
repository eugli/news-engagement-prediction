Remember 2014? A simpler, happier time when Barack Obama was still president, the EU referendum hadn’t happened, and we were all wildly obsessed with a very attractive felon named Jeremy Meeks? Kanye gave hijabi model Halima Aden her runway debut at his Yeezy Season 5 show \nJeremy Meeks, in case you don’t recall, is a man who was arrested for possession of a firearm back in 2014. \nHe posed for a mugshot. That mugshot was posted on the Stockon Police Department’s Facebook. That mugshot was widely considered very, very attractive, and so Jeremy quickly became known as ‘hot mugshot guy’. (Picture: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images) \nSure, it’s not quite as catchy as #SaltBae, but we were young then. We hadn’t learned. \nOnce he got out of prison, Jeremy landed himself a modelling deal . Because fashion and attraction don’t care about things like ‘laws’ or ‘bad behaviour’. They just care about Jeremy’s piercing eyes. \nAnd now Jeremy has officially made it. He’s just walked the runway at New York Fashion Week, so is officially a legit model rather than just some guy on Instagram people perve over. (Picture: Albert Urso/Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows) \nJeremy was picked to walk for Philipp Plein’s AW17 show, modelling a glorious black puffa jacket. (Picture: Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/FilmMagic) \nHe also walked the catwalk shirtless while wearing a jazzy hat, because why the heck not. \nIt’s the first time Jeremy has walked the runway since he landed a modelling deal, but it looks like he’s firmly in the midst of becoming a proper fashion person. (Picture: Getty) \nA few days ago he posed with Carine Roitfeld. Plus he has more than 792,000 followers an Instagram, which is very important. A post shared by JEREMY MEEKS (@jmeeksofficial) on Feb 12, 2017 at 2:01pm PST \nWhile it’s not the first time someone with a criminal record has appeared at NYFW (*cough* Naomi Campbell), it is the first time someone’s managed to land a prime fashion week job from a mugshot. So congrats, Jeremy. \nIt also signals a shift in the way we scout models and fashion influencers. (Picture: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows) \nMuch in the same way that the new ‘supermodel’ is a celeb meets model with millions of Instagram followers, it’s pretty likely that we’ll keep seeing more viral internet types walking the runway. \n#SaltBae, we’ll see you at Preen next season.
