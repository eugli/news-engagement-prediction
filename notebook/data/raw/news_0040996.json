He is worse than the bubonic plague: not only is he a curse to our party but he is also an affliction to our nation,” Mr. Fani-Kayode said. “I stand with Ahmed Makarfi and our Caretaker Committee.” \nMr. Fani-Kayode slammed Mr. Sheriff for “insulting” PDP governors who championed his emergence as chairman despite the warnings he issued against such move at the time. \n“I read his insulting comments about [Governor Ayo] Fayose and [Governor Nyesom] Wike and I laughed. Are these not the very same people that brought him in the first place and convinced others in the PDP Governor’s Forum to support him?” \nMr. Sheriff’s spokesman, Inuwa Bwala, declined comments Sunday evening. \nBut Wale Oladipo, the national secretary of the Ali Sheriff-led PDP, dismissed Mr. Fani-Kayode’s attacks as “merely his opinion.” \nMr. Oladipo also pushed back against allegations that his faction is working for the APC. \n“How can we be working for the APC?” Mr. Oladipo queried. “When we were in government for many years, did opposition work for us?” \nMr. Sheriff’s victory at the appellate court was seen by some in the crisis-plagued major opposition party as a major boost for his legitimacy. \nBen Murray-Bruce, a PDP senator from Bayelsa State, urged all stakeholders in the party to rally behind Mr. Sheriff or risk sending the party into oblivion. \n“I am supporting Ali Modu Sheriff because it is the only way to preserve the party,” Mr. Murray-Bruce said. \n“We will work with Ali Modu Sheriff and go to a convention. \n“Right now, PDP is on a course towards destruction and abiding by the judgement of the court is the only thing that can save us,” he added.
