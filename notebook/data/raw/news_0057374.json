On the film side, her credits include Ghost, A Few Good Men, The Joneses, My Best Friend's Girl and Indecent Proposal . She's repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment. \nMoore joins a rapidly growing roster of Empire guest stars for the third season of Empire . They include Eva Longoria, Taye Diggs, Phylicia Rashad, Nia Long and Moore's daughter, Rumer Willis . \nMoore's casting comes as co-creator Lee Daniels recently confirmed to THR that there will be an Empire spinoff. \"We're in talks,\" Daniels told THR in January. \"We're finally figuring it out. It takes a minute, you know? We just really had to build the foundation of Empire, so we then try to figure out what that B-chorus is. It looks like it's going to happen.\" Pressed for details, Daniels remained mum on whether the spinoff could be for this current pilot season or if it would be a planted episode that serves as a back-door pilot. \nAlso unclear is the firm premise, though there had been talk in August 2015 that a spinoff could serve as a prequel revolving around Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie. \"It could be,\" Daniels told THR about a prequel series. \"We really are in deep talks about it, and we're having all these ideas thrown around to figure it out. But I can officially say that we will be having a spinoff.\" Lesley Goldberg ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:24:44.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
