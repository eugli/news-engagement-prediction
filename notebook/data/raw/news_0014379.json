Share via Twitter Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Rebecca Minkoff It's been a whirlwind 2017 for mother-to-be Lauren Conrad . After kicking off the new year with an adorable pregnancy announcement on Instagram, the former star of The Hills has embraced motherhood with open arms. Between swooning over the photo of her beautiful belly and obsessing over her list of possible names for her new bundle of joy, we're almost more excited about this pregnancy than LC is. The 31-year-old gave fans another look at her growing tummy on Saturday, stepping out for Rebecca Minkoff’s Spring 2017 \"See Now, Buy Now\" fashion show at the Grove in Los Angeles. The star looked glowing in a white off-the-shoulder lace frock that showed off hints of her baby bump. But don't go thinking that the dress's billowy silhouette means that Conrad has traded in the chic contents of her closet for a new wardrobe of maternity pieces. Instead, the always stylish LC is still trying to find creative ways to make classic pieces work for her changing figure. \"Anything I can fit into from my everyday wardrobe I am still wearing,\" she told People on the red carpet. \"I haven’t had to purchase many maternity pieces.\" When it comes to dressing for two, Conrad says she prefers cozier knits and layered pieces, like the outfit she wore when she first revealed her baby bump back in early January. \"My go-to look at the moment is a knit dress and one of the long cardigans from my Kohl’s line,\" she said at the event. To get a better glimpse at Lauren Conrad's burgeoning baby bump and the breezy look she rocked at the fashion show, take a look at the photos below.
