The breakdown released by the Commons authorities shows that last year: Mr Bercow hosted a dinner for the Israeli Speaker in March which cost £3,950 plus a £70 'service charge'. An outside caterer was drafted for the event because the heavily-subsidised in-house restaurants 'do not provide kosher food and drink'. A spokeswoman said 'around 30 people' attended. A lunch with Cardinal Charles Bo, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Yangon, in June was £2,400. Lunch with the Italian Speaker in March left a bill for £1,536, while dining with the German Speaker the same month was £1,275. The taxpayer picked up the bill for £175 for wine at a dinner for the Panel of Chairs - a group of around 40 MPs appointed by Mr Bercow and paid £15,000 a year to assist him with parliamentary duties. His spokeswoman said the payment was 'in line with long established practice'. By contrast Mr Bercow lavished just £107 on a 'sandwich lunch' for the Salvation Army choir after they performed carols in parliament in December. The Speaker's spokeswoman said it was 'an informal rather than official occasion'. A Sky TV subscription for the sport-loving Speaker at his grace-and-favour residence has been costing around £109 a month. A spokeswoman confirmed that the deal included Sky Sports. Mr Bercow, a keen tennis player and Arsenal fan, has accepted thousands of pounds' worth of free tickets and hospitality at sporting events over the years. It is far from the first time Mr Bercow has found himself in trouble over his use of public funds. MailOnline reveal previously that he had purchased a new morning suit for £1,060, just a few years after he bought one for £3,200. In 2015 he pledged to rein in his use of official cars last year after an FOI request revealed his travel to an event less than a mile from parliament had cost £172. In February it emerged he had charged the taxpayer almost £2,000 for hand finished beeswax candles, and bought postcard pictures of himself to send to fans. A lunch with A lunch with Cardinal Charles Bo, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Yangon in Burma, was £2,400 in June Keen tennis player and Arsenal fan Mr Bercow, pictured with wife Sally at last year's Wimbledon, has accepted thousands of pounds' worth of free tickets and hospitality at sporting events over the years More than £100,000 was splurged on wining and dining other MPs and visiting foreign politicians - including just one meal with then Australian Speaker Bronwyn Bishop in May 2014 which cost £1,954. A 'standing down' dinner for Mr Bercow's deputy Dawn Primarolo was £2,057 in April 2015. He blew £20,000 on a trip to Japan for a conference last summer - a year after he made another £10,000 visit to the country. A trip to Burma in October came in at £6,500. The latest disclosure shows that Mr Bercow's official account was used to fund three 'retirement' parties for senior staff last year. Commons Human Resources Director Andrew Walker and Facilities Director John Borley both left their £125,000-a-year jobs in September. The Speaker recently use public funds to purchase a £1,000 morning suit. A few years ago he bought another one for £3,200 Despite the events in the opulent state rooms being described as marking their 'retirement', the House accounts say they each received 'compensation' of £95,000. The third send-off was for the Speaker's Counsel, Michael Carpenter. The parties cost £2,000, £1,700 and £1,600 - a total of £5,300. Some £287 was spent drafting in a photographer to take a picture of Mr Bercow and senior officials before the state opening last May, and getting prints made up. SPEAKER'S OPULENT RESIDENCE FUNDED BY THE TAXPAYER Speaker's House, which contains Mr Bercow's official residence John Bercow has lived in the grace-and-favour residence in Speaker's House with wife Sally and their three children since 2009. Whereas the PM pays a tax charge for her apartment in Downing St, Mr Bercow is not thought to contribute a penny in rent or running costs. Soon after they moved in the Bercows ordered a refurbishment of the residence that cost some £20,000. They were also allowed to move a nanny into a self-contained flat on the estate - raising questions about whether the taxpayer was subsidising the family's childcare. His spokeswoman said such photos had 'always been taken at the State Opening of Parliament'. A spokeswoman for the Speaker said: 'The Speaker fulfils all the obligations expected of both him and his predecessors, and has added to these obligations an extensive outreach and civic engagement element to the role. 'In spite of the fact that his responsibilities and commitments have increased as a result, the Speaker’s Office costs nearly 25 percent less to run than it did when he was elected in 2009.' On the cost of of Mr Bercow's meals with counterparts and Cardinal Bo, the spokeswoman said: 'The Speaker has traditionally been expected to host official lunches, dinners and teas for visiting dignitaries. 'The costs of such occasions, which can comprise of up to forty guests, are met out of the Speaker’s Office budget, in line with long-established practice.' Mr Shelbrooke said: 'MPs cannot claim for Sky Sports. 'He likes to stand in the chamber and say we should reflect on how we look to the outside public. 'He needs to look at what he is doing and how that is perceived by the public. 'If that is what you are saying then that is how you have to behave. 'The problem is that as soon as people find out that the Speaker is doing it they think we are all doing it.'
