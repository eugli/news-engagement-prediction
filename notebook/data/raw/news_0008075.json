The daily clusterfuck of governmental shock and awe since Trump&apos;s inauguration has history buffs revisiting the authoritarian right-wing system for some insight on what to expect in the years ahead, making this now-viral poster a handy guide for the resistance:\nIn the US Holocaust Museum.\nI&apos;m shook. pic.twitter.com/EeuHEXWusE \n— Sarah Rose (@RaRaVibes) January 30, 2017 Related Today Is Your Last Chance to Sign Up For Obamacare Trump Fires Acting Attorney General After She Refuses To Defend His 'Muslim Ban' (UPDATED) Trump's Press Secretary Used the Quebec Shooting to Justify His Travel Ban The poster was originally created by Laurence W. Britt back in 2003 and is not exclusive to the Holocaust Museum, the Daily Dot reported Monday. In fact, you can easily buy one for you and every member of your extended social circle with a quick Googling. And while the poster is billed as an abridged list of fascism&apos;s \"warning signs,\" many have already started drawing immediate parallels with the current White House administration&apos;s rise to power:\n@RaRaVibes There are two things he has left to do. It&apos;s time for us to rise up and #resist #oppose and #impeach this monster. pic.twitter.com/K24exMyHC6 \n— ❄️Eboneezer Goode❄️ (@EbonGoode) January 30, 2017 But before we dive much deeper, let&apos;s hit up our pals at Merriam-Webster for a proper definition of \"fascism\" to ensure we&apos;re all on the same page:\n\"a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition\"\nSo which of these warning signs, arguably, have already popped up in 2017 America? Let&apos;s dive into a few obvious front-runners:\nNationalism The chaos of Trump&apos;s Muslim travel ban this weekend showed, among other things, this ideology at play. White nationalist writers for publications not worth naming here said they were \"ecstatic\" and felt like \"crying\" about the executive order, Salon reported Monday.\nDisdain for Human Rights Trump was declared a direct threat to human rights earlier this month by Human Rights Watch. In a 687-page report cited by the Hill , Trump&apos;s election was pinpointed as the moment the \"postwar human rights system\" was put at risk. \"Trump and various politicians in Europe seek power through appeals to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and nativism,\" the report states. \nSupremacy of the Military This tweet certainly hits that note: \nIf Chicago doesn&apos;t fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 Rampant Sexism Where do we begin? From \"grab &apos;em by the pussy\" to his extended public feud with Megyn Kelly , Trump—despite his claims of having more respect for women than anyone else in the world—possesses no such thing.\nCorruption Um... \nActually, fuck it. This whole list of warning signs has (at least) been hinted at during both the campaign and the new administration&apos;s first two weeks in office. So study up and start calling bullshitters on their bullshit. \nTags: News , Donald Trump , Government , Viral , opinion , Holocaust , Election 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:51:25.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
