SUPPLIED \nClinton Thinn could face the death penalty if found guilty of first degree murder in California. \nHe is charged with attempted robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, carrying a loaded firearm and murder in the first degree. \nREAD MORE: \nThinn has not entered a plea and is not eligible for bail. SUPPLIED \nA friend of Clinton Thinn said he had gone to the United States about a month before his arrest to travel. \nIf Thinn is convicted of first degree murder, he is facing a minimum sentence of 25 years' jail or even death. \nThe spokeswoman could not confirm what the murder charge related to, but a media report regarding the attempted robbery said no-one was injured and a friend of Thinn said the murder charge came after a later incident in the US jail he is being held in. \nThe media report of the bank robbery noted the offender entered a Chula Vista bank with an orange flare gun and hammer, fired two shots and used the hammer to try to shatter a bullet-proof partition that six workers were hiding behind. \nPolice arrived and released a police dog, but it was called back after the offender put his hands in the air. Ad Feedback \nA second report from NBC San Diego said Thinn used rope to tie the bank doors shut from the inside. \nWhen a teller refused to hand over money he confronted a security guard and fired a round from his flare gun toward the guard. \nThinn's friend Chris Sims said the pair had been close since they were about 18. \nIn May Thinn had left for the United States to travel and would regularly call Sims via Facebook to chat about his adventures. \nBut when those calls stopped Sims became worried and after searching on the internet found the news article about the attempted bank robbery. \nAfter calling the California prison system he was shocked to be told Thinn was also facing a further charge of first degree murder, which he says he was told was related to an incident that happened at the prison. \nThe alleged crimes were completely out of character for Thinn, who was just a \"Grammar boy from Parnell\". \n\"I'm just afraid he's going to be in prison for the rest of his life, on death row. \n\"I can't really believe it, I may never see Clinton again.\" \nA Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokeswoman said they were aware of Thinn's detention and had provided consular advice to him regarding the robbery allegations. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:02:51.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
