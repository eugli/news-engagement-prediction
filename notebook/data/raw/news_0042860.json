She said this was the first such resolution an Indiana city has passed and advocates hope to convince more communities to sign on. She said Indianapolis is considering a similar resolution. \nSix local students involved with the two groups   resolution. They pointed out 97 percent of climate scientists agree human activity is worsening climate change, a fact that also is noted on NASA's web page . \nMiranda Frausto, 17, a senior at Carmel High School, said now is the time to act. She realizes Carmel is only one community, but hopes others follow suit. \n\"We are kind of ignoring everything that is going on with climate change,\" she said, \"and we as the youth who are going to be affected by this when we are older need to take action for our futures.\" \nJodh Pullela, 14, a freshman at Carmel High School, noted climate scientists believe problems such as flooding, migrations, energy and food shortages will worsen if climate change is left unchecked. \n\"I don't want to experience any of that in my lifetime,\" he said. \nMayor Jim Brainard has long been an advocate of fighting climate change. In 2013, Brainard was named to a task force on climate change created by President Barack Obama. In December 2015, he took a trip on behalf of the U.S. Department of State to India and Germany to discuss ways to build sustainable cities. \nBrainard said the resolution will help the city continue along its current policies. He has a four-page list of ways the city strives for energy efficiency, including everything from purchasing hybrid and bio-fuel vehicles, planting trees, to requiring developers to create storm water pollution prevention plans to, of course, keeping traffic moving by building roundabouts instead of traffic signals. \nMore Carmel news: Carmel prepares for 96th Street construction Council approves ordinance targeting clerk treasurer \nThe Council unanimously approved an ordinance to transfer responsibilities for the city's comprehensive annual financial report, plus $106,500 in related expenses, from Clerk-Treasurer Christine Pauley's office to Brainard's office. \nCouncil members have been unhappy with the slow progress of last year's report , which is of 2015 expenses. Pauley remains responsible for that report, but this ordinance would impact annual reviews from this year forward. \nPauley hired longtime city consultant Curt Coonrod to do last year's deep-dive review of city finances. She was seeking a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence from the Government Finance Officers Association, an important designation in government circles that could lead to lower bond ratings. \nCoonrod and Pauley have not been seeing eye to eye on some of his accounting methods, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:19:56.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
