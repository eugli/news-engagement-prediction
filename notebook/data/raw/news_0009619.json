The e-commerce business will be spun out into a separate entity called 'Paytm E-Commerce.' \nThe entity will operate as 'PayTM Mall,' named after Alibaba's T-Mall in China, or 'PayTM Bazaar' with a new site and an app, Economic Times reported citing sources. The business has an annual gross merchandise value of about $1 billion. \nPaytm's parent One97 raised $60 million in mid-last year from Mediatek, its last funding round when it was valued at $5 billion. Alibaba and Ant Financial will have a combined 50 per cent stake in the new division after this deal, according to Mint . Alibaba's payments affiliate Alipay and venture capital firm SAIF Partners, are also investing in the deal. \nWith this deal, e-commerce competition in India is set to further heat up that has been dominated by homegrown brands Flipkart and Snapdeal, and e-commerce giant Amazon. The e-commerce industry in India is expected to grow to about $55 to $60 billion by 2020, according to estimates by AT Kearny and Google. The market was worth about $14 billion to $16 billion at the end of 2016, ET noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:00:28.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
