The minimum to medium security facility for women is located in Maple Creek, Sask.\nShe said the healing lodge focuses on Indigenous culture, teachings and ceremonies while also holding people accountable in hopes that they can become rehabilitated and repay their debt to the community. \nJordan and Chanda Van de Vorst and their two-year-old son, Miguire, and five-year-old daughter, Kamryn, were killed in January.
