The Doomsday clock is close to midnight . And, hey look, here’s a collaboration between The Chainsmokers and Coldplay to make you feel just a tiny bit worse. The bros of EDM have teamed up with the bros of adult contemporary to deliver a song that‘s exactly as annoying as you think it’s going to be. You can listen below to “Something Like This,” which they performed together at yesterday‘s Brit Awards. \nThe track really does sound exactly like you would expect a piece of music from these two groups to sound like. It starts out in Coldplay mode, with mopey Chris Martin vocals about feeling insufficient compared to the likes of Spider-Man and Hercules. And then The Chainsmokers drop their throbbing beat, and you realize this tune will forever be stuck in your head. Listen at your own peril. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:09:14.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
