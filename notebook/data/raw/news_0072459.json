In fact, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy by 2030 of any high-income country high-income country , according to the researchers. By 2030, men’s average lifespan will hit 79.5 while women’s reaches 83.3. That puts the country at number 26 for men and 27 for women—even more behind than it already is. \nSome possible reasons? We beat out other high-income countries in factors we don’t want to be ahead for: body mass index (BMI), homicides, and child and maternity mortality—all which are contributing to our shorter lives. In addition, the U.S. is the only high-income country without universal health coverage, and has the most people who can’t afford healthcare. \nSouth Korea, on the other hand, has universal healthcare and an improving economy, leading to better nutrition and fewer chronic diseases. Compared to the majority of Western countries, South Koreans have lower BMIs and blood pressure , and women smoke less. The country’s female life expectancy by 2030 is 90.8, while men’s is 84.1. Men in Australia and Switzerland are also expected to live past 80. \nWhile women across the world live longer than men, the difference isn’t as big as it used to be, and the researchers think it’ll keep narrowing as men get smarter about their eating, drinking, and safety. \nThough there could be some genetic factors at play, the differences between countries are mostly cultural — which means we could all be living much longer lives. “I don’t believe we’re anywhere near the upper limit of life expectancy,” lead author Majid Ezzati said in a press release, “if there even is one.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:09:37.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
