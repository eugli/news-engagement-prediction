It's important to make sure all gear is in working order. Give yourself time to test equipment and replace/repair anything that is not working properly. Remember, if an item breaks, you will still need to haul it back. Clean out your tent, if you haven't since the last time you used it. It's important to get rid of any debris and especially food particles that might remain in the tent, if you've not used it in a while. Set it up and let it air out before you pack it again. Always get new lighters, new camp fuel, and check the batteries of any flashlights or other items that can fail in the wilderness and leave you struggling. 7 Pack a whistle and a mirror. Every backcountry camper needs to have in their bag a whistle and a mirror in the event of an emergency. If a hiker becomes separated from the group, the whistle can be used to help find the separated camper. If the event of a more serious emergency, mirrors can be used to signal rescue teams, by reflecting sunlight. Small stuff that can be a life-saver. 8 Bring maps of the area. Having a detailed map of the area you'll be hiking is critical to a good and safe hike. Park maps are typically available at trail heads, as well as at the Visitor's Center of most areas, or you can find your own topographical maps at sporting goods stores. National and State Park maps are typically low resolution, which can be fine for day hikes, but British Ordnance Survey or USGS (US Geologic Survey) have elevation contours and are more accurate and reliable in an emergency, provided you know how to read them . These maps are available at most sporting good stores in the area that you'll hike. Carry a compass and know how to read it and use it with your map. You can use some software programs to print your copy on waterproof paper if you cannot access any of the ready printed ones. A GPS device can pinpoint your location, but you should still carry a map and compass. 9 Balance your pack properly. Your backpack might feel ok now, but you'll start to notice that it's unbalanced after a few miles and get a serious strain on one shoulder. It's important to try to space out the heavy items in your bag and keep things relatively balanced from side-to-side, and from top-to-bottom. [5] Put the heaviest things toward your back, and low in the bag to help keep you on balance. In general, you want to start packing with the bulkiest and the heaviest items, then stuff extra space with things like clothes and other gear. Read this article for more information about packing your backpack properly . Part 3 Planning for Safety 1 Familiarize yourself with local hazards. Before you set out, you need to be aware of the unique dangers that the area poses to hikers. Is there poison oak to watch out for? Rattlesnakes? Bears? Is it wasp season? What do you do if you're stung? Lightening preparedness is a critical part of hiker safety. Learn to identify and find the appropriate shelter in the event of a lightning storm. If you are going about 6,000 feet know how to recognized acute mountain sickness and how to manage it. Make sure you know basic first aid for things like cuts, scraps, and broken bones. 2 Always go with a group. Backcountry hiking needs to happen in a group, unless you're a very experienced hiker. Aim for a small group of like-minded friends, between 2-5 people for a safe hiking trip your first time out. Ideally, you'll want to have an experienced hiker who is familiar with the area you're hiking. If you are experienced, you have the opportunity to introduce a newcomer to the wonders of backpacking. If you have never been backpacking, you might want to consider going on your first trip with an experienced hiker. It's best if your camping partners are somewhat compatible in terms of hiking speed, distance they are willing to hike, and camping style. Some people like to travel lightly and hike long distances. Others prefer just getting out of sight of the car. If you travel solo make sure someone knows your plans and that you have the equipment and skills to be self-sufficient. 3 Carry more than enough water to get you from one source to the next. Water is heavy, but critical on a hiking trip. You need to bring enough water so that everyone has at least 2 liters of clean water to drink each day, especially if you're working hard and sweating on your hike. If you are using a water filter, bring replacement parts, including replacement filters. They often clog with sediment, or just plain break. Boiling water for at least one minute is an effective backup method, in an emergency. [6] 4 Check in with someone before you leave. Leave a detailed itinerary with someone who is not going on the trip, including your route, inventory, areas you plan to stay. It's important that someone knows when you expect to return, so they can check in if you're late. Be sure to contact them after you have safely returned. Leave a note on your car, at least. This can be very helpful in the event that you don't show back up to the car on time. Check in at the ranger station or the Visitor's Center before you go camping. This is an easy way to let people know how long you're going to be in the area. 5 Pace yourselves. An average hiking pace is 2-3 miles per hour. Don't get overambitious. Shoot for less, rather than more, so you can take time to enjoy the sights. Determine the approximate area where you will camp each night ahead of time. Try to plan your trip so that you camp close to a reliable water source each night. 6 Don't keep food in your tent. All of your food needs to be secured from bears, and kept separate from your tent, if you're going to be hiking in the backcountry. Even if bears aren't regularly found in the area you're hiking, it's important to protect yourself from all sorts of curious animals, who might want to sneak a bite. If you will be visiting an area with bears, bring a bag and rope to hang your food from a tree, or use an Ursack or bear canister, depending on local regulations. Follow the same precautions with anything scented, including hair products, shampoo, lotions, toothpaste, and gum. Always use the same bag for storing and hanging food and scented items, from campout to campout.
