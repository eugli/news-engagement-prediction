Radical feminism views patriarchy as dividing rights, privileges and power primarily by gender, and as a result oppressing women and privileging men. \nRadical feminism opposes existing political and social organization in general because it is inherently tied to patriarchy. Thus, radical feminists tend to be skeptical of political action within the current system, and instead tend to focus on culture change that undermines patriarchy and associated hierarchical structures. \nRadical feminists tend to be more militant in their approach (radical as \"getting to the root\") than other feminists are. A radical feminist aims to dismantle patriarchy, rather than making adjustments to the system through legal changes. Radical feminists also resisted reducing oppression to an economic or class issue, as socialist or Marxist feminism sometimes did. \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance \nRadical feminism was rooted in the wider radical movement, where women participated in anti-war and New Left political movements of the 1960s, finding themselves excluded from equal power by the men within the movement, even with underlying theories of empowerment. Many of these women split off into specifically feminist groups, while still retaining much of their political radical ideals and methods. Then radical feminism became the term used for the more radical edge of feminism. \nRadical feminism opposes patriarchy, not men. To equate radical feminism to man-hating is to assume that patriarchy and men are inseparable, philosophically and politically. (Robin Morgan defended \"man-hating\" as the right of the oppressed class to hate the class which is oppressing them.) \nRadical feminism is credited with the use of consciousness raising groups to raise awareness of women's oppression. \nSome key radical feminists were Ti-Grace Atkinson, Susan Brownmiller, Phyllis Chester, Corrine Grad Coleman, Mary Daly , Andrea Dworkin , Shulamith Firestone , Germaine Greer , Carol Hanisch , Jill Johnston, Catherine MacKinnon, Kate Millett , Robin Morgan , Ellen Willis, Monique Wittig. Groups that were part of the radical feminist wing of feminism include Redstockings . New York Radical Women (NYRW) , the Chicago Women's Liberation Union (CWLU), Ann Arbor Feminist House, The Feminists, WITCH, Seattle Radical Women, Cell 16. Radical feminists organized the demonstrations against the Miss America pageant in 1968 . \nLater radical feminists sometimes added a focus on sexuality, including some moving to a radical political lesbianism. \nKey issues for radical feminists include: reproductive rights for women , including freedom to make choices to give birth, have an abortion , use birth control or get sterilized. evaluating and then breaking down traditional gender roles in private relationships as well as in public policies. understanding pornography as an industry and practice leading to harm to women, although some radical feminists disagreed with this position. understanding rape as an expression of patriarchal power, not a seeking of sex. understanding prostitution under patriarchy as oppression of women, sexually and economically. a critique of motherhood, marriage, the nuclear family and sexuality, questioning how much of our culture is based on patriarchal assumptions. a critique of other institutions including government and religion as centered historically in patriarchal power. \nTools used by radical women's groups included consciousness-raising groups, actively providing services, organizing public protests, and putting on art and culture events. Women's Studies programs at universities were often supported by radical feminists as well as more liberal and socialist feminists. \nSome radical feminists promoted a political form of lesbianism or celibacy as alternatives to heterosexual sex within an overall patriarchal culture. \nThere remains disagreement within the radical feminist community about transgender identity . Some radical feminists have supported the rights of transgender people, seeing it as another gender liberation struggle; some have opposed the transgender movement, seeing it as embodying and promoting patriarchal gender norms. \nTo further study radical feminism, here are a few histories and political/philosophical texts: Mary Daly.

Some Quotes on Feminism from Radical Feminists \n• I didn't fight to get women out from behind vacuum cleaners to get them onto the board of Hoover. - Germaine Greer \n• All men hate some women some of the time and some men hate all women all of the time. - Germaine Greer \n• The fact is that we live in a profoundly anti-female society, a misogynistic \"civilization\" in which men collectively victimize women, attacking us as personifications of their own paranoid fears, as The Enemy. Within this society it is men who rape, who sap women's energy, who deny women economic and political power. - Mary Daly \n• I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them. - Robin Morgan \n• In the long run, Women's Liberation will of course free men -- but in the short run it's going to COST men a lot of privilege, which no one gives up willingly or easily. - Robin Morgan \n• Feminists are often asked whether pornography causes rape. The fact is that rape and prostitution caused and continue to cause pornography. Politically, culturally, socially, sexually, and economically, rape and prostitution generated pornography; and pornography depends for its continued existence on the rape and prostitution of women. - Andrea Dworkin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:48:48.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
