The PVV is suspending its public activities until all facts in connection with the corruption investigation are known,” Wilders, the frontrunner in the 15 March election, said on Twitter. \nDutch media reported earlier this week that a member of the far-right politician’s police security team had been arrested on suspicion of leaking details of his whereabouts to a Dutch-Moroccan criminal gang. \nThe Algemeen Dagblad newspaper reported on Thursday that the officer and his brother, both previously members of the Utrecht police force, had been investigated in connection with suspected leaks of confidential information. \nThe DBB security service, responsible for the safety of the royal family, diplomats and high-profile politicians, said the officer – who is of Moroccan origin – was not one of Wilders’ bodyguards but screened locations for his public appearances. \nWilders, whose platform includes banning the sale of the Qur’an, closing mosques and Islamic schools, shutting Dutch borders and banning Muslim migrants, has lived under 24-hour police protection for more than a decade following death threats. \nHe was found guilty of inciting discrimination against Dutch Moroccans last December and sparked uproar at his official campaign launch on Saturday by criticising “Moroccan scum who make the streets unsafe”. \nThe Dutch police chief, Erik Akerboom, told Dutch radio an investigation had been opened but insisted Wilders’ safety had not been compromised, prompting Wilders to reply that if he could not trust the DBB, “I can no longer function”. \nThe justice minister, Stef Blok, insisted Dutch politicians could “campaign safely on Dutch streets” and said the alleged leak had endangered no one. The security officer, identified as Faris K, was released on Thursday but suspended pending the investigation. \nWilders’ PVV is running neck-and-neck with the liberal VVD party of the prime minister, Mark Rutte, and may well become the Netherlands’ largest party, but is likely to be shut out of government by a coalition of more mainstream parties. \nDespite its reputation for calm and tolerance, the Netherlands has relatively recently experienced shocking political violence. \nThe flamboyant far-right leader Pim Fortuyn was shot dead by environmental and animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf just nine days before the 2002 elections. Two years later, the controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh was gunned down by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Muslim radical.
