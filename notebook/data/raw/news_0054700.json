And while you might assume that some of that would have subsided once the baby got here, that’s not how things are panning out. After a paternity test that determined that Hartwell is indeed the father, Ed is not ready to pay child support just yet. According to TMZ , in new documents filed in his pending divorce, Hartwell acknowledges that he is the father but believes he should not have to pay child support until the court decides upon the amount. In the documents, Hartwell states that he doesn’t believe Knight Pulliam’s claim that she’s in need of emergency financial support. Plus he said she’s not considering his expenses in setting up a nursery for their daughter in his place. Ugh. Ed, you setting up a nursery still doesn’t even begin to cover the costs, both emotional and financial, of day-to-day child care. Stop it. At this point, it’s just a waiting game to see what he’ll do next. Veronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.
