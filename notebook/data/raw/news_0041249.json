The move was aimed to encourage people to use digital payments post demonetisation. \n\"In order to operationalise the (government's direction), the Reserve Bank will reimburse banks MDR on debit cards used for payment of tax and non-tax dues to the government of India with effect from January 1, 2017,\" the central bank said in a notification. \nBanks begin levying MDR charges on debit card payments \nBanks have been asked to forward their claim for reimbursement of MDR along with statutory auditor's certificate, as in the case of agency commission claims, to RBI's Nagpur office on a quarterly basis. \nAlso, the banks will have to certify that MDR charges for transaction amounts up to Rs 1 lakh have not been collected from the payer. \nThe banks have been asked to file claim by April 30 for the quarter ending March 2017.
