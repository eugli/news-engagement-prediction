It's inexcusable. Wright told The Sun Football Podcast \n\"Arsene Wenger said before the game the players were ready and then afterwards he said the team wasn't ready. \" \n\"The performances are showing that the team are not accountable. \n\"It's all about the start and Arsenal have nor started well for so many games now. I'm not expecting Arsenal to start well. \n\"I don't feel they get themselves up for certain games, there's not enough accountability. And it's just exactly what happens every season at this stage.\" \nWright then singled out Olivier Giroud for his performance against Watford on Tuesday: \nWas he injured or wasn't he injured? \n\"Two minutes into the game he signalled that he wasn't right. He knew that his ankle wasn't quite right. It was the most pitiful 45 minutes I've ever seen from a centre-forward and he was rightly taken off.\" \n\"I would be absolutely livid with him because it's all about the start.\" \nThoughts on Wright's comments?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:38:31.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
