Picture: AAP Image/Mick Tsikas Claire Bickers News Corp Australia Network Share \nDONALD Trump is set to change his stance on climate change, according to a former US Republican congressman. \nBob Inglis is no lefty activist or latte-drinking ‘trendy’. \nHe was a congressman who represented “the reddest district in the reddest state in the nation”, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, for six years in the 1990s. \nIt was the same time Vice President Al Gore was warning against the impending crisis of global warming facing the planet. \nSince then, Inglis has reversed his position on climate change after extensive briefings with scientists and founded a movement of conservatives lobbying for action on global warming from the right. \nIn a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra today — where he referenced meeting the unlikely hero of the marriage equality movement in Australia, former croc farmer and Coalition MP Warren Entsch — Mr Inglis said President Trump would be forced to change his mind on climate change. Lawyer and former US Congressman Bob Inglis says Donald Trump will change his mind on climate change.

President Donald Trump will be forced to change his mind on climate change, Bob Inglis says.

How likely was it that Richard Nixon would open up China? How likely was it that Bill Clinton would sign the welfare reform bill, the welfare reform bill that we conservatives sent him after he vetoed it twice, he finally signed it. How likely was it that he would sign that? \n“Reality is what will force Donald Trump to shift and amend the chants at his rallies.” \nMr Inglis, who founded the Energy and Enterprise Initiative in 2012 to promote conservative solutions to climate change, said President Trump could try to repeal President Obama’s actions on climate change but some efforts to address global warming in the US had already progressed too far. Lawyer and former US Congressman Bob Inglis addressed the National Press Club in Canberra today. Picture: AAP Image/Mick Tsikas Source: AAP \nHis comments come amid reports President Trump will sign an order reversing Obama’s initiatives on carbon emissions from power plants, coal mining and government authority over bodies of water. \n“The coal miners jobs aren’t coming back,” Mr Inglis said today. \n“President Trump may repeal President Obama’s clean power plan but it’s going to be much harder to repeal the price on natural gas in America. \n“That came from competitive pressures, that came from innovation. \n“He won’t be able to repeal that. \n“My hope is that the bushfire set by the Tea Party will burn itself out in the Oval Office. \n“And perhaps it had to make its way all the way there in order to finally burn out. \n“As it does, we’re going to discover in my country, and perhaps you’ll discover here, that pitchforks and torches are not good building tools.” \nMr Inglis is lobbying for a carbon tax in the US as a conservative measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ruled out considering a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme for Australia late last year after Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg announced there would be a review of the government’s climate change and energy policies in 2017.
