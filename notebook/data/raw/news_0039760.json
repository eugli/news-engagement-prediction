Related Articles Soren Kragh Andersen's promise fulfilled with Tour of Oman stage win The Dane, who won the white jersey in last year’s Tour of Qatar, timed his sprint for the line perfectly after a number of late attacks had been reeled in by the bunch. The stage had been marked by a six-man break that formed in the early kilometres after a frantic start. \nMatthew Brammeier (Aqua Blue Sport), Chun Kai Feng (Bahrain Merida), Bert Van Lerberghe (Sport Vlaanderen – Baloise), Gavin Mannion (UnitedHealthcare), Kazushige Kuboki (Nippo - Vini Fantini), and Frantisek Sisr (CCC Sprandi Polkowice) all made it into the move with the group establishing a 3:45 lead after 25 kilometres of racing. \nAs the race wound towards the coast and the sun broke through the cloud cover, the gap extended to just over four minutes as BMC Racing set tempo on the front of the peloton. \nAt the summit of Bousher Al Amerat it was Kuboki who took the maximum number of climbing points, but a slight headwind after the climb began hamper the leaders. \nWith Katusha and Astana shuttling to the front to help with the chase, the gap immediately began to drop with the six out front seeing their advantage reduced to 2:15 with 50 kilometres still to race. \nThe final ascent may have been shallower in pitch than what the riders were faced with on stage 2, but the sprint into the final climb on stage 3 was nothing but frenetic as teams looked to position their climbers as close to the front as possible. That surge was enough to reel in the break with 15 kilometres remaining. \nAs the climb started, the peloton shed itself of the weakest riders and it was a resurgent Julian Arredondo (Nippo - Vini Fantini) who moved clear. The Colombian endured a difficult final season at Trek but he initially looked strong as he opened up a gap. \nWhen Arredondo faded Laurens De Plus (Quick-Step Floors) took up the reins but he too couldn’t hold off the late charge and the Belgian eventually crossed the line in fourth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:19:50.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
