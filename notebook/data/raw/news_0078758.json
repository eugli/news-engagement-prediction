Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGood news if you're dreaming of jetting off somewhere sunny; flights to many popular holiday destinations have fallen sharply, according to price comparison site KAYAK.co.uk . \nFor example, Ibiza is the fifth most-searched-for destination on the site, and has seen average prices crash by a third, which works out at a saving of about £56. \nSimilarly, flight prices to Faro in Portugal have dropped by 20%, while Alicante and Majorca have seen price falls of 19%. The five biggest price drops for European destinations Source: Kayak.co.uk Long-haul trips have got cheaper too \nThe study also highlighted some big price drops on long-haul flights. \nKayak reckons the 'bargain of the summer' is Mexico; flights to Mexico City have dropped by 39%, which works out at a saving of £289 on last year. poll loading Are you going abroad for your holiday this year? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \nRio has seen prices fall by 23% (worth around £173), while flights to Singapore are now around 20% cheaper than last summer. The five biggest price drops for worldwide destinations Source: Kayak.co.uk Saving a packet on your holiday accommodation \nSnapping up a cheap flight is a good start, but if you want to really save a few quid on your holiday you need to think about the accommodation too. \nIt's a good idea to use comparison sites like loveholidays or hotels.com , which bring together millions of deals for you to choose from. \nWhen you definitely CAN get compensation for a delayed flight \nIf you're feeling adventurous, you could always plump for a 'mystery' hotel. Basically, you can secure a massive discount, but you don't know exactly where you're going to stay until close to departure. \nAnd don't forget, you could always give Airbnb a try; you might not get to enjoy room service, but it could end up saving you a small fortune. Get the most bang for your buck \nNabbing a cheap deal on your flight and accommodation is only half the story though. \nIt’s also crucial that you get a great deal when changing up your spending money, particularly given the way the pound has dropped in value since last year. \nAccording to a study by On The Beach as many as one in ten of us wait to the last minute to change up our holiday money at the airport before jetting off. This is a terrible move - the rates you get at the airport are rubbish, so you are chucking money away. \nYou’re much better off changing your cash in advance. Don’t bother with a high street bank either - you’ll get a better rate by using a travel money specialist, like Travelex or ICE . \nAnother 11% rely on using their debit or credit card for spending abroad. \nThis is another costly move, as your card will incur all sorts of extra fees and charges. You will be better off taking out a specialist overseas spending credit card, like the Post Office credit card or the Halifax Clarity credit card . \nAlternatively, you can get a prepaid card - you load cash onto it in advance and then use it like a normal debit or credit card once you’re abroad.
