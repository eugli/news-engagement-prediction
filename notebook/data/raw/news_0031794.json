Two people were diagnosed in December, and one this month. \nOf the three patients, two have recovered from the infection, officials said. \n“This illness can be serious but is treatable with readily available antibiotics,” city Health Department officials said in a statement released Tuesday. \nHomeless housed in sub-human and unsafe conditions in NYC: report \nIt enters through the body either through cuts or through the eyes, nose or mouth. \n“Symptoms can range from a mild illness with fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, vomiting or diarrhea, to a life-threatening sickness that affects the kidneys and liver,” health officials said. \nAt 750 Grand Concourse, a Health Department notice warned tenants that a resident of the building was one of the three people diagnosed, CBS 2 reported. \nThe city routinely finds signs of rat infestation at that building, records show, and an inspection Monday showed “active rat signs.” In November 2015, the public advocate’s office deemed the owner the “City’s Worst Landlord.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:05:21.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
