PHOTO | FILE By ERIC WAINAINA \nFour young men have been found strangled and dumped in a vehicle in a garage at Gitaru in Kikuyu, Kiambu County. \nPolice say the vehicle, which was parked at the garage on Wednesday morning, spent the whole day there without mechanics inspecting its cargo. \nThe man who parked it left and Kikuyu police chief Joseph Ongaya said they were hunting for him. \nAlso wanted is the owner of the vehicle, whose identity police are likely to get from the Kenya Revenue Authority. \nMr Ongaya on Thursday told the Nation that the bodies had head injuries that they suspected were caused by blunt objects. \nNo identity documents were found on the corpses, which have been taken to City Mortuary in Nairobi.
