Travel options are as follows:... https://t.co/rBM3IpL0qx \n— YubaCityCalifornia (@YubaCityCA) February 13, 2017 Officials are racing to relieve water pressure on the dam, which is so far continuing to hold.\nBut California’s governor has activated an Emergency Operations Center in response to the emerging crisis.\nThe local sheriff’s office has told media that helicopters are being prepared to drop loads of rocks at critical points along the spillway in an effort to strengthen the structure.\nOroville Press Conference https://t.co/qcbgLP8uzG \n— CA - DWR (@CA_DWR) February 13, 2017 UNDER PRESSURE \nConcerns were first raised yesterday when water started flowing over an emergency spillway at Lake Oroville for the first time after erosion damaged the Northern California dam’s main spillway.\nOfficials hoped to avoid using Oroville Dam’s emergency spillway, fearing it could cause trees to fall and leave debris cascading into water that rushes through the Feather River, into the Sacramento River and on to the San Francisco Bay.\n⚠️ Move to higher ground!

Croyle said the main spillway will need a “complete replacement” from the damage. Officials noted earlier this week that the cost of repairing the dam could approach $US100 million, but they noted the estimate was an early, ballpark figure.\nAbout 240km northeast of San Francisco, Lake Oroville is one of California’s largest man-made lakes, and the 235-meters-tall Oroville Dam is the nation’s tallest. The lake is a central piece of California’s government-run water delivery network, supplying water for agriculture in the Central Valley and residents and businesses in Southern California.\nHazardous situation is developing with the #OrovilleDam Dam auxiliary spillway.
