We are concerned because this involves a high profile case.\n“That was why we deployed Stafoc to keep guard, that is all,” he said in response to rumours that security was increased at the mortuary because of Han-sol's arrival.\nACP Sukri said the Stafoc team ended its shift at 8am Tuesday, after keeping watch from Monday night.  He added that there had been no threat so far. \nHe also confirmed that police had briefly taken in a Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) cameraman for questioning early Tuesday.\n\"We did not arrest him. We recorded his statement at the hospital and immediately released him.\n“While taking his statement, we also verified the authenticity of his media identification documents,” he added.\nACP Sukri said police were acting on a report lodged by HKL’s auxilliary policemen, who became suspicious after seeing the cameraman wandering around the hospital.\nHe explained that it was standard operating procedure for police to investigate after receiving a report.\n“It’s a normal investigation. He is not a suspect in the case.  Once we were satisfied with his statement, we released him,” said ACP Sukri. \nSecurity has been stepped up at the mortuary since last week to stop any unauthorised removal of Jong-nam's body.\nJong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2) on Feb 13.\nHis body was sent to HKL where a postmortem was carried out.\nFour people have so far been arrested in the probe into his death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:09:13.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
