According to Miami-Dade police records, via ProFootballTalk , Elam was arrested on drug charges at 3:45 a.m. Sunday. \nElam was pulled over for reckless driving, according to police, at which point 126 grams of marijuana and 3 grams of oxycodone were found in his vehicle. \nHe was charged with possession of more than 20 grams of cannabis, possession of cannabis with intent to sell or deliver, and possession of a controlled substance. \nElam was suspended back in 2015 for violating the league’s substance abuse policy and has played just nine games the past two seasons. The 2013 first-round pick has been a disappointment for the Ravens thus far, and with his fifth-year option declined by the team, he’ll hit the open market on March 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:01:46.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
