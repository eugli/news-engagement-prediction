We need to do more work to get more output.” \n“Adding more lost time from a business perspective isn’t necessarily a good idea” \nGallant said there’s currently no timeline for a decision as they continue to weigh the benefits of the issue. \n“We want to make sure that if we ever do go forward with it that we do everything we can to mitigate the potential negative impacts on some of the stakeholders,” Gallant said. “But our government is still committed to looking deeply into this issue.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:04:32.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
