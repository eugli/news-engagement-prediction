Source: Getty Images \nWith the departure of former skipper Stephen Moore and senior players David Pocock, Matt Toomua and Joe Tomane, Lealiifano’s leadership qualities will be important in a new-look Brumbies outfit. \nLarkham said on doctors advice he wouldn’t be pushed too hard physically in the first six months of his recovery. \n“I certainly want to see him back training by the end of the season,” Larkham said. \n“If he’s back playing with us that would be unbelievable. \n“If he’s back playing club rugby by the end of the season that would be unbelievable as well. \n“If he stays in remission for the rest of his life - that’s the number one goal for now.” \nLealiifano’s return could see him add to his 117 Super Rugby games for the Brumbies or his 19 Test caps. \n“He’s got this journey he’s been on and he wants to get back and play rugby at some stage,” Larkham said. \nLive stream 2017 Super Rugby on FOX SPORTS.
