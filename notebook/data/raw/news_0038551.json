Justin Humphrey prepares to speak before a Public Health Committee at the State Capitol in Oklahoma City on Tuesday. (Steve Gooch/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, February 15, 2017, 4:15 AM \nA legislative bill gaining momentum in Oklahoma could force women wanting to have an abortion to first obtain consent from the fathers of their fetuses. \nThe so-called HB 1441 bill , authored by Republican Rep. Justin Humphrey, passed the state House Committee on Public Health on Tuesday, and is now up for a full House vote. \nThe measure would require a woman “to provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion.” If the father would not consent to the abortion, the woman could not legally go through with it, according to the bill. \nHumphrey did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily News, but told The Intercept earlier this month that he believes a woman becomes a pregnancy “host” if she has been “irresponsible.” \nOkla. lawmaker wants women to seek men's approval for abortions \n“I believe one of the breakdowns in our society is that we have excluded the man out of all of these types of decisions,” Humphrey told the news site. “I understand that they feel like that is their body…I feel like it is a separate — what I call them is, is you’re a ‘host.’ And you know when you enter into a relationship you’re going to be that host and so, you know, if you pre-know that then take all precautions and don’t get pregnant.” \nHumphrey has been widely rebuked since introducing the bill last Thursday. No, Rep. Justin Humphrey, we are not \"hosts.\" We are women, and we cannot be contained. #WhyIResist — Women's March (@womensmarch) February 13, 2017 \n“No, Rep. Justin Humphrey, we are not ‘hosts.’ We are women, and we cannot be contained,” the official Women’s March account tweeted after the bill passed the public health committee. \nThe Center for Reproductive Rights claimed that the bill amounts to a “total ban on abortion” for women stuck in relationships plagued by domestic violence. Furthermore, the center alleged that Humphrey’s bill is unconstitutional, as ensured by the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey Supreme Court ruling, which struck down the argument that a woman must notify her spouse before having an abortion. \nHorse carriage company, animal rights protesters look to SCOTUS \n“It is shameful that Oklahoma politicians advanced this measure, which is demeaning, patently unconstitutional, and puts women in abusive relationships at risk,” Amanda Allen, the center’s senior legislative counsel, said in a statement . \nThe abortion rights organization also launched a petition , which demands that Gov. Mary Fallin vetoes Humphrey’s bill should it pass the full House. \nIn April, Fallin vetoed the so-called SB 1552 measure, citing constitutional concerns. The controversial measure had passed the House and proposed to make performing an abortion a felony offense.
