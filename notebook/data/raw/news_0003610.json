Jake Speight reveals the hectic 24 hours he went through to place Omar Bogle at Wigan \nPlayer turned representative is using his bad-boy past to help today's promising starlets succeed in football Exclusive Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments JAKE SPEIGHT is the poacher who has turned gamekeeper — using his bad-boy past to help today’s starlets. \nBy his own admission, the former Sheffield United and Bradford striker was a problem player who fell out with plenty of bosses during a journeyman career of unrealised potential. 4 Jake Speight is the player-turned-agent helping today’s starlets succeed in football \nBut the 31-year-old has learned his lessons and become an agent who worked over 23 hours on transfer deadline day on Tuesday to secure moves for his clients. \nHis company, Fifteen Eleven Management, has been going for five years and has nearly 50 clients. \nHe clinched 11th-hour moves on Tuesday for Omar Bogle from League Two Grimsby to Championship side Wigan, and for Bogle’s replacement Sam Jones, who joined the Mariners from Gateshead. \nIt made for a long deadline day for the Sheffield businessman, as he explains here in an exclusive run-down of events . . . \n5.30am: I get up and wolf down a croissant for what will be the last thing I eat that day. From then on I’ll be running solely on coffee. \n6.05am: I arrive at the office and prepare myself for what this manic day will bring. Every deadline day is the same — it’s all very reactive. You’re just waiting for something to happen and the domino effect to kick in. \nAt this point, you have an idea of which clubs are interested in your players so you’re waiting to see what business they do to see if spaces open up for your guys. \nI have three players to potentially shift today — Omar, Sam and a goalkeeper. But Sam’s switch is dependent on Omar’s move going through, so the pressure is on. joel.fox@thesun.co.uk 4 Jake Speight spent nearly 24 hours working in order to secure Omar Bogle his move to Wigan on deadline day \n8am: I’m already on my third flat-white of the day. The situation is complicated further by the fact there is a near-to-full fixture list tonight — whose bright idea was that? \nI’ve got everything set, from my phone, to the transfer centre on the iPad, to the computer, to Sky Sports News on loop. \n10am: The phone keeps ringing with clubs inquiring about the situation, what the costs are etc. Media guys like Sky and The Sun are on the case too, trying to find out what’s going on. It’s carnage. \n1pm: Suddenly everything goes completely dead. I take advantage of it to watch my little boy at his indoor sports day at his school down the road in Sheffield. I try to turn my attention to him but my mind is all over the place. \n3.30pm: I head back to the office, expecting the phone to go and the mayhem to resume.

All hell breaks loose. The phone starts going nuts as everything kicks off. \n5.30pm: The first bid from Wigan for Omar has been received by Grimsby and, though it is knocked back, the feeling is that an agreement will be reached eventually that evening. \nThe Grimsby chairman tells me to get to Wigan. I ring Omar and tell him it’s go, go, go. He heads from Grimsby to Wigan in a taxi. \n6.30pm: I’m delayed as I have to get the paperwork sorted for Sam. His move is on now and is key to Omar’s deal going through. \n9.30pm: Traffic isn’t good and I’m still on the M62 heading to Wigan. In the car, I’m negotiating both Omar’s deal and Sam’s deal on loudspeaker. \nAt the same time, I’m getting calls from other clubs on the pair as well as other players. 4 Former bad-boy Jake Speight spends most of transfer deadline day on the phone trying to see deals over the line \nWith Omar, we’ve made up our minds that Wigan is the one to go for. The manager, Warren Joyce, is perfect for Omar’s development given his amazing work at Manchester United and that is the deciding factor. \n9.45pm: A new Wigan bid is finally accepted by Grimsby. We’re nearly there but due to a mix-up we’re at the stadium, when we should be at the training ground! Omar is remarkably relaxed about the whole thing. \n10.30pm: We get to the training ground. I still have to sign off the deal to get Sam to Grimsby, so I’m on the phone to him to talk it over. \nWigan fax the paperwork back to Grimsby to get that done. \nAt this point, it’s a massive worry that the deals won’t get done in time because of the tight schedule. \n10.50pm: Sam’s deal goes through at Grimsby. A sigh of relief but there’s still Omar’s to get over the line. \n10.57pm: Omar’s goes through at Wigan. And . . . relax! Pro Sports Images Ltd. 4 Omar Bogle’s move from League Two side Grimsby to Wigan went through just before 11.pm \n11.00pm: Omar does his press with the club, while everything gets ratified with the club and the league. \n12am: We hit the road to take Omar back to Grimsby. He’s really happy, so it’s a nice journey. He has come such a long way from his time in non-league. We had a long chat when I first became Omar’s representative about how to maximise his potential. He’s doing it and I’m very proud. \n2.30am: I drop off Omar. The smile on his face tells the story. My eyes are starting to go, even after the espressos. But I still have a 90-minute drive back home to Sheffield. \n4.45am: I’m finally back in bed, absolutely shattered. But it’s been a good day. The next one is due to start in a few hours, with the school run at 8.30am. \nThen there’s a day full of admin, like ensuring Omar has everything he needs to settle in. It never stops . . .
