Credit Photo illustration by Ben Grandgenett. Subway riders: Piotr Redlinski. In high school, I lived my longest days. I chiseled my morning routine into a trim half-hour (shower, clothes, Cheerios), and at 6:40 a.m., I raced to the subway, squeezed into a car, gazed uncomprehendingly at my chemistry notes, popped out onto Chambers Street and shot westward to school. And when classes concluded at 3:40, I did not, like a normal person, go home; I went to the school-newspaper office and edited, and wrote, and wondered if anyone would ever kiss me, and eventually, after darkness had fallen, drifted back across Chambers to board the train uptown. How I loved the train uptown. My feeling as the 6 pulled into the station was like that of the toddler who spots an ice-cream truck rounding the corner, only my treat of choice was sleep. To school I took the express, for time was of the essence, but from school I took the local, for time no longer mattered, and I wanted merely to sit and doze. My naps were efficient, a city dweller’s naps; they unfurled with near-mechanical precision. As the train left each station, I slipped out of consciousness. As it slowed upon arrival at the next, I re-entered the waking world. Among the shoppers who boarded at Canal, the students at Hunter, the doctors at Lenox Hill, I slept. Each time I woke, I became half-aware of the industry of the world — and then I slept again. Subway slumber was one of my few acts of rebellion in those days. I was a sweet kid, with a ready smile, a ravenous appetite for good grades and an oddly long to-do list. I had fun only on the rare occasions when my homework happened to be fun. But flying beneath the city streets, jostled by the Discman-toting masses, I retreated into myself and refused to do anything at all. Soporific New York City Subway Rides Longest with no transfer: The A train from 207th Street in Manhattan to Far Rockaway (more than 31 miles). Longest with transfer: The 2 train from 241st Street in the Bronx, with a transfer to the A train (more than 38 miles). Longest interval between stations: The A train between J.F.K. Airport and Broad Channel (3.5 miles). Sleeping on the subway is a storied tradition in New York. Among the ranks of nappers past, none fascinates me more than Henry Shelby, the cheerful, well-educated vagrant who choreographed overnight ballets of subway rides, hopping from the Eighth Avenue Express to the Sixth Avenue and back, snoozing for hours on end. (Unlike most who spend their nights on the subway, Shelby appears to have been homeless by choice.) Shelby inspired the 1956 Harper’s Magazine article “Subways Are for Sleeping,” which detailed the nuances of his technique. Between midnight and 1, boarding at the front of the Eighth Avenue train nearly guaranteed a seat; certain station bathrooms, at certain moments, proved ideal for illicit cigarette breaks. Each time I scan the cars of an arriving train, seeking out the emptiest one and — all too often — running after it, I think of Shelby, who stands for an important principle of subway naps: They both demand and reward strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:11:34.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
