REUTERS/Anthony Phelps 5/5 By Harry Pearl | SYDNEY \nSYDNEY New Zealand conservation authorities said 240 pilot whales that were stranded overnight at a remote bay which only days earlier had a larger beaching refloated themselves on Sunday and were swimming offshore. \n\"We had 240 whales strand yesterday in the afternoon and we were fearful we were going to end up with 240 dead whales this morning,\" Herb Christophers, a Department of Conservation spokesman said. \n\"But they self-rescued, in other words the tide came in and they were able to float off and swim out to sea.\" \nThe pod was the second large group to strand itself in recent days at Golden Bay, at the northwest tip of the South Island, in one of the worst mass strandings in New Zealand. \nOn Thursday evening, a conservation worker spotted that about 400 whales had washed ashore. Hundreds of volunteers spent days pouring water over the beached whales to try and keep them cool, while waiting to catch high tides to carry them out to sea again. \nBut most of the whales from that pod died. Officials will soon have to start clearing the carcasses, Christophers said. \nThe strandings have been New Zealand's largest in decades. \nThe precise cause was not known, though beached whales are not uncommon at Golden Bay. \nIts shallow muddy waters confuse the marine mammals' sonar, leaving them vulnerable to stranding by an ebb tide, according to marine environmental organisation Project Jonah. \nPilot whales are not listed as endangered, but little is known about their population in New Zealand waters. \n(Reporting by Harry Pearl; Editing by Richard Borsuk) Next In World News Khamenei says Sweden has good name among Iranians \nDUBAI Iran's supreme leader said on Saturday the United States and Western powers are regarded with suspicion in the Middle East because of their interference, but that Sweden has a good name among Iranians and is seen as a reputable economic partner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:21:52.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
