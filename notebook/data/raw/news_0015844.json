We give Rs 1,500 every month. After five years, 1,500 will become 90,000 and this will also increase,\" Parrikar had said on January 29. \n\nThe EC had sent a notice to Parrikar and sought his explanation by February 3 but the latter sought more time for his explanation. Reminding the former Goa Chief Minister of the provisions of the Model Code for elections, it said his remarks amounted to \"abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery\". \n\nInformed sources in the poll panel said Parrikar in his reply said what he meant to say was changed due to incorrect translation from Konkani to English.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:05:21.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
