(Photo: From 'Saturday Night Live'/NBC)\n“Saturday Night Live” is regaining the must-watch status that it enjoys from time to time, with its dependable weekly take-downs of President Donald Trump and his administration.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s always funny.\nThere was a lot of anticipation for Saturday’s episode in particular, since Alec Baldwin hosted (for a record 17th time). Baldwin has played Trump to acclaim for months — what would he do as host? How far would he and the show go?\nNot that far, actually. Baldwin only played the president in a skit toward the end of the show, in which Trump appeared in an episode of “The People’s Court,” trying to get his administration’s travel ban reinstated. The idea was funnier than the execution which, like many of Baldwin’s Trump bits, relies too heavily on the actor simply parroting Trump’s bizarre mannerisms and strange behavior.\n(To be fair, it’s a tough gig. “South Park” recently announced that it wouldn’t try to keep up with what’s going on in Washington, because it couldn’t match the craziness. “SNL” suffers similarly at times.)\nThe show’s best take on the new administration arrived last week as a surprise, with Melissa McCarthy’s guest spot playing press secretary Sean Spicer. She portrayed him as angry, defensive, always on the attack. She did the same thing this week, only more so — where last week she picked up the podium and went after reporters, this week the podium was motorized. Last week she used a Super Soaker squirt gun on the media. This week it was a leaf blower, turned on a reporter whose question he didn’t like.\n“That was me blowing away their dishonesty.”\nBigger, louder and more is not necessarily the key to successful comedy, something that seems lost on the show. Better was McCarthy/Spicer talking about “some light terrorism” this week, referencing Nordstrom’s decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. He showed off a bracelet and heels behind a Home Shopping Network-like graphic.\nFunny, too, was the use of “my dollies” to explain, with props, the travel ban to the press. He used one doll to represent a TSA agent; the other was Barbie. “Nice American girl,” he said. “Back from a dream vacation. We know she is OK, because she’s blond.”\nA darker-skinned Moana doll wasn’t so lucky; she, he explains, will be sent to Guantanamo Bay\nAgain on the good-idea-gone-too-far front, Kate McKinnon (who played Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Spicer skit) has been funny as Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, who, like her boss, has given the show plenty to ridicule. CNN personality Jake Tapper grilled her mercilessly this week, in real life. In the skit Conway broke into Tapper’s apartment (he was played by Beck Bennett), in a “Fatal Attraction”-like segment, and begged and threatened him to put her back on his show. It was kind of funny until she fell out a window, died and reanimated. You can’t go much more over the top than that.\n\"Elizabeth Warren came at me like a porcupine...\" #SNL pic.twitter.com/M1tn4hadIT\n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 12, 2017 The show was only funny in fits and starts, which has been true throughout its resurgent popularity. In fact, even at its best, it’s always been a bit of a hit-and-miss proposition. That’s how it goes with live comedy.\nIt all feels a bit like a wasted opportunity at the moment, and too predictable. That extends to the reaction.\nThose who don’t like Trump will talk about how great the show was, how it really went after the president. Those who support him will complain that every skit is a left-wing hit piece. But will anyone talk about how funny it was?\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.
