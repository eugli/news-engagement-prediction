Host Jimmy Kimmel at the 89th Oscars. –Mark Ralson/AFP/Getty Images By Kevin Slane February 26, 2017 \nJimmy Kimmel’s Oscars opening monologue on Sunday night had jokes at the expense of Mel Gibson, the Academy’s lack of diversity, and Donald Trump. But the host saved his longest, “meanest” insults for his rival Matt Damon. \nKimmel led into his Damon roast by suggesting that America might be slightly less fractured if everyone reached out to one person with whom they differ politically to have a candid conversation. \n“And tonight, in the spirit of healing and bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet with someone I’ve had issues with,” Kimmel said, as the camera cut to Damon. “Now Matt, I’ve known Matt for a long time. I’ve known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one.” Advertisement \nKimmel then pretended to give Damon credit for selflessly passing the lead role in Manchester by the Sea to Casey Affleck. \n“He could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend,” Kimmel said. “He handed what turned out to be an Oscar-caliber role over to his friend, and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. \n“And that movie, The Great Wall , went on to lose $80 million dollars,” Kimmel continued. “Smooth move, dumb***.” \nBefore the show even started, Damon joked with E! red carpet reporter Ryan Seacrest and ABC red carpet reporter Michael Strahan about his faux-feud with Kimmel . \n“I’m a member of the Academy, so I think I’ll definitely make it into the theater, but I don’t know what he’s going have in store for me,” Damon told Seacrest. “It’s going to be ugly.” \nKimmel, for his part, was watching Damon’s interviews and taking notes.
