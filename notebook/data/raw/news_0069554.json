(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2:29 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 2:29 p.m. ET \nPaul George had been considered untouchable in trade discussions ahead of Thursday's deadline — until now. \nThe Pacers are examining the trade market for their All-Star forward, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical . While this presents a change in Indiana's thinking, the Pacers are still trying to bolster the current roster in order to help George and give him more incentive to sign a long-term extension. The Pacers have gone so far as to dangle a first-round pick for an established wing or big man. \nMORE: Live updates and latest news ahead of NBA trade deadline \nNate Taylor of The Indy Star reported Tuesday that Indiana wouldn't consider any trade talks involving George, but Wojnarowski reports the Pacers have been pursuing a second path that would lead to a rebuild around talented young center Myles Turner. \nGeorge, who is averaging 22.5 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, is set to become a free agent in the summer of 2018. Sources told Wojnarowski that George has considered re-signing with the Pacers or leaving for the Lakers. George was born in Palmdale, Calif., and he has always shown a great deal of respect for Kobe Bryant, even naming his dog after the Lakers legend . George's relationship with LA and the Lakers' estimated cap room mean that link won't disappear. \nAny team hoping to snag George before the deadline would have to consider the possibility of George becoming a risky rental. In a star-driven league, though, George would be a major addition and someone who could change the direction of a franchise.
