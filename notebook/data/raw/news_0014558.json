Trish Dunell \nJason Waddell takes a major step in his comeback with a Group II victory aboard Wyndspelle. \nNobody has ever doubted Waddell's immense talent in the saddle, but at times he has been equally adept at finding trouble as he is the winning post. \nREAD MORE: * Relief for trainers as apprentice jockey cleared of injury following career best win \nBack in December 2015, Waddell was disqualified for 12 months for acting detrimentally to the interests of racing and improper riding. \nAt his hearing, it was alleged Waddell committed an act of deliberate interference and that he told a fellow jockey, he would do it again and was not concerned with the consequences. \nWaddell is no stranger to fronting disciplinary hearings, but the 2017 version of Jason Waddell seems to be a different, more mature man. \nThe 30-year-old said his first month back has \"exceeded all expectations\". \nIn 49 rides, Waddell has scored eight wins with seven seconds and six thirds. Only Opie Bosson, Leith Innes and Jacob Lowry have a better strike rate for riders who have had more than 40 starts this season. Ad Feedback \nWaddell says he owes that to the support of owners and trainers who have been happy to put him on quality horse flesh. \nSaturday's win was the icing on the cake for what has been a critical month of Waddell's career. \n\"I couldn't have imagined it going any better. \n\"Even just to be getting rides in the big races this season is a big thrill,\" he said. \nWaddell committed to the ride on Wyndspelle more than two weeks ago because he was so confident the Iffraaj colt could compete with the best three-year-old's in the country. \nSaturday's win was the first time Wyndspelle had come up with a decent draw, Logan said. But it was also the first time Waddell had been on his back. \nWaddell feels Wyndspelle has all the attributes a Derby horse needs and believes Saturday's run was the blueprint. \nHe is keen to stick with Wyndspelle for the $1 million Group I New Zealand Derby (2400m) at Ellerslie on March 4 and it is hard to imagine connections would be looking past him. \nFollowing Saturday's win, bookmakers slashed Wyndspelle's Derby price in half from $18-$9. \n\"I knew if he was three or four back on the rail he could go to sleep and then his turn of foot would put him right there at the finish. \n\"He went to sleep like a pussy cat, he just idled along and didn't waste any energy until I asked him to go.\" \nAs much as Waddell loves that wining feeling, following Saturday's victory, his thoughts were with the loyalty of the man who has been the rock behind his comeback - his manager Darryl Anderson. \n\"He's always stood by me through thick and thin and we've become close friends,\" Waddell said. \n\"Darryl's done a lot hard work, doing his homework and getting me the right rides and he'll be getting just as much of a kick out of this as I am, if not more.\" \nWaddell was always confident in his ability as a jockey, but has been surprised with how smoothly his return to the saddle has been. \n\"It had been four years since I'd had the silks on at a race day so I wasn't expecting to be seeing things so clearly in a race and for my judgement to be as good as it is.\" \nFollowing Saturday's success, the logical next step for Waddell is to get back into the Group I grove. \nHe has won five Group I races in New Zealand and has a Singapore Guineas victory. \nWaddell believes he has a great Oaks ride in Devise, who was a close second behind Nicoletta in the Group III Desert Gold Stakes at Trentham last week, and is obviously keen on Wyndspelle for the Derby but he is not getting ahead of himself. \n\"I'm just taking it one day at a time, all I'm thinking about now is riding at Ellerslie on Wednesday.\" \nWaddell does not have a ride in Group I races, the NRM sprint and Herbie Dyke Stakes at Te Rapa on Saturday, but with his effort aboard Wyndspelle fresh in the minds of owners and trainers, that may change. \nHe will ride Devise in the Group II Sir Cambridge Stud Sir Tristram Fillies Classic. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:06:46.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
