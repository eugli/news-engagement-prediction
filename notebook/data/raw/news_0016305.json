Nadhim Zahawi MP Credit: PA \nM r Zahawi said the Speaker had invited Chinese president Xi Jinping despite MPs being unhappy about his policy on Tibet, and the emir of Kuwait, which bans British dual nationals of Israeli origin, to speak in Parliament. \nHe said Mr Bercow should now \"think about\" his position and explain his remarks to Parliament. \nThe Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think it is, in my book, unwise and he opens himself up to the accusation of hypocrisy, that's my point.\" \nL ord Lamont, the former Tory Chancellor, told Sky News he believed Mr Bercow had \"gone too far\" and \"made a terrible error\". \nJohn Whittingdale, the former CultureSeecretary, said Mr Bercow’s speech was \"damaging to the national interest\". \nHe accused Mr Bercow of \"playing to the gallery for as much publicity as possible\" and suggested the Speaker could have had a \"quiet word\" with the Prime Minister rather than speaking publicly. Lord Fowler Credit: Geoff Pugh \nL ord Speaker Lord Fowler is expected to make his own statement on the issue at 2.30pm this afternoon. \nA source close to the peer told the Telegraph he will \"express his disappointment that John Bercow did not consult him before he made a statement in the House.\" \nAdding: \"No one has had a request for Trump to speak and he believes that it is not their role to take a view before that has come in. \n\"He is no fan of Trump himself - he has some reservations about some of his policies, but that formal request has not come in. \n\"Lord Fowler felt put out that John had gone ahead and done this without informing him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:02:31.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
