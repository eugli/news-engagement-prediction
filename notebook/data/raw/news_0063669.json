She used lies to deflect the truth and anger me. Porsha is a hypocrite and a liar. Bottom line is if you're a woman that has hooked up with a girl before, don't go around throwing \"shade\" at someone because they've done the same thing.” \n\n\nShe continued, “I'm very transparent. I'm married. I love my husband. I'm not in the closet. I don't have a sex dungeon. I've never had a seven year relationship with a woman. Porsha still hasn't sent me the name or number of whoever this anonymous woman is.” \n\nThe highest-paid housewife also doesn’t believe rumors of her husband’s infidelity. \n\n“My husband doesn't tell people his name is \"Marvin\" to cheat. People recognize him on the streets before they do me, so who would believe him if he had?” \nKandi continued to point out Porsha’s hypocritical ways, saying the divorceé admitted to kissing her but “blamed it on the Henny.” \nWho do you believe, Porsha or Kandi?
