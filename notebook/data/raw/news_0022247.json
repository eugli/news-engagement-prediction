Mr Vreeland could be seen nearby, also wearing armour, but carrying a camera. \n\"We felt a little afraid for our lives when we were pulled over, so we figured we better protect ourselves,\" he added, tilting the camera to show the rifle. Five ways US gun debate has changed \nMoments after walking through the front door of the building, officers drew their weapons and told the pair to drop all weapons. \n\"Put it on the ground, now ... or you are dead. I will shoot you!\" one officer can be heard shouting, before Mr Baker dropped his camera. \n\"I will put a round in you, sir! Put that rifle on the ground,\" an officer can be heard saying. \nOne of the two activists can be heard arguing that the guns are legal under open-carry laws. \nBoth men were arrested, and according to Mr Baker's Facebook page, were each charged with misdemeanours (lesser criminal acts). 'Reckless' \nPolice said they had seized a \"loaded AP-14 firearm\", an AR-15 rifle, an \"AK-47 style\" rifle, a loaded Glock 19 handgun, dozens of rounds of ammunition, body armour and ballistic vests, and camera equipment. \nAlthough openly carrying firearms is permitted in the state, the stunt drew widespread criticism from both law enforcement and gun rights advocates. \nDearborn's Police Chief, Ronald Haddad, said the behaviour was \"totally unacceptable and irresponsible\" and was not related to the constitutional right to bear arms. \n\"We had members of the public in our lobby that fled in fear for their safety, as these men entered our building,\" he said. \nThe president of Michigan Open Carry, a gun rights advocacy group, called Chief Haddad to condemn the stunt. \n\"It is our belief that their actions were reckless, and primarily designed to draw attention and a response,\" the group said in a statement. \n\"Wearing a mask, dark glasses, visible body armour, and a rifle slung across your chest instils a very specific image that cannot be ignored,\" it added.
