(AP Photo / Andrew Harnik) Vivian Salama,  32AM EST \nWASHINGTON -- A senior Trump administration official was fired following criticism in a private speech of U.S.   policies and his inner circle of advisers. \nCraig Deare, whom Trump appointed a month ago to head the National Security Council's Western Hemisphere division, was on Friday escorted out of the Executive Office Building, where he worked in Washington. \nA senior White House official confirmed that Deare is no longer working at the NSC and has returned to the position he previously held at the National Defence University. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an incident not otherwise made public, and provided no further details. \nBut current and former administration officials say Deare's termination was linked to remarks he made Thursday at a private talk at the Wilson Center, a Washington think-tank. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. \nAccording to one person who attended the discussion, Deare slammed the Trump administration for its policies on Latin America, specifically its rocky start to relations with Mexico. That person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private event. \nTrump signed an order in the first week of his presidency to build a border wall with Mexico, jumpstarting a campaign promise. The move prompted Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto to cancel his trip to Washington in late January. \nThe person who attended the Wilson Center discussion also said that Deare openly expressed frustration over being cut out of most of the policy discussions about Mexico, saying that members of Trump's inner circle, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, have not consulted with NSC directorates as the White House formulates policy. \nDeare has been on the faculty of National Defence University in Washington since 2001. He joined the university's College of International Security Affairs in 2010 and most recently served as dean of administration. \nThe person who attended the Wilson Center talk also noted that Deare made several remarks about how attractive Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, appeared, remarks that person described as \"awkward.\" \nDeare did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials with the Wilson Center also declined a request for information, saying the discussion was off the record. \nDeare is the second senior NSC official to leave in under a week. On Monday, Trump's national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, resigned after revelations that he discussed sanctions with a Russian diplomat before Trump was sworn in, then misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the nature of those conversations.
