On Game of Clones singletons are presented with their exact type (Photo: Channel 4) They must choose from eight clones (Photo: Channel 4) \nEvery day the clones will take part in group dates to help the singleton work out whose personality they like the best. \nThe unusual dates will include a Bollywood performance, wine tasting and even designing tattoos. \nIf the dates go well, the clones can earn some one-on-one time with the singleton in the Love Mobile – the car that takes them back to the house. They go on dates every night for a week (Photo: Channel 4) Singletons virtually create their exact type (Photo: Channel 4) \nBut a dating disaster would see them send to the Dumping Room where they have to plead for their place. \nEach night a clone is dumped and after a week the singleton will be left with their final three and must decide who is their “one and clonely” to join them for a final date. \nThe first episode will see 23-year-old Charlotte design the man of her dreams. \n* Game of Clones starts at 7:30pm from Monday 27 February on E4 Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:10:29.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
