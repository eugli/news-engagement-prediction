Illegal step? \nLast month, Mr Hamilton set out revised 2017 RHI regulations in a bid to cut costs and ease the financial burden. \nLawyers for the Renewable Heat Association (RHANI) of Northern Ireland are set to claim this was an illegal step against boiler owners with 20-year contracts. \nPart of their case is that 2017 regulations are rendered unlawful because they were not discussed and agreed on by the Executive. \nMr Larkin will definitely now feature in that case after an issue of devolution was raised. \n\"The 2012 regulations never came before he Executive to be discussed and agreed,\" he told the court. \n\"So the point that is made against the 2017 regulations it seems to me can equally be made against the 2012 regulations.\" \nProceedings have been brought by RHANI and some boiler owners have been granted anonymity in a separate action against Mr Hamilton's plans to publish the identities of those using the scheme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:46:12.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
