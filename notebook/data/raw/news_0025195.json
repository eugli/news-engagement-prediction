Blackouts could happen instantly to protect supply \nThe AEMO said it was working to reduce the need for so-called \"load shedding events\", like the one which saw 40,000 properties lose power in Adelaide for 45 minutes last night. \nThe event occurs when the operator directs power companies to switch off customers' power supply because the electricity network is at risk. We take a look at the process of load shedding and why it takes place. \n\"Load shedding could occur instantly if the demand supply balance changed rapidly,\" the statement said. \nAEMO said it was in contact with generators in New South Wales and the State Government to try mitigate such an event. \nGrattan Institute energy specialist David Blowers said hot weather had sparked load shedding in the past, but it was not a frequent occurrence. \n\"Not just in South Australia but also in NSW today facing pretty tight supply conditions,\" he said. \n\"And when it has been as hot as it has for as many days as it has, that's when the system really comes under pressure.\" Video: Why is South Australia running out of power? (ABC News) Residents encouraged to save energy \nNSW Energy and Utilities Minister Don Harwin has encouraged the people to play their part in easing the strain on the state's power supplies. \n\"Turn up your air conditioners to 26 degrees, adjust fridge temperatures, switch off unused electrical appliances and turn off lights when it's safe to do so,\" Mr Harwin said. \n\"We encourage the community to reduce their energy use where possible.\" \nMr Harwin said he would be kept up to date as the situation developed and further action would be taken if required. \n\"We are working with AEMO, TransGrid and generators to ensure that all generation capacity is operating including coal, hydro, gas wind and solar,\" he said. \n\"We will make sure that the energy companies are informing their customers and we will update the community as we know more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:45:54.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
