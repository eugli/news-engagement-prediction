The resort's entry is being guarded by the police and AIADMK members, and people are not allowed to go near or inside. \nLate Thursday afternoon, AIADMK member K Pandiarajan attempted to quell the coercion rumours saying, \"MLAs have been staying at their convenience at hotels etc, they have not been forced or compelled to do anything.\" \n#2 ONE HILARIOUS CHANGE OF CAMP \nAdding an unbelievable, Bollywood-like twist to the story is Sivaikuntam MLA SP Shamuganathan. \nShamuganathan was one of the 130+ MLAs who were to board a bus to the luxury resort everyone was being taken to, but he had a sudden change of heart and changed his allegiance to OPS. \nAccording to a report in Hindustan Times, Shanmuganathan told those in charge getting the MLAs on the bus \"that he was feeling giddy and wanted to take medicines.\" \nAfter going out for some time, Shanmuganathan returned, only to slip away for a second time -- with the excuse of taking a bathroom break. As it happened: One MLA (cannot name), in a hotel told Dhivaharan's man that he needed to take a leak. Escaped & just landed in OPS res -:) â€” SriramMADRAS (@SriramMadras) February 8, 2017 \nHe was next seen at Panneerselvam's residence, where he declared support for the caretaker chief minister. \n#3 OPS STRIKES BACK: AIADMK BANK ACCOUNT FREEZE \nAs the support for him gained a spine, Panneerselvam turned his boss mode on as well. Panneerselvam writes to banks, says don't endorse AIADMK transactions not bearing his name, says his expulsion as treasurer invalid. â€” Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) February 8, 2017 \nLate Tuesday night, OPS wrote to banks saying his expulsion as treasurer was invalid and that no one should be allowed to operate AIADMK's accounts without his \"written consent and instructions,\" effectively freezing party funds. OPS writes to bank as Treasurer of ADMK that none should be allowed to operate the ADMK Party's current account. #OPS da pic.twitter.com/h5k657Kjk8 â€” SriramMADRAS (@SriramMadras) February 8, 2017 \n#4 STRIKE TWO \nAccording to reports Panneerselvam called Chennai Commissioner of Police S George, to do something and prevent the \"kidnapping\" of AIDMK MLAs. An unamused George, however, hung up on OPS midway. \nAn angry OPS then consulted with Governor Vidyasagar Rao and chalked up a plan to boot the commissioner out. From OPS camp. CM called up chennai CP and told him to file case of kidnapping based on complaint of 4 MLAs who had escaped. He refused. â€” T S Sudhir (@Iamtssudhir) February 9, 2017 CM #panneerselvam decided to shunt out #chennai CP. Asked CS to ask governor for permission. If Rao okays, CM will issue transfer order. â€” T S Sudhir (@Iamtssudhir) February 9, 2017 #chennai top cop George may be transferred say sources. â€” T S Sudhir (@Iamtssudhir) February 9, 2017 \nS George will likely be replaced by Thursday night and Tamil Nadu DGP TK Rajendran could be transferred as well. \n#5 STRIKE THREE: MOVE TO MAKE SASIKALA HOMELESS \nPanneerselvam's next masterstroke came as a decision to make Sasikala homeless. \nHe announced that Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence -- which is where Sasikala is currently living -- will be turned into a memorial for the former chief minister who died in December past year. Hon CM to issue orders to make Poes Garden residence as Amma's memorial. â€” ???? O. Pannerselvam (@CMOTamilNadu) February 9, 2017 \nThough there is some speculation that Sasikala inherited the property, though there is no clarity on whether Amma left behind a legal will. \nPoes Garden Jayalalithaa's home for 35 years, where Sasikala lived with her too. After a rift back in 2012, Amma made Sasikala and her family leave the house. Sasikala then wrote an apology letter to Jaya, who allowed her back in on one condition: Sasikala's family was not invited. \nAfter Jaya's death, Sasikala's family -- who is known to be associated with the infamous Mannargudi Mafia -- was back at the house. OPS' decision appears to have been triggered out of anger to this. \n\"The people that Amma did not want around are now at Amma's house, and they call us traitors,\" he had told reporters earlier on Thursday. Next plan is to march towards #AIADMK HQ and move Sasikala out.. #Th #AIADMK daaa... â€” Hari Prabhakaran (@Hariadmk) February 9, 2017 \n#6 'MYSTERY AROUND AMMA'S DEATH' \nIn a massive win for Panneerselvam, E Madhusudhanan -- an MGR loyalist and AIADMK Presidium Chairman -- declared support for OPS at the caretaker chief minister's residence. In his speech Madhusudhanan reiterated allegations of \"mystery surrounding Amma's death.\" \nHours before Madhusudhanan's comment, Jayalalithaa's acupuncturist Dr MN Shankar told India Today that Jayalalithaa's death should be probed for the 'clarity of the people'. \n\"Everyone is saying something had happened. But the drugs that were given to her, steroids, are very dangerous,\" he said. \nShankar said Jaya was suffering from multiple medical problems, but saw \"dramatic improvement\" under his care. When asked why he didn't get in touch with doctors or supporters at Apollo, he said, \"In the break, I had to go abroad. When I came back she had been admitted to Apollo. That time too I was not called. They never called me for a review. How can I go there myself?\" \n# # # \nThe drama in the fight between Panneerselvam and Sasikala could reach its climax once the TN Governor takes a decision based on his meetings with two. Until then, who knows what other bombshells the state will send our way.
