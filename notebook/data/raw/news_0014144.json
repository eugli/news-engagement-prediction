HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE   ADVERTISEMENT \nJustice Department lawyers on Saturday filed notice that they will appeal a federal judge’s ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s immigration order. \nDOJ attorney Michelle Bennett filed paperwork Saturday evening to appeal a temporary restraining order against Trump’s travel ban issued a day earlier by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle. The case likely will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nMeanwhile, Trump’s order remains blocked. Travel to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries resumed Saturday after federal officials announced they would stop enforcing key provisions of the president’s order. Some 60,000 previously revoked visas were recognized again, and refugee resettlement restarted. \nThe three judges who likely will hear the appeal are Judge William Canby, appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Richard Clifton, appointed by George W. Bush; and Michelle Friedland, appointed by Barack Obama. \nThe White House said shortly after Robart’s order that it would challenge it, and issued a statement calling the ruling “outrageous.” \nTrump on Saturday lashed Robart , who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2003, in a daylong series of tweets. The president called Robart a “so-called” judge and warned that because of him, “many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.” The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nRobart’s ruling was issued in response to a challenge of Trump’s order filed by Washington state and joined by Minnesota. The judge said the states had “met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order.” Trump’s edict, Robart said, adversely affected education, employment and the freedom to travel.
