When I see it let's news these forests and I honestly with mourned. Hold everything into them. Crews are others and I kids seven. They iron and I feel like they can handle that pressure. And I feel that I can live through it. Villanova has an uptrend. Tenet told them that it's an understood him hey Fuzzy because so yeah they're not doing anything by antagonizing them. There's a couple of people there. But South Carolina State. Okay did we need. I. I'm not initiative collect anything you know at some protesters do you know and as. In some offices. But though that's only because Donald Susan escalated before and we check everything to defend our people. But that's wave. Do you counsel really speaks. Staying there compared with this. As I've had nothing. I'll Maki. This move it to give Glenn you gotta stay positive and suitcase bombs and is. This is a ceremony and we have to protect what we have here and that's our prayer. And this is one thing that. Can't stop. For months standing rock Sioux and their allies have camped out. On the banks of the Campbell River in North Dakota. Their mission. To stop the Dakota access pipelines. A three point seven billion dollar project slated to deliver crude oil from North Dakota to southern Illinois. The proposed route comes within 15100 feet for the current standing rock reservation and the tribe. Here's the pipeline will contaminate it's drinking water and destroy its sacred sites. It's a cause that's drawn the support of thousands from across the globe. But at the heart of it all there's a little known group of indigenous youth who was helped steer the movement from the very beginning. They are known as the international indigenous youth council. Four I allied YC. I didn't ever really I know he leaving them. People think kids these days again. Night at a nine nothing in Italy takes it seriously really the whole on the lineal deal and it well like we're really Lisa Meyer. I believe that these started this moment so we would be the lens to make that last and to finish this movement. Because none of us. Are here to losing. Go back home you know. You thank you think those Lexington everybody's gonna help us. It's going to be nice. We're gonna celebrate. I. These started this movement. With Jason charge and then you know dapper image NE two DC in Omaha and they ran a long way that's a long way friend Ken Ambon like Dakota to Washington DC. But they did it. Yeah. The big club. There I was pretty cruel a kind of problem in Gottesman spiritual being and that risks they would do as many people as there was on the run because you're just bringing awareness. I'll might expect the political infants ideas but this plane. I didn't and elegantly too with the specifics. This on massive ceremony. And welfare. And that soon meaning. He is Karen slowly started it cute Stanley. I people they came to the face me. His me my brother Alex in our friend Jason chargers Tyrrell. And a very freeze counseling. Now we're are currently twenty you know kind of wish people fainting coming term meetings between thirty and fifty people. It's powerful to see. Hello no just a small group of people and when there was really no news less than ten of us when we started. Now we have this this whole movement. You know we we laugh together and we kind I didn't know who won big fan me. In its awesome. Because a lot of us here in youth counseling you know me being Andrew who had been a fan like this before. Never had people cared about them you know the way we care about them and it's it's healing. It's historic. We've proven that ended his kids were ripped from their families and cleansed of everything that we had we cut a cutter handy fetus and he spoke our language we weren't allowed to pray we weren't allowed to Wear clothes. We we're not allowed to be who we are. It. And so. Where are finally coming back in where healing with one another and allowing ourselves to become the leaders that we know we are. There's a La in my life that I learned from. I grew up brown. American Indian movement leaders. I come from a long line of land protectors and water protectors. My ancestors no irons Q is to achieve through the whole. Tee time through each side. We've been silent for so long with the historical trauma that we face aren't identity used it for months voices were taken from us. Now we have them that we in the stand further broken she's. Political prisoners and more in this is you know we're in the seventh generation. Simply put to even begin to understand what's happening it's standing rock. You have to go back centuries. The ancestors of the standing rock Sioux originally inhabited the Great Lakes region. The by the seventeenth century an influx of white fur traders and competition among other tribes dwindling resources. Push them west onto the great plan. But the 1840 discovery of gold in California. Unleashed a wave of white fortune seekers who crossed into territory on route. Setting off a series of complications that resulted in the signing of the historic fort Laramie treaty of 1851. In exchange for seating all of their territory east of the Missouri River the Sioux were promised land extending from outside modern day Bismarck, North Dakota. All the way to southern Nebraska. An area that now includes the current code access pipeline route. 1950 when treating entered into a piece. With the federal government before the ink was dry. Question this story coming through. The federal government. Did little to stop white settlers from encroaching further into some links. And a subsequent treaty in 1868. Followed by several congressional acts resulted in the suit losing most of the land originally set aside for them. There's not one senator. One. Back and say our lands were not illegally taking. By the close of the nineteenth century. This you had endured abuse of assimilation schools the outlawing of their religion dependence on government aid. And one of the worst massacres in American history. We live with so many broken promises. There's all these things that happened T tribes over time. Where in just. Were not right and today we're saying no. We'll put this I think it enough is enough respect our lands. Respect our people respect our rights. The companies in the try to ran around this thing through our throats. It's buses they can and they're doing it. Representatives from Energy Transfer Partners parent company to code access pipeline. Declined to be interviewed. But in the past they have claimed the pipeline is a safer alternative to truck in real transportation of crude oil and that it poses no significant threat to the tribes drinking water. Or sacred sites. Likely in reference to a series of 2015 public hearings on the project the tribal officials did not attend. Kelcy Warren the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners told the Wall Street Journal. I really wish for the standing rock suit that they had engaged in discussions way before they did. We could've changed the route he could've been done but it's too late. There's but monitor. Might just push and there's agreement this coma. But according to a newly released audio recording from the first meeting between the tribe in pipeline officials in 2014. A full year before the permitting process began Energy Transfer Partners has known all along of the tribe felt about their project. Network. Good morning thank you so much for allowing us to be here today I am Tammy about what's a code access pipeline and I know that one. The representatives from them from standing rock has and has contacted. The parent company Energy Transfer Partners who owns to put apps has pipeline. With some environmental questions amenities that we're here tend to teach other projects and to answer questions and. And just between this plea is project two don't understand. We recognize our our treaty boundaries. Before they reach he. 1850 when an 1868. Because of that we we oppose the local pipeline we have a spending resolution that was past few dolphins while. That opposes any. Pipeline. Within that treaty bone. Food mostly at all common common in. This is something that the tribe has supporting. The thought that type of not. Which. Vicki Chan. From the beginning it's known by the picks the PUC it's known by the company. Known by an Army Corps of Engineers. That we do not want this pipeline comes. The standard feature has always. Maintain the position that we're about protecting one. We're about protecting there are sacred places where about protecting their sovereign state revolved protecting. On the future. Are our future generations with the children who are not yet born. And we have always opposed the sprightly. Not for any other reasons. Move those our our reasons. But on July 25 2016. Despite pleas from three different federal agencies urging them to consult further with the tribe. The Army Corps of Engineers issued the environmental assessment needed for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River claiming they had adequately consulted with the tried. A month later the tribes in the army corps for not properly consulting them eleven days after that. Energy transfer sued the tribe for blocking construction the fight. Was just getting started. This whistles than that. Created a rising pension and business people spirit plea. And across the world to support is overwhelming and there. Saying enough is you know. Beginning in the spring 2016. The first protest camps begin to take shape just south of pipeline construction sites. He started out small. About 300 people. And after a couple weeks and went to thousands. Tonight everything grew so fast. Winona cast so established the first kitchen at the ocean. Extended Ellis one kitchen and as the Tribe's KM. They created their own kitchen for their people final at one time there was eight non I don't even on how many now. Kitchens aren't the only service found in camp there's an art supply ten. A legal services and a donation center as well as 24 hour medical services and. We have excellent medical services there was doctors nurses and native and herbal medicines lots of skilled. Personnel care. The perhaps the most important service in camp can be found at the indigenous peoples power project. This is stationed. Cars and strength sessions are being offered and then at ten. The orientation goes over a set of principles and about her condition has seen some time here so these senate action that came up. One Texas. If we do our best returns many people's Newton. Mentioned that says. We won't even though it's. It is. A full. Obama is definitely or aspect of it and win this movement starting. Ceremony was held and that ceremony as spiritual guidance him. Experience. As long as people peaceful and careful in this fight that. Went. When this camp started the spirits told us you know. We have to to follow behind the youth and we have to stand prayer. And so you know as a youth council and and you know beings. You know spiritually here for in the youth. No we try to keep people knowing that a state of mind. Where young you know on the front lines there would every on the column we always remind people to stay in prairie enough we see people getting. You know worked very very you know they have and they look like they're having a hard time you know we talk to them we pull them aside. Just because that's kind of their old that we could and we placed ourselves and you know the you know I really empowers people known to to see young people doing this we want people to to see yes than know who we are and know that we're there to help.

The sport's first for the generation and a fifth of that they'll have this strong sense of unity you know have the strong sense of sovereignty. No from a young age and me personally. And I'm willing to send my life on the line to protect smother. To protect this way of life from human commandeered. And so I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I hope it doesn't come down to that no known. Crazy Horse. In one sentence in today's a good day today. On September 3 2016. Dakota access pipeline construction crews began bulldozing ground that had only a day earlier been identified by the tried in court as containing secret sites. In response hundreds of people climbed the fence to confront the construction workers. Among them the machinists upwelling and I YC member. When we first got there. Anything about what looked to be about seven individuals. Having these dogs than holding on to them and it looked at this dogs because. She got. Mean dog and with the in two. Traditionally is sick so I leaned down and it crowds. Can liken us locked position going conscience. Two in the current. When I try to going to petted the woman. Then.

And then somebody turned the means they said your bleeding and they looked down and my whole breast was full blood. In there is hope and simmered in mind teacher. And construction crews eventually left the scene that day. Police reported that several private security officers were injured during the confrontation. Everything you've been here hands and social media social media that this is has been peaceful. And they wanted to do it by fair this is not too weak to do this Disney's Cuba come to an end he's in agreement that needs to go with throttle. Leadership. And get together and put an end to this an issue that has done properly in the courts and not done this. Yeah. Tribal officials claimed twelve people were bitten by the security dogs. The dog handlers did not respond ABC news' request for comment but a subsequent investigation by the local sheriff's office found. They were not properly licensed. That Dave I got bit by a dog. With only the beginning of their violence. Now today's. Were shot at with all rubber bullets. May starting spot with its big cans and peppers very. Smoke canisters thrown at us. When we did not when we're doing nothing but wanting them kick it off ticket plan. I'm Tobin turning back and we wind says stand in solidarity and pain. Fire Brothers and sisters that headlock down arms and equipment. They seem like we're just surrounded by riot police and army vehicles tonight. And it officers standing train that runs in Chicago and then I'll list on this select students for a peaceful people like you know we are praying. Or. As law enforcement closed in on her group. Lauren says she began trying to convince the officers to let a small child seeing. I was speaking to an off stage and I have noticed. Member of the National Guard behind him he was in military fatigues as and had to face mask on in. He was head of the turn in his hand and he was like. Right behind them like just staring at me I would just noticing an announcement Texas office. So my name grabbed the Blaine name motioned for the officers take him so he can. And a scene that Cobb. I just think he was back there and then this speculating as in friend my face with that the turned. Town meeting get the F bag. And he this site. Started in like bashing my hand. Well it's aim them and in the boy I was still with me. And I had to push the blame back in my friendly and Danny that the plane returned the console of women.

And he just like asses like three or four different times and I guess I didn't notice it offers is adrenaline. But as those walking away just felt it really hurting and you know appendages was like oh yeah guy Kidd. He had a happy and then that's a real thing that just happens. It. Boren says she was first rushed back to the medic tent to camp then to a nearby reservation hospital. This senate this mother's body small fractures in the night tiny little bottles of Marius. Because I can't. Can't end it like it's patriots' maintenance. Mosaic okay. Although the hills and I can't really stop it and doing you know this could have bodies at risk it lives. October 22 marked the first mass arrests carried out by the Morton county sheriff's office which denied boring story in an email to ABC news. More than a 140 people were rested. Including several journalists. Lauren returned to the front lines the next day. And less than a week later on October 27 police forces would clear a newly established winter camp on land owned by decode access pipeline. It was known as sacred grounds. All of us that in. You see these military vehicles as humvees. Slowly inching towards us with men. Both sides and then there are under the cops there and they were coming out us. And we didn't know it's do. Or I. Are you can count they learned a rescue people laughed and I knew there may mean people. Mailers hitting people at the time and you know win this thing on this it's scary. It's not easy because my sister likes to down in the Frontline. Yeah officer at that. Actions handed grab my areas in case some terrorist Osama look NN -- intends. Right away went from there is student misses again. Let's take care and their rents and a couple people from behind grabbed me. So I can't get away and I just got to back that they went back. Mean. It's gonna hang any league either way I could either be her at can't feeling sorry for his where can be at the front lines hurting him. Helping people. How far council members were. Arrested that day. We were on nine minutes we were in he's been weavers and prayers. People. We're also getting out of hand and archives by by us now. I don't blame them you know this has happened for so long that it's not gonna happen right now in this tender age. You know after we were arrested they how this on the side of their road. For hours. While bulldozers. Known win over there. The burial sites known they were working you know full force behind us. And we had to say there you know with restraints on and watch that happen. It was. It was a sad day. And clearing of sacred grounds can could result in more than a 140 arrests. Police claimed rocks and other decree were thrown at them due to the outbreak of several fires nearly all of those arrested were charged with a felony count of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion. But those charges were later thrown out by a judge. Most of those who arrested that day were first brought the Morton county law enforcement center for processing. Before being shipped out to jails all across the state. They would which you re in holding cells as they call on all of us have our rests just referred to him as dog kennel. Her basically. Chain link fence wire mesh cells. Bought ten feet by twelve to fourteen feet long. And I know that the sheriff departments come out and said that these holding cells. As they call him were approved by the department of corrections the dog kennels again refer them to or in their parking garage for the or via. County jail so here you have guys with just their hats. Coal concrete floor. In a parking garage and sighed dog kennels with the ambient air temperature being around 4045. Degrees. They call that approved by the department corrections. Well we call it a humane. Like everyone else arrested that day a number was written on Ron's arm for identification purposes. And so the idea that that's the only way they can recognize you with buy your number. We find that very offensive. To be right keepers keeping us in and you mean dog kennels and writing numbers on us. Doubts that's just not a -- get treated in America are not supposed to get treated. Morton county sheriff Kyle Kirch Meyer told ABC news in a brief interview that the protest activities that standing rock and put a tremendous amount of strain on his officers. Well as we go through this and you know as this has started back since August 10. And so it's been on it's going on for. A time now and it definitely is very. Taxing and straining as we continue to. To find the very peaceful resolution to you know to go to the protest into the activities soul. You know you just gotta take it and I take it dated date if you go to work. You see what happens in you you go from there but the number one thing here is maintaining the public safety. And that goal is not between. The sheriff has long claimed the protests are not peaceful. And that his officers have behaved professionally in an extremely difficult situation. Law enforcement isn't the aggressor here and we are not the attackers the only time that law enforcement is responding. To these situations. Is win the aggression is taken out against law enforcement. And we have the right and the lawful duty to make sure that the pieces maintain. And that's what we're doing. When we aren't confronted me. We don't want to become the very thing that is hurting. Front yeah. And in the aftermath of the confrontations at the sacred grounds camp the international indigenous youth council feared the movement might lose its grounding in peaceful ceremony. It's along with other groups that can't be helped organize an action they hoped would restore a sense of harmony. They called it the forgiveness march him. That forgiveness for actions or if I loved how it happened because that in violated any traffic. I remember walking through this the tunnel a tunnel that went across the bridge. And I'm really looking back and theme. The Clinton people here on tunneling through with little those little path. They were on there to pray. On the air district and an ambulance. Own way. You know was just like. I felt really felt really really good about that day soon. When we yeah. I didn't go out. Okay. Again. Oh. This is a great opportunities grass really to connect with. The police officers on a human to human level I don't think the police officers are horrible people the people that are here like we're not. We're not fighting against. For peace initiatives department you know like grace period to stop crying in here to protect water. I hope it touches some of their heart. News it. On average let me having. Eaton. I severely hard. At this time we must also say that we are not perfect. People I've gotten. We did things and he's got things on that that pay. Or not find this. All issue up humility. Lucky to stay. Somewhat mild she told me. Not only mean. I forget it. It also means I'm asking you to give me. So we stand here today. Acknowledged. Pit bulls eyes and how to parent. And dinner. I. Back to camp the next day DI YC let another action aimed at bringing the movement back to its center. We want and to do not just a prayer march. Just to keep you remind people why we're here. So we did a silent march. Was it. No silence ourselves and we've we've already been silenced for so long over the past few centuries. But it was more to showed discipline. You know and humanity. It was kind of hard to believe that you know. There was 400 people locking behind me because you couldn't here's thing. When the marchers reached the barricaded the back water bridge to row another highway C members had the rest of the group wait for they approached the police line. Today bridge. And we prayed with the police there we offered them on her that that we prayed with music you know ceremony. Known there was five of them on the and one of them you know except in offered. Not only us that de officers are also humans. But it also showed you know a lot of humility. And period should on the officers part knowing that you're known by taking that liberian. By a crane with us he knew that the other officers there would know would treat him differently. And something that I'll never forget just because. Of how together we Wear in you know unified we were. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the arrival of winter did little to persuade people to leave camp. And wood and propane continue to pour in that's pence gave way to hard structure. Yeah yeah. It's. But on the night of November 20. The movement would get its first taste of what the winter meant for direct action on the high planes. Extradite here to the new flashpoint in the pipeline showdown North Dakota hundreds of protesters clashing with police and right here. Trying to block the pipelines construction. After seven demonstrators tried to move burnt out vehicles from the backwater bridge they were joined by hundreds of others who lined up in front of the police they're. Letters saying that with play. Two high pressure hoses. They would try to get someone's go down. And then once there and go down there just to act this very canons of right after them. By then there are due. Shooting tear gas at us. Garrity using water hose third shooting everybody with rubber bullet defendants. I'll let tear gas in my chest her flight maybe a week is pretty traumatized and you know monitor to see all that in. There is hard to see anything in hard to talk about it right now. Police described the night of November 20 as the riot. Heart. Quote data shot him. For speaking. Shot. The standing rock medic in healing council reported over 300 injuries that evening with when he six haven't been taken to hospital. Okay. Three days later on November Toney fifth the army corps issued what amounted to an eviction notice. By December 5 their lands would no longer be open to the public meaning everyone at the ocean Jessica we campus had to leave. Out. The announcement was quickly followed by an evacuation order issued by the governor and the more in county sheriff's department warned that anyone carrying supplies to camp. Would be subject to a thousand dollar fine. And yeah. I mean yeah. Ronnie. Hanging. That. Really hinging insight. Telling people who are already extremely annoyed that if you're really annoyed about it on this we'll have army tents over their sad. And if you really paranoid about viewing your kids we'll have those ready for use the you can go ahead sleep in there until that time passes. There going to do these companies. From the few about it. I phone carrier. You know this is my life in the past demons and connect with people in. To me. You know when I. And it's getting. And the DI YC and the winter was off to a bad start. But then an opportunity arose due. Sheriff's department and put out a list of donations. That police officers are asking for. And specifically the police officers who have been.
