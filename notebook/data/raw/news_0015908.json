(Photo: Michelle Pemberton / The Star) Buy Photo \nThis story was originally posted January 27, 2015. It has been updated. \nIt was a frigid Saturday afternoon when my husband and I, along with some friends, went to check out this \"big craft beer fest thing.\" We parked the car and walked toward a line snaking through the Indiana State Fairgrounds. \nIt wasn't long before we realized we were out of our league. We didn't have coats. We didn't have beards. We didn't have pretzel necklaces! \nWe forged on. Once inside and thawed out, we began a trek down a long line of tents, stopping at each to sample a beer, er, beers. When we made it to the end, we peered down several more rows of beer stations, then at each other. We didn't have a ride. Huge rookie mistake. \nWe sent emergency texts to our friends and family. Luckily, my sister and brother-in-law came to our rescue. They filled our beer bellies with food and drove us (and our car) safely home. \nYou can learn from our mistakes. Here is a guide to surviving the annual Brewers of Indiana Guild Winterfest . \nDon't be like us. \n1. Get a ride. \nDesignated driver tickets are $10 and include complimentary soda, coffee and water. (All tickets for 2017 are sold out, including designated driver tickets.) If you don't have a friend that wants to take on that responsibility, make sure to plan for a ride home. The samples may look small, but they add up. Here is a list of six ride services available in Indianapolis. \n2. Eat before you go. \nEats from Barto's Concessions will be available for purchase. However, I would still recommend eating a hearty lunch. Think carb-heavy foods such as pizza or pasta. Fatty foods are known to slow the absorption of alcohol, preventing hangovers. Also, drink your fair share of water before game time. Continue to alternate beer samples with the clear stuff throughout the event.
