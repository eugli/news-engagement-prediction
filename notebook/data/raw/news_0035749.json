that came a day after he launched a sustained attack on the media during a White House press conference .\nIn his latest barb aimed at US journalists, the Republican billionaire took to Twitter to accuse reporters of publishing “fake news” and singled out several broadcasters for criticism.\nMr Trump wrote: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!”\nRead more Intel community 'ready to go nuclear' against Trump over Russia ties Mr Trump has frequently attacked the media but has never before called it an enemy of the American public.\nIt comes a day after an astonishing news conference in which the US President criticised the press and commented on the nature of reporters’ questions. \nDuring a 77-minute sparring session with journalists, he claimed coverage based on White House leaks was “fake because so much of the news is fake”, despite admitting that the leaks are “absolutely real”.\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Asked by a CNN reporter how “real” leaks could generate “fake” stories, Mr Trump replied: “The reporting is fake. The public read newspapers, they see television. They don’t know if it is true or false because they are not involved.\n\"But I am involved, so I know when you're telling the truth and when you’re not.”\nThe New York businessman also responded sarcastically to questions from a number of outlets. He prefaced a question from the BBC’s Jon Sopel by saying, “Here’s another beauty”.\nWhen Mr Sopel insisted his question was “impartial, free and fair”, Mr Trump replied: “Yeah sure, just like CNN”.\nIn pictures: Protests, pomp and Donald Trump 30 show all In pictures: Protests, pomp and Donald Trump 1/30 President-elect Donald Trump acknowledges guests as he arrives on the platform at the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty Images\n2/30 Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump looks on during the 58th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington\nAP\n3/30 President Donald Trump shakes hands with Justice John Roberts after taking the oath at inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States\nReuters\n4/30 President Donald Trump raises his fists after his inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol\nGetty\n5/30 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump greets outgoing President Barack Obama before Trump is inaugurated during ceremonies on the Capitol in Washington\nReuters\n6/30 resident-elect Donald Trump arrives on the platform of the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty Images\n7/30 Attendees partake in the inauguration ceremonies to swear in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States at the U.S. Capitol in Washington DC\nReuters\n8/30 US President Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address during ceremonies at the US Capitol in Washington DC\nGetty\n9/30 U.S. President Donald Trump waves with wife Melania during the Inaugural Parade in Washington DC\nReuters\n10/30 Protesters registered their rage against the new president Friday in a chaotic confrontation with police who used pepper spray and stun grenades in a melee just blocks from Donald Trump's inaugural parade route.
