Here are five of the best slam dunks from previous years. 5. Dwight Howard - Superman - 2008 \nThere's always a lot of showmanship during the Slam Dunk Contest, but the vast majority of participants are unable to back it up. Dwight Howard in 2008, however, was not one of those people. \nBefore his attempt, the then Orlando Magic player unveiled a Superman top under his jersey, put on a Superman cape, and slammed home his dunk to win the contest. Some might say that this wasn’t actually a dunk because he didn’t touch the rim, but it was still a fabulous attempt. 4. Zach LaVine - Between His Legs - 2016 \nZach LaVine had already won the Slam Dunk Contest in 2015, but he had to do a lot to retain his title the following year because of the efforts of Aaron Gordon. Some will say he did exactly that. \nTaking off from around the free-throw line, the Minnesota Timberwolves star took the ball through his legs during flight before slamming the ball home in the hoop, causing a great reaction by the likes of Steph Curry and James Harden. 3. Michael Jordan - Free-Throw Slam - 1988 \nIn arguably the best Slam Dunk Contest ever, Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins squared off in a duel for the Slam Dunk crown in 1988. \nWilkins was a great competitor, but it was impossible for him to stop the greatest of all-time in Chicago. For his winning attempt, MJ took off from the free-throw line for his iconic dunk, scoring him a perfect 50 and retaining his title. 2. Aaron Gordon - Under The Legs and Mascot - 2016 \nGordon is the clear favourite to win the Slam Dunk Contest for the first time this year, but arguably, his first Slam Dunk title should have come in 2016 for this attempt. \nUsing Stuff the Magic Dragon who held the basketball in his hand over his head, the Magic star jumped over the mascot, cupped the ball with one hand, passed it under his legs, and then slammed it home. 1. Vince Carter - reverse 360-degree Windmill - 2000 \nVince Carter brought back the Slam Dunk Contest with a bang in 2000 with his fantastic attempts, one of them being the amazing reverse 360-degree windmill straight from the off. \nHe says as well that he didn't have a clue what he would do in the contest until he stepped onto the court, so to create this in a short space of time is truly incredible, and why it's one of the best dunks we have ever seen in the Slam Dunk Contest.
