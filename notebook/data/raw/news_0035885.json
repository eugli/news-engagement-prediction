Rishabh Pant of Delhi - who was on 3. \n\nIndia 'A' were 293 runs in arrears at stumps. \n\nStarting his innings in stunning fashion with a six over long on off the first ball he faced from Nathan Lyon, Iyer dominated the rival bowling, barring Jackson Bird, who was the pick of the Australian bowlers with his pace and movement at the Brabourne Stadium. \n\nIyer gave just once chance, off Lyon, soon after reaching his half century in 44 balls, but otherwise dominated the Aussie spin duo of Lyon, whom he hit for three sixes, and left-arm spinner Stepen O'Keefe, who was hoisted for two over the ropes by the youngster. \n\nAll the sixes were hit over long-on as Iyer, who is 15 runs short of his ninth first-class hundred in 38 games, danced down the track. \n\nThe 22-year-old batsman's innings was the pick of the India 'A' reply in which opener Priyank Panchal made 36 with six fours in 77 minutes, but was beaten often by lanky pacer Jackson Bird. \n\nThe other opener Akhil Herwadkar struggled his way to 4 in 48 minutes, Ankit Bawne made an attractive but all-too-brief 25 in 39 minutes with four hits to the fence while skipper Hardik Pandya too got a start before departing late in the day for 19, caught behind off Bird. \n\nIyer and Pandya, dropped on 3 at first slip by Matt Renshaw off Bird, had consolidated the innings after the fall of Bawne with a partnership of 52. \n\nIyer and Bawne had earlier steadied the innings after the loss of the two openers with a stand of 57 for the third wicket. \n\nFor Australia, Lyon - although punished by Iyer - showed good form as he got purchase off the track to pick up 2 for 72 while Bird, easily the most impressive of the visiting team's bowlers, did not allow the batsmen any freedom and also got rid of Pandya to end with excellent figures of 2 for 15 in 11 overs. \n\nIn the morning, Mitchell Marsh and Matthew Wade utilised the one-off opportunity to hit individual half centuries, ahead of the Test series opener.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:43:01.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
