At the summit Kerry outlined a regional peace initiative aimed at advancing an Israeli-Palestinian agreement with the support of the Sunni Arab states. Kerry’s initiative included Netanyahu’s main demand, that the Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish state, but even under these terms Netanyahu was reluctant to support the proposal, citing “coalition difficulties” and “overly detailed wording.” Ravid’s report clarified the basis on which Netanyahu, after the summit, conducted talks with Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog to possibly change the makeup of the coalition. Those contacts fell through, and Netanyahu instead took Yisrael Beiteinu into the coalition and buried for good the chances for a diplomatic move. The disappointment led the Obama administration to support UN Security Council Resolution 2334 , which established the principles of a future agreement, condemned Israel’s settlement policy and caused the Netanyahu government a great deal of embarrassment. Now it emerges that the Aqaba summit, which was convened two years after Kerry’s previously failed peace efforts, provided Netanyahu a rare opportunity to extract Israel from the diplomatic stalemate, revive the peace process and put together an allied front committed to a joint strategy. But Netanyahu failed this leadership test. At the moment of truth he preferred the political comfort of curling up with his right-wing base, led by his rival, Naftali Bennett, to taking a political chance for the benefit of Israel’s future. Netanyahu kept these developments a secret while throwing out vague hints about the close ties he’d forged with the Sunni states in the region. Through his close associate Natan Eshel, (“ The Israeli left prefers getting rid of Netanyahu to peace ,” Opinion, June 4, 2016), Netanyahu blamed Herzog for the missed opportunity because the latter ostensibly made the coalition talks difficult. But the responsibility rests with the prime minister, not with the head of the opposition, who justifiably had doubts about his interlocutor’s seriousness and commitment. If Netanyahu was the one who initiated the summit, as he told Likud ministers Monday , he should have created the political conditions to allow the peace initiative to be realized. Instead Netanyahu trashed the Kerry initiative and evaded fulfilling the promises he made to Kerry, Abdullah and Sissi to make gestures to the Palestinians in the territories. At the moment of truth the prime minister preferred his partnership with Bennett, who is dragging Israel to the abyss of annexation and apartheid, over the chance to advance the two-state solution with regional backing.
