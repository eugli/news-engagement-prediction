So it is wrong for the company to have moved funds meant for gas infrastructure projects to another subhead.” \nAccusing the company of abuse of due process when it presented its 2016 budget performance to the committee, Senator reminded the company that a budgetary balance of $1.8 billion was carried over from 2015 to 2016, while the sum of $ 3.8 billion was provided for in 2016 out of which it spent $4.2 billion leaving a huge balance, adding that $ 422 million was allocated in the 2016 Budget for gas infrastructure projects out of which it spent $ 318 million. \nAsked to explain the reason for the debit balance in view of information to the contrary, Engr. Dafe Sejebor said that the budgetary balance was used to settle outstanding joint venture commitments. \nThe committee then ordered the company to furnish it with details of shortfalls of funds allocated for gas infrastructure projects. \nIn line with the decision of the Honourable minister of state for petroleum to ensure cost efficiency in the budgetary allocations in the oil and gas sector, the committee said it would allocate $12 billion to the Gas Industrial park project while it will not support any allocation to the Brass LNG. \nEfforts by Dafe Sejebor to convince the Lawmakers that due process was followed in the expenditure of cash proved abortive. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:56:43.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
