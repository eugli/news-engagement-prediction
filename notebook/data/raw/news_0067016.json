It cited comments by Calderon that actors were concerned that they would be shut out from parts based on age bias.\n\nThe state attorney general's office did not immediately have comment on the ruling.\n\nCalderon has said the bill was aimed at protecting lesser-known actors and actresses whose ages are not as readily available as bigger Hollywood stars.\n\nThe law was supported by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which said in a statement the ruling simply represented an early skirmish in the legal fight.\n\n\"SAG-AFTRA will continue to fight until we achieve for actors and other entertainment industry professionals the same rights to freedom from age discrimination in hiring enjoyed by other workers in other industries,\" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's chief operating officer and general counsel.\n\nChhabria said there are likely \"more direct, more effective, and less speech-restrictive ways\" of fighting discrimination in Hollywood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:17:23.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
