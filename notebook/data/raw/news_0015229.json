It was on February 3, 2002—less than six months after the 9/11 attacks—and U2 was tasked with making a meaningful, transcendent tribute that would appeal to millions of viewers who had tuned in to escape such a dark and troubling time. EDITOR’S PICK The 9 Types of People at Your Super Bowl Party \nAshley Fetters, GQ.com entertainment editor: Greatest halftime show in Super Bowl history? Man, I am so, so ready to watch the Beyhive descend en masse on your Twitter mentions. Bold claim. Not an indefensible one, though—and I'd absolutely call it the most meaningful halftime show, or the best-ever example of a Super Bowl halftime show transcending the fact that it was a Super Bowl halftime show to become a genuinely poignant pop-culture artifact. \nScott: Apologies to Springsteen and Prince and, yes, Beyoncé—but as great as their halftime performances were, the stakes weren't nearly this high. The brilliance of U2's show starts with a carefully selected three-song setlist: \"Beautiful Day,\"\"MLK,\" and \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" Let's take them one by one. \n\"Beautiful Day\" is the obvious choice—their big, rousing hit from their 2000 album, All That You Can't Leave Behind. But it's also a pretty meaningful choice—a tribute to forward-looking optimism at a time when a bunch of us needed it. Bono has described it as a song about \"a man who has lost everything, but finds joy in what he still has,\" and that's just about right for the United States in 2002. And instead of starting on stage, Bono is performing the whole first verse while walking through the crowd. It's a hell of an opener. \nAshley: Next up was the short Unforgettable Fire cut \"MLK,\" a simple, elegant dirge mourning Martin Luther King, Jr. with imagery of peaceful rain and peaceful sleep—and, of course, this is where the part everybody remembers and everybody tears up over happened. A screen behind the band starts scrolling through the names of all the Americans who died on September 11, all the plane passengers and World Trade Center employees and police and fire department officers, and suddenly it's like Bono and the Edge are singing a comforting lullaby to a whole country of people who've been having nightmares. \nU2 at its most sincere is also sometimes U2 at its most grating and sanctimonious—but this time, it was precisely what a lot of us needed. \nWhat makes this work so well is that it's so brief; the bittersweetness of the moment has only started to register when they bust out \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" arguably their most famous anthem about hope for the future and the song I always put on when I hop on a treadmill and want to feel like I can sprint forever . It's arguably the formula you'd want in any tragic situation: a moment to acknowledge the horror and hurt of it all, and then a long, luxurious bask in light and optimism and healing. \nScott: \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" ends with the lyric \"It's all I can do\"—but at the Super Bowl, Bono changed it to \"It's all we can do.\" It's clearly intended as a statement from the whole band: \"We're feeling your pain too, and we can't fix it, but we're one of the biggest bands on the world, and we'll put on the biggest, most heartfelt tribute we can.\" \nDo you remember watching this live? \nAshley: I have one vivid memory of watching this halftime show as it happened: I remember watching Bono pull that American-flag-on-the-inside-of-the-jacket trick and thinking that was the most majestic shit I'd ever seen . I can't imagine not burying my face in my hands if I watched that happen on live television today; it's a different time, America's an angrier place, and I've grown up and become an adult who bristles at these kinds of po-faced public expressions of extreme empathy. But back then, whoo, boy. \nMy older brother loved U2 (still does), so in typical little-sister form I made it my mission to also love U2. Given that it was a time in history when everything was scary and confusing and they were making music about hope and peace, it wasn't that hard. I was a kid, the world was a mess, and that flag-jacket move dazzled me. \nScott: I hadn't remembered every detail of this halftime show until I rewatched it, but I did remember Bono opening his jacket to reveal the American flag lining at the end. It's such a simple, powerful image to close out the show. \nPeople like to rag on Bono for all his \"save the world\" stuff , but I don't know—he just brings such a genuine sincerity to the table. The previous year's halftime show theme was \"The Kings of Rock and Pop,\" featuring Aerosmith, 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and Nelly. And the following year went right back to that, with Shania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting performing a quick medley of their biggest hits. There's nothing wrong with that, but 2002 was a tender time, and U2 was the perfect band to openly address that in an uplifting, humanistic way. \nAshley: What's so striking to me about it is that U2 couldn't have pulled this off in just any phase of their career together. They've been quite literally all over the sincerity index, veering from the bleeding-heart-directly-on-sleeve passion of The Joshua Tree to Pop 's leering, jaded mockery of commercial culture and back again. \nIn 2002, they just so happened to be dialed all the way over to the \"sincere\" end of that spectrum. And let's be real, U2 at its most sincere is also sometimes U2 at its most grating and sanctimonious—but this time, U2 at its most sincere was what a lot of us needed. That 9/11 happened ten months after U2 had released their most earnest, affecting music since the '80s and five months before they were scheduled to play the Super Bowl is the kind of thing that makes some people want to believe in God. It's both hilarious and heartbreaking to me, looking back, that after this, viewers all over America had to dry their eyes and watch the second half of a football game. \nScott: And now we have another Super Bowl halftime show coming at a politically troubling time—and toplined by an artist known for her philanthropy and activism. If you were Lady Gaga, what would you do on Sunday? \nAshley: I believe it was President Bill Clinton who once said , \"There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by an American flag meat dress.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:41:08.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
