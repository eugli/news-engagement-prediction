Apple , the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content. Apple said Monday night that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring. Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as Apple tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service. “There are a bunch of projects. We’re in it. This is what Apple Music is going to be,” Mr. Iovine said in an interview on Monday night. “Apple Music will have video and other things that I can’t talk about. We’re going to be aggressive about it.” Apple is still primarily a smartphone company. And despite sitting on $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, it insists it has no short-term plans to directly challenge streaming-video giants like Netflix and Amazon, which are increasingly commissioning high-quality original shows to attract and retain subscribers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We’re not out to buy a bunch of shows,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of software and services, said during an onstage interview at the Code Media technology conference on Monday night. But Apple does intend to use original video to help distinguish Apple Music — which began in June 2015 and has attracted than 20 million subscribers — from competitors like Spotify. “We’re trying to do things that are unique and cultural,” Mr. Cue said. Much like MTV did in its heyday, that means going beyond music. Apple aired a trailer for the first show, “Carpool Karaoke, ” at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. The series, a spinoff of James Corden’s running sketch on “The Late Late Show,” will be available to Apple Music subscribers in April. The second program, “ Planet of the Apps ,” is a reality TV series about iPhone app developers competing to build the next great app. In the show, developers will make 60-second pitches, receive mentoring from the musician Will.i.am , the actors Jessica Alba or Gwyneth Paltrow, or the social media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk to develop their ideas, and then try to persuade a venture capital fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, to invest in them. The winners will get prime billing in Apple’s App Store. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.
