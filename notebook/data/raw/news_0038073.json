The gorgeous image, painted by celebrated artist Alex Ross , is titled \"Generations,\" and shows original characters with their legacy counterparts. Marvel did not, however, reveal what this is actually about, only that it's \"coming summer 2017.\" \nFrom left to right, the image includes Jean Grey with her young time-displaced counterpart, Wolverine with X-23's Wolvie, Thor Odinson with Jane Foster Thor, Steve Rogers Captain America with Sam Wilson Cap, Richard Ryder Nova with Sam Alexander, Captain Marvel Mar-vell with Captain Marvel Carol Danvers, Ms. Marvel Carol Danvers with Ms. Marvel Kamala Khan, Hawkeye and Hawkeye (Clint and Kate types), Iron Man with Ironheart, Peter Parker Spider-Man with Miles Morales, and Bruce Banner's Incredible Hulk with Amadeus Cho's Totally Awesome Hulk. \nAll the top, older character images are classic styles; we see Jean in her green and gold phoenix costume, Thor looking bulky and helmeted, Ms. Marvel in her first costume, and even a much more classic Iron Man variation.

Will it be one story taking place years ago while another takes place in the modern Marvel Universe, mirroring each other? Is it just a poster to show off how Marvel continues to evolve and promote legacy within their brand? It's hard to tell with only an image to go on, but what an image. \nIt is notable, as well, to see two mutant, X-Men characters alongside a bunch of characters that otherwise exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, another sign that the Marvel seems to be acknowledging the X-Men a little more again than they have in the last few years. \nThis isn't the first time Alex Ross has drawn a huge grouping of Marvel Comics characters. In the mini-series Earth X with Jim Krueger, they created a story that unified every character, race, and origin story in the Marvel Universe, bringing together aged characters and their legacies to combat the next ultimate threat. \nMarvel doesn't tease and not follow-up on it, so expect more teaser images and or more concrete information about \"Generations\" from Alex Ross and Marvel Comics soon. Check out the hi-res, full-size image below. \nMore Marvel Comics News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:42:31.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
