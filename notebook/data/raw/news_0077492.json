Credit Patrick T. Fallon   Jimmy Kimmel was rapidly criticized for his jokes about the names of two nonwhite people during his turn as host of the Academy Awards. He twice drew humor from the name of the best supporting actor winner, Mahershala Ali, including a request to yell his name as apparent visitors from a tour bus entered the auditorium. When an Asian woman in the group told him her name, followed by a man named Patrick, he said: “See, that’s a name.” On Twitter, several people said making fun of nonwhite names, far from simple middle-school bullying, serves to “other”-ize them. Many said they had dealt with it for a long time and decried what some called “casual racism.” School in America was teachers constantly sayig \"now THAT's a name\" to any Western name said after my own. \"Patrick, that's a name!\" Because \"white\" names are real names. He can get all the way out of here with that casual racism. — alex medina (@mrmedina) Feb. 27, 2017 Others turned the tables on Mr. Kimmel.
