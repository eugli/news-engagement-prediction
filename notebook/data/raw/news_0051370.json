While members of the Department of Public Works were working on a sewage valve, gas fumes leaked out and affected their breathing. \nThe army said the workers had tried to escape the pit, but were overwhelmed by the toxic gases and passed out. \nOne contractor ran for assistance and approached the Maritime Reaction Squadron bus which was passing nearby. \nThe three SANDF members tried to save the lives of the workers, but died after succumbing to the high levels of fumes in the pit. \nAs more assistance arrived, more SANDF members descended into the pit through a Compressed Air Breathing Apparatus and recovered the six bodies. Paramedics on the scene conducted the final assessment and declared all six people dead. \nTwenty-four other members that assisted with the recovery of the bodies were taken to St Augustine Hospital, where they were treated for shortness of breath. All members underwent chest X-rays and were cleared. \nSS Mendi \nZuma also used the occasion to remember the men who died when the SS Mendi sank, thanking men and women in uniform for their continued sacrifice. \nThe troop ship carrying South African soldiers to France, sank in the English Channel near the Isle of Wight, following a collision with a cargo steamship on February 21, 1917. A total of 646 people died, most of them members of the South African Native Labour Corps. \nEarlier, he handed out medals to soldiers who had displayed acts of bravery and those who had served in the army for a long period. \nSoldiers and doctors who looked after former president Nelson Mandela were also recognised. #ArmedForcesDay Zuma: the men who died in SS Mendi will be remembered. In their memory, today we salute SANDF men+women. @News24 pic.twitter.com/yZcBEZY8sg — Amanda Khoza (@MandaKhoza) February 21, 2017 #ArmedForcesDay The president has presented medals to the doctors who took care of Nelson Mandela during his last moments in 2013. @News24 pic.twitter.com/i8EAQLoi4X — Amanda Khoza (@MandaKhoza) February 21, 2017 #ArmedForcesDay Zuma extends condolences to three naval officers and three workers from public works @News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:05:55.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
