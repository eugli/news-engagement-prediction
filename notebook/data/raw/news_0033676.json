She was elected to the Rajya Sabha on April 3, 2014. \nA couple of days after her expulsion from the AIADMK, she alleged in Parliament that some forces within the party were threatening her and that she was being forced to resign. \nShe was the first to cry foul when the AIADMK passed a unanimous resolution to work under the leadership of Jayalalithaa’s confidante Sasikala. \nAfter Jayalalithaa’s death last December, Sasikala Pushpa moved the Supreme Court seeking a CBI probe or a judicial investigation into the new party chief’s elevation. \nRead: AIADMK after Amma: All you need to know about the origin of the OPS-Sasikala war \nShe alleged that Jayalalithaa’s death was “suspicious” as her medical condition was not disclosed, no one was allowed to visit her in hospital, the funeral photographs showed embalming marks, and everything “was kept under wraps”. \nSasikala Pushpa’s lawyers were attacked by party workers and her husband was arrested by Tamil Nadu police a day after a ruckus outside the AIADMK’s office in Chennai over who will succeed Jayalalithaa. \nParty spokesperson CR Saraswathi had then said: “Pushpa is no more with the AIADMK and has no right to be present at any meetings.” \nPanneerselvam was promoted as chief minister, the post he had filled in twice briefly for Jayalalithaa. \nIn the weeks that followed, the ruling AIADMK appeared to be running smoothly. Gears began grinding two weeks ago when Panneerselvam said he would not allow Sasikala to replace him as the chief minister as decided by the party. \nRead: Sasikala’s conviction: Panneerselvam says Amma’s spirit alive, asks MLAs to unite \nThe Supreme Court’s judgment on Tuesday convicting Sasikala in a disproportionate assets case has added suspense to the ongoing chaos for the chief minister’s chair. \nThe question being asked now is will it give a new chance to Sasikala Pushpa to reenter the AIADMK. \nShe might be taken back only if Panneerselvam wins a floor test to prove support of the majority of party legislators in the assembly and retains the chief minister’s post. \nFor Sasikala Pushpa, a ray of hope has also arisen because the other Sasikala will not be able to contest elections for 10 years or hold public office. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:03.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
