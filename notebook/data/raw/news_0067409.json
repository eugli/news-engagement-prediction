Mysterious radiation spreading across Europe \nThe WC-135 can detect and identify nuclear explosions from the air and is also used to track radioactivity after nuclear incidents such as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. \nA US air force spokesperson said the aircraft is in Europe \"on a preplanned rotational deployment scheduled far in advance,\" adding: \"anything contrary is completely baseless.\" \n\"The WC-135 routinely conducts worldwide missions and we are not going to get into further details,\" they said. \nMan-made radioactive material Iodine-131 was found in Norway in early January and has since been detected in small amounts across Europe, officials have said. \nIt isn't clear where Iodine-131 would ever have been released from, but conspiracy theorists have pointed to the fact that the spread appeared to emanate from northern Norway, where Russia may have run a secret nuclear test.

AP Photo/Tatiana Belyakova \nIodine-131 is perhaps most closely associated with atomic bombs, and was found throughout the world after those were tested. It is usually found alongside other radioactive materials, but in this case it wasn't. \nAnd it has a short half-life – the time required for one half of the atoms of a radioactive substance to disintegrate – but a significant amount of it was found, meaning that it is likely that it was introduced very recently. \nThe material is also being used to treat some cancers and other illnesses. The fact that the material was found on its own likely suggests that it had been isolated, and so makes it more likely that the leak came from a pharmaceutical company that hasn't reported it to authorities.
