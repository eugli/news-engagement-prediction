It doesn't really focus on the reasons the areas where we really need to tighten up,\" Schumer said. The second reason, the New York Democrat continued, \"is something called the visa waiver program.\"\n\"It's very easy to come to America from countries that we've always regarded as friendly. There are, I think 27 of them,\" Schumer continued. \"But these days there are would-be terrorists who have infiltrated places like Belgium and France, and they could come into this country much more easily than someone who's a refugee from the seven countries the president mentioned. That needs real tightening up.\"\n\nStephen Miller: Administration looking at new ways to do travel ban By Daniel Strauss \nSchumer went on to say the Trump executive order \"is just un-American and unconstitutional.\"\n\"A religious ban just goes against the American brain. We believe in immigrants in this country and we don't believe in a religious test,\" Schumer said. \"And finally, it hurts us economically. When immigrants don't come to this country it hurts our job creation, our job growth. Silicon Valley is very worried that a lot of their jobs are going to have to go to Vancouver or Canada where Canada has a much more forward looking immigration policy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:54:11.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
