MICHAEL REAVES/GETTY IMAGES \nFloyd Mayweather retired from professional boxing with a 49-0 record. \n\"The fight could even be announced within two weeks.\" \nREAD MORE: * Wilder wants Parker next \nThat \"third-party holdup\" could be UFC President Dana White, whose company has McGregor under contract and who has repeatedly thrown cold water on the proposed fight.In January, White said that the chances of the showdown taking place were about the same as him \"being the backup quarterback for [Tom] Brady\" in the Super Bowl. \nFloyd Mayweather J, left, and Conor McGregor are superstars in their respective fields of fight sports. \nWhite did offer Mayweather US$25 million (NZ$34.8 million) to fight McGregor, but that was mostly to call the retired boxer's bluff after Mayweather had said on ESPN he'd give McGregor $15 million to fight him. \nMayweather, who insisted that his September 2015 win over Andre Berto, which ran his record to 49-0, would be the last fight of his career, has stated that he won't enter the ring again for less than $100 million. \nMayweather has also indicated that he's aware McGregor is one of the few possible opponents who could generate enough interest to help him reach that massive figure. \nOnly thing that I'm probably interested in is the Conor McGregor fight,\" Mayweather told ESPN's \"First Take\" in January. \"I'm a businessman, and it makes the most business sense, I think.\" Ad Feedback \nThe Irishman has broken UFC records for pay-per-view revenue, but he also sees Mayweather as a means to the biggest payday of his life. In November, McGregor said, \"Tell Floyd and Showtime, I'm coming. . . . I want $100 million cash to fight him under boxing rules because he's afraid of a real fight.\" \nMore recently, Mayweather said, \"I believe the fight could happen. ... Let's give the fans what they want to see.\" Around the same time, McGregor said that the fight \"is being more than explored. That fight has been in the works for a while now.\" \nMcGregor made those comments during a pay-per-view interview session in England, at which he also said that, if the UFC tried to stand in the way of a boxing match with Mayweather, he could use the \"Ali Act\" to manoeuvre around his contract with the MMA company. \nThat piece of legislation, officially called the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, has a \"Protection from coercive contracts\" clause that McGregor could potentially cite in a courtroom battle with the UFC, and it may explain why he chose to get a boxing license from the state of California (Bloody Elbow has a detailed explanation here). \nTo further tease the promise of a fight, McGregor posted footage of himself in a training session last week for a boxing match. \"Why conquer one world when you can conquer two?\" he'd said during his PPV interview. \nMcGregor has never fought in a sanctioned boxing-only match before, and Mayweather, who is arguably the greatest defensive boxer ever, would figure to the betting favourite if the fight were to take place. \nThe Irish Sun also reported McGregor pulled out of a scheduled meet-and-greet in Dublin later this week, ostensibly to shoot an anti-bullying video in Las Vegas as part of his settlement with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, following a pre-fight melee with Nate Diaz before UFC 202 in August. \nThe newspaper claimed McGregor \"will also use the opportunity to finalise details with his representatives in Las Vegas as the Mayweather fight inches closer.\" - The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:50:50.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
