Denmark has been struggling to maintain Danish identity while integrating immigrants’ cultures. Credit Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York Times The Danish government has been inadvertently paying benefits to citizens fighting for the Islamic State in Syria, Danish officials said Tuesday, as outrage grows that militants are manipulating the country’s famously generous welfare system. About 145 Danes have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight for militant groups since 2012, according to the Danish security and intelligence services. Officials said this week that they had identified a number of citizens who, while receiving government disability pensions, had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, also known as ISIS . “It is huge scandal that we are paying out money from the welfare funds in Denmark to people who are going to Syria and elsewhere in the world to undermine democracy that we have been fighting for hundreds of years,” the country’s minister of labor, Troels Lund Poulsen , said. Last year, the news media reported that more than two dozen Danish citizens receiving unemployment benefits had traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS, even though the law requires recipients to live in Denmark. Senior labor ministry officials said Tuesday that the center-right government of Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was planning to pass legislation to plug loopholes and prevent what they called an egregious misuse of public funds. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Officials said that since last year, municipal and state authorities had been trying to collect about $95,000 in welfare benefits that had been wrongly paid to 29 citizens who had gone to Syria to fight for ISIS. Until now, national regulations have made it difficult for the authorities to stop benefit payments to a suspected militant, even if the person had been identified by the intelligence services as an ISIS fighter. Officials said investigating the circumstances of individuals in Syria or Iraq was logistically challenging. Under the proposed legislation, any citizen deemed a national security risk after traveling abroad to join a militant group would have their benefits immediately halted, said Bent Nielsen, an official who oversees how welfare benefits are distributed. “If someone is deemed to be a risk for state security by intelligence services while staying abroad, they wouldn’t get a dime,” Mr. Nielsen said. He added that, under the proposed legislation, once a Danish court determines that a citizen has violated the law and joined the Islamic State, then Danish authorities would also be able to demand the reimbursement of benefits already paid. Dozens of militants have returned to Denmark after fighting for ISIS in the Middle East, and the country has been experimenting with ways to reintegrate the former fighters, including psychological counseling, education and job advice.
