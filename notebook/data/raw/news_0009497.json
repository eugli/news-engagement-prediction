Eric Greitens challenged Missouri’s colleges and universities last week in cutting $90 million from higher education in his budget plan. \nInstead of raising tuition, Greitens suggested following the example of Purdue University by culling “administrative bureaucracy” and costly contracts to rein in spending outside the classroom. \nThe governor had a point: Purdue has kept tuition flat for the past five years, and school president Mitch Daniels — a former governor himself — has made a point of cutting unnecessary spending . \nA more cautious approach to new building construction has helped hold project costs down, said Robert Wynkoop, managing director of Purdue’s office of the treasurer. A new health plan saves the school $6.5 million a year. Yanking out rarely used landlines in dormitories saved another $800,000. \nBut Daniels has also cited another trend helping his school: a stark increase in out-of-state and international students who pay more than native Hoosiers. \nAs Greitens noted, it’s not a new strategy. Many colleges, including Missouri schools, have pursued transplants to supplement their budgets and enrollments. \nPurdue’s model could be extremely difficult to reproduce without making changes to several long-standing policies friendly to out-of-state students and potentially prioritizing nonresidents over Missourians. \nSince 2008, Purdue has added 3,057 nonresident undergraduates to its student body, a 22 percent jump driven mostly by international enrollment, according to university data . \nIn the same period, resident population has shrunk by 4,775 students, a 30 percent decline. \nThat led to last fall, when nearly 47 percent of undergraduates on campus were from out of state compared to about a third in 2008. \nThe exchange rate on that shift is high: Nonresident students pay $18,000 to $20,000 more a year in tuition than their resident counterparts. Purdue’s international students are especially lucrative because they’re not eligible for public financial aid . \nTheir results are not unique. The University of Missouri-Columbia has also seen the number of out-of-state students — who pay an annual $15,000 premium over the in-state tuition rate — double in the last decade. It has especially targeted Illinois high school graduates, claiming nearly a fifth of its freshmen from the state in recent years. \nBut 70 percent of MU undergraduates are still residents paying the lower rate, due in part to generous state policy that makes it easy to for transplants to obtain a discount. \nMany state schools, including Purdue and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, require students to live in their state for a year or more before they offer to cut rates. But in Missouri, students can get the deal by spending the summer after their first year here, getting a drivers license, registering to vote and making $2,000 at a summer job. Parent can no longer claim those students on their taxes, but many save tens of thousands in tuition. \nIt’s an especially popular option at Missouri University of Science & Technology, which, like Purdue, prides itself on its engineering programs, enrollment officials said. More than a third of students who come from outside Missouri eventually get residency and pay less. \n“They don’t make it difficult to do, and it makes plenty of sense for a lot of students and their parents trying to save money,” said Tim Albers, S&T’s interim vice provost for enrollment management. ‘Something off’ \nMissouri schools might also want to exclude themselves from the Midwestern Higher Education Compact — in which they agree to charge out-of-state students no more than 150 percent of their in-state rates — to get the most out of potential transplants. \nPurdue, Illinois, the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have all opted out. \nAnd even if Missouri schools could attract more out-of-state students, it wouldn’t necessarily benefit Missourians. \nStephen Burd, an education policy researcher at the New America Foundation, reviewed enrollment records from 424 public institutions and found many flagship state universities are aggressively reaching outside their borders. \nHe found those colleges were competing among each other for wealthy out-of-state students by offering them more and more merit-based aid, cutting into need-based aid for their local, low-income applicants. \n“Stung by sharp state budget cuts at the same time they are seeking greater prestige, these universities are increasingly pitted against one another, fiercely competing for students that they most desire: the best and brightest, and those wealthy enough to pay full freight,” Burd wrote. \nMU is already one of those universities to a degree, offering one-fifth of incoming freshmen without financial need some sort of scholarship package in 2013. \nIt’s also playing defense. In 2014, Missouri raised the cap on its Mark Twain scholarship for out-of-state students to $10,000 a year to counter offers from the likes of Kentucky, Alabama and South Carolina. \nSteven Chaffin, executive director of the lobbying group Associated Students of the University of Missouri, understands the financial gains that can accompany aggressive out-of-state recruitment, but worries it could eventually go against the university’s mission. \n“There would be something off about Missouri taxpayers funding a university that focuses more on out-of-state students than in-state students,” Chaffin said. “We don’t want to have a system where we’re playing favorites because someone is paying more.” \nPaul Wagner, executive director of the Council on Public Higher Education — an association of Missouri’s 13 public colleges — agreed. \n“We’re first and foremost a public institution,” Wagner said. “We’re not going to jeopardize that by having majority-out-of-state schools that aren’t serving Missourians well.” \nAnd neither Wagner nor Chaffin think Greitens’ suggestions of cutting administration and recruiting higher spenders could solve higher education’s budget woes on their own. Pressure is building \nMissouri has led the nation in keeping the cost of college down since Gov. Matt Blunt signed a law capping in-state tuition at four-year universities a decade ago. But Wagner doesn’t see it surviving the proposed 10 percent cut to higher education. \n“We’ve been in this budget-cutting efficiency mode for a while,” Wagner said. “But we’re at a point where there aren’t a lot of tools we haven’t used. With a budget cut of this magnitude, I don’t think we’re going to be able to hold tuition flat this year.” \nThe University of Missouri Review Commission, formed by the Legislature last year to audit the UM System’s operations, came to a similar conclusion in December. \nIt’s also where St. Louis Community College Chancellor Jeff Pittman came down. \nHe said he plans to review his system’s programs to find out which are best preparing students for local jobs, but said tuition increases, changes to health insurance benefits and buyouts for professors were already under consideration. \nAn influx of wealthy international students isn’t in the cards for his schools. \n“We have a small group of out-of-state students, but that’s not normally a big part of being a community college,” Pittman said. “We’re here to serve the local community, and we’ve got to keep things affordable for them.” 3 O'clock Stir e-newsletter 3 O'clock Stir from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nShake off your afternoon slump with the offbeat or overlooked news of the day.
