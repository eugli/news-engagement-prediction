Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nO n the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has had a strained relationship with the press, calling journalists \"the enemy of the people\" and frequently criticizing outlets and individual reporters whose coverage he does not like. \nThe reporters' group said it would go ahead with its April 29 dinner despite Trump's absence. The Washington event typically draws movie stars, politicians and business leaders to hear a humorous speech by the sitting president. \nThe dinner \"has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic,\" said Jeff Mason, a Reuters White House correspondent who heads the association this year. \nRonald Reagan was the last president to sit out the event after he was shot in 1981.
