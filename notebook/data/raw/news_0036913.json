Here's what happened through the morning up until the second time the Speaker adjourned the House. Utter chaos in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, which assembled at 11 am for a trust vote (Photo: ANI) 1. Chennaiites awoke to a city almost completely shut down by police, ahead of the trust vote in the Tamil Nadu Assembly scheduled for 11am. Around 8am, AIADMK MLAs corralled in Kuvathur's Golden Bay Resort for more than 10 days started leaving for Chennai. 2. Soon after, the opposition DMK's working president M K Stalin set out for the Assembly, choosing to walk the half-kilometre stretch to the secretariat after his vehicle was stopped for checking by police and security personnel. 3. At 9 pm, AIADMK chief minister EK Palaniswami - of the Sasikala faction -arrived at the secretariat for the floor test. Soon after, journalists said they were being kept out of the Assembly premises. 4. When the session began at 11 am with 230 MLAs present, CM Palaniswami moved a motion for vote of confidence in the assembly, which speaker P Dhanapal accepted. PALANI Soon after, the opposition DMK and the Congress, started raising slogans in favour of the AIADMK's pro-Panneerselvam (OPS) faction, which in turn started loudly demanding a secret ballot. The DMK and the Congress soon joined the chorus for a secret ballot. 5. In fact, the DMK's MK Stalin even told the House the floor test should be done on another day. \"Why the hurry when the Governor has given 15 days time?\" he asked, even as OPS raised his hand and pressed them together in Stalin's direction, thanking him. Panneerselvam also told the House that MLAs should be given time to hear the views of their constituencies. Until then, a floor test shouldn't take place. 6. The speaker rejected the demand for a secret ballot. \"Nobody can interfere in my decision on how to vote,\" speaker Dhanapal said. AUDIO Then, a little before 11:30 am, all doors to the Tamil Nadu Assembly were shut. Right then, the television telecast of the proceedings was stopped. The audio of the proceedings was also shut. 7. After this, conflicting news trickled out. Some sources said that without a secret ballot, the House began 'division voting', where MLAs were asked to stand up in blocks of six and declare their vote. 8. Other sources said there was chaos in the assembly with chairs and microphones being flung around and broken by opposition DMK members demanding a secret ballot and lawmakers 'gheraoing' the speaker. Reportedly, Ku Ka Selvam , a DMK MLA went and occupied the speaker's chair. An official was also injured, ANI reported. Around 12:15 am, the speaker adjourned the House till 1:00 pm and walked out. 9. After the House resumes at 1:00 pm, all the present DMK MLAs - 88 of 89 - were evicted after the House again descended into chaos when it resumed at 1:00 pm. Half an hour later Palaniswami moves confidence motion again. 10. At 1:30 pm, the House is adjourned again and scheduled to resume at 3:00 pm.
