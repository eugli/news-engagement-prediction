Etti Bali Here’s some ethnic style inspo by Bollywood’s trendsetters. \nWho said ethnicwear is only reserved for certain functions? Take the cue from these Bollywood ladies to rock your desiwear as you travel. While many prefer to be in casuals while travelling, keeping comfort level in mind, there are some who take their travel wardrobe very seriously. The latest trendspotting that we did had more of ethnics, accompanied by minimal accessories and neat hairdos. This not just lends an inherent desi charm, but one looks effortlessly graceful. From maxi gowns and salwar-kameez, and the more modern palazzos, these Bollywood divas have aced them all. Here’s some inspo for your next travel plan: Read more Your favourite Bollywood divas are repeating their handbags. Is this a trend now? \nAll about business The Birkin bag and matching peep-toes go well with Sridevi’s burnt orange and rust maxi-gown. (Yogen Shah) \nSridevi is known for setting trends, even when she’s hopping on a plane. Here, the printed maxi accompanied with a slick top knot, Birkin bag and matching peep-toes complete the look. This look is perfect if you don’t like investing in too many accessories. \nKeep it simple, sweety The mirror work on Sonam Kapoor’s maxi kurta complements the juttis, while the delicate bracelet and chunky earrings add a bit of glam. (Yogen Shah) \nHalf-up hair, minimal make-up and the ivory maxi-kurta give Sonam Kapoor’s airport look an ethereal charm. The takeaway? White’s got might! If you have to directly leave for an event upon landing, go for this look. Add a bright lip. \nOf drapes at the airport Rekha makes a no-fuss statement with a pastel saree and a flowy drape. (Yogen Shah) \nWe might or might not agree with Rekha’s sartorial picks. But, it’s hard to ignore the fact that she always ends up making some style noise. A basic monochrome drape in a lightweight fabric can be travel friendly. \nFifty shades of brown Sonali Bendre’s all-brown monotony is given a break by those dainty earrings. A bit of accessorising would not hurt this travel look. (Yogen Shah) \nRight from her shades and suit to her bag and nail paint, Sonali Bendre chose to paint the town brown with this look. Mono-toned looks have never been hotter and now is the time to do it, even when it comes to fusion ethnicwear. \nOne-toned Preity Zinta aces the red-on-red look with ease. (Yogen Shah) \nWe might not be completely on board with Preity Zinta’s red-on-red look. But, she does make the salwar kameez look pretty easy-breezy for travel. We’d say, pick an all-pastel ethnic ensemble and colour block with your juttis. Not only does it put comfort first, but is also on-trend. \nPlaying it subtle Elli Avrram’s chic look is simple and yet, makes a very breezy statement. (Yogen Shah) \nElli Avrram stepped out of the airport in this beaded white kurta that she teamed with floral white palazzos. This chic look is easy on the eyes. If you are packing bags for a vacation, remember to always pack your go-to comfortwear for that plane ride. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:24.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
