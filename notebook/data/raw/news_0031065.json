He says things that aren't true. That's the same as lying, I guess.\"\nFranken cites Trump's groundless claim that he would have won the popular vote in the presidential race if not for 3 million to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally voting for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\nAnd Trump is said to have told some senators in a private meeting at the White House that he and former Republican Sen.
