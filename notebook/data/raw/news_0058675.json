The #T20 GDL has enormous potential and will change the face of South African domestic T20 cricket. We have been longing for a big league of our own to showcase the talent, facilities and beauty of South Africa,” Amla, who has so far played 38 T20s, was quoted as saying in a media release issued. \n“South Africa is one of the most beautiful countries in the world – we have great weather, beautiful tourist attractions and cuisine and we have proven to be warm hosts. \nWe are also lucky to be in a great time zone that would attract huge viewership as we suit most of the cricket world. \n“Owners, potential investors and players will be getting involved in a League that has every reason to succeed,” the right-handed batsman added. \nEarlier, Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat had conceded that one of the major considerations before announcing the launch of #T20 Global Destination League was losing key South African players to the KOLPAK agreement.
