'We were just searching the internet, looking for signs' \nNelle Hookins, 2, is one of the children who has been through the test which determined that she had Cohen syndrome, which affects mental and physical development. \nUntil her diagnosis, her parents had spent a frustrating 18 months dealing with specialist after specialist. She was \"gravely ill\" and had been in hospital 11 times. \n\"It was just a really dark period for us where everything was on the table. We were just searching the internet, looking for signs of what it might be,\" her mother Amanda Hookins said. \n\"It was a very traumatic time, I would say and there's a sort of a fear, lots of anxiety, the unknown is enormous because there's so many possibilities out there it's overwhelming.\" \nMs Hookins said doctors at the Royal Children's Hospital suggested Nelle join the research project. \n\"It brings a kind of peace to know that you don't have to search any more or that you don't have to wonder. Essentially the mystery is solved,\" she said. \nGenomic sequencing was not possible when Associate Professor White first started out 20 years ago, and was talking to parents about their child. \n\"I know your child has something genetic, but I have no way of finding out what that condition is,\" she had to tell parents back then. \n\"That's why this is so revolutionary for our area of work because we can now personalised that child's care.\" \nRare conditions affect one in 12 Australians, many of whom are never diagnosed. \n\"It's certainly a test we'd like to be able to offer every undiagnosed child with a presumed genetic condition,\" Ms Hookins said. \n\"We're still fighting battles to get that testing funded.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:42.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
