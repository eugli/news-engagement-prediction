Harrison was asked twice by the media if terrorism was suspected. While he didn’t say “No” he did say it looks like a case of DWI.

Seven others declined to be hospitalized, city Emergency Services Director, Dr. Jeff Selder said.

Harrison said the officer, who was on duty, was undergoing tests to determine the extent of her injuries. She was in “good spirits,” he said. \nThe accident came during one of the busiest nights of Mardi Gras when thousands of people throng the streets of Mid-City to watch the elaborate floats and clamor to catch beads and trinkets tossed from riders. As police and city officials were assessing the accident scene, people were streaming home as plastic bags that used to hold trinkets and discarded beads littered the ground. The area where the accident occurred was cordoned off with police barricades. \nOne woman at the scene told The New Orleans Advocate that a silver truck whisked by her just feet away as she was walking through the intersection. \nCarrie Kinsella said, “I felt a rush it was so fast.” \nTwenty-year-old Kourtney McKinnis told the Advocate that the driver of the truck seemed almost unaware of what he had just done. \n“He was just kind of out of it,” she said.
