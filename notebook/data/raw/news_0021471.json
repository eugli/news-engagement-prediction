YOU NEED SHOES FOR EVERY TASK \nIt’s a scorching hot day and you want to go to the beach to cool down, it’s just a shame you can’t walk on the sand without shoes for fear of suffering third degree burns. \nYou might be able to get away with going barefoot on the grass, but that’s only on the proviso there are no bindiis scattered across the lawn. \nEven going to check your letterbox requires the tedious task of putting on your shoes, because no one wants to open a hefty electricity bill with blisters on their feet. \n2. CRICKET TAKES OVER THE TV \nOK, this technically has nothing to do with the heat, but cricket has to be one of the sh*ttest sports the world has ever seen. \nGrown men standing on an oval watching a grown man throw a ball at other grown men for days at a time is not my idea of fun. \nI will admit that shorter games of cricket like the Big Bash get me excited, because it makes even the most mundane of tasks like ironing seem more exciting in comparison. High-five guys, we just finished the world’s most boring sporting match. Picture: Carl Fourie/Gallo Images/Getty Images Source: Getty Images \n3. DRIVING IS A NIGHTMARE \nIf you manage to get into your car without branding yourself with your seatbelt buckle, congratulations — you have passed the first test of Aussie summer. \nAlthough, you are not home just yet because unless you have a steering wheel cover, you will have to master the art of driving with two fingers or battle through some serious pain. \nThen there are the heated debates about whether waiting for the aircon or driving with the windows down will cool the car quicker. \n4. YOUR DIET AND FITNESS SUFFERS \nAs much as your New Year’s resolution to get fit and healthy started off strong, some days it’s just too bloody hot to even consider exercising. \nEven getting up at 5am to go for a run leaves you looking like you have just jumped into a bath fully clothed, which is something no one wants. \nThen there is the fact you are smashing a pack of Zooper Doopers and other sugary ice-creams on the regular in the hope they might cool you down. Sure Zooper Doopers are delicious, but not the best when trying to eat health. Source: Supplied \n5. DRINKS AND SHOWERS \nYou have just navigated the shade and made your way inside for a cold drink and shower. \nThe only problem is your water supply has spent the whole day soaking up the hot Australian sun and you have to wait minutes before the cold water tap stops shooting out water hotter than what has ever come out of your kettle. \n6. IF IT’S NOT THE HEAT, IT’S THE MOZZIES \nYou load up on sunscreen during the day and then have to put a heavy amount of Aeroguard on at night to keep away the mosquitoes. \nBut we all know that no matter how much pest spray you wear and how many bug zappers/mozzie coils you own, those pesky blood suckers will find a way to bite you. \nMother nature really must get a kick out making the peak mozzie season when people are already annoyed by the heat. Did someone say mosquito? Picture: @JOELSARTORE Source: Supplied \n5. THE SHOPS/CINEMAS/RESTAURANTS ARE PACKED \nYou are sitting at home trying not to drown in the pool of your own sweat and decide it might be worthwhile trying to escape the heat for the comfort of an airconditioned establishment. \nThe only problem is 378,000 other people also had the same idea and your local Westfield is the busiest you have ever seen. \n9. GETTING A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP IS IMPOSSIBLE \nIf you have aircon you run the risk of catching a cold after sleeping under the unit all night — although, I would happily run that risk. \nFor those without aircon, the task of falling/staying asleep is a near impossible task, especially if you have needy pets who feel the need to cuddle regardless of the weather. This little guy gets how hard it is to sleep during summer. Picture: Steve Tanner Source: News Corp Australia \n9. PUBS/NIGHTCLUBS JUST DON’T SEEM TO GET IT \nWhat about the arguments you have with establishments during the hotter months of the year? \nWhile the venue might think having a non-negotiable pretentious dress code is a great idea, many Aussies will likely disagree. \nThere should be a stipulation that thongs and footy shorts are acceptable attire during summer. \n10. YOU USE YOUR GARDEN HOSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES \nNo, this isn’t a joke about getting a Powerade bottle and garden hose to make a bong. \nAnyone that’s ever lived in drought ridden part of Australia will know it’s illegal to use excessive water on your lawn/to create homemade Slip N Slide. \nWhile it’s ultimately for the greater good, it doesn’t make melting inside and looking at your dead lawn any easier. \nWhat else would you add to the this list?
