That's still Eli Manning. (Elsa/Getty Images)  37 PM \nBy the transitive property, Eli Manning's stock went up just a tick. \nAfter Sunday night's miraculous Super Bowl LI comeback over the Falcons, Tom Brady has now earned a ring in five of his seven trips to the Super Bowl. Brady has bested Kurt Warner, Jake Delhomme, Donovan McNabb, Russell Wilson and now Matt Ryan in the big game. \nThe only quarterback to ever stop him? That's still Eli Manning. Who did it twice. \nSomehow, it's still just Manning -- an otherwise solid but not exceptional QB -- who has the magic recipe to beat the man that is arguably the greatest player of all-time. Or maybe that's not even an argument anymore. \nOK, maybe it's two sets of Giants' pass rushing units that really own the secret sauce to stopping the Brady and Bill Belichick combination in the playoffs. And for awhile in Sunday's contest, the Falcons seemed to try and replicate it. Tom Brady has now earned a ring in five of his seven trips to the Super Bowl. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) \nBut Manning always held up his end of the bargain, too. In his two Super Bowl victories over the Patriots, Manning threw for a combined 551 yards and three touchdowns, along with one interception, for a total passer rating of 96.2. \nAnd in each of those wins he also found a way to partner up with his receivers for remarkable, dramatic plays that helped fuel Big Blue's victory. In Super Bowl XLII it was David Tyree's incredible helmet catch and in Super Bowl XLVI it was Mario Manningham's sideline grab. \nFinally, in Super Bowl LI on Sunday, Brady got one too from Edelman. And a short while later he became the first quarterback to earn his fifth Super Bowl win. \nBrady's legacy grew tremendously on Sunday night. Manning's did just a little bit too.
