The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. \nOpposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. \nThe IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. \nBoeing says the union is not needed because it is a divisive force that picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. \nThe Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. \nBoeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. \nThe South Carolina plant helps build the 787-8 and larger 787-9, and exclusively builds the 787-10 “stretch” version. \n(Reporting by Harriet McLeod and Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bill Rigby) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:31:06.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
