Doug Snelgrove's not guilty verdict. (Submitted Photo)\nJustice Valerie Marshall said the case hinged on whether the complainant, who was 21 at the time, had consented to sex or was in a position to consent, and whether Snelgrove knew if she did not or could not consent.\nAnother demonstration is planned for outside the RNC headquarters in St. John's at 12 p.m. Monday.\nFurther discipline Snelgrove also has yet to face full discipline from the RNC following the incident.\nIn a statement released Friday, RNC Chief William Janes said the Crown has 30 days to file an appeal and following any appeal, the appropriate discipline will be determined through the public complaints commission process.\nJanes also said Snelgrove has been suspended from all duties, without pay, since charges were laid in 2015, and will continue to be suspended until appropriate discipline has been determined.\nHe said the RNC does not tolerate inappropriate and unprofessional behavior by officers and supports victims of sexual assault.\n\"We continue to work with the community in supporting victims of sexual assault and I want to reaffirm our commitment to investigating all allegations of sexual assault,\" said Janes.\n\"We encourage any person who has been the victim of a sexual assault to come forward; all complaints will be thoroughly investigated.\"\nWith files from Garrett Barry and Marilyn Boone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:19:13.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
