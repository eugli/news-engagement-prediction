We've been lacking this one genre of player,\" he said. \n\"We knew he was going to be there for the first 14 games ... We pretty much knew we were not going to get him for below this price.\" \nTymal Mills, Stokes's England Twenty20 team mate, was snapped up for 120 million rupees by Royal Challengers Bangalore, who will look to benefit from the left-arm fast bowler's ability to combine great pace with economy. \nAll-rounder Chris Woakes was the third England player to get a hefty payday, going to Kolkata Knight Riders for 42 million rupees. \nOther big-earners included New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult and South Africa paceman Kagiso Rabada, who both went for 50 million rupees to Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils respectively. \nEngland's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan went to Kings XI Punjab for a relatively modest 20 million rupees. \nDelhi Daredevils bought Australian paceman Pat Cummins for 45 million rupees, while compatriot Mitchell Johnson, who quit international cricket in 2015, returned to his former team Mumbai Indians for 20 million. \nOwners mostly gave the cold shoulder to slow bowlers, with South African leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who tops both the one-day and Twenty20 bowling rankings, unsold. \nMohammad Nabi became the first Afghanistan player to be bought in the IPL with Sunrisers Hyderabad offering three million rupee for the all-rounder. They also bought Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for 40 million rupees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:49:34.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
