The others have been euthanised.\nThe call went out on Saturday evening for volunteers to head to the beach with wet suits, buckets and sheets to help the whales at a spit at the top of the South Island.\nThe events are the latest update in a big rescue effort after 416 whales stranded overnight on Thursday at the beach, which is thought to be death trap for whales as it confuses sonar navigation.\nDead Pilot whales line the shore after being stranded for a second time at the remote Farewell Spit in New Zealand\nA volunteer pours water on pilot whales after anpother mass stranding at Farewell Spit, where eighty of the 100 whales refloated\nVolunteers try to guide some of the stranded pilot whales still alive back out to sea after one of the country's largest recorded mass whale strandings,\nThe tragic decision has been made to euthanise 20 pilot whales that have washed ashore again at Farewell Spit\nAbout 75 per cent were dead on discovery but since then hundreds of volunteers have worked to refloat whales at high tides.\nAt Saturday morning's high tide boats and a human chain of rescuers worked to keep the whales at sea and keep the second pod away from the beach.\nThe decision to euthanise those who didn't make it was to relieve suffering.\n'We are not able to successfully refloat stranded whales in every case. Even when some whales are saved, others inevitably die from injuries and the stress of being stranded, particularly the more they re-strand, as commonly occurs, and the longer it goes on,' DOC says.\nThere was a successful refloat of whales on Saturday and a pod of 200 were kept at sea, but joy turned to despair with three new strandings about 5pm.\n'The whole damn lot of them have come ashore,' a DOC spokesman said.\nThe call has gone out on Saturday evening for volunteers to head to take wet suits, buckets and sheets to a new locations on the spit at the top of the South Island\nAbout 75 per cent were dead on discovery but since then hundreds of volunteers have worked to refloat whales at high tides\nThey were found of a beach at Farewell Strip on the South Island, a protruding coastline with gently sloping beaches\nBefore a rescue operation could begin, around 275 of the adults and babies had already died\nBut hours after floating out to sea at high tide on Friday lunchtime, 90 of the whales became beached again\nPilot whales are too large to be pushed back out to sea, leaving the rescuers to wait for high tide. Their role yesterday was keep the animals upright to so they could breathe properly and rock them gently to stop fluid accumulating in their bodies. When the water is not taking the whales' weight, major organs are put under stress and start to fail\nVolunteers are being called out again to try to keep the whales alive until an attempt to refloat them at high tide.\nMassey University pathologists are carrying out necropsies on the dead whales to try to determine the cause of death.\nLocal iwi representatives Mairangi Reiher and Shane Graham have provided a karakia, or prayer, over the dead whales.\nThis week's event is the third-largest recorded in New Zealand since data started being collected in the 1800s.\nAbout 1000 whales beached themselves on the Chatham Islands in 1918 and 450 in Auckland in 1985.\nThe current incident comes almost exactly two years after nearly 200 pilot whales were beached at Farewell Spit.\n...BUT WHY DO SO MANY END UP STRANDED? Whales can beach themselves when chasing prey or when old, sick and injured animals seek shelter close to land.\nBeachings have also been blamed on submarines' sonar and oil industry installations because they can confuse the mammals which use sound to navigate with echo location.\nWhales can also become stranded after being hit by ships or tangled in fishing nets.\nWith pilot whales, which travel in large groups, such events can involve hundreds. In 1985, 450 were stranded near Auckland on New Zealand's North Island.\nStephen Marsh of British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said: 'They are called pilot whales because they follow a leader, very often the matriarch of the group, but sometimes an animal that is having problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:57:27.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
