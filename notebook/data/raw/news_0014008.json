Kim quit the show after the row (Photo: Rex Features) \nHe said at the time: \"She was chatting away to Keith Lemon and he asked her: 'Have you got much coming up?' \n\"She said, 'I don't think the people who make TV would want me anymore'. And I said, genuinely, honestly, 'Don't do yourself down. People will always need a cleaner'. \n\"She looked at me and said something on the lines of, 'When I want an opinion of a fat man, I'll stand outside Gregg's'. (Photo: Rex Features) \nHe went on to reveal that the argument quickly became bigger than it needed to be as Kim became more and more heated. \n\"It ended up really horrible. She was trying to be deliberately personal, and by the point it got to that place, I was like, 'OK, because I'm a stand-up comedian and if you want to start heckling, I'm good at this'. \n\"And so I was personal back. She basically kept saying I was fat. But I did end up saying, 'That's a bit rich coming from a woman who looks like a face drawn on a deflating party balloon.'\" Kim snapped on This Morning yesterday (Photo: Rex Features) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:44:29.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
