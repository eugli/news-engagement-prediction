Anushka Sharma has already made her production debut with NH10 and is now ready with Phillauri, her second production venture. \nBollywood actresses are stepping up and are going beyond the stereotypical acting, lifestyle and fashion promotions that they have been traditionally associated with. \nFrom Priyanka Chopra to Anushka Sharma and Richa Chaddha, heroines are going beyond the realm of acting and modelling and are ready to turn job creators in the industry. \nHere, we take a look at some of them who have turned producers and the films they have taken under their wings: \nRicha Chadha - Khoon Aali Chithi \nChadha made her debut as a producer with a Punjabi short film that will soon be released digitally on a major streaming platform. Khoon Aali Chithi is a story of love and peace set amidst the backdrop of the Khalistan movement in 1980’s and how it affected the common man in Punjab. It has already been selected for International Film Festival of South Asia, Toronto. \nPriyanka Chopra - Sarvann \nChopra, who is now marking her presence in Hollywood, is known for a bunch of things - from being a philanthropist to Miss World 2000 winner. She has even established a film production company with her mother, called Purple Pebble Pictures. She has produced a Marathi film Ventilator and the second project Sarvann, a Punjabi film that hit theatres a few weeks back. \nAnushka Sharma - Phillauri \nSharma has acted in several blockbuster films and even her production debut, NH10, was a surprise hit. Her upcoming film Phillauri, which has Diljit Dosanjh as the male lead, is her second outing as a producer. \nSonam Kapoor - Battle for Bittora \nSonam was in the news recently when she announced she will co-produce (with Rhea) the comedy flick Battle for Bittora, which will go on floors this year. Sonam’s sister Rhea Kapoor is producing her next, Veerey Di Wedding. \nTwinkle Khanna - Padman \nLast November, it was reported that Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan will be seen together on screen in an R Balki directed movie after 10 years. The film also has Sonam and Radhika Apte. Twinkle Khanna, Akshay’s wife, will produce Padman which will be the first film under her Mrs Funnybones Movies. Twinkle has also co-founded another production company, Grazing Goat Pictures, and has co-produced 14 features including Singh is Bliingg, Rustom, OMG – Oh My God!, Fugly and the Marathi language drama 72 Miles.
