On Wednesday I flew EVA Air’s 777 business class between Los Angeles and Taipei. I flew EVA Air back when they first joined the Star Alliance , though this was my first time flying with them in over three years. \nLast time I flew with EVA I thought they were an all around solid airline with great seats, service, and an overall very good soft product. \nWell, after this flight I’m convinced they offer one of the best business class products in the world. A couple of years ago they introduced a slight update to their business class product , and it sure does make a difference. \nEVA Air still has reverse herringbone seats in business class, though they’ve slightly updated the finishes. I think they look much better now. But that’s minor and cosmetic in the grand scheme of things. \nOn the 777 EVA Air has 10 rows of business class, spread across two cabins — there are six rows in the forward cabin, and four rows in the rear cabin. As usual, I prefer being in the rear cabin . \nThe soft product was phenomenal as well. There were Rimowa amenity kits, pajamas, slippers, an incredibly comfortable duvet and mattress pad, and wifi. The wifi was fast, and a pass for the entire flight cost just $22, with no data caps. \nI was also so impressed by the food. When I flew EVA Air a few years ago the food was the most underwhelming part of the flight. This time around the food was excellent . Everything was set directly on the tablecloth rather than on a tray, and there was course after course. \nFirst there was a date with cream cheese and some cream with avocado. Then the appetizer consisted of foie gras terrine (which was the only part of the meal I didn’t partake in). \nEverything else was excellent, from the pumpkin soup to the garden vegetable salad to the incredible miso seabass with vegetables and steamed rice. \nAfter that there was a fruit and cheese course, and then lastly for dessert a chocolate brownie with orange. \nThe quality of the food was excellent across the board. \nOn top of that, the drink selection was top notch as well . They served Veuve La Grande Dame 2006, a champagne which retails for $150+ per bottle (but more importantly, actually tastes great). \nThe rest of the drink selection was equally impressive, including Fiji and Evian still water, San Pellegrino sparkling water, an impressive tea selection, espresso-based cappuccinos, iced coffee, and more. \nThe crew was personable, professional, and extremely polished. \nA while back I wrote about the 11 factors that make business class great , and EVA Air checks almost all those boxes. I thought EVA Air was great last time I flew them, but they improved immensely since then. They added wifi and pajamas, and greatly improved the quality of the food and service flow. \nThe only two areas where they don’t excel are the entertainment selection and also the lack of dine on demand. The lack of dine on demand isn’t an issue since their service flow is excellent when they serve meals, so I don’t mind that. As far as the entertainment goes, I’d say the selection was about average. However, since there was fast and reasonably priced wifi, I didn’t mind much. \nEVA Air is totally top notch, and I can’t recommend them enough. Along with Japan Airlines business class , it’s probably the best transpacific business class product I’ve taken. \nPerhaps the one thing that stuck out to me is how much better EVA Air 777 business class is than Cathay Pacific 777 business class , despite the virtually identical hard products. EVA beats Cathay Pacific by a long shot when it comes to food quality, existence of wifi, amenities (amenity kit and pajamas), drink selection, service flow, etc. Like there’s not even any competition, the two products aren’t in the same league when it comes to their soft product. \nIf you’ve flown EVA Air business class, what was your experience like?
