The Centre has formulated a policy to promote living close to mass public transport corridors like metro, monorail and bus rapid transit (BRT), a move aimed at addressing the challenges of urbanisation. The National Transit Oriented Development Policy seeks to promote Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) -– a type of infrastructure development which enables people to live within walking or cycling distance from transit corridors which are being undertaken in India at a large scale.\nThe policy will be discussed with the states and union territories (UTs) at a national workshop on urban development on Tuesday next week, an official release said. TOD is considered a viable solution to urban challenges like haphazard growth, mobility problems, congestion due to rising private vehicles on roads and pollution, among others.\nThe Ministry of Urban Development is also incentivising the TOD under new Metro Policy and Green Urban Mobility Scheme that seeks to create non-motorised transport infrastructure in cities like footpaths and cycle-tracks.\nThe Ministry’s initiative comes in the context of over 300 km of metro lines being operational in seven cities, while another 600 km of metro line projects being under construction in 12 cities and over 500 km projects under consideration.\nWatch this also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:22:54.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
