Speaking in an interview with Vanguard, Okogie said the President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress party has deviated from all their promises during the last election. “It’s obvious to all now that this is not the kind of change people like Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu, campaigned for. The man who was talking about change, change, change, this is not the kind of change they preached. READ ALSO: Is someone in government importing illegal weapons? He said: \"At the inauguration of APC government, President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech was about change, but they have now played on his intelligence. This is my own view. They saw that this man who put him there may try to turn the table, so they looked for those who Tinubu doesn’t seem to like, and made them his enemies.\" When they now saw where he was going, they are now trying to bring the man back. If it’s not too late, I don’t know!\" Okogie lamented.

The Archbishop further commended the efforts of the Anambra state governor Willie Obiano in ensuring growth and development in the state. He however, said it is unfortunate that some people are pushing for the removal of the governor whom he said has done measurable well since assuming office. “For example, look at what Gov. Willie Obiano has been doing in Anambra State, but because some people know he is eligible to contest for a second term, they are now calling for his impeachment.
