I´m the type of person that if I like a TV show, I´ll binge watch ... \nDespite initial doubts and concerns fans had with the #HanSolo spinoff, the project has been shaping up nicely, with production currently underway , an impressive cast that has everyone in the galaxy excited to see it and a constant stream of news from it. \nNow, get ready for some more Han Solo news, as Variety is reporting that Phoebe Waller-Bridge ( Crashing , Fleabag ) is in talks for a key role in the newest #StarWars anthology film: [Credit: The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon] \nAccording to the report, she will be playing a CGI character - similar to Maz Kanada in #TheForceAwakens - who's expected to have the same relevance as other Star Wars personalities such as C-3PO, K-2SO and Chewbacca. Because the latter will most likely be a part of Han Solo , it looks like Phoebe's character and everyone's favorite fur ball will be fighting for time in the spotlight (piece of advice for her when going against Chewie: be careful with your arms) \nThe mystery of her casting obviously raises a few questions, though. Under Disney's leadership, the vast Star Wars canon has spread across comic books, TV shows and video games and the different mediums have slowly started to fit together. #RogueOne pulled a character from The Clone Wars TV series, Saw Guerrera , and made him an important part of the story. \nSo, could #Disney and Lucasfilm be connecting their different sides of the Star Wars universe once again with Phoebe's character being already established in canon? Or will she be a completely new creation? Hopefully we'll get some answers soon. \nSee Also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:38.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
