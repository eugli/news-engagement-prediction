On Feb. 9, Barnett gave the man at least 10 explosives, a bag of gloves, a mask and a license-plate cover, which would be used to cover up the man’s identity, prosecutors said. \n\"Barnett told the [confidential source] not to let the box bounce around or they would explode,\" according to the complaint. He reassured the source that they wouldn't kill anybody, it said, but they would \"take your hand off.\" \nBut before the plan moved forward, the man went to the authorities and gave them the bombs and explained Barnett’s plan. \nAn explosives expert determined that the bombs were capable of \"causing property damage, serious injury, or death to nearby persons upon detonation.\" It was not clear, however, if they would have also sent Target stock price lower. \nA subsequent search of Barnett’s house by federal agents found rocket motor ignitors, M-5000 explosives and batteries were found. An explosives expert determined that the homemade explosives — 1½-inch shells stuffed with explosive powder, to be triggered by a battery — \"were capable of causing property damage, serious injury, or death to nearby persons upon detonation,\" the complaint said. \n\"The cooperation between the local, state and federal law enforcement agencies involved in this case was instrumental to quickly identifying this individual and resolving any potential threat to the public,” said Charles Spencer, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Jacksonville Division. \nBarnett is being held in the Marion County Jail for nine parole violations. If he's convicted, Barnett faces up to 10 years in federal prison; it is not clear if he will be able to daytrade Target stock from prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:43:45.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
