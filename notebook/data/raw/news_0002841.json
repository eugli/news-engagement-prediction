He said the two did not impress each other much, but when he left he apologised to Smith if he'd hurt his feelings with the sculptures. \n\"Nick turned to me ... he kind of looked around, as if seeking a quiver full of arrows, and he said to me, 'Sam, there's absolutely nothing you could possibly do that could hurt my feelings'.\" \nThe latest sculpture, Mahon said, was an attempt to prove him wrong. \nSam Mahon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:20:08.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
