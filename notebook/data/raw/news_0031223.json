Smith-USA TODAY Sports When Kevin Durant first took the court for pregame warmups on Saturday night, Oklahoma City fans peppered him with boos and jeers. After all, the former league MVP ditched the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors — the same team that eliminated Oklahoma City in the playoffs — during a free agency fiasco that left a sour taste on those he left. But while Durant used every opportunity to downplay the potential beef he and Russell Westbrook had after his decision, a series of events during Golden State’s 130-114 win over the Thunder proved there’s still bad blood between the two sides. Late in the second quarter, Westbrook shoved Durant, who was standing idly near mid-court. Here's Russ' shove of KD I was referring to pic.twitter.com/3rZ85oq668 — Liam (@KDsIntellect) February 12, 2017 The Durant-Westbrook beef reached full force when the two engaged in a shouting match while retreating to their respective benches during a timeout midway through the third quarter. Finally, things boiled over when Andre Roberson fouled Durant on a layup attempt — a foul the former league MVP took exception to. Roberson and Durant exchanged words before butting heads and jawing with one another. The two had to be separated. In the end, Durant had the last laugh. He finished with a team-high 34 points on 12-for-21 shooting, hitting timely shot after timely shot to keep Oklahoma City down by at least 12 points for the entire second half. The Warriors’ leading scorer hit a deep triple late in the fourth quarter that acted as the dagger, not just for the game, but for the Thunder’s hopes of redemption at its ex-superstar’s decision to jet the franchise over the summer. The Warriors are 3-0 against the Thunder so far this season, each win by at least 16 points. And Durant’s MVP-caliber play is one of the many reasons why Golden State is on pace to repeat as Western Conference champions this season. Giannis took one dribble from halfcourt and dunked Giannis Antetokounmpo got his nickname “The Greek Freak” for a reason — he can do things most other players can’t. And Antetokounmpo showed that incredible athleticism on Saturday when he jetted up court for a Space Jam-like dunk from near the foul line on a fast break.
