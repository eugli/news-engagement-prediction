It was my job to front screen and disrupt him. Was trying to get back in front of him,\" he said, referring to the Rhead incident. \n\"Tried to duck under his arm and he moved it back and hit me on the head. Contact is part of the game, no problem with that.\" Burnley's Joey Barton clashes with Lincoln's Alex Woodyard (Photo: REUTERS) \nHe went on to claim Hawkridge was not scratched in the face, despite replays suggesting he very much was. \nBarton added: \"Unlike their player saying he was kicked on the floor and also the one who jumped and held his face as if he'd been struck. \n\"But that wouldn't make a good story would it. Fair play to Lincoln. They where well organised and that's Cup football. Good luck in next round.\" \nNo-body online was buying Barton's explanations while an old tweet the controversial midfielder sent was dragged up to embarrass him even more. \nIn 2013 the then QPR man tweeted: \"Players who roll around when nobody touches them should be subsequently banned. I hate cheats.
