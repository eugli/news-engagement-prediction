ADP was expected to report 168,000 private-sector job gains for January. (Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP) \nBusinesses added 246,000 jobs in January, payroll processor ADP said Wednesday, possibly signaling the government this week will report a spike in hiring after a recent moderation. \nEconomists expected ADP to record 168,000 new jobs, according to a Bloomberg survey. They estimate the Labor Department on Friday will announce 175,000 additional jobs in the public and private sectors. \n“The U.S. labor market is hitting on all cylinders and we saw small and midsized businesses perform exceptionally well,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \nADP tries to project Labor’s private-sector total but often varies from it markedly. For December, ADP came within 9,000. \nOther labor market indicators, such as initial jobless claims, which typically reflect layoffs, have indicated steady payroll gains. But overall, many economists expect average monthly job growth to slow to about 160,000 this year from 180,000 in 2016 as the low unemployment rate provides employers a smaller pool of available workers. \nIn January, small businesses added 62,000 jobs, mid-size ones,102,000 and large companies, 83,000. \nProfessional and business services led the job gains with 71,000. Trade, transportation and utilities added 63,000; education and health care, 47,000; leisure and hospitality, 17,000; and construction, 25,000. \nManufacturers added 15,000 jobs in a sign the sector may finally be turning around as rising oil prices prompt producers to resume drilling and ordering materials such as steel pipes.
