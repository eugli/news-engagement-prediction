Jeanne Shaheen (@SenatorShaheen) February 8, 2017 \nBut a check of the record shows there was no qualifier about cloture attached to Shaheen’s statement.\nWATCH: \n\nShaheen’s exact words were, “And to suggest that we should not get a fair hearing on the nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, I think is not just something that’s going to be good for the American people. Unlike the Republican majority, I haven’t heard any Democrat saying we don’t think that Judge Gorsuch should get a hearing or that he should get an up-or-down vote. Everybody I talked to agrees that he should get a hearing and an up-or-down vote.”\nA cloture vote is not an up-or-down vote for confirmation, it is to end Senate debate on the nomination and proceed to a vote. Some Democrats have suggested they may filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation vote, thereby preventing an up-or-down vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:27:40.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
