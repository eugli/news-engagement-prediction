Lewis. \n\"I know the emotions surrounding these teams,\" he said. \"If you grew up in Houston, you'll always remember where you were when they played North Carolina State (in the 1983 NCAA championship game).\" \nRosenberg, however, was unable to convince team member Benny Anders, who until a recent appearance in an ESPN documentary on the team had not granted an interview in decades, to join his teammates at the show. \n\"I wish they (Anders' teammates) could have explained to him how the fans would love to see him and how much fun he would have,\" Rosenberg said. \nOther autograph guests include newly minted Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell and several Heisman Trophy recipients, including Earl Campbell and Mike Garrett.
