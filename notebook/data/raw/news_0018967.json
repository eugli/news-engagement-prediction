Cronin and Max Livingston, who wrestles at 152 pounds, both have more than 100 wins, while 220-pounder Brian Kennerly isn't too far away and hopes to get there by the end of the season. \nMartin's only team to have three 100-match winners from the same class is the 2000-2001 squad, when Andrew Helms, Joel Edwards and Shannon Meehan all recorded 100 career wins. \n\"I would have loved to have seen Brian wrestle Joel Edwards,\" Martin said. \"Joel is a little lighter, but that would have been a battle. Helms was a little bigger than Cronin or Max. But him and Max would have had battles too.\" \nCronin, Livingston and Kennerly are trying to do something that group or any other Upper Darby team has never done. \n\"We're not looking at the wins,\" Cronin said. \"We just want to all place at states and at least get two state championships this year. That's what we're really working for right now.\" \nLivingston is ranked fifth in District 1 in the 152-pound weight class. He was one win away from states last year, finishing fifth in the region. \nCronin has one loss this year and is ranked as the top District 1 wrestler in his weight class. Last season, he finished fourth at states and hopes to compete for a state title once again. \nThe two have been wrestling partners since first grade. \n\"He's one of a kind,\" Livingston said of Cronin. \"He's very creative. So not only does it help me, it helps mold me as well. I teach him things. He teaches me things, and it really helps us both.\" \nKennerly didn't start wrestling until middle school. He hasn't lost a match this season and is ranked at the top of his weight class in the district. \nThe 220-pounder went to states in 2016, but he didn't place. He hopes to contend for a state championship as well. \n\"It would mean a lot because I never expected it,\" Kennerly said. \nNext season, Cronin is headed to wrestle at the University of Pittsburgh, and Kennerly will wrestle at the University of Virginia. Livingston is still deciding where he will go. \n\"If I left with a gold medal and they didn't, I wouldn't be as happy,\" Kennerly said. \"I want the triple crown.\" More Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:26:40.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
