But that’s not really very funny when you consider that he was fired by one for his erratic behavior and from the other because he was implicated in a scandal concerning possible connections to the Russian government. \nSomething has gone very wrong with our system that such a person could come so close to high levels of power in two administrations. But Flynn did. His short tenure and the circumstances of his departure have brought all the questions about Russian involvement in the campaign into the White House, where they cannot be ignored any longer. \nI had always tended to believe that Trump probably didn’t really have any personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. Trump is such a serial exaggerator that his allusions to it struck me as hype. His great pleasure in being stroked with Putin’s compliments indicated that Trump didn’t actually know him. It’s also obvious that he truly admires Putin’s strongman leadership style and that’s disturbing enough. \nStill, there has been the nagging sense for some time that there’s something off about the way Trump speaks about Putin. It’s obsequious and submissive, which is very uncharacteristic of his normal style and one cannot help but wonder why that is. Trump is not servile toward anyone in this world — except Vladimir Putin. It would be one thing if we could chalk it up as another one of Trump’s weird psychological tics and hope that he isn’t so subject to flattery that he decides to help the Russian leader carve up Europe just to keep his approval. But it seems there’s more to it than that. \nThe Russian story has been bubbling under the surface for months, of course. The hiring of Paul Manafort, best known in recent years for his career as a lobbyist for pro-Russian Ukraine politicians — and a stranger to American politics since the 1980s — seemed odd. Still, there was no reason for serious suspicion since Manafort had once been partners with Trump’s good friend Roger Stone and had lived in Trump Tower at one time. Anyway, the world of political consultants is very small. So no big deal. \nWhen the word came down that the Democratic National Committee had determined it had been hacked by what its security firm said were foreign actors associated with the Russian government, I don’t think anyone saw an immediate connection. But then came that weird incident at the Republican National Convention last July, when Trump representatives intervened to soften the GOP’s official policy on Ukraine. Again, by itself this would not be a huge deal. But when combined with Trump’s strangely passive attitude toward Putin and the hiring of a man who had spent years working in politics in the region, people started to wonder. \nIt was only a few days later that Trump made his shocking public invitation to the Russian government to “find” Hillary Clinton’s personal emails and deliver them to the media. He suggested afterward he had only been joking. Maybe so. \nSince that time suspicions have only grown. The U.S. government verified that the Russians had hacked various people and institutions in the presidential campaign, the WikLleaks dumps happened and we have learned that the FBI had been investigating possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government since last spring. \nThe mainstream media finally revealed that, except for Mother Jones , they’d been sitting on an explosive dossier compiled by a credible oppo researcher with deep ties to Russia that suggested members of the Trump campaign, including his hand-picked national security adviser, were in touch with Russian officials and that the Russians had some compromising material (or kompromat ) on Trump himself. The infamous details of the kompromat have not been verified but other elements of the dossier appear to have some basis in truth. \nSince Flynn was forced to resign due to an inappropriate conversation with the Russian ambassador pertaining to lifting sanctions, one can no longer avoid asking whether Trump was personally involved. After all, those sanctions that Flynn apparently assured the ambassador would be revisited after Trump took office were imposed precisely because Russia had apparently interfered in the election on Trump’s behalf. \nSo here we are, with the GOP-led Congress finally rousing itself to open a serious investigation. They sent around a memo telling the White House to keep all records pertaining to Russia, which is a start. Over the weekend, this startling new report appeared in the New York Times: \nA week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was hand-delivered to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document; Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia; and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. \nThis report was characterized by Michael Weiss, senior editor of the Daily Beast, this way: Jesus. Trump's lawyer, a mobster and a Manafort-minted Ukrainian pol are trying to blackmail Poroshenko. https://t.co/loTQd8cuWH \n— Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) February 19, 2017 \nBoth Manafort and Cohen were among those said to be under investigation by the government. The Trump business associate, Felix Sater, is the Russian-born “mobster” (and convicted felon) who has apparently also been a CIA and FBI informant for years. As Josh Marshall lays out in this piece , Sater’s story is bizarre and incredible — but no more so than the fact that the president of the United States has been financially connected with him for years. \nWe don’t have enough information to come to any conclusions about any of this yet. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias points out, however, there is a long list of questions that must be addressed. What this growing scandal makes more clear than ever how unacceptable it is that we have a president who won’t properly divest himself of his business dealings around the world and refuses even to reveal what they are. It’s untenable. Trump cannot govern under these circumstances. Heather Digby Parton, also known as \" Digby ,\" is a contributing writer to Salon.
