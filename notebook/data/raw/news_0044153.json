From general information about cannabis, as the plant is also called, to ways it can be turned into edibles, oils and tinctures, the workshop covered all aspects of using marijuana as a medicine. \nPeople also showed up to tell others how the plant has helped them. \n“I came today to share my experiences,” cancer survivor Jennifer May told CTV Barrie. “This excites me… to see how people are reacting, and it’s positive.” \nThe workshop was held Saturday at The Barn Co-op , a community hub in Meaford, Ont. So many people came out that it was standing room only. The workshops have proven to be so popular that they are now being held on a monthly basis. \nThe events even feature a cannabis cooking class. \n“I’m learning that it’s actually not a hard process at all,” Midland, Ont. resident Mary Ellen told CTV Barrie. “It looks like it’s something I could do myself.” \nOrganizers say the stigma of using the plant is now fading away. \n“(That) allows us to share our stories, our experiences, with one another,” presenter Fred Harris said. \nIn Canada, it has been legal to use marijuana for medical purposes since 2001. Currently, the only legal way to obtain the plant, outside of growing it yourself, is through a licensed producer after receiving written approval from a health care practitioner. \nThe federal Liberals, who campaigned on the promise of legalizing recreational marijuana, are expected to unveil legislation to this effect this spring. \nWith files from CTV Barrie Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:37:38.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
