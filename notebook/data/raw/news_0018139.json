Sadly, the mainstream media have kept this disaster “on the down-low” in order to not panic the public, just as they did when Chernobyl took out millions with cancer.\nWith sieverts now reaching 530 and talks that they could go as high as 5,000, the mainstream media is forced to report on this devastation, however they fail to mention the repercussions it will have on humanity.\nIn the video below I use scientific facts to prove just how bad this event really is and the effects it will have on those here in America….\nHere’s what the globalists have to say about decreasing the worlds population, and I believe, they allow things like Fukushima specifically for that:\nAt the United Nations Biodiversity Assessment on Sustainable Human Population; US Senate September 9, 1994:\n“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be one billion people. This must be implemented within 30-50 years, 2/3’s of the population must be cut.”\n“The UN says property rights are not absolute and unchanging, but are there for the convenience of whatever government wants to do.” – Michael Coffman\nPrice Phillip, Duke of Edinburg:\n“If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.”\nHenry Kissinger:\n“Depopulation should be the highest priority of U.S. foreign policy towards the Third World.”\nTheodore Roosevelt:\n“Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind”\nTed Turner, in an interview with Audubon Magazine:\n“A total world population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”\nThomas Ferguson, State Department Office of Population Affairs:\n“There is a single theme behind all our work–we must reduce population levels. Either governments do it our way, through nice clean methods, or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran or in Beirut. Population is a political problem. Once population is out of control, it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it….”“Our program in El Salvador didn’t work. The infrastructure was not there to support it. There were just too goddamned many people…. To really reduce population, quickly, you have to pull all the males into the fighting and you have to kill significant numbers of fertile age females….” “The quickest way to reduce population is through famine, like in Africa, or through disease like the Black Death….”\nAlexander King, Bertrand Schneider – Founder and Secretary, respectively, The Club of Rome, The First Global Revolution, pgs 104-105, 199:\n“In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill…. But in designating them as the enemy, we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.”\nPaul Ehrlich in The Population Bomb:\n“A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people…. We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many apparently brutal and heartless decisions.” Stanford Professor ”\nJacques Cousteau UNESCO Courier 1991:\n“In order to save the planet it would be necessary to kill 350,000 people per day.”\nRobert Walker, former chair of PepsiCo and Proctor & Gamble on water:\n“Water is a gift of nature. Its delivery is not. It must be priced to insure it is used sustainably….Ted Turner makes the radical statement that, “A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal,””\nClub of Rome, The First Global Revolution, 1991:\n“In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill (this is absolute proof that man made global warming is a fabrication)…. But in designating them as the enemy, we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.”\nBill Gates TED Talk\n“First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3.”\nMore Critical Reads You Need to Hear by Lisa Haven!
