Picture: 7:30 News Corp Australia Network Share on Twitter \nTHANKS to the silence of the great broadcaster and one its famous presenters, no-one will know if the ABC’s Leigh Sales actually did get through to Centrelink yesterday. \nThe 7.30 Report host gave Centrelink a blast on her twitter account this week after the government agency kept her on hold for more than two hours — for the second time this week. \nThe TV presenter asked why she had been left on hold for more than two hours, which she posted onto her twitter account. \nIt was unclear why the agency had kept the presenter on hold for so long, but it did respond eventually, on twitter. \n“Hi Leigh, what are you calling about? We’ll try to help you here. Just remember, it’s not safe to share personal info on Twitter.” @centrelink Does centrelink ever answer its phone? 2 hours on hold last week fruitlessly, heading in the same direction today. — Leigh Sales (@leighsales) February 8, 2017 @centrelink Does centrelink ever answer its phone? 2 hours on hold last week fruitlessly, heading in the same direction today. — Leigh Sales (@leighsales) February 8, 2017 . @Centrelink @leighsales this is absolutely not your fault - Centrelink is so desperately underfunded - but 12/16 mins is just not true. pic.twitter.com/XvuplC37pI — Sally Rugg (@sallyrugg) February 8, 2017 \nSales responded with a simple “Thanks for the tip” before asking the agency for a phone number that might be answered inside 10 minutes. \n“Hi Leigh, call wait times can vary. However, if you can tell us what you’re calling about we may be able to help direct you,’ Centrelink responded. \nSales hit straight back: ‘I’ve told you what I want: a phone number that will be answered in fewer than two hours’. \nCentrelink responded again: ‘Families line open til 8pm on 136 150, otherwise our other lines reopen 8am. Our average answer time is around 16 mins’. Anyone know if Leigh Sales has gotten through to @Centrelink yet? #abc730 — Boba Khan (@Deyterkmahjerb) February 8, 2017 Surprising number of people in my twitter feed sharing stories of appalling waiting times to get through to @Centrelink on the phone. — Leigh Sales (@leighsales) February 8, 2017 Leigh Sales wants #Centrelink to answer the phone in under 2 hours.

Classic Robot Human chaos. 😳😂😋😂😳🤖😮😳💡😜 — Blue Book Art Robot (@ERN_Malleyscrub) February 8, 2017 \nSales’ frustration became a hotly-followed topic with readers posting about their own long wait times. \nOthers speculated on why the popular TV figure would need to speak to Centrelink, with another quipping that the best way to get a response from Centrelink was to acquire a debt and wait for the Robo-debt recovery phone call. \nThe great question about whether Sales actually got through to the agency won’t be answered, however. A spokesman for the ABC confirmed the broadcaster would not be making a comment about the matter. And Sales has not posted an update about whether she finally got through either. The entire twitterverse left with many questions, but no answers. \nNews Corp phone Centrelink several times for comment, but the line was busy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:34:16.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
