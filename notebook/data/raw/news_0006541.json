Eruption is when a tooth becomes visible in the mouth. \nRead the latest tweets from Nancy Hixt below and scroll down to continue reading today’s article \nTweets by @NancyHixt \nCourt was also shown images taken from surveillance videos June 30, 2014 near the Liknes home and two nearby businesses. \nForensic video analyst Kathryn McCaw said Thursday she was asked to compare the CCTV images with a re-enactment done by police with the Garland truck in the same areas. \nAt 5:15 a.m. on June 30, photos showed something white in the truck box. \nAt 7:37 a.m., the truck is caught on tape in the same area, driving in the opposite direction. McCaw said at that time it had “no contents visible in back of the truck.” \nMcCaw also noted numerous similarities between the truck on CCTV and the Garland truck, including same make, model, and colour. She also pointed out rust on both trucks in the same areas. \nWatch below: Global’s ongoing coverage of Douglas Garland’s murder trial Tech crimes experts testify in triple-murder trial of Douglas Garland ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:06:56.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
