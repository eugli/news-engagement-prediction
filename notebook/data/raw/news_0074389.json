This type of behaviour not only puts a black eye on our sport but puts you in the spotlight as well,” Doram said. \nThe email went on to say “Hockey Edmonton expects all participants to police themselves and police each other.” \nDoram did not say how many parents were suspended or what level of hockey was involved. \n“We lose a number of officials every year because of threats made by parents and coaching staff towards them. We can’t afford to lose these folks; they are an integral part of our game. Many of these referees are young people and we need to remember you are an adult and need to conduct yourself in a more mature manner.” \nThe suspended parents are not allowed to attend games for the rest of the season and the suspensions can carry over to the next season. \nDoram asked parents to ensure their actions in the arena “are a positive influence in their child’s athletic experience.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
