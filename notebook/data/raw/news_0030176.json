Close \nAfter their White House meeting, the North American neighbours emerged to hail their close ties, with Trump promising to \"build upon our very historic friendship\" and Trudeau noting the \"special\" bond between the countries. \nBut it was hard to escape their contrasting worldviews. Another handshake and another awkward moment as Canadian PM Justin Trudeau came face to face with Donald Trump. Photo: Getty Images \nSpeaking to reporters, Trump defended his restrictive refugee and immigration orders, saying that \"we cannot let the wrong people in.\" Trudeau, on the other hand, said Canada continues to \"pursue our policies of openness.\" Trudeau says Canada will welcome refugees rejected by US \nTrudeau later acknowledged that there are times when the two countries differ. \nBut he said, \"The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they chose to govern themselves.\" \nDuring their post-meeting news conference, the reporters Trump called on did not ask about two pressing issues of the day - the future of embattled National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and North Korea's reported ballistic missile launch. After an awkward handshake between Trump and Japan's Shinzo Abe, all eyes were on the body language when Trudeau came to Washington DC. Photo: AP \nTrump greeted Trudeau with a firm handshake as the Canadian arrived at the White House on a blustery morning. The two posed silently before reporters, until Trump suggested they shake hands for the cameras. \nTrump's daughter Ivanka Trump was in attendance at the meeting and helped recruit participants and set the agenda, fresh evidence of her policy influence. \nSaid Trump: \"In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive, and I think that's happening in the United States much more so. And Ivanka is very much involved in this. And I appreciate you being involved in it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:50:26.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
