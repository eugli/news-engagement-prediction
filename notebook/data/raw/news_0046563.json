By Cavan Sieczkowski \nLindsay Lohan alleges she was profiled at London’s Heathrow Airport on Monday while wearing a headscarf. \nThe actress, who has been reading and studying the Quran , claimed she was stopped by an airport employee during an interview with “Good Morning Britain” Tuesday . \n“When I was flying to New York recently, I was wearing headscarf and I got stopped,” she said. “She [an airport official] opened my passport and saw ‘Lindsay Lohan’ and started immediately apologizing, but then said, ‘Please take off your headscarf.’ And I did. It’s OK. But what scared me was, at that moment, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock.” Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Lindsay Lohan speaks with press after visiting Syrian refugees in Turkey. \nLohan, who described the experience as “jarring,” said she was traveling from Turkey and wore the headscarf out of respect. \n“I felt more comfortable that way [with the headscarf] and then I was a little scared going to America,” she added. \nA representative for Heathrow Airport was not immediately available to comment on the situation. \nThe “Mean Girls” star has been seen carrying a Quran since 2015. During an interview earlier this month with the Daily Mail, she said the current political climate surrounding President Donald Trump ’s Muslim ban has left her unsettled. \n“I was scared to come here with everything going on because of my personal beliefs,” she said.
