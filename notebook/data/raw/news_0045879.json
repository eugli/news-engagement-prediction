SCREEN GRAB \nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif has said terrorism is not synonymous to any religion, and equating militancy with Islam has in fact given a rise to extremism worldwide. \n“Terrorism is not synonymous to any religion… terrorists are not Muslims or Christians or Buddhists or Hindus…they are criminals,” the defence minister said while addressing the Munich Security Conference 2017 on Sunday. \n“This Islamophobia… it is fuel when terrorism is branded as Islamic terrorism. Since morning I have heard maybe a dozen times. President [Donald] Trump uses it very frequently,” he said. \nMeanwhile, he also denounced the seven-state ban, which was recently ‘enforced’ by the United States. \n“With all due respect, with all humility on my disposal, this ban on seven states, whatever perceptions the US has, has not helped the fight against terrorism.” \nPunjab decides to seek Rangers help after upsurge in terror attacks \nIn the most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, Trump signed an executive order earlier this month to pause the entry of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. A US judge, however, had overruled the executive order. \nPakistan a frontline state against terrorism \nAsif said the recent spate of terror attacks across Pakistan has manifested that more is to be done. \n“We’ll counter this threat with full might of our state and we expect and hope that there will be cooperation from from across the border in Afghanistan… because it’s a common fight,” he said. \n“We have made mistakes in the past [but] for the last three years our armed forces have done a very good job and we intend to continue that.” \nHe assured that the world community that Pakistan was a frontline state in this war and will continue to fulfill its obligations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:22:46.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
