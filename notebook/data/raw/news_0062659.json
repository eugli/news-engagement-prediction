Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday urged congressional Democrats to “stand up” and “fight” against the Trump administration’s plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, suggesting they “take a page” from Republican lawmakers who blocked the Obama and Clinton administrations’ major policy initiatives.\nAt a rally in the Bronx, organized by the local 1199 SEIU health care workers union, Cuomo said he had a message for Democrats in Congress: “It’s not time to make a deal. It’s not time to get political. It’s time to get principled.” Most Popular Supporters of suspect in jogger case stage rally NYC pol: Protect immigrants from deportation MTA: Subway ridership dropped in 2016 JFK’s Ark pampers livestock before air travel NYPD: Bull dies after getting loose in Queens\nDemocrats “have to stand up and learn from what the Republicans did when they didn’t agree with something,” Cuomo said. “The Republican Congress fought Bill Clinton every step of the way, and the Republican Congress fought Barack Obama every step of the way, and these Democrats have to take a page out of their book, and say, ‘We’re not going to let you take us backwards.’” See also Tell us: How is Trump doing?

Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove), the newest member of Long Island’s congressional delegation, said he agreed with Cuomo “that we need to fight hard to defend our values,” and avoid a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But he added, “My goal is to try and work across party lines with Democrats and Republicans to actually try and solve problems.”\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\nColeman Lamb, a spokesman for Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City), said Rice “certainly agrees that all of us need to stand our ground in this fight . . . For Representative Rice this isn’t about opposing Republicans to score political points, it’s about protecting the millions of people who will lose health insurance if President Trump and Republicans in Congress repeal the ACA instead of working with Democrats to improve it.”\nWednesday’s rally of more than 650 union members, held on the campus of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was billed as an event to speak out against GOP-led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But Cuomo, whose name has been routinely floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, used the occasion to decry the Trump administration’s overall agenda.
