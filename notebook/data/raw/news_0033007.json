By Anusha Iyengar | Published: February 15, 2017 3:21 pm Rahat Fateh Ali Khan was introduced to musical comedy on ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’! \nPakistani singer Momina Mustehsan became an internet sensation after becoming a part of Coke Studio. She became an instant favourite after she sang Afreen Afreen with Rahat Fateh Ali Khan in one of the episodes. And not only does she have a beautiful voice but the singer looks breathtakingly gorgeous. Apart from Afreen, Momina also went on to singing more songs for Coke Studio, Tera Woh Pyar being one of the best. While the rest of the world was celebrating Valentine’s Day with their special someone, Momina called off her engagement and announced it on her Snapchat and Facebook accounts. \nShe wrote on her Facebook,” Yes, our families have mutually agreed to call off the engagement. Earlier when the news broke, I requested everyone not to jump to conclusion and to not speak on my behalf on such a personal matter, and let me be the one to make the announcement when need be. No one gets engaged to have it called off, but sometimes things don’t go the way you would have wanted to or thought. Such is life. Fortunately, the best part of our life is that it goes on. It has to. I would appreciate if no further speculations are made.” (ALSO READ: Valentine’s Day should be Me-Day, says Jennifer Winget ) \nTake a look at her Facebook status right here. \nMomina also posted a Snapchat picture of a gift she received on Valentine’s Day and captioned it,” Single girls get Valentine’s gifts too. Thanks @beoneshopone”. The singer was engaged to a US based banker, Ali Naqvi. She had even announced her engagement on Facebook saying,” Hi world. Meet my fiancé, Ali Naqvi. We met each other for the first time less than a month ago, our families really liked each other and now we’re engaged. Though we wanted to keep this only between our close family and friends, and celebrate this privately and get to know each other without unnecessary hype and interference, news got everywhere. I firmly believe that everyone has a right to keep their private life to themselves, but in this case, the ball is no longer in our court.” \nBut like she said, life has to go on!
