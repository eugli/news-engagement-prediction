On one hand, they can be regressive and objectifying (if you've ever seen footage of JonBenet Ramsey 's performances, you know what we mean). On the other, they offer a powerful platform, like when Miss Iceland 2015 dropped out to protest fat-shaming, Miss USA crowned an Army Reserve officer , and Miss Teen USA officials nixed the swimsuit portion of the event (also controversial) and replaced it with athletic wear. \nKeeping in line with the latter, 26-year-old Justine Clarke competed in the South Australian state final of the Miss World Australia competition last weekend—and made headlines. Her dress was ivory, and hair Rapunzel long, but what caught eyes and made the news was her wheelchair. Although you, like us, might be groaning that pageants as we know them have existed for a long time (the Miss America franchise, for instance, has been around for nearly a century) and this is only the first time a visibly disabled person has made it to this level, it's at least a move in the right direction. \n“For somebody in a wheelchair to be able to compete is a big thing,\" she told Australian media outlet The Advertiser . \"I really hope it sends a message that no matter what your race, size, or disability—whatever makes you different—you are beautiful.” Facebook PHOTO: Tracy Teague \nClarke has been wheelchair-bound for two years due to a leg deformity. \"I was so nervous about entering the competition as I’ve never done anything like this before, but I was also really excited,\" she tells Glamour . \"I'm surprised by how accepting and supportive everyone has been. It’s really nice to know so many people around the world are supporting my cause.\" Loading View on Instagram \nIt's an essential message, because while so much focus is placed on inclusivity concerning race and body size (and rightly so) disabilities get short shrift. Diversity, for some reason, doesn't always extend to health matters. You rarely if ever see disabled people on TV serving as more than a convenient plot device. But there's hope. Nordstrom, for one, has been quietly including models with disabilities in their catalogues since the '90s. Even though Miss World Australia has garnered a lot of initial fanfare for this, the goal is that this sort of thing becomes so normal and expected that we don't think twice when a wheelchair rolls across a stage. \nClarke didn't make it to the next round of the Miss World Australia, but she's still eligible for the Beauty With a Purpose initiative, a subset of the Miss World competition that's raising funds for a children's charity. \"Miss World Australia really is a family, and I’m so appreciative they’ve welcomed me with open arms,\" says Clarke. It's not a surprise that she plans to run again. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:18:01.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
