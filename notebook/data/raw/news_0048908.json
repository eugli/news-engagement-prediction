More than 7,000 people over the age of 50 currently living in Manchester identify as LGBT. \nA recent report by the Manchester-based LGBT Foundation, commissioned by the council, revealed that older LGBT people experience higher levels of loneliness and isolation. \nMany were fearful of discrimination in existing accommodation and the research found there was a desire for affordable LGBT-specific housing where people could be open about their identity in later life. \nThe extra care scheme – a targeted development for older people – will house a minimum of 51% LGBT residents, but heterosexual people will also be welcome to apply to live in the accommodation. \nThe housing will have specially trained staff based on site and pets will be welcome. As well as the LGBT Foundation, the project is being supported by Stonewall Housing and the Homes and Communities Agency. No specific location or timetable for the project has been announced. \nCarl Austin-Behan, who was last year named as Manchester’s first openly gay lord mayor, said it was important for people to know they were going to be respected by the other people living in their sheltered accommodation. \n“In this day and age, when people are more open and able to speak freely about their sexuality, some of the older generation are still a little bit more reserved with it,” he said. “It’s important that once they’ve come out and been themselves ... that 20 years later they don’t feel like they can’t be themselves, and aren’t discriminated against.” \nA 2014 survey of care home staff by Nottingham University found that LGBT residents were not disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity to staff, with many care home workers thinking there weren’t any LGBT residents in the accommodation they worked in. \nCllr Bev Craig, one of Manchester city council’s leads for the LGBT community, said that prejudice and discrimination could be a real problem facing older LGBT people. “[They] shouldn’t have to face the prospect as they get older of being surrounded by people who may not accept their sexuality or gender identity,” she said. \n“Older people should never feel isolated by who they are, or who they love. Alongside improving this in general provision, it is time that we develop a scheme in Manchester that provides care for LGBT people, providing a place where the LGBT community can give each other a network of support in older age.” \nPaul Martin, chief executive of the LGBT Foundation, said that in the charity’s research over half of the lesbian, gay and bisexual people over 55 surveyed felt that their sexual orientation would have a negative impact on getting older, with social isolation identified as a major concern. \n“Manchester prides itself as an Age-Friendly City, and we welcome the announcement of this scheme as a significant move towards improving the lives of older LGBT people in the area,” he said.
