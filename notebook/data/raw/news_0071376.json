He’d already returned to the middle of the circle, arms flexed, mouth open, leading 6-2 and looking like he’d just gulped a pot of coffee. \n“Let’s go!” he yelled. \nIn the parlance of coaches, family and teammates, Harman is a wrestler with a “gas tank” that never runs empty and a “motor” that rarely sputters. One year after placing second in 6A at 145 pounds — which he called a personal disappointment — the top-seeded Harman won the first of what he hopes is three state titles by hounding the unseeded Simko for 4 minutes, 41 seconds before winning by fall at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. \n“That’s a typical Sean match,” West Linn coach Doug Samarron said. “‘I’m going to terrorize you for about four minutes until you don’t like it and then I’m going to pin you.’” \nWhen Harman was growing up, he used to sneak down to the floor level at the Coliseum during the state wrestling championships with his father, where they’d watch his brothers, Ryan and Tim, compete up-close. Wrestling is in the family DNA: His grandfather, father and both brothers have or will wrestle for Navy (Tim, a two-time state champ for West Linn, begins his freshman year in Annapolis next fall). \nThat lineage created high expectations for Sean. \n“I watched my brothers win on the big stage and lose on the big stage and every time they lost I felt the hit, and every time they won I felt like I was on top of the world with them,” Harman said. “Two, three workouts a day and all that stress wondering if i’m good enough and fast enough and to finally get the title … it felt so good. \n“I had him (Simko) in the cradle and said, ‘I’m going to be state champ.’ I thought, damn that’s got a nice ring to it.” \nTo get there, Harman has cultivated a style that, for opponents, has become anything but nice to deal with. \nSamarron called him rare, not only for his success so early — he earned freshman All-America honors last year through the All-Phase Wrestling club — but because he has a fine-tuned understanding of technique while also possessing a wild “motor” that can overwhelm, if necessary, by brute force. \n“My mentality is, OK, I’ve got to break this kid,” he said. \nHarman finishes the high school season 38-1, with the lone loss to four-time state champion Lane Van Anrooy of Roseburg. Harman went up in weight to face Van Anrooy, motivated by seeing how he’d fare. Seeking out touch matches is something of a habit. At All-Phase, his regular training partner is North Marion’s Lane Stigall, a three-time state champ in Class 4A at 152. \nHarman, his brother Tim said, has “high aspirations that extend beyond high school, and the match against Van Anrooy was as much about a marquee win in 2017 as it was about what he’d need to work on to get better for his junior and senior seasons. (For extra motivation, it also didn’t hurt that, in 2015, Harman watched as Van Anrooy edged Tim Harman by just one point in the 6A 152-pound state final.) \n“If I want to be the best college wrestler and not just the best in high school, I’ve got to chase those big guys and Van Anrooy is one of those big names you have to wrestle if you want to be top dog,” Harman said. “He’s a beast.” \nAfter his punishing win Saturday, more than a few said the same about Harman. \n-- Andrew Greif", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:21:21.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
