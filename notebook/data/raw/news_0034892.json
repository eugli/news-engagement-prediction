The move came as opposition parties urged him to order a halt on winter disconnections until proposed legislation banning them can be passed after MPPs return from their Christmas recess next week.\n“At no point, under any circumstances, should a customer be put at risk over their electricity bill,” Thibeault wrote in a letter to utilities Thursday.\n“All LDCs (local distribution companies) should commit to this high standard,” he added.\nIn December, Hydro One announced it would no longer do winter disconnections and promised to hook 1,400 customers back onto the grid.\n  Officials have said some utilities in the province have quietly adopted informal policies of not disconnecting customers for non-payment over the winter.\nOthers put limits on how much electricity customers in arrears can use.\nThibeault said some northern and rural residents who lose hydro also end up without water because they use electric pumps to raise it from wells.\n“If you knock out power . . . there’s no water,” he told the Star from his Sudbury riding.\nNew Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said Thibeault’s letter “falls far short of the actions Ontarians expect and deserve” and joined the Progressive Conservtatives in accusing him of playing “political games.”\nThe Conservatives have called on the government to break the winter disconnection ban from a larger bill introduced last June. It is being studied by a legislative committee.\n“Families are freezing in the cold,” said Tory MPP Todd Smith, his party’s energy critic, who repeated a demand that Thibeault order the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to ban winter disconnections by utilities.\nThibeault said he doesn’t have that power under the Electricity Act passed by a previous Tory government in 1998.\nBreaking the component out of the bill that gives the OEB more power over disconnections would take longer because it mean going back to “square one” in the legislative process, Thibeault added.\nThe Liberals have offered to bring the bill back for final debate starting Feb. 28.\n“We can do this quickly if we work together,” Thibeault said\nAbout 60,000 customers had their electricity disconnected for non-payment last year. The energy board does not yet have statistics for this winter.\nIn the meantime, Thibeault   have promised more relief on high electricity prices in the coming weeks, in addition to instant rebates on the 8 per cent provincial portion of the HST.\nThe energy minister acknowledged the government has done a “very poor job” of communicating the reasons behind the rise in hydro rates and on programs for low-income families to get assistance.\n“People don’t understand it,” he said. “Not only are the bills confusing. So is the system.”\nRead more: \nRelief package coming for northern, rural Hydro users, Kathleen Wynne says \nElectricity prices spur renewed push to have Hydro One $100,000-plus salaries on the ‘sunshine list’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:01:27.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
