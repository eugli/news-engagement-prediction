Physical fitness has been at the centre of Hrithik Roshan 's prep for any film, right from his debut film, 'Kaho Naa...Pyaar Hai' to his last release, the Sanjay Gupta-directed 'Kaabil'. \n\nThe 43-year-old actor is set to take his commitment a notch higher by launching a workout regime for everyone who wants a body like his, which he has designed with his fitness trainer, Mustafa Ahmed . \n\nThe duo will also train a bunch of experts from select gyms in the definite knowledge, technique and philosophy endorsed by the regime. \n\nHrithik Roshan: I don’t take the term ‘role model’ too seriously Be it his swift dance moves or acting prowess, Hrithik Roshan has a fan base not only outside Bollywood, but within the industry as well. \n\"Through this initiative, he hopes to share with people all the knowledge he has acquired about healthy living and the gym,\" informs Mustafa, who has been training with Hrithik since January 2016. \n\n\"The workout is inspired from animal moves. Exercises include compound and functional movements, lots of stretches and core strengthening. The aim is to help people move more freely, without pain and it's done in a way that challenges everyone.\" \n\nThe three-level course will be available from next month. The routine doesn't involve diet plans but will emphasise on the importance of eating right. \n\nHrithik on a break at a health farm in Germany 00:27 \nB'wood celebs spotted 1 600 B'wood celebs spotted Shahid Kapoor took his wife Mira Rajput for an outing, the celebrity couple was snapped at Bandra in Mumbai on February 23, 2017.
