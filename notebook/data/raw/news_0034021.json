Read More \nThe loud chants of Sherlocks’ Army begin long before there's any sign of the band and carry on at any opportunity once they're on stage, too - encouraged by Andy’s bass chords between songs. (Photo: Jack Kirwin Photography) \nLive for the Moment kicks things off, Last Night is raucous, and Brandon’s precision drumming keeping things in check on Escapade. \nNew single and old favourite Was It Really Worth It? - currently riding high on Radio One and BBC 6 Music - is now an even bigger song, its evocative first five chords, spine tingling chorus, and awesome lyrics make it a fearless and timeless tune. Read More \nNew numbers Candle Light and Nobody Knows, plus the big sound and intricate guitar work on the haunting Will You Be There?, have everyone bouncing. The band even surprise fans by playing a fully reworked, country vibe version of Motions. (Photo: Jack Kirwin Photography) \nBlue, with Josh and Andy on soaring backing vocals, and long-time anthem Chasing Shadows wrap things up alongside a huge confetti drop and stunning illuminations by lighting supremo Craig Greenhalgh. \nAgainst convention, The Sherlocks are a roots up band who have grafted for years to earn a night like this. Here was a people's band at a people's venue. These indie insurgents already have fans that could last a lifetime; this gig won them for ever more.
