We cannot go to visit him, we have to wait until somebody he knew in Dubai goes to see him then lets us know how he is and one person sends a photograph of him each week just lying in hospital,” Diane said. \n“He turned 70 last November and we wonder how much longer he can survive. His sons would dearly love to see their dad.” \nMalcome moved to Dubai in the 1980s for work and eventually set up his own construction company employing hundreds of men. \nWhile there he married his Ukrainian wife Olga and the couple had sons Alexandre and Paul.

We are worried we wouldn’t get any further than the airport. \n“The last time we saw him was October 2013 when he came to us here and said how peaceful it was. \n\"We tried to persuade him to stay for Christmas but said ‘I have to go back for the men’. He could be flown back here but the decision has to come from Dubai - they have to release him.” \nBedridden Mr Munroe is now conscious but has very limited movement and cannot speak. \nHis family rely on a friend in Dubai who visits him to send pictures. \nThe avid Manchester United fan, who ‘lived and breathed’ football, was pictured with a football top draped across his hospital bed on his 70th birthday. \nDiane said: “He moves his head from side to side and blinks, that’s it. Our friend says sometimes a tear will trickle down his face when he shows him pictures of the boys or Olga.

His family are in a mess and his sons are pining for him,\" she said. \n“We can’t afford to pay solicitors fees as my husband and I are both pensioners and Malcome’s wife can’t afford it. But we’d appreciate any advice. We never thought it would go on for so long.” \nThe Embassy of the UAE has been approached for comment.
