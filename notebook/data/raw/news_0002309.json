If a child can describe their emotions then they don't have to act them out. \nEarlier at the start of January, in an unrelated incident, a nine-year-old Kaitaia girl died in Auckland's Starship Hospital. \nREAD MORE: \nA spokesman for the coroner said this \"suspected self-inflicted death\" was also being investigated by the coroner. SUPPLIED \nMinistry of Education head of sector enablement and support Katrina Casey says the ministry is supporting the school and students. \nIn the year ending June 2016, eight children aged 10-14 died by suicide, compared to 10 in the same age group during the previous year, according to the provisional suicide figures released by the Coroner's Office . \nWhile one nine-year-old Palmerston North Girl's death in November 2015 was self-inflicted, in a ruling Coroner Carla na Nagara said the girl took an impulsive step to end her distress but did not intend to end her life. \nIn the year to June 2012, one child in the 5-9 age group died by suicide - the youngest since the Coronial Services Unit began collecting comprehensive suicide statistics in 2007. 'AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY' \nPolice Inspector Brett Batty said Waitakere Police have been keeping in contact with the 10-year-old's family and providing support as required. \"This is an absolute tragedy. The thoughts of the community and local police are with the family.\" \nThe girl's death happened just days before the end of the summer holidays but has affected the school community. \nMassey Primary School board of trustees chairman Kurt Jarrett said the school was supporting the family, students, staff and community. \nThe Ministry of Education's traumatic incident team had been working with the school since the girl's death, Jarrett said. \nCounsellors from a local community group had also been made available to staff, students and the girl's family. \n\"Yesterday being the first day back went well staff and then students where talked to right at the start of the day, and care was taking all day along with many available outlets for discussions on the subject. \nI heard at the end of the day that it all went well,\" he said. Ministry of Education head of sector enablement and support Katrina Casey said a plan had been developed, and students and staff who may need extra support identified. \nMassey High School staff would also support the primary school this week before high school students started on Thursday. \n\"We will continue to work with Ministry of Health colleagues, Child Youth and Family and others to ensure the right support is in place for the schools and community,\" Casey said. \n​HOW TO TELL YOUR KIDS \nChild and family psychologist David Stebbing said when adults talked to children about a tragic death like this, they needed to use factually correct but simple language. \nIt wasn't helpful to say someone had \"gone into the sky\" or \"gone to a better place\". It left things too open to interpretation, Stebbing said. \nInstead, allow children to ask questions and clarify why they had asked a question before answering. \nAdults also needed to manage their own reaction and stress because there could be an element of contagion to the child, he said. \nChildren weren't always good at distinguishing possibility versus probability and can become quite distressed. \"You have to have a supportive environment in the sense of people being able to share their sadness,\" Stebbing said. \n\"One of the things that's really important is for families to try to have open forums where kids can bring stuff to the table... \n\"Parents also need to give kids a clear message that emotions are normal and OK. \n\"There's a difference between how you think and feel, and what you do.\" \nWhen talking about the self-inflicted death of a young person, there is often a debate around whether children can understand the idea of death and forever. \nStebbing said he did not think anyone really understood death but children conceptualised permanence in a different way. \n\"It's hard for them to have that same sense of forever as adults would.\" \nATTITUDES NEED TO CHANGE \n​Suicide prevention campaigner Mike King said 20 per cent of children will have a suicidal thought before they leave school. \nKing said the thought may be fleeting or it may grind away at the child. \nAnd 80 per cent of those kids never talk about it. \n\"The questions we need to really ask ourselves is: 'what's happening in society when kids aren't coming to us and talking to us?'\" \nKing said Kiwi kids lived in \"absolute terror\" of what other people would think or say about them. \n\"The pressure on our kids to be perfect is just unbelieveable.\" \nKing said New Zealanders' attitudes towards mental health needed to change to be more accepting of those with problems to curb the number of self-inflicted deaths and suicides. \n\"We've got to make it OK for young people to have problems... everyone has problems,\" he said. \nLifeline (open 24/7) - 0800 543 354 \nDepression Helpline (open 24/7) - 0800 111 757 \nHealthline (open 24/7) - 0800 611 116 \nSamaritans (open 24/7) - 0800 726 666 \nSuicide Crisis Helpline (open 24/7) - 0508 828 865 (0508 TAUTOKO).
