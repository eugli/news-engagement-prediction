It had been kept in a private collection and had never appeared at auction before. The other three known examples are also held by private owners. Its sale at an auction house in Geneva, Switzerland, broke records for the most expensive wristwatch in history, previously held by another Patek Philippe sold a year earlier for £5.8million. Aurel Bacs, a senior consultant at Phillips auction house, which sold the watch, said more than 400 people were in the room during the tense 13-minute bidding process. It was sold last November in an auction that saw buyers from six continents pay a total of £22.3million to purchase 177 different luxury watches. Paul Boutros, head of watches for the Americas for Phillips Bacs and Russo, said: 'I have waited a lifetime to see a 1518 in stainless steel.' Patek Philippe was founded in 1851, and still designs watches today. The Swiss manufacturer creates complicated mechanical pieces, considered to be among the most prestigious in the world. Past owners of their watches have included Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and Pope Pius IX.
