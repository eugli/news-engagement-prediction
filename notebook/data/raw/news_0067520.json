Bush.\nHe is the latest member of a generation of experienced hands who have left U.S. diplomatic ranks in recent months. Some, like Fried, have retired voluntarily, while others Trump chose not to retain.\nMany current and former U.S. officials are troubled by Trump's openness to closer ties with Russia, fearing this could lead to acquiescence in its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and, more broadly, in Russian domination of its other neighbors.\nFree trade advocates are also worried by Trump's decision to abandon the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, his desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and his suggestion he could impose punitive tariffs.\nFried argued against a winner-take-all attitude in which the great powers each try to carve up the world to their advantage.\n\"Spheres of influence ... would mean our acquiescence when great powers – starting with Russia and China – dominated their neighbors through force and fear, while creating closed economic empires,\" he said. \"America would essentially retreat from whole areas of East Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.\"\nIn what appeared another implicit criticism of the current administration, whose efforts to clamp down on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and on refugee admissions have been stymied by the courts, Fried said: \"We are not an ethno-state, with identity rooted in shared blood.\"\nThe retiring diplomat also urged current officials to serve Trump and new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \"with loyalty, dedication and courage.\"\n\"Help Secretary Tillerson. He deserves it. And he needs it. And help the president as well, putting your backs into it.\"\nAmong those who spoke at the event were former Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who took a dig at how long it has taken Trump to fill State Department jobs, including his own.\n\"When Secretary (of State John) Kerry used to say to me as deputy, 'you are truly irreplaceable,' I thought it was just flattery,\" Blinken said. \"Who knew?\" he added, to loud laughter.\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Warren Strobel and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:05:37.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
