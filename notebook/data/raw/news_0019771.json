The brunette beauty showcased every inch of her lithe frame in the black ribbed dress, which she gave an offbeat twist thanks to some simple suede flat trainers. Wearing her ombre-hued tresses in a sleek bob with a blunt fringe, the rising star framed her eyes with lashings of mascara. Keeping accessories to a minimum, Anjela rocked an embroidered colourful clutch and a diamante scoop necklace. Natural beauty: Scraping her dark hair into a tousled updo, the actress framed her eyes with smokey shadow and plumped her pout with a taupe lipstick Sticking to a muted palette: She rocked a metallic gold clutch and classic nude pumps as she posed with director Danny Boyle Keeping good company: Anjela was in great spirits as she mingled with co-star Ewen Bremner Just hanging out: Jonny Lee Miller and Danny Boyle larked around with Anjela on the red carpet And it was clear that months of filming had paid off, shown in the rapport between Anjela and her co-stars as they larked around on the white carpet. Jonny Lee Miller, British actor Ewen Bremner and the iconic film's British director Danny Boyle all cosied up for shots. Joking around, Danny, who praised newbie Anjela for her acting prowess in previous interviews, showed his appreciation for her once more as he took a photo of her posing. The whole gang: The cast looked proud to be showing off the product of their hard work - Trainspotting 2 Working their angles! They separated off, with Anjela stealing centre-stage Anjela was certainly injected a fresh dimension into the Nineties cult film's remake - stripping off in racy scenes with Ewan McGregor. And she's no stranger to racy roles, as she played a Bulgarian model tricked into becoming an Amsterdam sex worker in the 2015 film The Paradise Suite. In the Dutch flick she performs a live sex show for a group of businessmen in X-rated scenes that were so raunchy they were shared on porn sites.

He said: 'It is quite daunting to come back to a character who is so well known and loved. Like all of the characters in Trainspotting, they are people who we feel like we know. 'They are like people who we have really met in life - Begbie, Sickboy, Spud and Diane. It was sort of daunting, but I am Renton, and Renton is me. 'I haven't lived in Scotland since I was 17 years old and there was a sort of trepidation about coming back, thinking maybe I don't have it any more, but then Renton hasn't been in Scotland for 20 years either because he's been in Amsterdam, so our stories are not dissimilar I guess.' Speaking fondly of reuniting with Boyle and his castmates, he added that not much has 'changed' between them Snap-happy: Danny, who praised newbie Anjela for her acting prowess in previous interviews, showed his appreciation for her once more as he took a photo of her posing Pals: It was clear that months of filming had paid off, shown in the rapport between Anjela and her co-stars as they larked around on the white carpet Natural beauty: Wearing her ombre-hued tresses in a sleek bob with a blunt fringe, the rising star framed her eyes with lashings of mascara Back then: The actors cut a completely different figure now then they did in 1996's promotional posters for the original film He added: 'It was very lovely to work with Danny again. I didn't feel like that had changed. The dynamic there was wonderful, and I found him to be a director who pushes you. He is somebody I have done my best work for, I think he pulls great work out of actors. He knows how to do that somehow. 'Just being back with these characters again. Looking back into the eyes of Sickboy again, looking into the eyes of Spud, Begbie and Diane. It was amazing. That was the best bit, they are like people we know.'
