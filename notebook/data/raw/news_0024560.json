Members Sign In Mass. students are increasingly diverse. But their teachers are not. By Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff February 13, 2017 \nThe Massachusetts public school student population has grown increasingly diverse in recent years, but the state’s teaching force has remained overwhelmingly white — a worrisome mismatch that, studies show, reduces minority student performance. \nMinorities accounted for 37 percent of public school enrollment in the last full school year, but only 7.1 percent of the teaching staff, according to records from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for 2015-2016.

Janey, senior project director for the nonprofit Massachusetts Advocates for Children. \nAltogether, school staffs — including teachers plus other workers — are less racially and ethnically diverse than their student bodies in more than 99 percent of public school districts statewide.

Diversity low in Mass. teacher preparation programs \n“It’s a challenge because every superintendent is looking for someone of color, and there’s only so many candidates to go around,” said John Reed, a retired Barnstable teacher who serves as treasurer for the Massachusetts Partnership for Diversity in Education, an organization that works to recruit minority teachers. \nReed, who is also vice president of the NAACP’s Cape Cod chapter, said school districts also need to do a better job of retaining and promoting minority teachers.

And researchers project the gap will grow even wider in the coming years as the student population grows ever more diverse. \nWhy are teaching forces so white? \nExperts say the pipeline to become a teacher — from college to licensing exams to actually getting hired — is riddled with leaks, where minorities exit at higher rates than whites. \n“There are pretty significant leakages of minorities at basically every step along the way,” said Michael Hansen , an education policy researcher at The Brookings Institution in Washington. \nHe said two of the more prominent “leaks” in the pipeline are that minorities are far less likely to major in education and also less likely to graduate from college. \nMultiple factors might be at work, including that minorities are more likely to come from low-income families and to attend lower-performing K-12 schools that inadequately prepare them for college, experts said. \nMinorities are also disproportionately saddled with college debt, which might contribute to the lower graduation rates and might steer those who do graduate toward higher-paying careers. \nMinorities might also be less interested in becoming teachers. “It may be there is a vicious cycle that’s going on because there’s a low representation of minority teachers,” Hansen said. “When students of color are going to pick a major, they don’t think of education because they say, ‘Oh, I don’t know of any teachers who look like me.’” \nHe said that while racial discrimination on the part of those in charge of hiring teachers cannot be ruled out, it is not believed to be a major factor causing the underrepresentation of minorities among teachers. \nThe result is that the pool of candidates that superintendents and principals can hire from is predominantly white. \nOf the 5.1 million adults in Massachusetts, 21 percent were minorities, according to 2010 census figures. \nStudies have shown that students taught by educators of the same race or ethnicity tend to perform better and have fewer absences and suspensions. Teachers have also been shown to have higher expectations for students of the same race, suggesting they are more likely to push those students and to serve as role models for them. \n“They are not huge effects, but they are statistically significant, and it does make a difference,” Hansen said. \nChelsea has the largest student-teacher diversity gap of any traditional (noncharter) public school district in Massachusetts. \nMinorities accounted for 22 percent of all school staffers, or 10 percent among just teachers, last year, both of which were above statewide averages. Yet those figures paled in comparison with the 93 percent of students in the district who were minorities. \nMany districts with the largest student-teacher diversity gaps are places with high percentages of minorities in the general population. They include Lynn, Lawrence, Lowell, Brockton, Holyoke, Malden, and Springfield. \nThose districts, like Chelsea, have staffs that are as, if not more, diverse than the statewide average. But the student bodies in those districts are so overwhelmingly diverse that a major gap has opened up. \nThen there are cases like Waltham, where the diversity gap exists because of a combination of a diverse student body and an overwhelmingly white staff. \nIn Waltham, 55 percent of students were minorities last year, compared with just 6 percent of all staff, and just 3 percent of teachers. \n“We know this is an issue. We know we can do much better at this,” said Shelly Chin, an administrator for Waltham schools who is a member of a diversity task force the district launched in the fall. It will report its recommendations this spring. \n“I don’t think we’ve made as strong as a commitment to [teacher] diversity, or been as public about it, in the past as we should have,” she added. “But I think having new leadership in [Superintendent Drew] Echelson here has brought on a new commitment and made it a priority.” Echelson started the job in July 2015. \nSuperintendents around Massachusetts, while acknowledging that some key factors driving the problem are beyond their control, outlined various steps they have taken to try to increase teacher diversity in their districts. \n“This is very much on the minds of superintendents,” said Thomas Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. “They are always looking for ways to attract candidates.” \n“I think people are realizing more and more that it’s not going to just happen,” he added. “It’s going to have to be planned and more strategic. There’s a lot going on, but there’s a lot more that can be done.” \nIn Springfield, nearly 88 percent of students were minorities, while about 29 percent of the district’s staff were. (Teacher-only data were not available.) \nThat gap “is a big concern and something we’ve put a lot of focus on,” Superintendent Daniel J. Warwick said. “We’re not where we want to be, but we’ve made improvements.” \nEfforts included partnering with Westfield State University to set aside spots each year in the college’s education program for Springfield public school graduates. \nChelsea Superintendent Mary Bourque said her district has also launched efforts to improve teacher diversity, including encouraging high schoolers to return to teach in the district. But she and many others said that’s a challenge. \nAs a society, “We’ve portrayed going into teaching as a horrible profession,” Bourque said. “We’ve bashed teachers. We’ve bashed the unions that represent them.” \n“When, as a country, are we going to go back to the days when we made it glamorous to go into a life of service?” Matt Rocheleau can be reached at .
