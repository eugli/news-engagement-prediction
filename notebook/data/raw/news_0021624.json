We’re looking at you, under construction bowling alley.\nThe practically all-white home is listed by Morgan Rogers of Dorsey Alston Realtors .\nCheck out more views of the blank-canvas property, which has an insane amount of closet space and enough bathrooms to satisfy any demand, below.\nPictures courtesy of Dorsey Alston Realtors.", "external_links": ["http://www.zillow.com/homes/13940-Atlanta-National-DR-Alpharetta-GA-30004_rb/", "http://www.animalplanet.com/embed?page=108115", "http://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-rappers/", "http://www.dorseyalston.com/agents/morgan-rogers/"], "published": "2017-02-07T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:07:52.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
