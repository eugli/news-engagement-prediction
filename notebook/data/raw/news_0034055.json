By the time she reached year 11 in school, though, she had quit. \n\"It got harder and harder when everyone else got taller and I didn't,\" she said. \n\"It was just no fun because as soon as I got the ball someone would take it off me.\" JOANNE CARROLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nKersten works on her parents' dairy farm in the Grey Valley on the West Coast. \nKersten, 22, is a dwarf. She has five older siblings who are all \"six feet, competitive and super sporty\". She is 128 centimetres tall. Except for her height, Kersten is no different from her brothers and sisters: in August she will be one of just two people representing New Zealand at the World Dwarf Games in Canada. \nShe will compete in badminton singles, doubles and mixed doubles, table tennis and possibly power lifting. \nBadminton is Kersten's main sport, but she is not a member of any team and trains using a brick wall at the side of her house in Matai, in the Grey Valley. Supplied \nWest Coast farmer Nina Kersten is representing New Zealand at the World Dwarf Games in Canada. \nHer sister Lisa, who was in the NZ softball team at the 2000 Olympics, also travels over from Christchurch to train with her. \n\"I love badminton. Playing against people of average height has made me play better. I used to play with a social team in Greymouth but it got too much because of work.\" \nWhen she's not training, she works on the family farm. She gets up at 4am every morning to milk 400 dairy cows. JOANNE CARROLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nKersten and Ella Sargison will represent New Zealand in the badminton doubles at the 2017 World Dwarf Games. \n\"My parents have had this farm for 35 years. My brother Isaac manages it and I work milking cows or [doing] any tractor work. I love farming; it's the coolest job and I get so much satisfaction from it [as] you can see the results of how much you put in. Happy cows means you're doing a good job.\" Ad Feedback \nA trip to a Short Statured People of Australia (SSPA) conference when Kersten was 16 got her back into sports. \n\"When I first went over, I picked up a badminton racket and came second, beating people who had been playing for years,\" she said. \nShe continued playing and went on to win medals and trophies in Australian tournaments and represent New Zealand at the Parabadminton World Championships in England in 2015. \n\"I got a silver medal in the women's doubles with Randika Doling from Sri Lanka. It was real cool, we were real chuffed with that. \n\"While I was in England they said 'Why don't you come to the World Dwarf Games?' and I was like 'What's that?',\" she said. \nThe SSPA offered for Kersten to travel with the Australian team to the games in Canada in August. \nHer friend Ella Sargison, 23, from Auckland, whom she had met through Little People of New Zealand, decided she wanted to come too. \n\"She didn't play badminton at all, but she wanted to be my playing partner for the doubles so she started training with a professional coach and has improved so much. We train together every three or four weeks as I go to Auckland or she comes down here,\" Kersten said. \nKersten and Sargison are fundraising to help with the trip to Canada. \nThe seventh World Dwarf Games will be held in Guelph, Ontario from August 5 to 12. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:56:58.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
