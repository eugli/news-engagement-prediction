In 21 minutes against Tennessee on Tuesday at Auburn Arena, an 87-77 wire-to-wire win for the Vols, Wiley finished with just five points, with just two field goal attempts and a staggering seven turnovers. “We did a terrible job getting the ball to Austin on the inside and we turned the ball over a lot,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. “I’m not sure why, because going in, I thought that’s where we had some real advantage. “From the very first possession we tried to get it to him and we turned it over. We were not able to, as a team, create good opportunities, for him to get his touches on the inside, and he was open in there a lot.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Defense has been a big part of the Vols winning four straight games and five of their last six. “We’ve spent a lot of time working on ball-screen defense,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. “We’ve spent a lot of time talking about our guard coming down and rebounding, helping on the backside, especially when we have a post player coming over to alter shots or block some shots.” Auburn freshman guard Jared Harper erupted for 18 points in the first half against the Vols, including 5 of 7 shooting from the 3-point line, but had just three points in the second half. Mustapha Heron had 12 points for the Tigers, but went just 3-for-12 from the field. “If you look at the stat sheet,” Pearl said, “we had a number of guys who just did not play well.” Tennessee held Kansas State to 58 points on Saturday, with the Wildcats shooting 44.8 percent from the field and 35.7 percent from the 3-point line. Kentucky shot 41.7 percent from the field and 25.0 percent from 3 on Jan. 4 and Mississippi State shot 44.1 percent from the field and 25.0 from 3. “I felt like (against Auburn) we did a good job helping each other and rotating,” freshman forward Grant Williams said after scoring 17 points. Rotating and helping isn’t good enough, though. “Knowing our scouting report and coverage,\" Williams said, \"we didn’t do a good job of that tonight.” Tennessee is plus-35 in rebounding margin (174-139) during its four-game win streak — plus-15 in defensive rebounding and plus-20 in offensive rebounding. “I think the biggest thing has been the focus,” Barnes said. “Understanding how fine the line is between winning and losing. We’ve been in so many close games and didn’t finish them.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
