It started in Washington D.C. on social media, naturally, with the campaign calling for \" a day without immigrants ,\" meaning asking foreign-born people not to go to work or shop today in protest of recent immigration bans. Since the hospitality industry relies heavily on immigrants, thousands of restaurants around the country have joined in in solidarity. \nSan Francisco and the entire Bay Area is no exception, with dozens of restaurants and bars shutting down for the day entirely or donating proceeds to various organizations in a show of support. Use this map as a reference for which local restaurants are joining in. If there's no text, that means they are fully closed. If they're participating in other ways, we indicate in each map point. \nKnow of others, or closing your restaurant? Let us know in the comments or at sf@eater.com.
