By Taylor Pittman \nFour-year-old Claire Ryann Crosby and her dad, Dave Crosby, are known for their Disney covers on YouTube . After their performance of “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” from “Toy Story” caught the eye of Ellen DeGeneres , the duo scored a chance to share their talent with a Disney star. \nIn a performance arranged by DeGeneres, Claire sings “How Far I’ll Go” from “Moana” while her dad plays guitar. The best part? Claire got to sing with Auli’i Cravalho , who is the voice behind the character Moana. She even scored a high five from the actress. \nLin-Manuel Miranda , the mastermind behind Broadway’s “Hamilton” and the songwriter behind “How Far I’ll Go,” also tweeted out his praise for the performance. — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) February 27, 2017 \nConsidering Claire went from singing in YouTube videos to singing with Disney stars, “How Far I’ll Go” seems like the perfect song choice.
