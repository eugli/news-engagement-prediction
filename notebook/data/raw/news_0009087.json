Picture courtesy: Facebook/Sapna Kahol \nMeet Sapna Kahol. She is a cancer survivor. She was 34 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. \nYes, she has had her share of struggles. But it is her undaunted spirit that has shielded her against all hurdles. \nSapna sounded all happy and cheerful when we recently spoke to her over the phone. And the rendezvous indeed bears testimony to the absolute courage with which she has dealt with life. Here is what she said: \n'It was a shock for me'' \nSapna was living in Siliguri with her family when she suddenly discovered a lump in her breast one day. ''I was as active as I am today. It was a shock for me,\" she said. Later she was diagnosed with the second stage of breast cancer. This was followed by regular checkups, after which she was referred to a doctor in Kolkata. \nAlso Read: 8 possible signs of cancer that you just shouldn't ignore \nHer disease however did not impede the normalcy of her life. ''I said I am not going to sit at home. I continued with my job,'' expressed Sapna. \n''My husband was really upset. While my in-laws knew about it, I could never reveal the truth to my parents. My mother is not aware of it till date. You know how much they love you, so it's difficult,'' said Sapna, the youngest daughter of her family. Although she was cured after a period of time, health problems began to re-surface two years back. She however refused to take chemotherapy, and resorted to naturopathy instead. Picture courtesy: Facebook/Sapna Kahol \n''My positive attitude helped me a lot'' \nEven the hospital visits were done alone, claimed Sapna. ''People at the hospital said, 'You don't look like a patient!' But why should I? I have never lived like a patient!'' she excalimed. Healthy diet, yoga and her optimism have been key in overcoming the battle against death. ''I also talk to a lot of other cancer patients and the only advice I give is to remain positive in life. They later tell me about how that is really helping them,'' stressed Sapna. \nAlso Read: World Cancer Day: 6 myths surrounding one of the most deadly diseases \n''I lead a very normal life'' \nSapna has been living alone in Delhi for the past 6 years. She is working as a teacher in an army primary school, and has a very busy schedule. When asked about her interests, she said, \"I love cooking, roaming around, dancing, singing, visiting malls and making friends. I lead a healthy and normal life.'' \n''You can't change what destiny has in store for you. But why crib and cry about it all the time? With whatever you have, you should just enjoy your life. That's what I do,'' signed off this brave woman.
