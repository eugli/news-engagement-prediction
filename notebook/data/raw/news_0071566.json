My wife is Katherine and we have been married for 21 years. I know, old fashioned of us to be married so long but we are traditional like that. (Or lazy - hard to know.) \nThe kids are Superman (18), Batman (15), and Green Lantern (12). Their names aren't really those, but my youngest son Green Lantern changed the autocorrect on our devices so that when we type their names, it changes them to superhero names. His name is actually \"Green Lantern\", but when I type Green Lantern, it just comes up as \"Green Lantern\". I'll have to keep referring to him as Green Lantern in these columns; I hope that's not too confusing. Ad Feedback \nI headed back to hospital on Monday for the bone marrow biopsy. Katherine came along – I think she mainly went to stop me taking more photos of morbid things but it was nice to have her there. \nUnlike the last time, there was virtually no waiting at all. I suspect I have now gone up a tier in their membership scheme, sort of like the Koru club. When I check in now, they say hello by name and say things like \"we've been expecting you\". If only I could get valet parking, I'd be happy. Throw in a glass of Pinot Noir and I might never leave. \nThe Bone Marrow Biopsy (I've put in it caps to make it sound more ominous) was even more entertaining than my previous physical examinations. \nFirstly, the nurse (it's important you know her name was Ruby, you'll see why in a second) takes some blood from me (see! Ruby - red – blood! Told ya! No? How about \"Ruby, don't take my blood to town\"? Still no? Wow, tough crowd). \nThen I had to climb up onto the hospital bed (good to see it was a New Zealand-made Howard Wright bed, the M7, made in New Plymouth and exported around the world). \nThen my new doctor asked me to pull down my shorts a bit so she could get to my pelvis. They wanted me to curl into a tight ball in the fetal position. As she started wiping down my lower back, I immediately had two reactions – bugger, what if I need to break wind? That would be the height of rudeness, farting in the oncologist's face. I'm sure that would set me up for some painful procedures later - she'd never forgive me. \nI didn't think I needed to, but it was certainly an underlying concern through the procedure and once you think of something like that, it's hard to get it out of your head and keep it in your bum. \nMy tumour is where the big yellow one is, although it's about twice that size. Photo: Supplied \nThe other thought was: \"what undies am I wearing? I hope they're not the ones with the frayed waistband. Katherine told me I should throw those out, I should have listened to her. It's just they are so comfortable. Damn, the doctor is going to think we can't take care of ourselves, they'll send someone around to take the kids away. Why didn't I wear a new pair of undies today?\" \nMy inner narrative was much more concerned about my choice of underwear than the impending procedure. I had the feeling my priorities were wrong. So, here's my hospital Pro Tip #1 for you all – when going to hospital, wear new undies. You never know who's judging. \nSo anyway, there I am, curled up in a ball trying not to be flatulent, with guilt about my grutts, and my wife holding my hand, and the doctor tells me the plan is to shove a long needle into my hip bone. It might hurt a bit, she says, and points out I can use nitrous oxide (laughing gas). \nI staunchly say I am not sure I'll need it, but just for fun I give it a whirl before she starts. Nothing. Might as well be sucking on air. We were laughing more before I took it (we've got a habit of making ourselves laugh in situations like this, Katherine and I.) \nThe doctor starts trying to shove the needle into my bone but apparently, I have particularly hard bones (thanks Mum for making me drink all that milk as a child), so she has to have a few gos, and pushes really hard. Oh yes, that hurts a bit now, like a bad toothache. \nI give the N2O a pretty good go while trying not to cry. So now I am curled in a ball, trying not to cry or fart, worried about my undies, sucking on laughing gas and finding the whole thing simultaneously hilarious and bloody painful, when I look up and see Katherine looking a bit green. Actually quite Kermit-like. She starts to sway and looks about to faint so the doctor yells for Ruby to help her out. \nSo now the nurse and the orderly are helping Katherine in the nearby chair; they unceremoniously rip the blood pressure cuff and heart-rate monitor off me and onto Katherine and I think they were planning to give her my N2O too. \nTypical. I'm not taking her again to my procedures, she's trying to get in on the act. While they are all distracted, I'm pretty sure the doctor yells \"geddinthere!\", smacks the needle with a sodding great hammer to drive it into the bone, grabs the sample she needs and we're done before I can stop crying and laughing. The surgery is dishevelled, my wife is wasted, but it's over, with no escaped gas or comments about my Jockeys. A triumph. \nSo far I've had 5 of these. I am certainly getting my fair share of hospital consumables. Photo: Supplied \nAfter checking Katherine was OK (she was fine, the showpony - just a bit faint from seeing my choice of undergarments, I suspect), I asked the doctor why it was so difficult to get the needle into my bone and she said that hard bones tend to go with four groups; the young, the fit, Māori and Pacific Islanders. Hmm, not sure I fit into any of those groups, but I'll pretend I squeak into \"young\". Notch up another benefit of cancer so far. \nAnyway, we sit down to have a chat and one of the senior nurses pops in the door and asks us to keep the laughing down; apparently it's disturbing the other patients. Might have to get used to it, I think, I'm intending on having fun through this new experience. I let out a celebratory botty burp. I don't think anyone will mind now and I think I've earned it. \nThe conversation gets a bit more serious, though, when the doctor confirms that the growth they found is cancer. Specifically, it's a Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one of my other mates asked if we were too cheap to splash out on the proper Hodgkin's type). \nIt's going to be treatable, and the goal is recovery. Nice to hear, although I notice they are not offering any money-back guarantees. The treatment is chemotherapy, a cocktail of drugs that will kill the cancer cells, and unfortunately quite a few others, too. \nIt will take about 18 weeks – six cycles of three weeks each. So I guess the columns will go on for about that long. Stop me if it gets boring. \nOnce we had the confirmation, we had the unpleasant task of telling my parents, who understandably were pretty upset. They live remotely from us, so we couldn't see them in person, but luckily my sister could be there when we talked. One upside of the illness might be that I call my mother more often like she wants, although to be frank that is probably an unrealisable goal. No matter how often you call, mothers would prefer it more often. It's like Zeno's paradox. \nSteroids and painkillers. Breakfast of champions! Photo: Supplied \nWe also told the kids. They reacted well, they are pretty cool kids, although of course it was a shock. Never one to miss the opportunity, I did what all good parents would do, and tried to turn the situation to our advantage. I told the kids that mum would need a lot more help around the house and maybe they could start by clearing the dinner dishes. Brilliant, it worked well. I even got Batman to mow the lawns. \nI reckon we can get a good 2 to 3 days' worth of this before, like all parents' tricks, they get immune to it and we'll need to come up with something else. Not sure I can top cancer though. \nSo anyway, now I am in the limbo period between knowing what will happen, and waiting for it to start. It's like standing by the pool, knowing it's going to be cold, and not quite being ready to get in. Normally I just do a bomb and get it over with, but that's something I'm not in control of at the moment. Plus, I've only got my frayed undies on. \nWith the help of my amazing team and boss at work, I have decoupled from work life for the duration of the treatment, but I'm not used to sitting around doing nothing. Thank God for one-day cricket. I also started on some drugs today so maybe I will get out of it on hallucinations (wow look, the Kiwi opening batsmen got decent scores). \nThey are steroids, apparently quite a high dose, according to the chemist, so there goes my Olympic dream. I'm quite excited to see what they'll do to me though. I imagine it will be like Popeye, where suddenly I'll get muscles bursting out of my sleeves. \nYou know things are bad when you watch cricket because you are already bored. Photo: Supplied \nThanks for all the positive comments on the first column. I'm glad you are taking delight in my misery, you weird lot. Katherine has banned me from talking about how pretty the doctors are now, so that's another thing I am no longer in control of. Will report back next week when I should have had some chemotherapy and start getting proper sick. \nSomething for us all to look forward to in my journey with a mild touch of the cancer. \nDavid Downs has been, at various times, an author, radio and TV actor, comedian and public speaker.
