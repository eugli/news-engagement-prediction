'They say “can you please do another recording? I know this book inside out – we play it in the car, at home, when they go to bed”, and it’s a really positive outcome,' she said. For many fathers, it gives them a chance to bond with a child they may not have even met. 'We’ve had young dads in here who have had babies while they’ve been incarcerated,' she explained. 'Unfortunately, the babies don’t get to bond much with Dad because of the situation. Listen out! For some young fathers, recording a story helps their young child familiarise themselves with their dad's voice, and makes talking over the phone a better experience 'So when Dad rings up home, Mum will put the phone next to the baby, and the child doesn’t recognise the voice. 'But with Storybook Dads, the children learn the sound of their dad’s voice – so when he rings up, they’re eager to talk on the telephone to dad, because they know who it is.' Ms Toovey recalled one inmate in particular who came and told her the program had made such a difference to his relationship with his infant child. 'He came and told me \"my baby didn't know me, didn't know my voice, but now he talks to me on the phone, he recognises my voice\" and I just thought, how powerful is that?,' she said. New skills: Three inmates at Acacia currently edit the recordings, by altering the father's voice for different characters, adding sound effects and cutting out any extra voices One inmate, who went by the name Ambrose, referred to Storybook Dads as 'the best program in Acacia'. 'To be able to give my two boys a book, especially read by me with the sound effects, was truly terrific,' he said. Heath Chapple, managing director of justice and immigration for Serco, who own both Acacia Prison and the Wandoo Reintegration Facility, said the program has been a huge success. 'We know through experience and significant research that connection to family, both while in prison and on release, is a key factor to reduce reoffending,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Storybook Dads maintains this link. Importantly, it also bridges other programs that enhance successful rehabilitation such as education through reading and writing, and social skills like anger management and engagement' Back and forth: Fathers who have low literacy skills are also benefiting educationally from the program, as a worker will help them to read the story through a parroting system Mr Chapple says the focus on rehabilitation and reintegration has allowed the company to 'achieve a recidivism rate at Wandoo that is half the national average for adults and the best in Australia'. 'Recidivism is not measured specifically at Acacia, but anecdotally we know men who engage with programs like Storybook Dads are better placed to engage with family and society on release,' he said. The program is only available for inmates who have remained charge free while inside prison for three months, and those who have not been charged with child sex offences or issued a violence restraining order. Remaining inmates record their stories with Ms Toovey. The resettlement manager says she will spend at least one day a week recording stories back to back. If the father struggles with reading, Ms Toovey will read the book and he will parrot it back to her. In the editing process, she will be edited out so only his voice is audible. Proven success: Serco, who run the prison, say the program builds connection within the inmates family, which has been proved to reduce the rate of reoffending Inmates are invited to write their own stories for their kids, and often change the names of characters in the available books to the name of their child. If they like, they can purchase the book they have read for between $1 - $25 - depending on if it is an ex-library book or a brand new book - so they can attach it to the CD and their child can read along. The discs and books are then put into the inmates property and he can post it home or sign it out when his child comes to visit. Ms Toovey says the range of men reading stories for their children is astounding. 'I've had big burly bikies singing nursery rhymes and guys who can't read very well telling these beautiful stories for their kids,' she gushed of the progress she had seen in inmates. Within Acacia prison, three inmates have been assigned jobs editing the recordings, giving them skills to enter the workforce upon their release. 'It's a great skill to leave with,' Ms Toovey explained, adding: 'they all love it, they think [the recordings] are so funny'.
