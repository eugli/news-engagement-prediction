It was also one of the first diesel cars to appear in India and one of the first to have air conditioning.\nBut its downfall was as spectacular as its rise - dropping from sales of more than 20,000 cars in the mid-1980s to about 2,000 in 2013-14 when production was suspended.\nRead more:\nWhy makers of iconic Ambassador car have lost faith in India Production of India's Ambassador car suspended A tribute to India's iconic car (video) The car was also renowned for its idiosyncrasies.\nThe handbrake rarely worked properly - instead spawning a generation of drivers that could easily do hill starts deftly balancing the accelerator and brake.\nThe indicator controls were often mounted in unusual positions, its brakes were notoriously soft and its steering lock was virtually non-existent.\nAmbassador taxis are still commonplace in Indian cities More and more Ambassadors are now off the roads and seen as relics of yesteryear", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-2756378", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0C2D/production/_94271130_gettyimages-450257118.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36044903", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-28947720", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F183/production/_94272816_ambassador2.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A74B/production/_94272824_f54badd8-251c-4223-9183-f9ef2c2f0e9f.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0B0B/production/_94272820_ambassaor3.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-12T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:45:03.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
