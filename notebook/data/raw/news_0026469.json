Sunny Ade was nominated, Femi Kuti was nominated too. Now Wizkid has gotten a nomination for his work. Unlike Femi Kuti and King Sunny Ade, Wizkid’s nomination was not for a sound recording he did for himself, or his personal album. He was given the nod for his contribution to Drake’s “Views” album, which was one of the biggest albums of last year. ‘One Dance’, a single he co-wrote, co-produced, and sang on, was streamed over 1 billion times on Spotify, and spent 10 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. play He also, got himself signed on to a deal with Sony Music and their subsidiary, RCA Records. A huge investment of cash and resources was placed on his career too. Wizkid is arguably solely responsible for the increased spotlight that Nigerian music now enjoys from international music. His work with Drake, and the penetration of his music across the continent and beyond has helped shine more light on the music coming in from Africa. That’s why the Grammy nomination feels like a deserved feat. Wizkid has worked hard for it and has earned it in many possible way. The event which would hold on Sunday, February 12, 2017, at the LA Staples Center, will attract the biggest artistes from all over the world. They would be celebrating the best songs on the continent, and rewarding everyone who stood out spectacularly in the year in review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:10:20.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
