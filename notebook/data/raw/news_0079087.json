Earlier this month, news surfaced that Bobby Shmurda accepted a plea deal that would extend his prison sentence one to four years, following last year’s incident where his girlfriend, Kimberly Rousseau, tried sneaking in a shank for Shmurda but was obviously caught. So while it’s unknown at the moment when Bobby will be a free man again, it appears he's been keeping his spirits high during his incarceration. Today, Bobby made a phone call with MMG rapper Meek Mill & Trav, and gave them an update on his situation. Bobby said “he’s getting big, and writing every day,” before ending the conversation with a little freestyle over the phone, which you can check out for yourself (below ). We'll continue to keep you posted on any further updates with Bobby moving forward.
