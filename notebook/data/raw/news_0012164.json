While injury problems prevented him from becoming a long-term member of the Indian team, he did have his moments of fame. \nAFP \nOne such moment came in the 2003 World Cup against England. Both teams were gunning for a Super Six spot and the winner would earn a place while the loser would be on the verge of elimination. \nSet 251 to win, England were comfortably placed at 52/2 when Nehra worked his magic. \nNasser Hussain and Alec Stewart were dismissed off consecutive balls and all of the sudden the middle order was exposed. \nAFP \nPace, swing and length did the batsmen in as one by one they succumbed to the left-armer. \nFrom 52/2, England were left reeling at 107/8. All six went to Nehra and he finished with figures of 6/23, the best bowling figures by an Indian in World Cup cricket. \nIndia went on to win the game by 82 runs and Nehra was the toast of the team. \nSuch instances were sadly not on a consistent basis for the southpaw, but when they did come, Team India reaped the benefits.
