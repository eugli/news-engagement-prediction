Fathers on television tend to be at polar ends of a scale--either extraordinary fathers or clueless dads. This list of famous television fathers tends to reflect our society's favorites. Silver Screen Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images 1. Andy Taylor from The Andy Griffith Show \nAndy Griffith played Sheriff Andy Taylor, in the Andy Griffith Show in the 1960's. He was a totally committed single father who lived with and raised his son Opie and with their Aunt Bea. He was a doting father, but still held Opie to a high standard of morality and proper behavior. And he courted Opie's ​school teacher Helen Crump. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Packable School Lunches All Kids Love Courtesy of TV Land 2. Heathcliff Huxtable from The Cosby Show \nAs the patriarch of the Cosby clan, Cliff Huxtable was the consummate father of his generation. A busy obstetrician with an office downstairs at his home, Cliff had time to wise crack and spout wisdom with the children we watched grow up over eight seasons in the 1908's. His love of jazz music and great art, his colorful sweaters and his clever repartee inspired many fathers and families. Hulton Images / Getty Images 3. Mike Brady from the Brady Bunch \nArchitect Mike Brady, played by Robert Reed, headed up his blended family on The Brady Bunch . Famous for his morality talks with the kids and a sometimes exasperated look at the antics of six busy kids, Mike Brady was beloved by a generation. Getty Images Entertainment 4. Ray Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond \nRay Barone, the lovable father on Everybody Loves Raymond , is a sportswriter, husband to Debra and father to sons Michael and Geoffrey and his daughter Ally. Ray is the typical conflict-avoidance father unless it comes to his own parents who live across the street and seem to invade very important family moment. As the title of the TV show implies, Ray wants to be loved by everyone in his circle. He and Debra have some tense moments, and she sees him as somewhat clueless, bur Ray Romano is a favorite dad for many. Courtesy of Pricegrabber 5. Howard Cunningham from Happy Days \nPlayed by well-recognized actor Tom Bosley, this TV father owned and operated a hardware store. Howard Cunningham alwys seemed to have time to be a part of his kids' lives and regularly offered solid fatherly wisdom to his chldren and their sometimes unique frieds like Ralphie, Potsie, Fonzie and Chachie. Howard and Marion's home was always open to any kids who happened to show up. Getty Images 6. Charles Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie \nMichael Landon was best known as Little Joe Cartright from Bonanza fame when he took on the role of Charles Ingalls in Little House on the Prairie . Charles was the archetypal pioneer and farmer father raising three daughters on the frontier. He was full of homespun wisdom and was the pillar of their small farming community. Getty Images 7. Homer Simpson of The Simpsons \nHomer Simpson is the father every father hopes not to emulate. With no particular interest in anything in life except the occasional beer and the not-so-occasional donut, Homer is a dysfunctional father at it's best. Abusive and disconnected with his family, Homer is admittedly funny but truly a sad example of a father in today's world. Courtesy of Warner Bros. 8. Danny Tanner of Full House \nDanny Tanner was played by Bob Saget who later hosted shows such as America's Funniest Home Videos and was an extraordinarily funny stand-up comedian. In ​ Full House , he was a young widower raising four daughters including the Olsen twins (Mary Kate and Ashely) as the baby of the house. Known as a bit overprotective and as a neatness nut, Danny Tanner was lovable and the dad many teenage girls wished they had. Getty Images 9. Tim Taylor of Home Improvement \nThe host of Tool Time on this show, Tim Taylor is the consummate \"man's man.\" He is accident prone, does not know everything about a home workshop, and often feels that a bigger tool will do the job when a smaller tool will not, right or wrong. As a father, Tim is quite unfocused, and his wife Jill totally runs the family, and is the perfect comic foil for Tim. This is a home with love and respect underlying the comedy and silly situations. Home Improvemen t ran on television from 1991-1999, and can be seen today on TVLand. Getty Images 10. Phil Dunphy of The Modern Familiy One of the most committed dads on television in the last few years, Phil Dunphy (played by Ty Burrell) is a consummate family man. Married to Claire and father of three, Phil tries hard to bond with the kids and be a \"together father\" for the family. He certainly has his moments of cluelessness, and he is maybe a little too attached to his father's new trophy wife, but he works hard at being a good husband and father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:43:32.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
