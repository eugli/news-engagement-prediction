Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch meets with Sen. Bob Corker on Thursday, Feb. 2. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \nDonald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, currently a federal appeals court judge, told Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a courtesy meeting on Wednesday afternoon that he found President Trump’s tweets attacking a “so-called judge” who ruled against him “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” A spokesman for Gorsuch subsequently confirmed that the judge did indeed use those words to characterize the president’s assault on the judicial branch. \nBecause we know the president is not about to let the slightest slight go unanswered, we must assume that at this very moment he is shambling around the White House in a bathrobe, fumbling for doorknobs and attempting to craft the perfect response. Advertisement \nHere are a few attempts to channel Trump’s certain-to-be-upcoming Twitter reply: \nMagnanimous Trump: \nNo reason to be disheartened. I have the biggest heart. The best heart. You’ll see.I respect my judge Neil's right to Freedom of speech! How many terrorists streamed in while failing news obsessed over cmmts \nGorsuch is WRONG on “demoralizing” judge comments but will #MAGA. Easy D! Advertisement \nEnraged Trump: \nAny negative judges are FAKE JUDGES. Gorsuch is just like Robart and Curiel. Radical judicial activists! \nSo-called “judge” Neil Gorsuch weak on national security! I made him famous, this is how he repays. Sad! \nThank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #FuckGorsuch Advertisement \nEmoluments Trump: \nMy judge Gorsuch has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. He is a great person -- always pushing me to appear normal! Terrible! \nAlternate Narrative Trump: \nThe lying media has made FAKE NEWS about my judge Neil Gorsuch—like a dog! Advertisement \nAlt Right Trump: \nFake Judge Neil Gorsuch is clearly as mentally unstable as RBG. Both should go to New Zealand . Sad! \n“@WhiteGenocideTM: @realDonaldTrump Not sure about that Gorsuch guy” \nHostile judge Gorsuch, a hater of Donald J. Trump, is ENGLISH. Cannot be impartial. Must recuse! Advertisement \nDouble Down Trump: \nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \nConspiracy Theory Trump: \nI won popular vote in landslide. Now Gorsuch is being paid by George Soros to call me “disheartening.” Terrible! \nAn ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Judge Gorsuch’s birth certificate is a fraud \nDid Crooked Hillary help disgusting Gorsuch (check out sex tape) become a U.S. citizen so she could put him on the federal bench? \nLoser Neil Gorsuch is “demoralized” by my tweets. Sad! I am President of the United States and he isn't. And his mom killed JFK. \nConfused Bathrobe Trump: \nEveryone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Gorsuch. \nSupreme Court seat still open. Delay, delay, delay. \nDahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate , and hosts the podcast Amicus . \nMark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate . He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.
