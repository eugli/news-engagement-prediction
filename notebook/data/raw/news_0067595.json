[Photo/Agencies] \nRIO DE JANEIRO - Brazilian Foreign Minister Jose Serra resigned over health problems on Wednesday. \nIn the resignation letter he presented to President Michel Temer, Serra cited health issues as his reason for departure. His actual health condition was not detailed. He underwent a back surgery in late 2016. \nSerra spent only 11 months in the position after he took over the ministry in May 2016, when Temer became interim president following the impeachment of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff. \nIn order to take over the foreign ministry, Serra had to leave the Senate, where he was serving his third term that would last until 2022. \nHe is expected to return to the Senate to continue his representation for Sao Paulo state, where he spent almost his entire political career.
