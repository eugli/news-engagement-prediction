Another lashed out at the “Shallow-Thinking, Uneducated ‘Mouthy’ Conspirator.” There’s another Kevin McCarthy in Iowa, a Hillary Clinton supporter, who also received a bevy of misdirected messages during the presidential campaign. He posted a slick video requesting people to “stop with your tweeting.” “It was really funny at first,” Mr. McCarthy says in the video about the barrage of Twitter messages. “And then they just kept going, and going and going.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • A Whittier police officer was killed during a routine traffic stop. “He was the best of the best,” the city’s police chief said.

Photo Credit Stilson Snow Buried in the mud flats of Humboldt Bay are a feast of clams waiting to be pulled loose. And twice daily, at low tide, clammers carrying shovels show up to collect. Stilson Snow , of Eureka, shared a photo of two of them working off the bay community of King Salmon a number of winters ago. Humboldt Bay is a productive habitat for clams, among them steamers, horsenecks and Martha Washingtons, that thrive in its muddy sand and nutrient-rich water. Recreational clamming is allowed year round. The hunters find where the clams are buried by spotting telltale holes in the mud, then plunging in with fists or shovels to pull them out. Lately, however, public health concerns have put a damper on the hobby. State officials have issued warnings about elevated levels of toxins in clams and other shellfish. Casey Allen , a longtime clam digger, said that with farm-raised clams available in the market the warnings were enough for him to take a pause. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:20:28.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
