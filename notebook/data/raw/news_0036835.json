He can go wherever he wants, but the truth is on our side and I'm sure that truth will win,\" he said. \nPanneerselvam visited Jayalalithaa`s memorial on Thursday night and spent some time there with his supporters. \nHe asserted that the people were against the new government. \"Until this government is removed, we will not sleep or rest. The people don`t want this government,\" he said. \nEdappadi K. Palaniswamy on Thursday today took the oath as Tamil Nadu`s 29th Chief Minister. \nAlso Read: New Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami - All you need to know \nA total of 31 other All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MLAs were also sworn in. \nEarlier, Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao requested the Chief Minister to seek the vote of confidence in the assembly within 15 days. \nThe decision to this effect was conveyed to Palaniswamy during his meeting with the Governor at Raj Bhavan earlier along with party presidium chairman KA Sengottaiyan and senior ministers Dindigul C Sreenivasan and P Thangamani. \nThe Governor heard competing pitches on Wednesday night from within the ruling party of the state over who should be the chief minister after the conviction of AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala in connection with a 19-year old disproportionate assets case. \nWith ANI inputs First Published: Friday, February 17, 2017 - 09:16 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:11:55.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
