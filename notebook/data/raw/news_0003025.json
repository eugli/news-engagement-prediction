We're looking forward to the big reveal, but at the same time, October is still many months away. Based on what we've seen so far , though, we expect the upcoming Supra will look a lot like the unofficial renderings you see here.\nDreamed up by the SupraMKV forum using spy shots of camouflaged test vehicles (and reprinted here with permission from the creators), these fan-generated renderings have a lot in common with Toyota's FT-1 Concept . We also see a little bit of Toyota 86 in there, too.\n© SupraMKV.com Compared to the spy shots below, the renders look pretty darn accurate. Some of the details will doubtless end up a looking different, but we think the overall proportions of these sketches are likely to be accurate, at least in a general sense.\n© SupraMKV.com Of course, there are plenty of other questions we still have. We've heard rumors that there will be a hybrid version , but will Toyota offer a non-hybrid Supra as well? And how will it drive? Will it be significantly different from the BMW version, likely to be dubbed the Z5? Will it live up to the legendary Supra name?\n© SupraMKV.com Hopefully, Toyota will answer those questions for us this October.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook & Twitter\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MSNAutos", "http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/videos/a31445/new-toyota-spotted-testing-on-the-nurburgring-once-again/", "http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/detroit-auto-show/news/a6682/toyota-ft1-concept/", "http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/news/a31157/toyota-supra-hybrid/", "https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos", "http://www.roadandtrack.com/", "http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/news/a32444/toyota-will-reveal-a-supra-conceptplus-two-other-sports-carsin-october/", "http://www.supramkv.com/threads/our-new-supra-renderings.574/"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:32:37.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
