Roaming musicians ply tourists for tips against a backdrop of restored art nouveau buildings. Across town, the thump of techno beats keeps the young and well-heeled dancing until dawn. \nIt’s not Barcelona or even Berlin. It’s Belgrade , baby. \nThe city is still dirt cheap for visitors, but its chic future is arriving fast. In some ways it’s like Budapest was with its ruin bars 10 years ago, or Prague in the ’90s — gritty, full of life and undiscovered by Americans — but with an added dash of style that neither of those hot spots had until they were already overrun with tourists. \nNow might be the time for this offbeat destination. Construction has begun on a 10 million-square-foot development that promises to transform a brownfield right in the city’s core. Here’s a quick guide to a city on the verge. \nGO AHEAD AND SPLURGE \nFirst things first: Belgrade will never be in the running for Europe’s most beautiful city, partly because the former capital of Yugoslavia has been destroyed and rebuilt so many times in the past 2,000 years. \nExpect to see brutalist Soviet-era buildings and government buildings that were damaged in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign and never repaired. \nDespite the eyesores and neglect, elegant 19th century architecture also exists, especially around the main pedestrian promenade, Knez Mihailova Street. \nWhat the city lacks in European charm, however, it makes up for in affordable luxury. The best massage of my life cost US$25 with tip for an hour. One of my favourite meals in three months of travelling around Europe — including duck paté with a bright smear of quince paste on the plate, aperitifs and a bottle of wine – was $45 for two people. \nPlenty of familiar hotel brands are bargains here, but why bother when a one-bedroom Airbnb goes for US$27 a night? The apartment I snagged for five days was in the trendy Skadarlija neighbourhood, a centrally located bohemian hangout with an artsy vibe, galleries, smoky kafane (taverns) and traditional restaurants serving rakija, a fruit brandy of varying flavours that’s potent enough to double as paint thinner. \nMUST-DO’S \nFor a leafy respite from the grey city, head to Kalemegdan Citadel, a fortress that doubles as the city’s biggest park. Ancient Celtic tribesmen laid the first stones of the foundation, and its perch atop a ridge at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers was so prized that it was overtaken and built upon by a succession of marauders. Much of that history is on display in the citadel’s Military Museum, which has about 3,000 items in its collection ranging from Roman swords and Serbian suits of armour to the wreckage of a U.S. stealth bomber shot down in 1999. \nThe fortress, which is free to enter, offers a range of other activities, including archery, tennis and basketball, as well as a fairly cheesy exhibit with animatronic dinosaurs. Or do what the locals do, and grab a six-pack and sit at the edge of the ramparts for the best views in the city. \nFor a glimpse into the life of a favourite Serbian son, visit the small, but mighty, Nikola Tesla Museum . English-speaking guides will demonstrate the scientist’s most wellknown achievements, including the Tesla coil, which can wirelessly light fluorescent bulbs from across the room. Guides also mention lesser-known failures, such as Tesla’s plan for an industrial-sized transmitter on a former Long Island potato farm that would have beamed power to New York. Tesla electric cars were named in his honour. Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:49:25.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
