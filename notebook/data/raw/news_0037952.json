Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA policeman believes he may have a poltergeist living in his laundry room - as spooky footage shows him run in terror when a detergent bottle moves on its own. \nTerrified trainee cop Jonny Edwards was home alone when he took a Snapchat video as he went to investigate an unexpected noise coming from the utility room and was greeted with the eerie movement . \nThe 29-year-old let out an almighty yelp as the untouched bottle slid sharply from left to right despite the washing machine being switched off and no-one else being present. \nAnd, shortly afterwards, Jonny claims a canvas and a picture frame fell off the wall in two separate unexplained incidents. Jonny heard a noise coming from his laundry room and decided to investigate (Photo: Mercury Press) \nJonny, from Brisbane, Australia, said: \"I'm convinced this house is haunted. There's no other explanation. \n\"We always switch the washing machine off when we're finished - every time - so I knew there was something weird going on. \n\"We've got a Labrador-dachshund cross called Ahlo who used to sleep in the laundry room and since this she's been petrified and won't go near it. There's something up. The bottle moves across the machine of its own accord (Photo: Mercury Press) \n\"I was watching television and the washing machine started making a noise. I thought: 'That's bizarre' because we turned if off after using it the previous day. \n\"I took a video to send to my partner and after I saw what had happened I rang my cousin straight away. \n\"It was crazy. After that bottle moved... that was it for me. I'll never look at that room the same way. Jonny sprinted from the room in terror (Photo: Mercury Press) \n\"A canvas came off the wall behind me as well. I have no idea what happened. I never used to believe in poltergeists and that kind of thing, but this has completely thrown me.\" \nJonny then claims that shortly after the washing machine incident, which happened last month, another freak turn of events sent shivers down his spine. Jonny and his partner believe there could be a poltergeist in their home (Photo: Mercury Press) \nAfter he and his partner went out to a service station to buy cigarettes, they returned to find a picture frame had fallen off a wall and landed a metre-and-a-half away by the door. \nJonny said: \"These two things have really opened my eyes. We've lived here for a year and there's been all sorts of weird happenings. \n\"The bathroom door has unlocked itself a couple of times but I put that down to me not shutting it properly. \n\"The washing machine thing was frightening. It was around 8pm. I was home alone. After I checked that the machine was definitely off, I couldn't go back in there. Jonny has experience other strange incident during his year living in the house (Photo: Mercury Press) \n\"I was s*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:53:51.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
