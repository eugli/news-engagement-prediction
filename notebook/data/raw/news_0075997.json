Back in 1964, the Academy made a similar mistake in the best-score category—but handled matters in a completely different manner. Let’s take a quick look back at Hollywood history, shall we? At the 1964 Oscars, Sammy Davis Jr. was tasked with presenting the award for best music score. Unlike today’s ceremonies, in which presenters walk out holding the envelope that contains the winner’s name— in theory, anyway —Davis was handed the winning envelope by an offstage handler right after announcing all the nominees. After tearing it open and reading the winner—John Addison for Tom Jones —he quickly returned to the mic to announce that he had been given the wrong envelope entirely. “Wait til the N.A.A.C.P. hears about this!” Davis quipped. Despite the embarrassing mistake, the Academy handled the blunder with unbelievable swiftness, immediately correcting it and giving Davis the correct envelope before the wrong winners could take the stage—something that can’t be said of Sunday night’s ceremony. After incorrectly being given an envelope revealing best actress, rather than best picture, presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty accidentally announced La La Land as the night’s big winner. Beatty seemed confused when he initially read the card, but turned it over to Dunaway—who seemed to spy La La Land printed next to Stone’s name, and assume the film had won best picture. What was even more shocking than the initial blunder was the fact that the cast and crew of La La Land were able to take the stage, and two producers were able to give acceptance speeches—all before an Oscars producer and host Jimmy Kimmel appeared to explain the mistake. Ultimately, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz took control of the situation, announcing that Moonlight was actually the night’s big winner. It was a shocking moment that surprised an A-list audience and viewers all over the world—especially Moonlight director Barry Jenkins , who delivered a stunned acceptance speech after the surprise change. “To hell with dreams: this is real,” he exclaimed.
