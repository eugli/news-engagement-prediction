Provided by Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana If you're looking to travel to the best city for pizza, you won't have to travel far if you live in Phoenix. That's because, according to Travel & Leisure , the Valley is the top spot for pizza in the country. A margherita pizza from Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana. Provided by Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana \"In Phoenix, locals and visitors can enjoy classic thin crust joints and James Beard award-winning margheritas, or order gourmet Neapolitan, wood-fired pies, traditional deep-dishes and yes, even drive-through pizza by the slice,\" reads Travel & Leisure's story about its top cities list. \"This Southwestern city even has an annual pizza festival .\" The travel publication polled readers to determine the top cities for pizza and Phoenix beat out such pizza heavyweights as Chicago and New York, and other pizza paradises such as Detroit and Indianapolis. T&L cite Pizzeria Bianco — as so many others do — as the catalyst for Phoenix's rise to the top of the pizza pile, and also name-drops popular joints including Oregano's and Spinato's. Phoenix certainly seems a pizza paradise when you stop to think about it. In addition to the quality pies you can grab at Oregano's, Bianco's and Spinato's, the Valley also is home to chains and concepts including NYPD Pizza, Barro's, La Piazza Al Forno, Pomo and many more. In recent years, Phoenix has seen an influx of the fast-growing build-your-own pizza concepts including homegrown Fired Pie and Blaze Pizza. In T&L's ranking, Phoenix beat out Detroit (No. 2), Buffalo, New York (No. 3) and Chicago (No. 4).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:45:39.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
