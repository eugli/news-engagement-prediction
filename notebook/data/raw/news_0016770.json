He even kept up the relationship after his supervisors, who were growing suspicious, told him to break it off. In 1981, Mr. Vasilenko was transferred back to Moscow, and the two men lost contact with each other. But Mr. Vasilenko resurfaced when he was assigned to Guyana, and Mr. Platt visited him there in the fall of 1987. Mr. Platt retired from the C.I.A. that year but stayed on as a contractor into 1988, specifically to keep trying to lure Mr. Vasilenko into espionage. \nAdvertisement   But then Mr. Vasilenko vanished after flying to Cuba from Guyana in January 1988. On his arrival he was arrested by K.G.B. operatives and interrogated about his relationship with Mr. Platt. Mr. Ames, who had begun spying for the Soviets in 1985, almost certainly gave Moscow C.I.A. files that contained Mr. Plattâ€™s reports on his contacts with Mr. Vasilenko. Fortunately for Mr. Vasilenko, Mr. Platt, in his reports to his superiors, had never exaggerated their relationship by claiming to have recruited Mr. Vasilenko to spy for the United States. The reports showed only that Mr. Vasilenko had held unauthorized meetings with Mr. Platt. The K.G.B. held Mr. Vasilenko for six months. Without evidence that he had spied for the Americans, the Russians released him and forced him out of the K.G.B. Mr. Platt did not find out that Mr. Vasilenko was still alive until August 1991. They reconnected and eventually went into international business together. In 2005, however, Mr. Vasilenko was once again arrested by the Russian authorities, this time on weapons charges. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Vasilenko said he believed the real reason for that arrest was that he had helped a former K.G.B. colleague get a visa to the United States, without realizing that the former colleague had provided information to the United States that helped unmask the former F.B.I. agent Robert Hanssen as a spy for Moscow. In 2010, Mr. Vasilenko was released to the United States as part of a spy trade in which four Russians who had been seized by the Soviet authorities were exchanged for 10 Russian sleeper agents who had been arrested by the United States. John Cheney Platt III was born on Feb. 18, 1936, in San Antonio. He graduated from Williams College before serving four years as a Marine officer. In addition to his wife, the former Paige Gordon, he is survived by three daughters, Leigh, Michelle and Diana Platt, and one grandchild.
