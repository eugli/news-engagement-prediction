Photo: Oppo \nChina's Oppo has a teaser ahead of this year's Mobile World Congress: The company plans to wow the world with a new smartphone camera technology called \"5X.\" \nThere aren't many details in the press release we've gotten, and an actual device isn't even mentioned, but there's a lot of vague superlatives that describe it. \nApparently, the new tech is \"the result of an extensive, year-long R&D process\" and it will \"give users unprecedented ability to capture highly detailed images.\" Furthermore, company VP Sky Li said this \"breakthrough ... will change how the world perceives smartphone photography.\" \nIt's perhaps not just mere buzzwords - Oppo is the top smartphone brand in China and fourth in the world, and the company has innovated in the area of smartphone photography before; for example, in 2016 it launched a phone with a 16-megapixel selfie camera. \nOppo has an event scheduled for Feb. 27 as part of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which officially kicks off on that day, and Mashable will be there to cover the news. \nRead the full article here . \nMashable is the go-to source for tech, digital culture, and entertainment content for its dedicated and influential audience around the world.
