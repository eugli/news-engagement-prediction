Despite a rare, all-night protest by Senate Democrats on Monday night that carried into Tuesday morning, DeVos was confirmed by Senate in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a historic, tie-breaking ballot.\nDeVos, a wealthy GOP donor, has been widely criticized for weeks for her multiple conflicts of interest and her apparent lack knowledge of basic education policy.\nAs DeVos was confirmed on Tuesday, hundreds of New York City high school and college students walked out of class and gathered in Manhattan’s Foley Square in protest of Trump and his executive order temporarily banning refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. According to Gothamist , the protesters also booed DeVos’ coinciding confirmation after one student speaker shouted, “Betsy DeVos was confirmed today despite her shameful inexperience and complete lack of understanding for the very job she seeks.”\nOthers took to social media to speak out against DeVos’ confirmation.\nTo all who are angry or frustrated about today's vote confirming DeVos, please know: the vote may be over, but our fight must continue. pic.twitter.com/QHFveiRv9d\n— Sen.
