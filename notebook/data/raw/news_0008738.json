Saffron Curtiss-McGinty used the elaborate ploy in an attempt to hide stolen goods at a B&M Bargains store in Solihull, West Midlands, under a child's buggy. But the 18-year-old lacked a baby to justify the pram, and security guards were not fooled. A police chief who saw the funny side said she would not win any awards for her artwork, and described it as 'abstract'. The 'abstract' get-up was designed to fool security guards into thinking she was wheeling a baby around After being stopped, she slapped a store manager in the face. The soft toy was dressed in a baby grow and scratch mitts, with a crude face scrawled on half a bra. She was stopped at the store's exit on January 27, and staff found scented candles, sweets and an electric toothbrush hidden in the buggy. She was arrested and charged with theft and assault. Curtiss-McGinty, of Highgate, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to assault by beating and two counts of shoplifting, having been identified on CCTV stealing from the same store on the previous day. In reality it was a soft toy dog with half a bra over its face. Security guards were not fooled RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T15:36:02.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
