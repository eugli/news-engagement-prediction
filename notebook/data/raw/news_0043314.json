Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj \n— Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017 \n\nAccording to reports, during his “campaign rally” in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday, Trump pointed to European countries like Sweden and Germany as reason why America needs to place heavy restrictions on immigration from the Middle East.\n“We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” Trump told supporters.\n“Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible,” he explained. “You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.”\nTrump, discussing terror, seamlessly mentions incident \"last night in Sweden\".\nThere was NO \"incident\" in Sweden last night. pic.twitter.com/XtcC4PRiNU \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 19, 2017 \n\nHowever, as most news outlets were quick to point out, there was no terror attack or notable incident in Sweden recently dealing with terrorists or refugees from Middle Eastern countries.\n“Trump cites non-existent terror attack,” wrote the Guardian .\n“Donald Trump Appears To Make Up Sweden Terror Attack,” said Huffington Post .\n“Donald Trump appears to invent Sweden terror attack during Florida rally speech,” said UK-based The Independent .\n“Trump appears to invent Sweden terror incident,” wrote Reuters .\nLiberal magazine Slate, on the other hand, alleged that Trump made up the attack because he possibly watched a recent segment on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show.\nBildt served as prime minister of Sweden from 1991-1994.
