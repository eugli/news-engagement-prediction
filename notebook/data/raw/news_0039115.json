In this business consistency is important. That is the reason why Uber has not been very successful in many parts of the world,” said Vij. He is right – Uber is facing similar criticism in London and other part of Europe. \nThis is also a time for the other taxi providers to capitalise on the strike. In the case of Easycabs, it is targeting the office-goers, a segment which Uber and Ola was chipping away. “We have developed a mobile app, and the bill goes straightaway into your email, or to the office travel desk,” said Vij. \nVij is not the only one. Meru Cabs, is looking at educating drivers about driving cycles. \n“It is important to handhold the driver, through the cycles of high and low income… That is what Meru still does. The income is stable… Meru doesn’t force the driver to drive long hours to earn,” said Siddhartha Pahwa, who was the company’s CEO until December 31. \nMeru is also pushing advance booking, and business predictability. “That is why more than 80% of the drivers continue with Meru,” he said. \nHowever, Pahwa, a veteran in the industry said that Uber and Ola incentive pricing is not good for the industry. “As the income fall many drivers would leave the industry, and that would be detrimental for the growth in economy,” he said.

If one of them is missing the eco-system fails,” said Vivek Kejriwal, co-founder and CEO, Oneway.cab, an inter-city taxi company. \nIt is upon the cab company, Kejriwal said, to ensure that the drivers should get a minimum threshold of payment at the end of the day. \n“The objective should be that more and more drivers come on board… This (strike) has created a negative impact. There is a lot of service disruption caused,” said Kejriwal. \nMeanwhile, Jugnoo, which is an auto rickshaw aggregator, has launched its cab service. “We analysed the issues faced by taxi drivers of late and have come up with a strategy to provide taxi services at prices where drivers do not work at artificially lower rates than their costs,” co-founder and chief operating officer Chinmay Agarwal said in a statement. \n( Inputs from Livemint ) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:12.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
