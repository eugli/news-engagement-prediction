Victims 'lost hope' \nAnother victim, known as \"Q\", told the court Spillane's abuse had caused him pain, loss and suffering, and affected his relationship with his children. \n\"I have to explain why dad just walks out of the house sometimes ... why I am sometimes distant,\" he said. \nQ told the court that over the nearly 10 years since charges were first brought against Brian Spillane, he had never shown \"an ounce of remorse.\" \n\"I have lost the choice to get up every day and face the day with optimism and hope,\" he said. \n\"I have lost my faith in people, the church and the legal system,\" he said. \nVictim \"O\" told the court he had over 200 jobs and struggled to deal with people in positions of authority because of the abuse. \n\"I have not been able to have a long-term loving relationship,\" he said. \nSpillane will be sentenced on these 18 charges at a later date. \nHe is already serving at least 11 years in jail on previous convictions.
