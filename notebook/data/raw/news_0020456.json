(Photo: Kelechi Osemele, Twitter) \nRaiders teammates Derek Carr, Kelechi Osemele and Latavius Murray got into a hilarious Twitter war on Tuesday night. It started with Odemele comparing Carr to the character Sid from Toy Story . \nHere's a great description of Sid from the Disney Wiki page : \nSid is a young, bratty and somewhat disturbed 11-year-old skate punk with metal braces, whose idea of fun is terrorizing his little sister, Hannah, by taking her toys away and using them for scary experiments like switching out heads or performing operations on them. He also destroys toys in many ways (exploding, burning, or in his \"mad doctor\" plays). Though despite this, he may have a lighter side, hinted in his dreams about ponies. — Kelechi Osemele (@KOseven0) February 8, 2017 Murray chimed in asking why this had to happen while also calling Carr \"Toy Story Head.\" — Latavius Murray (@LataviusM) February 8, 2017 Carr declared that the the war was on. — Derek Carr (@derekcarrqb) February 8, 2017 You aren't \"neutral\" if you laugh, Latavius. Wo @derekcarrqb I was neutral in the situation! @KOseven0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:27:35.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
