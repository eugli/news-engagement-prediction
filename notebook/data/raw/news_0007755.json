However, Trump’s investigation would center on his belief there were illegal immigrants voting in New York and California (there is no evidence of this), which led him to lose the popular vote by nearly three million.

He’s so fucking pissed, he’s hoping that he can find some voter fraud and hand it over to Hillary. \nTrump and Stern have been friends for a long time. Many of Trump’s most aggressive public statements have been made on Stern’s show, including rating women by their appearance and discussing with whom he’d want to sleep. \nStern said he was “shocked” to hear Trump was running — and “even more shocked that, sort of, people took it seriously.” \nHe was also shocked, Stern said, because Trump was previously a fan of Clinton and “pro-abortion.” \nThe radio host added he personally wishes Trump had never run because he’s worried about his health . Stern said, \nI actually think this is something that is gonna be detrimental to his mental health too, because, he wants to be liked, he wants to be loved. \nTrump’s current approval rating is 45 percent, according to Gallup . The average approval rating for a president’s first quarter is 63 percent. Are We Living In A Post-Fact America?
