The city of Pittsburgh is a better place because of her work. \n\"She was a strong, devout woman,\" Mr. Peduto went on, \"and I am sure she has found peace with God. Please keep her in your prayers.\" \nMs. Walker had been the OMI manager from 2014 until a promotion this year. She joined OMI at age 59, arriving with experience in law enforcement and as a higher education administrator, according to Mr. Peduto's office. \n\"She wore her love of community and her commitment to the community on her sleeve,\" said Elizabeth Pittinger, executive director of the Citizen Police Review Board.
