Really?? All of them. There is no rape on campuses? Got it. \nHe goes on: \n\"The ones that don't involve sex, the sort 'oh, hideous, someone touched my breast, how awful' — what's a woman really telling you there? She telling you that someone was sexually interested in her. It's a sort of bragging, isn't it?\" \nHost Joe Rogan , a much more reasonable human being than Milo (lowest bar ever), rejects that notion: \n\"Well, it is unless someone does really touch your breast in an unwanted way… if some guy just comes up and grabs your tit, that IS sexual assault.\" \nMilo's dismissive response? \n\"Oh gawd. Our parents' generation would have turned ’round and said, 'Keep your fuckin' hands to yourself,' and moved on with their lives. They wouldn't have gone into university administration and tried to destroy the guy's reputation and life over it. It's not that big a deal. Someone touched your tit. Get over it.\" \nHe's probably right about previous generations reporting assault far less. But um… why does he think they were right?? \nRelated: Donald Trump Is In Milo's Camp \nJust a few decades ago, Milo would have found it incredibly difficult to be openly gay without fear of becoming a pariah or worse! Does he want to roll back the clock on that one as well?? \nWe honestly can't tell if he's trolling here or just hates women so much he's willing to be totally illogical. \nThe entire conversation is pushing three hours, but you can find the sexual assault talk starting at about 1:47:41 (below)!
