The King of Queens star has written a tell-all book and produced an A&E series about Scientology, revealing secrets and explaining the harrowing process of leaving the church.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below To be clear, the Church of Scientology has vehemently denied every single one of Remini's claims. They have created a website of their own to dispute Remini's comments about the church, and say she created a \"dramatized work of fiction\" and \"is in it for the money.\" ( You can read their full statement here. )\nBut Remini and other critics like her say they're just scratching the surface about the church's clandestine practices. Below are just some of Remini's most shocking revelations about her time in the Church of Scientology.\n1. Loyalty is to the church, not to your family. In her memoir, Troublemaker , Remini talks about being raised in Scientology with many members of her family as practicing members. \"I didn't want to raise my daughter in the church because from what I experienced and what I saw, the church becomes everything, your mother, your father, your everything. You are dependent on the church,\" she wrote. She has also said that once you \"disconnect\" from your church, your friends and family are forbidden to make contact with you, no matter what.\n2. You get a big ego, even when you're a kid. In an interview to promote her book , Remini says Scientology views children as spiritual beings, and thus doesn't treat them like kids. Her mission was \"to save the planet,\" and because of that, \"you're given a lot of responsibility, and your ego becomes extremely inflated,\" she said.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 3. Critics of the church get harassed and stalked. In an episode of Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath , Remini talked to Mike Rinder, a former spokesperson for the church who left and became one of its most prominent critics. He said that while he was still a member of the church, his job was to \"discredit someone, dig up dirt on them, [and] get their backgrounds investigated.\" And after he left, he said the same thing happened to him; his trash was stolen and someone even installed a camera in a birdhouse to watch the front of his home.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. The church allegedly covered up abuse. One episode of Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath told the story of Amy Scobee , a former church member, who says she was a victim of statutory rape when she was 14. Scientology officials were apparently notified, but nobody told the police or the victim's family. Scobee said she ended up blaming herself.\n5. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' wedding was weird, to put it mildly. Remini wrote in her memoir that she was at a fancy dinner before their nuptials and heard a crying baby. When she tracked it down, it was little Suri Cruise, laying on the floor in a bathroom. Three women were hovering over her \"like she was L. Ron Hubbard incarnate,\" and Remini had to convince them to give her milk. At the actual wedding, Holmes apparently left Cruise at the altar for 20 minutes, and she later reported Remini for rude behavior at the big day. Holmes responded in a statement , saying, \"I regret having upset Leah in the past and wish her only the best in the future.\"\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 6. Scientologists apparently tried to recruit J. Lo. In an interview with 20/20 , Remini accused the church of trying to recruit Jennifer Lopez, who is her best friend. At Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' wedding, officials apparently tried to separate the friends so they could get close to Lopez. \"They were always trying to extract me. I could only assume because they wanted to make Jennifer a Scientologist and maybe I was barring that road for them,\" she said.\n7. Tom Cruise had a meltdown over cookie dough. Remini shared in her memoir that the movie star once freaked out when he wanted to make cookies, and asked his assistant to get materials ready. The assistant brought prepackaged cookie dough and laid it out for him, but Cruise didn't see it and started yelling, allegedly screaming, \"'Get in the fâ€“king present time, is what you need to do.'\"\n8. Tom Cruise is considered a \"messiah\" of Scientology. In an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit , Remini said believers truly think the movie star is \"singlehandedly changing the planet\" and is a messiah figure. \"Criticizing Tom Cruise is being critical of Scientology itself,\" Remini said in an interview with ABC News . She also added in an interview that Cruise was part of the reason she left the church.\nFrom: Redbook\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://www.redbookmag.com/life/a47464/leah-remini-scientology-aftermath-mike-rinder/", "http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a41094/leah-remini-scientology-aftermath-episode-one/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a40771/leah-remini-scientology-tom-cruise-mug/", "http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a41080/leah-remini-scientology-reddit-ama/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a40746/katie-holmes-leah-remini-suri/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/mom-kids/news/a40741/leah-remini-book-suri-cruise-tom-cruise-katie-holmes-wedding/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a40686/leah-remini-scientology-new-book/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/friends-family/news/a40557/leah-remini-scientology-tom-cruise/", "http://www.leahreminiaftermath.com/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a40334/leah-remini-scientology-expose-tom-cruise/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/a47347/leah-remini-scientology-reddit-ama/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a48519/leah-remini-shocking-scientology-stories/"], "published": "2017-02-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:10:44.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
