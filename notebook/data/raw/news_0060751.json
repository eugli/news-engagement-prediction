Sounds of the 60s began in 1990. \nThe BBC said it was the \"right time for him to step off the weekly treadmill\" of presenting the show, as he had spent several months off-air recuperating. \nBut in January, Matthew told the Daily Telegraph : \"I was ready and willing and able to go back, and they've just said they are going to put the programme in the hands of other people.\" \nFrom 4 March, Tony Blackburn will present the two-hour programme at an earlier time of 06:00, a move which Blackburn said was an \"absolute honour\". Image caption Tony Blackburn takes the reins at Sounds of the 60s from 4 March \nBlackburn said: \"To take over this show, 50 years after joining the BBC, is a real privilege and I can't wait to get started.\" \nSounds of the 60s' previous 08:00 slot will be replaced by Dermot O'Leary's show, with music entertainment and a Pause for Thought segment. \nO'Leary said it was a \"huge honour\" to follow in Matthew's footsteps. \"Brian did such an incredible job for so many years,\" he said. 'Thanks for the memories' \nFellow broadcasters and listeners paid tribute to Matthew's work on the programme. \nBBC Radio 2 presenter Bob Harris said : \"For more than 50 years from bantering with The Beatles to Sounds of the 60s, Brian Matthew has been my Saturday soundtrack. Thanks for the memories.\" \n\"What a massive loss to radio this is,\" said one fan, Sarah Jones. \"Exceptional knowledge gone.\" \nCraig Wright said: \"Sad that it's Brian Matthew's last [show]. The soundtrack to many a Saturday morning\". Image copyright Twitter \nBBC Radio 2 said in a tweet that \"we'll miss\" Matthew, adding that he will present future specials on his \"life and times in music\". \nLewis Carnie, Radio 2's head of programming, said Matthew was an \"outstanding presenter and, at 88, a radio legend.\" \nHe added: \"He has made the programme his own with his natural ability, passion and warmth and we are incredibly grateful.\" Image caption Brian Matthew, pictured in 1984", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:57:36.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
