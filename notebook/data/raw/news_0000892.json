(Natasha Razina) What a hassle to get a truculent tsar to swallow his soup. But the wet nurses in Alexei Ratmansky’s whimsical ballet “The Little Humpbacked Horse” know a thing or two about feeding a brat. So one of them pinches the tsar’s nose till his mouth pops open, and another shoves in the spoon.\nThis scene is a child’s revenge — force-feeding aimed at a grown-up. Throughout the two-act production, performed by the esteemed Mariinsky Ballet, we see the world as a child might. The ballet unfolds as a circus of bold colors, full of knockabout energy. The sweet young hero, Ivan, is utterly naive, but with his outsider’s innocence he wins the friendship of a magic pony. He also wins a wife, though not in the way typical ballet heroes do: He pulls her pigtail; she glares.\n\nThe cast is large, but the production has a spare, minimalist look. (Natasha Razina) “The Little Humpbacked Horse,” which opened Tuesday at the Kennedy Center Opera House, springs from a 19th-century Russian children’s poem that is full of magical creatures and kooky mortals, including a spoiled, buffoonish tsar with a taste for pretty young women. (Squint and look sideways, and that character feels rather contemporary.) Ratmansky catches the spirit perfectly. It all feels off-kilter, starting with Rodion Shchedrin’s bright, galloping music. Shchedrin composed it for the Bolshoi Ballet’s 1960 version of the story, which starred famed ballerina Maya Plisetskaya as the Tsar Maiden. The two fell in love during rehearsals and later married. There’s a lot of happiness in this music.\n\nThe ballet is full of magical creatures. (Natasha Razina) The whole production, which Ratmansky created in 2009, feels very Russian. There’s the sentimental music and the folkloric costumes, some of which recall Nicholas Roerich’s designs for “The Rite of Spring.” The comically self-important characters include mustachioed stallions in bell-bottoms and mullets, gypsies, firebirds and sea people caught in a watery, slow-motion slugfest.\nThe style is decidedly contemporary, and although the cast is quite large, the whole production has a spare, minimalist look. The story, however, is a bit complicated; the synopsis is 3½ pages, and I’d call it required reading. In a recent interview , Ratmansky told me that he hadn’t been able to oversee rehearsals recently or work with the current cast of dancers. It shows. The ballet needs fine-tuning in spots where the rhythmic responses were blurred. \n\nAnastasia Matvienko danced the role of the Tsar Maiden. (Natasha Razina) Still, it is full of pleasures. The tsar’s chamberlain — known simply as the Gentleman of the Bed Chamber — appears without fanfare, but just from the way he wiggles his fingers greedily, as if imagining riches sliding through them, you know he’s a schemer. Yaroslav Baibordin, in the role of the titular horse, has enough bounding energy to run a steeplechase. Vladimir Shklyarov’s Ivan was adorably endearing, and although Anastasia Matvienko had some struggles with Ratmansky’s flowing, spiraling solo as the Tsar Maiden, she was believable as a child at heart who has found her soul mate. The feeling was contagious. Ballets can leave you with all sorts of reactions, most of them contemplative. This is the first one that made me wish I could run outside and play.\n\nAlexei Ratmansky’s The Little Humpbacked Horse Through Sunday, Feb. 5 at the Kennedy Center, 2700 F St. NW.
