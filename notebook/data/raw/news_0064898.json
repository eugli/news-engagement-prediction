Those included a firearms prohibition, a DNA order and an order to be registered in the sex offender registry.\nThe man was originally charged with sexual interference after the little girl alleged that he touched her vagina inside her pants on several occasions. He repeatedly denied the accusations, which were also found to have inconsistencies between what she testified and what she told social workers.\nAt trial, the girl's mother suggested her daughter had been forced by her spouse's family to fabricate the claims as part of a vindictive feud between the relatives.\nThe trial judge dismissed the assertion, something the Appeal Court highlighted in its six-page decision.\n\"We cannot but note the glaring failure of the trial judge to frame the issue as it properly should have been framed,\" the judges wrote.\nThe case took a dramatic turn when the man appealed and indicated he had new evidence to present to the court, including four affidavits that the appeal court judges in their ruling last month say, \"leave no doubt the complainant has repeatedly and consistently recanted her trial testimony.\"\nIn one of the documents, the complainant described how her parents had separated and her paternal grandmother told her repeatedly that the man had sexually abused her, although she knew he hadn't.\nThe girl, who is now 17 years old, said she was told to make the allegations to social workers, police and in court.\n\"My (paternal grandmother) pressured me so much that I felt I had no other choice but to go to court and tell the story,\" she said in her affidavit, adding that she was made to watch a video of her statement before going to court to testify.\n\"All I wanted was to please my grandmother and I was very confused.\"\nThe judgment indicates she had apologized to the man, who the judges said, \"has suffered greatly as a result of this miscarriage of justice.\"\nThe Appeal Court states that the complainant was living with \"intense guilt\" about the false accusations and eventually told a therapist of the lie after she had gained some distance from her father's family.\nThe social worker stated in the affidavit that the girl and her sister were told by their aunt and grandmother that her mother hated them and would hurt them, and instilled the idea that the man abused her.\nThe worker concluded that the paternal family \"turned the children against their mother.\"\n-- By Alison Auld in Halifax", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:01:59.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
