I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea 🇮🇱🇺🇸 \n— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) January 28, 2017 \nThe subject of border walls has been the source of a major rift recently between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto . Last week, Trump signed an executive order to start construction of a wall on America’s southern border. Mexico responded by cancelling a meeting with Trump and promising once again that their government will not pay the cost for the wall. \nMexican foreign officials were reportedly dismayed when they saw Netanyahu’s tweet, and they asked that he apologize. Though Rivlin’s position in the Israeli government is mostly ceremonial, he offered a conciliatory statement while contrasting the differences between Israel and Mexico’s border security situations. \n“I am sorry for any hurt caused as a result of this misunderstanding,” Rivlin said, “but we must remember that we are talking about a misunderstanding, and I am sure that we can put the issue behind us.” \nNetanyahu brought up the commotion during a cybersecurity conference on Monday, where he said his words referred to Trump’s recent praise for Israel’s barrier on the Egyptian border. \n“I did not comment about U.S.-Mexico relations. We’ve had, and will continue to have, good relations with Mexico,” Netanyahu said. \n[Image via Shutterstock]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:36:46.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
