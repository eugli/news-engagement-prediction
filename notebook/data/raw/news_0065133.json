With an 87-68 victory over TCU on Wednesday, the Jayhawks clinched at least a share of another conference title. Kansas has done this every year since 2004-05, which was Bill Self’s second year at the school. Kansas’s 13th-straight conference title ties the NCAA record set by UCLA. The Bruins won their conference every year from 1967-1979, a stretch that began with seven consecutive national champions. The Jayhawks have won just one national title under Self, which happened in 2008. Kansas is now 25-3 overall and 13-2 in the conference. The Jayhawks have three games left before the start of the Big 12 Tournament . This looked like the year Kansas’s streak could finally be snapped. Baylor ascended to No. 1 overall in the rankings for the first time ever, but the Bears slipped up in conference play and are currently only 10-5 in the Big 12. West Virginia has also been a mainstay at the top of the rankings. The Mountaineers beat Kansas once at home and then lost a heartbreaker in Lawrence earlier this month. Kansas players celebrated on the court after the win. The Jayhawks are likely to be a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:29:28.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
