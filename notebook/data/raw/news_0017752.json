She watched Italy’s opposition leader Beppe Grillo as he clowned on stage, singing the blues and laughing like a maniac. When they met, Katya didn’t so much interview Grillo as humour him, as if he were an escaped lunatic. Marriage contract of the week Marriage contract of the week: Londoners Neil and Louise moved to the Yukon wilderness, to live as hunters. But Louise is squeamish about first aid. ‘If Neil gets injured,’ she told Jimmy Doherty in Escape To The Wild (C4), ‘I’ll have to shoot him.’ Don’t get injured, Neil... Her attitude typified how the Hampstead middle classes can’t comprehend Europe’s new political movements, with Brexit at the forefront — and why they are bewildered too by Donald Trump’s appeal. Despite Katya’s superior tone, this was a tightly edited survey of anti-EU attitudes across the Continent, and the soundbites from contributors were well chosen. Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis demolished the concept of the single currency: ‘It’s a bit like invading Russia. It starts off beautifully but you end up with blood on the snow.’ And columnist Alan Posener of the German newspaper Die Welt put the Eastern Europe problem pithily. The former Iron Curtain countries, he said, were part of one monolithic empire under the Soviets and do not ever intend to let that happen again. The Cruise: Sailing The Mediterranean Rating: Europe was proving dangerous in other ways on The Cruise: Sailing The Mediterranean (ITV). American tourist Charlotte, aged 90, had been bitten by a Barbary ape during a stop-off in Gibraltar. She had toothmarks in her forearm as though piranhas had been nibbling at her, but Charlotte didn’t seem too worried. ‘Call me Nana,’ she told the nurse. All the holidaymakers are laid back aboard the Royal Princess, and who can blame them? There’s so much booze sloshing about, they barely need the sea to float on. The Cruise: Sailing the Mediterranean, which ends tonight, has been as moreish as a jug of Beverly Hills. It was often little more than an advert for the cruise line One bleary reveller staggered to reception after an especially good night, asking if the shipboard computers could tell him exactly what he’d been up to. Drinking a gallon of Beverly Hills cocktails, it seemed. Even the couple whose suitcase had been dropped overboard didn’t seem too bothered. Those must be spectacular cocktails. This series, which ends tonight, has been as moreish as a jug of Beverly Hills. It was often little more than an advert for the cruise line, and was much too fixated with the ship’s plumbing . . . but it doesn’t half make you feel like weighing anchor and heading for the sun.
