Bear Paw Security — a local Indigenous company — has been hired to open and lock up the church doors this past week. Several volunteers from the church are eagerly and actively involved in running the program, she added.\nBorrowed mats and policies from the Salvation Army on how to run an overnight shelter have also been incredibly helpful, she says.\n\"It's changing people's nights. It's turning nightmares into warm rest. And so it's really a significant difference that we can make this winter. And hopefully we can sleep a little bit easier,\" she said.\nTessa Blaikie Whitecloud, of 1JustWinnipeg, is looking for 64 'heroes' to fund the $250 it costs to keep Augustine United Church open overnight for the homeless.
