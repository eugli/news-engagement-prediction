Cuomo warns even the wealthy have limits. \nCuomo has proposed extending a tax surcharge on millionaires set to expire at the end of 2017, but was skeptical during a meeting with the Daily News Editorial Board last week about going much further. \nThe Assembly Democrats support an extension but wants to add three brackets for those earning at least $5 million, with the top rate hitting 10.32% for those making over $100 million a year. \n“People will take a certain amount of abuse and then there is a point,” he said. “The question is, what is that point? Nobody knows for sure, but you don’t want to reach that point.” \nAssembly Dems release plan for tax hike on New York's wealthiest \nThe current 8.82% rate on all incomes over $1 million is set to drop to 6.85% if the surcharge expires in December. \nCuomo argued the 45,000 or so who earn more than $1 million a year in New York, half of whom actually live outside the state, have seemingly been okay paying the so-called millionaires tax. \nHis budget director, Robert Mujica, said the number of millionaire-earners in New York has actually grown since the surcharge went into effect in 2009 during the Great Recession. It was extended — albeit to include fewer people and at a slightly lower rate — in 2011 under Cuomo. \nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie, when announcing the Assembly plan to add tax brackets for the super rich , said it would generate $5.6 billion in additional revenue that would ensure “our communities have better schools, New Yorkers have better access to health care and that tax burdens do not crush those who are struggling to make ends meet.” \nCuomo did not directly come out against the plan but argued that high-income earners tend to be “highly mobile” and can simply leave New York altogether to avoid paying state income taxes they deem unfair. \n“At one point it becomes serious money,” he said. \nAssembly Democratic spokesman Michael Whyland said that “we stand by our proposal.” \nWhile the business community has called for a complete end to the millionaires tax, Cuomo said the state needs the billions of dollars in revenue the tax generates each year to fund programs and manage looming budget deficits. \nSenate leader shoots down de Blasio's 'mansion tax' \nThe GOP-controlled Senate opposes any extension. \nA bigger issue, Cuomo said, is a congressional proposal that would no longer allow people to take a federal deduction of the state taxes they pay. \n“That would be Armageddon,\" he said. \nOn other tax issues, Cuomo did not take a position on a Senate Republican plan to add New York City to a law capping annual local property tax increases at 2%. And while he did not say whether he supports Mayor de Blasio's call for a so-called mansion tax on high-priced home purchases , he did note that the proposal \"was called a non-starter by the Senate and dismissed out of hand.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:43:31.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
