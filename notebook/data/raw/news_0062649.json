Source: Tweet \nThree days after their drought-breaking A-League Sydney derby win, a second-string Wanderers side copped two rapid-fire second-half goals from Japanese internationals Shinzo Koroki and Tadanari Lee. \nTomoaki Makino and Rafael then landed the killer blows at Campbelltown Stadium on Tuesday night to deliver the 2014 champions their heaviest ACL loss across three campaigns. \nCoach Tony Popovic catered for a short three-day turnaround, along with this Saturday's trip to Perth, with six changes to his starting XI, thrusting untested teenaged striker Abraham Majok into the mix. \nIt was a baptism of fire for the 18-year-old Kenyan-born South Sudanese, who led the line on club debut against one of Asia's top teams just five months after last playing in the NPL 2 for Mt Druitt Town Rangers. \nHis offside goal aside, Majok battled to make a dent in the Reds, who deployed close to their strongest line-up but showed a lack of polish, expected of a team yet to start their domestic season. \nKoroki and Yuki Muto tested Vedran Janjetovic early as the visitors' menacing five-man attack probed in possession. \nThe hosts held firm as the excellent Kearyn Baccus opened up play, threading a ball into the area that Majok couldn't get his boot to before he took Nico Martinez's attempt in a marginally offside position. \nBut it all came undone 10 minutes after the break when an excellent play from Lee set up Koroki to tuck home. \nOnly two minutes passed before Koroki turned provider to Lee, who buried a left-foot shot in the bottom-right corner before Makino side-footed home from a set piece 10 minutes later. \nIf that left the result in no doubt, it only became worse for the Wanderers when Rafael beat Janjetovic at his near post. \nA small crowd of 5590 turned out for the mid-week fixture, including a strong contingent of Reds fans who at times outsang the Red and Black Bloc. \nOne Reds fan was taken away by paramedics after appearing to fall very ill suddenly in the first half.
