The Bruin Consent Coalition, which seeks to prevent sexual violence, released a series of posters earlier this week as part of its new #LetsPictureConsent movement 'It's harassment': The campaign highlights how sharing unsolicited nudes on social media is just as harmful as any other form of harassment when done without consent Not for sharing: The campaign also warns against sending someone else's nude photo to friends, like in the scenario pictured above, without the person's permission 'There is nothing wrong with taking and sharing intimate photos or videos of yourself. There is nothing wrong with exploring your sexuality. If you share a photo or video with someone you trust with the expectation of privacy, then that person betraying your trust is not your fault,' the organization wrote. The posters produced as part of the campaign feature both male and female protagonists, engaging in various situations when someone circulates a naked photo without permission. One of them reminds the public that 'unsolicited pics are a buzzkill', next to a conversation in which an explicit picture was sent in reply to a simple 'Hey!' A similar poster features an exchange between two exes, one of whom messages the other saying 'I miss you.' Not for keeping: The movement also speaks out against those who take screenshots of intimate photos that were meant to remain temporary Speaking out: 'When abuse, humiliation, and harassment happen online they are still abuse, humiliation, and harassment,' the coalition said in a statement Privacy matters: In one of the posters warning not to share someone's nude pictures with friends, one of the recipients asks if the sender obtained permission before sending them But when the other person asks 'Hey, we've broken up, can you stop texting me?' the original sender replies with an explicit photo - prompting the ex to demand: 'Can we not?' The campaign also warns against sharing someone else's nude photo with friends, without the person's permission. 'Count me out, don't group me in,' one of the poster reads next to a conversation between several male senders. 'She's hot, Dude,' one of them says below a nude photo. Another one replies, 'Yeah bro I'd tap that' - at which point another man in the exchange says: 'Yo, did she say you two could share those photos? That's not cool.' The Bruin Consent Coalition also speaks out against those who take screenshots of intimate photos that were meant to remain temporary, with one woman asking: 'Woah, why'd you screenshot that?'
