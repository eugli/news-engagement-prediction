No major injuries were reported.\n\"The water started to seep in the driveway, and then it started to creep up into the front door. It kept getting worse and worse,\" said Alex Hilario, who walked in knee-high water to get to his car and leave.\nMeanwhile several other communities downstream from a Northern California reservoir gushing water for the first time in 20 years braced for flash floods and evacuations. The surge released from Don Pedro Dam into the Tuolumne River in the foothills east of Modesto was expected to reach overtopped levees later in the day.\nRelated stories...
