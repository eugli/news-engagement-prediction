A court sketch from Harris's latest trial (Photo: Julia Quenzler / SWNS.com) \nHarris did not give evidence, but his barrister said they were “false victims” who were hunting for compensation from his £11m fortune. \nHe was cleared of telling a 12-year-old autograph hunter “let’s give you a little cuddle” before groping her as her mother stood nearby outside Radio Victory in Portsmouth in 1977. \nThe Australian was also cleared of “slobbering” over a blind woman at Moorfields Eye Hospital in the 1970s.
