Bicycling may earn commissions on products that are independently selected by our editorial team. 1/7 Rancho La Puerta Rancho La Puerta \nWith an organic farm, pools, hiking trails, and 32 acres of gardens, Rancho La Puerta’s 3,000-acre property is a veritable Mexican desert oasis. \nAmong the 60-plus classes and activities offered each week are interval training , weights, circuit work, spin, yoga, and guided meditations. The resort even has a fitness concierge who can help you create a personalized workout schedule tailored to your needs. \n“Rancho La Puerta is a great destination for individuals looking for a creative, interactive space for health and fitness needs,” says Brandon Mentore, an ACE-certified personal trainer. “The ability to plan and structure your own experience is great.” \nWhen you’re not sweating it out, learn how to make magic with vegetables during a plant-based cooking class. 2/7 eXtreme Hotel Extreme Fitness Camp \nIf a trip to the Dominican Republic conjures images of frosty drinks and beachside sunbathing, think again. The Extreme Hotel in Cabarete—a solar-powered beachfront eco hotel that serves food straight from its organic farm—is all about holistic health and wellness. \nTheir fitness camps are designed to help you jumpstart a new workout regimen or recommit to your goals. They offer traditional fitness activities like strength training , yoga, kickboxing, and core, as well as more non-traditional ways to get your heart pumping. Think: salsa lessons, kite-surfing, and trapeze work (yes, really). \nMentore says the variety of classes offered help you stay active while preventing the mental fatigue that comes from doing the same workout day in and day out. \n“Being healthy and fit is typically associated with traditional gym style experiences,” Mentore says. “Retreats [like this one] can shift the context of what fitness means to you by providing variety and mixing it up.” 3/7 Six Senses Douro Valley Stress-Free Success Retreat Six Senses Douro Valley Stress-Free Success Retreat \nSix Senses Douro Valley—a 19th-century manor house turned luxury resort in Portugal—is offering a new stress-busting retreat in March designed to, well, bust stress. \nThey don’t just calm you down by setting you up with a stellar view of the lush green vineyards (though that never hurts). They educate guests about the unhealthy side effects of stress and providing practical tips for improving your physical and mental health . The 4-day retreat offers an individual wellness assessment, workshops on stress management, tai chi, meditation classes, yoga, daily massages, and fitness activities. \nJosh Klapow, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and cohost of The Web Radio Show , says the retreat is unique in the way it approaches stress, calling it “a stress-reduction intervention” as opposed to just a relaxing experience. “There is a clear and stated intention to give you tools you can take with you to help make your life after the retreat more stress free,” Klapow says. 4/7 Mountain Trek Mountain Trek \nMountain Trek’s fitness-hiking vacation in British Columbia, Canada aims to help you gain strength, increase your metabolism, improve your sleep , lower your stress, and more—lofty goals, to be sure. \nBut the 6-day immersive, science-based program covers its bases. The daily schedule includes several hours of Nordic Fitness Trekking, an evening fitness class, massage, gourmet dinner, and more. \nThe staff even turns off the Wi-Fi for 8 hours every night to give you time to decompress, and each meal is prepared without alcohol, caffeine, starch, sugar, and processed foods. \n\"Mountain Trek has one of the best balances of all the things you would look for in a health and wellness retreat,” Mentore says. The program manages to feel both like a spa vacation and structured workout camp, but beyond that, Mentore says the service and support provided by the staff helps you stay on motivated and on track. \"You’re not left to rough it out by yourself.\" 5/7 Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui Mini Boot Camp \nIf 2017 has you craving a challenging, high-energy workout, head to Thailand for kickboxing with an ocean view. \nThe Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui is rolling out their 3-day Mini Boot Camp , which schools guests in the traditional art of Muay Thai kickboxing—a.k.a. the “Science of Eight Limbs.” You’ll also get personalized fitness consultations and nutritious, tropical meals. \nAfter your training session with a Muay Thai pro, treat your muscles to a cool-leg massage or full-body rubdown. \nStill have energy? Go hiking at Ang Thong National Marine Park (picture waterfalls, white-sand beaches, and mangroves), play tennis, or paddleboard through calm turquoise waters. 6/7 Red Reflet Ranch Red Reflet Ranch \nRed Reflet Ranch in Ten Sleep, Wyoming is the healthy vacation every country guy (or wannabe cowboy) dreams of. You can fish, ride horses, zip around the ranch on ATVs, help herd cattle, or go skeet shooting. \nMentore says the ranch is an ideal option for people interested in a more naturalist approach to health and wellness. It offers “lots of outdoor activities and experiences that combine exploration, learning, and some physical demand,” he says. \nTo break a sweat, explore the gorgeous trails via mountain bike, hike in the nearby canyons, paddleboard through the natural water park, or try your hand at the ranch’s rock climbing wall (avid climbers can head straight to the mountains). \nThere’s also a fitness center, pool, yoga classes, tennis, volleyball, and basketball courts, and a ground-level trampoline to please your inner child. 7/7 Golden Door Golden Door \nGolden Door is a tranquil Japanese-style resort in Escondido, California, complete with 25 miles of private hiking trails, citrus groves, Japanese gardens, and bathhouses. \nThe resort’s week-long men’s program—designed to help you “recharge your body, mind, and spirit”—offers amenities such as daily massages, sessions with a personal trainer, fitness classes, personalized skin care treatments, a customized meal plan, cooking class, and nutrition education class. \nThe staff will even create a personalized take-home fitness program for you, provide freshly laundered workout clothes each day, and take you to and from nearby airports so your trip is as smooth as possible. \n“Many locations offer the opportunity to connect with professionals in fitness, wellness, yoga, and stress,” Klapow says, “but in this setting the plan is provided for you.” \nWhich means all you have to do is show up and soak it in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:06:44.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
