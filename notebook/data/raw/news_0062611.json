However, the case could not be processed on time. According to sources in the government, Yadav, who already has eight police medals to his credit, was recommended for his ninth gallantry award by then Delhi Police commissioner and currently CBI director Alok Verma . The citation sent by the Delhi Police to Union home ministry late last year had mentioned the \"exemplary courage\" shown by Yadav during a 2013 encounter in Vasant Kunj with notorious gangster Surender Malik alias Neetu Dabodha, who had escaped from police custody earlier. The encounter, in which bullets were allegedly fired at Yadav but did not do him harm as he was wearing a bullet-proof vest, ended in the killing of Malik and his two accomplices. A total of nine Delhi Police personnel, including DCP Yadav, were recommended for gallantry award for the said encounter. However, a home ministry official said that recommendation was received too late and could not be processed in time, notwithstanding the immense pressure brought by Delhi police brass to expedite the same. As the Intelligence Bureau 's verification of details of the recommended cases often takes time, the file remains pending in the home ministry. Sources said if the facts put out in the citation are confirmed and officers are found worthy of gallantry award, the same may be announced on Republic Day eve of 2018. Yadav was the investigating officer in the 2005 Delhi blasts case, in which two prime accused Rafiq Shah and Mohammed Hussain Fazli were recently acquitted of all charges and a third accused, Tariq Ahmad Dar, sentenced to 10-year imprisonment. Dar had already served 11 years in prison. Incidentally, Yadav, who is in charge of all anti-terror investigations by the special cell, is not new to controversy. He was earlier in the dock for having \"framed\" Kashmiri Liaquat Shah in a terror case after an NIA probe found that weapons and explosives were 'planted' at guest house of the accused by a special cell 'informer'. In its judgement in 2005 Delhi blasts case, the court said \"the prosecution has not been able to prove any link between Fazli, Shah and Dar\". It further noted that Sheikh Jameel Ali, assistant professor at Kashmir University , had deposed saying that Shah was attending classes on the day of the blast.
