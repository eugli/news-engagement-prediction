'Right to dissent' \nMs Ashraf says she was performing at a venue two streets away from Ms Natarajan's residence in Chennai (Madras) when her band decided to change the lyrics to one of her songs. \nShe and others marched towards the house and transmitted it live on Facebook. \nPolice tried to stop the recording, but Ms Ashraf told the BBC that those accompanying her argued that she was doing nothing illegal. \n\"In Tamil Nadu there is a culture of bullying. There is no space for dissent. If you protest on the streets you are arrested, and if you protest on social media you are charged with defamation. This protest was my way of reclaiming both those spaces,\" she said. \n\"Party workers are asking us to give Sasikala a chance, but let her stand for election first.\" \nMs Natarajan's appointment caused a lot of chatter on Indian social media, both in Tamil Nadu and outside, with many expressing opposition to the decision.
