Bilic sees red as he slams 'awful' refereeing in West Brom draw \n‚ÄúLanzini is terrific and he‚Äôs a game changer,‚Äù Snodgrass told West Ham's official website. \n‚ÄúWe need to always get him on the ball in those areas and let him do what he does best and that‚Äôs pull out moments of magic like that. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gutted, but as I say, the lads battled so hard to get ourselves in front and get the three points and it‚Äôs a devastating way to lose them.\" \nLanzini has scored five goals in 22 top-flight appearances this season, just one less than his total for the entire previous campaign. üó£Ô∏è\"It was all us...\" pic.twitter.com/BikmeTZRlA ‚Äî West Ham United (@WestHamUtd) February 11, 2017 \nWest Ham currently occupy 10th place in the table and are set to travel to Dubai for a warm-weather training camp this week. \nSnodgrass has made a solid start to his Hammers career and is relishing the hard work needed to cement his place in the starting line up. \n‚ÄúPersonally, it was never going to be easy for me coming here, it‚Äôs tough and you have to work as hard as you possibly can to try and get in the team. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôve managed to do that and the team are very unlucky not to have got six points from my two starts,‚Äù he added.
