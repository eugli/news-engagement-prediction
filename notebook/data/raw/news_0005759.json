Berry said most fishermen obey the law and follow the rules, and an incident like this hurts their reputation.\n\"It has far reaching effects and if this gets really ramped up it could have condemnations on particular fisheries, if the circumstances aren't fully explained to the public,\" said Berry.\nThe video of the seal being abused was posted on Mark Allan MacKenzie's Facebook page. He, along with Jay Alexander Jenkins and Brendon Dougles James Porter are all facing charges under the Fisheries Act related to the mistreatment of a marine mammal and the handling of incidental catch.\nJenkins and Porter are also accused of fishing without a registration card.\nDFO was alerted to a photo that showed Jay Jenkins holding a seal with its face bloodied. (Facebook)\nCheckered past This isn't MacKenzie's first run-in with the law related to his activities on the water.\nIn 2005, he was accused of ramming his boat into another fishing vessel and was charged with assault with a weapon, uttering threats and dangerous operation of a vehicle.\nAccording to Nova Scotia provincial court records, MacKenzie also has 17 prior Fisheries Act convictions. They include failure to comply with conditions of a licence and possession of female crabs.\nIn 2009, he was handed almost $25,000 in fines for offences, including the possession of lobsters bearing eggs and mutilated lobsters. He was required to install a vessel monitoring system for one year.\nWhen asked about MacKenzie's previous run-ins with the police and DFO, Berry with the lobster association clammed up.\n\"On that particular avenue we're going to leave that up to the authorities, they're doing their due diligence,\" he said. \"They're on top of this and that's their kind of duty, we're just going to stay out of that side of it.\"\nWith files from Richard Cuthbertson and The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:27:16.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
