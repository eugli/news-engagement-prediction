Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMore than half of councils are poised to approve a 5% tax hike thanks to the social care crisis, Mirror research reveals today. \nOur survey shows at least 68 of 151 councils have lined up a 4.99% council tax rise in April - the maximum allowed without putting it to a referendum. \nAnother 14 have lined up a hike of between 4.9% and 4.98%. \nIf approved the rises will add at least £50 a year to the 'standard' Band D bill in more than half of all areas in England. Read More \nNow our exclusive interactive calculator allows you to search the proposed rise in your area - and exactly what it would mean in your pocket. \nEnter your postcode in our calculator below or scroll down for detailed instructions \nTheresa May gave 151 councils permission to hike bills by 3% in 2017/18 and another 3% in 2018/19 for social care, on top of the 1.99% rise already allowed. \nBut Labour called it a \"sticking plaster” after the Local Government Association (LGA) warned of a £2.6bn black hole in social care funding. \nAnd the GMB union branded the rises a \"postcode lottery\" because council tax hits low-income homes and badly-funded regions hard. \nHouse of Commons Library research has shown bills are set to rise 25% in the five years to 2020. \nShadow Communities Secretary Teresa Pearce told the Mirror: \"Local Councils are stuck between a rock and hard place. They have no option but to increase council tax to try to plug the massive black hole in their funding. \n\"[But] just raising council tax means the burden falls indiscriminately on people with absolutely no consideration of their ability to pay - at a time when the universal services they think they’re paying council tax for are being slashed.\" Labour shadow minister Teresa Pearce warned the burden is falling unfairly (Photo: Getty) \nLib Dem leader Tim Farron warned other taxes may have to rise to plug the gap. \nHe said: \"This shows, starkly, the social care crisis we are facing and how the government are doing nothing to tackle it. \n\"The Tories simply cannot continue to pass the buck on to local authorities. I don’t know how bad the figures need to get for them to actually take action.” Read More Millions face 5% council tax rises to fund the Tories' social care crisis \nThe proposed rates have been drawn up by council chiefs across England, and are being put to elected councillors for final approval over the next three weeks - with the busiest budget day due on Thursday 23 February. \nThat means some of the rates in our research could be rejected by councillors who disagree or fear a local backlash. \nAn early revolt happened at Surrey County Council, which abandoned a local referendum on raising bills by 15% after last-minute talks with the government. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn later revealed leaked texts in which the council's Tory leader was accused of seeking a special deal to \"kill it off\".

Nottingham is set to have the highest Band D bill rise in the country at £76 (Photo: Getty) \n\"If we could have had the same treatment as some of the affluent southern authorities, we wouldn’t be in this position, but under this Government, the poorer you are, the more you have lost – while some rich areas actually gained during this period.\" \nThe next-highest projected Band D rises in our survey were Northumberland and Bristol, both on £74, and Stockport and Liverpool, both on £72. \nOur research suggested 10 councils would hike a Band D bill by £70-79, 56 by £60-69, 35 by £50-59 and 25 by £40-49. \nThese projected rises exclude any additional hikes to police, fire, parish or district precepts. \nThe Mirror compiled its list in the week to February 15 by looking at councils’ public meeting agendas, press releases and local news reports. Where information wasn't available, we called the relevant press office. Manchester is among more than 60 town halls poised to hike bills by 4.99% (Photo: Getty) \nOur research showed just four councils had proposed freezing council tax completely, and just four more were planning a rise of less than 3%. \nEight were planning a rise of exactly 3%, 12 were planning a rise of 3.01% to 3.95%, and 29 were planning a rise of 3.99%. \nThe Department for Communities and Local Government said it had announced £900m for social care, giving councils £7.6bn total dedicated funding over four years.\" \nA spokesman said: \"Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010, and we are giving councils almost £20 billion to provide the services that local people most value.\" How to use our search tool Key to the Mirror's council tax calculator \nUsing our tool, enter your postcode to bring up a page of results. Then: \n1. Use the drop-down box to select your 'band' of home - which can be found on your last council tax bill or by searching here. If you’re still not sure just put Band D, which represents the ‘average’ home. \n2. This is the percentage council rise, including any general rise (up to 1.99%) AND any specific rise for social care (up to 3%), that has been recommended to councillors. It is the basis for the rest of the calculator - however, it may change as councillors give their budgets final approval. \n3. This is the total bill for your home, including all elements of council tax, in the year beginning April 2016. \n4. This is the projected total bill for your home in the year beginning April 2017. It includes smaller elements of council tax, such as police, parish and fire payments, but excludes any increases to those small elements over the last year. That means our total may be slightly lower than what you actually pay. \n5. This is the date councillors are, or were, due to approve the final rate in your area. How does council tax work?

Click here to see if you are eligible. \nCouncil tax is made up of 'precepts'. If your council tax bill is a pizza, each precept is a slice. \nThe biggest precept by far is for your local 'social care authority'. These are county, unitary, metropolitan or London borough councils. \nSmaller precepts are then added on top for parish councils, the police and the fire service. \nAll of these are allowed to rise too, but because they're smaller you'll notice the change a lot less. \nIf you live under a county council - e.g. Kent or Surrey - then you also have a district or borough council precept on top. Their bills aren't allowed to rise as steeply in percentage terms as county councils', because they don't have social care on their books. What council tax band am I? Does anyone actually know their council tax band? (Photo: Rex) \nUse the postcode search tool here. \nCouncil tax bands in England are calculated using an odd system that hasn't changed for decades. \nYour house is valued on the basis of what it would've sold for if it was around on 1 April 1991. \nYour area's 'Band D' council tax is then divided into ninths, and multiplied by a set number to calculate your final bill. \nHere's how that works. \nBand - Fraction of Band D bill - Home value in 1991 \nA - 6/9 - up to £40,000 \nB - 7/9 - £40,001 to £52,000 \nC - 8/9 - £52,001 to £68,000 \nD - 9/9 - £68,001 to £88,000 \nE - 11/9 - £88,001 to £120,000 \nF - 13/9 - £120,001 to £160,000 \nG - 15/9 - £160,001 to £320,000 \nH - 18/9 - more than £320,000 What if I think your calculator is wrong? \nSeven of 151 councils had no publicly available figure when our first round of research ended on 15 February 2017. They appear as 'TBC'. \nAnd some of our figures will end up being out-of-date over the next few weeks if councillors reject the rates suggested to them. \nIf you know of a council where the rate has changed compared to the one in our research, we are happy to update our calculator.
