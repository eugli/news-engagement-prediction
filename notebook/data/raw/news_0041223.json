Tillerson boarded his flight to Germany on Wednesday, making his first foreign trip as secretary of state. He has been conspicuously absent from several prominent events, often relying on a surrogate. Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BONN, Germany — When President Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was conspicuously absent. He was on his first flight overseas as America’s top diplomat, pretty much alone. Mr. Tillerson, who has no government experience, also missed two other important occasions in Washington this week: a lunch with Russia ’s ambassador and Mr. Trump’s meetings with the prime minister of Canada. He has yet to hold a news conference. Among the eight senior State Department staff members who accompanied Mr. Tillerson on Wednesday to Bonn, five are serving in temporary positions. Mr. Tillerson was not expected to do much talking, at least publicly, at a Group of 20 foreign ministers’ meeting here on Thursday, which will lay the groundwork for the Group of 20 meeting in July. The State Department did not invite the customary scrum of reporters, apparently hoping that Mr. Tillerson could continue to keep what has so far been a low profile. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tillerson relied on his acting deputy, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., a holdover from the Obama administration, to be his stand-in for the meetings this week with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the lunch with ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak of Russia, who is entangled in the growing scandal that cost Michael T. Flynn his job as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Having decided to spend Wednesday flying to Bonn so he could get a good night’s sleep before the Group of 20 meeting, Mr. Tillerson sent Mr. Shannon to Mr. Trump’s meetings with the Israeli prime minister instead. The State Department has not held its usual daily briefing since Mr. Trump was inaugurated last month, and Mr. Tillerson has said almost nothing publicly since the Senate confirmed him for the job two weeks ago. Part of the problem may be an extraordinary leadership vacuum at the department. Some appointees to top jobs during the Obama administration resigned or retired, and most of the rest were dismissed by the Trump administration long before there were candidates to replace them. Mr. Tillerson asked Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, to become his No. 2, but Mr. Trump overruled him . After interviewing Mr. Abrams in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump decided he could not get beyond Mr. Abrams’s criticism of him during the campaign. The very public rejection of Mr. Abrams by Mr. Trump sent a chill through the ranks of other Republican foreign policy veterans, many of whom had been equally critical of Mr. Trump during the campaign, if not more so. Finding the dozens of experienced diplomats needed, just as the National Security Council is going through its own uproar, will be challenging. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
