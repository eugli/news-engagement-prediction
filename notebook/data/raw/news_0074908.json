(And neither was it Steve Harvey’s). Someone handed them the wrong envelope. Beatty explained on the Oscar stage, “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said “Emma Stone La La Land.” That’s why I took such a long look at Faye (Dunaway)… I wasn’t trying to be funny.” ADVERTISEMENT \nBut it was kind of funny. And really really awkward. And we couldn’t help but feel bad for the cast and crew of La La Land who were in the middle of giving really good speeches when they were cut short. \nTwitter exploded with reactions to the mess.
