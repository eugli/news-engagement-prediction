PUBLISHED: 00:32, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 | UPDATED: 02:16, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 GETTY The Ceta deal could provide a fantastic platform for British trade negotiations post Brexit We start with a strong base because we already have Ceta Canadian Minister for International Trade, François-Philippe Champagne \nLong criticised by left-wing remoaners the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) with Canada, will be voted on by the European Parliament.Mr Champagne, believes the UK is in a powerful position, as he claimed: “We start with a strong base because we already have Ceta.

It would have far-reaching impacts for British businesses. The deal would make it far easier for British companies to send specialists and experts between Canada and the UK. GETTY Fox and Davis are hopeful that Ceta will aid future trade deals \nImportantly the deal does not include the free movement of people and does not pay any money to the European Commission.David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said: “We can pick up the almost complete agreement between the EU and Canada, and if anything liberalise it.” GETTY EU MEPS will vote to ratify Ceta later today \nIf MEPS vote to ratify the deal then trade specialists agree it will enable Britain to fast-track negotiations with Canada.Liam Fox, Britain’s International Trade Secretary, said in January: “(A future) three-way trading and investment alliance between Canada, the UK and the USA is vitally important not only to our own prosperity, but to the stability of the free trading world.” \nHe pointed out that Ceta is worth around £1.3billion a year to the UK, and some £7.3billion from the EU to Canada.Lourde Catrain, from the law firm Hogan Lovells, said: “One would expect it to be easier for the UK to have preferential market access with Canada if it managed to inherit the complicated negotiations that have been going on for a number of years and, let’s remember, that the UK played an integral part in.” EU summit 2016: EU leaders meet Fri, October 21, 2016 EU Leaders meet to discuss migration, trade and Russia, including its role in Syria, it will be also the first summit attended by new British Prime Minister Theresa May.
