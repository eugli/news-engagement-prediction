PlayStation VR appears to be in the lead when it comes to this area, as it has cumulatively sold 915,000 units worldwide as of Feb. 19, 2017. \nThe virtual reality system for the PlayStation 4 console was launched back in October 2016 and offered a more affordable alternative to the PC-based Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR systems. The existing PS4 consoles, which has already sold over 53.4 million unit globally, made it easier for gamers to get into VR gaming as it would only require them to purchase the PS VR headset and the PlayStation Eye camera if they did not already have one. The availability of game titles also made VR gaming on the PlayStation more viable. \nGame titles have reached over 100 globally as of February 19. Better yet, the number of publishers and developers involved with creating VR titles has increased to over 360. This includes the industry’s top publishers as well as small independent teams and a range of entertainment companies from movies to music. ADVERTISEMENT \nThere are currently 220 software titles in development for the PS VR. These include highly-anticipated titles such as Ace Combat 7, Final Fantasy XV, Steel Combat, Tekken 7, Farpoint and Gran Turismo Sport. Some video content is also being created. Over 100 of these titles are expected to be released by the end of 2017. \nThe PlayStation VR system is currently available in 64 countries and regions worldwide. In the Philippines, it can be purchased at an SRP of P22,900 for just the headset and P25,290 with a bundled PlayStation Eye camera.
