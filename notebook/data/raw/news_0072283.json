Or maybe I should say, I feel good about being a bald man,” Sasaki said, adding that he started losing his hair when he was 40. “And that is thanks to this bald men’s club.”\nThe club, which has attracted roughly 65 members from all over the country since its founding in 1989, encourages people to “view baldness in a positive manner, to have fun, and to brighten the world with our shiny heads”, according to its website.\nTeijiro Sugo, 70, the club’s chairman, hopes the gathering will turn into something much larger.\n“I want all the bald men all over the world to gather here so we can organize a bald men’s Olympic tournament,” Sugo said. The event is held every year on 22 February.\nJapan Asia Pacific news  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:58:27.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
