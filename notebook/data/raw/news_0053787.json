Get on with it, Bibi: Turnbull's message to Netanyahu on peace deal | Katharine Murphy Read more \n“I have a simple reply to Mr Netanyahu: The boundaries, internal security, external security, public finance and governance of a Palestinian state have been elaborated in detail in multiple negotiations with the US under the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, most recently in the Kerry Plan. \n“Mr Netanyahu knows these formulations like the back of his hand. Mr Netanyahu also knows he has torpedoed each of them, often at five minutes to midnight, often by changing the goalposts, to the enduring frustration of both Republican and Democrat administrations.” \nRudd said support for the state of Israel did not mandate a slavish devotion to all policies espoused by Netanyahu. \n“That is why I beg to differ on this and other aspects of Mr Netanyahu’s policies.” \nRudd also returned to a unresolved strain on the Australia-Israel relationship during his premiership. \nIn 2010, Israeli Mossad agents allegedly used fake passports – including several Australian ones , reportedly manufactured in a Mossad passport “factory” – to smuggle its assassins into Dubai, where they suffocated militant Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in a hotel room. \nAustralia expelled a senior Israeli diplomat from the country after saying there was “no doubt... Israel was responsible for the counterfeiting and cloning of those passports”. \nAustralia said it was aware Israel had forged Australian passports on previous occasions as well. \n“Will he [Netanyahu, who was prime minister at the time] use this visit to Australia to apologise to the Australian people for his government using forged Australian passports to facilitate an Israeli assassination of a member of Hamas in Dubai?” Rudd asked. \n“No apology has ever been received for that action which had the consequence of putting the integrity of Australian passports and the security of Australian passport holders travelling to the Middle East at risk.” \nNetanyahu is the first incumbent Israeli leader to visit Australia. Following a meeting and press conference with current Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and a lunch in central Sydney on Wednesday, he spent the afternoon at the Central Synagogue in Bondi. \nHe has further meetings with members of Sydney’s Jewish community on Thursday, as well as with government leaders and parliamentarians. \nHe will meet with NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, as well as Rudd’s successor, current Labor leader Bill Shorten.
