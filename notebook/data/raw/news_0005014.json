That kid is going to have the stage for 13 minutes,” she said. “And I’m excited to give it to them.” \nWATCH: Why Adele won’t perform at the Super Bowl \nThe performance at the NRG Stadium will also feature Tony Bennett, who Gaga called a “tremendously wise man.” Gaga and Bennett recorded the 2014 album of duets, “Cheek to Cheek,” which won a Grammy – the sixth for Gaga. They also launched a successful tour. \nThe showdown between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons airs Sunday on Fox. Gaga, who said many of her relatives are Pittsburgh Steelers fans, wouldn’t reveal whom she’s rooting for. “I’m going to keep that one to myself,” she said. \nIn addition to Gaga, three original cast members of the Tony Award-winning Broadway hit “Hamilton” will sing “America the Beautiful” during pregame festivities and Luke Bryan will perform the national anthem. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:06:59.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
