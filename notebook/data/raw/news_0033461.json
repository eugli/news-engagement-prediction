However, recovery strength in the legs has been less reliable, said Mr Power. A dozen patients with neck arthritis have had their arm movement restored. In these types of cases, the 45- to 60-minute operation can be carried out under general or regional anaesthetic (a ‘nerve block’), while the patient is awake. First, a small incision is made on the inner aspect of the arm, exposing the musculocutaneous nerve, which runs from the spinal cord in the neck and governs movement of the biceps and triceps in the upper arm. Also exposed is the ulnar nerve, which runs along the underside of the arm, across the elbow and into the forearm and hand. The key to the procedure is that the ulnar nerve is attached to the spinal cord at a lower point than the musculocutaneous nerve, and is often unaffected by compression in the neck. Singer Robbie Williams, 42, recently admitted to suffering from spinal arthritis The surgeon attaches a branch of the ulnar nerve in the arm to the musculocutaneous nerve, allowing signals to ‘bypass’ the damaged area. Over the next six to eight weeks, the newly rerouted nerve grows into the muscle. ‘The first sign that electrical signals are getting through is felt as a tenderness in the muscle, and then it begins twitching,’ explained Mr Power. ‘After that the patient must undergo physiotherapy so they can relearn to use the muscle.’ One of the first such operations was on a 42-year-old motorcyclist injured in a collision with a van. He had eight hours of surgery involving the transfer of six motor nerves, two sensory nerves and a tendon. ‘There was one nerve root still working to his right shoulder and upper arm, so he was able to move his shoulder but nothing else,’ says Mr Power. ‘We were able to transfer eight nerve branches within his arm to rewire his limb. We split the existing nerves and reconnected them. ‘We aimed to give him the ability to reach with his arm and to grasp by restoring sensation and dexterity in his fingers.’ Another patient to benefit is Colin Baker, a retired financial director from West Bromwich. He had a nerve-transfer operation 18 months ago after he lost the use of the right arm due to a tumour pressing on the spine in his neck. He is now able to move the arm, and even play golf again. Mr Baker, 80, said: ‘There was pressure on the spinal cord, squeezing the nerves firing the muscles. Mr Power moved the nerves to get the muscles moving again at the wrist and elbow. Now movement has come back and it improves all the time. I wasn’t able to swing a golf club, but now I can again – although my handicap has not improved.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:32:50.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
