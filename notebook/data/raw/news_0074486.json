REIGNS' DETRACTORS \nThat was clearly seen when he won the Royal Rumble, as well as the follow-up victory at WrestleMania 32 when he defeated Triple H for the WWE Championship.

ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT MINORITY \nReigns hit a brilliant Spear on Braun Strowman during the match and as you’ll be able to see and hear below, Reigns was cheered a little after the table broke in half. \nHe posted: “Look at the crowd when it happens. The anti-establishment minority doesn’t want you to know that reaction!” \nAs expected, fans were quick to respond and one responded by saying: “This is a German crowd. It is like 90% kids in there.” \nRoad Dogg then tweeted: “Heck yea there are! Their parents bought tickets too….get it?!” \nHe was referring to Reigns’ detractors as the anti-establishment minority, claiming that they don’t want other fans to know that Reigns actually gets cheered when they aren’t there. \nMaybe on that particular night, it was a slightly different story as the crowd was much smaller, but there’s certainly no way you can call Reigns’ critics a minority as it's proven on a weekly basis that if anybody is in the minority, it's his supporters. \nWhat do you make of Road Dogg calling Roman Reigns’ critics a minority?
