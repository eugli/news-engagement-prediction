But a lawsuit filed earlier this month by parents demanded Mack be placed in the boys’ division. \n“The 16 girls who are in (Beggs’s) bracket have been put in a very, very unfair situation because of the grown-ups,” said James Baudhuin, the attorney behind the lawsuit, per the Washington Post . “To me, this is a complete abject failure of leadership and accountability from the people who regulate sports in Texas. They’re doing wrong by Mack, and not just these 15 girls but all the other girls she wrestled all year.” \nLisa Latham, whose daughter Taylor was beaten handily by Beggs in the first round of the state tournament, is among the rules’ detractors. \n\"Mack wants to wrestle boys and he'll never be recognized as a boy because of the birth certificate in the state of Texas,\" Lisa Latham said, per the Dallas Morning News . \"And female wrestlers don't have a chance.\" \nLatham said she encouraged her daughter to forfeit the match, but Taylor wanted to compete. Beggs, in fact, reached the state tournament after two opponents forfeited, according the AP. \nThe UIL’s Harrison, though, does not anticipate the policy being changed. \n\"Nothing that has happened at this year's wrestling championships has the UIL reconsidering its rules, because quite frankly, we don't believe that any issues being reported on are really a product of UIL rules,\" Harrison said.
