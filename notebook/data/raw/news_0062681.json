What a win! #MCYvSYD #ALeague pic.twitter.com/sSRsaROgGQ \nâ€” Hyundai A-League (@ALeague) February 24, 2017 \nThe Sky Blues can effectively seal the title with a win next Saturday night when second-placed Melbourne Victory visit Allianz Stadium. \nAnd while Arnold's side would be very worthy recipients of the A-League premiers' plate, they weren't made to work hard for the points on Friday night. \nCity took the contest to Sydney FC but came unstuck dealing with their first serious attack. \nMuscat's first caution resulted in a penalty as he clipped the heels of Filip Holosko as the Slovakian bore down on goal. \nBrazilian Bobo comfortably converted the 24th-minute spot kick - the second Muscat has given away in as many weeks - to put Sydney ahead against the run of play. \nBut City found a goal their early play merited within a minute. \nFitzgerald, who caused marker and ex-City defender Michael Zullo headaches all night, fired a stunning outside-of-the-boot volley into the top corner to give Danny Vukovic no chance. \nCity's jubilation turned to exasperation on 39 minutes when Muscat's sloppy touch gave Alex Brosque a sight on goal. \nAs the Sydney skipper stole possession and raced away from his victim towards goal, Muscat couldn't help but tug at his shirt - a professional foul - to earn a second yellow. \nMichael Valkanis re-jigged his side at halftime, throwing on Ruon Tongyik for Tim Cahill, and the young defender played a part in Sydney's second. \nTongyik's unfortunate handball just outside the box gave O'Neill a dead-ball opportunity he made the most of - dinking his free-kick over the wall and past Thomas Sorensen. Don't expect new faces, says Socceroos coach Australia manager Ange Postecoglou has stated he doesn't expect that there will be too many bolters wearing the Socceroos shirt in 2017. \nBobo completed Sydney's first win over City in two-and-a-half years by latching onto Milos Ninkovic's sublime through-ball, swivelling past the helpless Osama Malik to finish from close range. \nThere was time enough for City substitute Fernando Brandan to run and spin through several Sydney players, only for Vukovic to deny him a goal of the season contender. \nArnold, who endured a difficult week after the derby defeat, said he always believed their losing streak would end at one. \n\"There was never really any doubt in my view that the boys would jump back on the horse straight away and perform the way they did,\" he said. \n\"We were hard done by on the weekend. The performance was very, very good ... we got on with it.\" \nValkanis said he wouldn't point the finger at Muscat, saying he was pleased at their start before the dismissal. \n\"You don't plan or expect you're going to get a red card. That changed everything,\" he said. \n\"The penalty was the first time Sydney got into the box and put a bit of pressure on us. We were in control (until then).\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:11:20.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
