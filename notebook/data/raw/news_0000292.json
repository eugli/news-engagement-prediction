However, the regional and national collation of vote tallies are done electronically. \nSome 12.6 million Dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots to usher in a new 150-seat lower house of parliament, with some 31 parties having so far registered for permission to field candidates. The election committee will rule on Friday how many parties will be allowed to run. \nThe far-right anti-Islam MP, Geert Wilders , and his Freedom Party (PVV) have been leading the opinion polls for months, leaving prime minister Mark Rutte’s Liberal party (VVD) trailing in second place. \nA polls aggregate on Wednesday predicted Wilders would emerge as the largest party with 27-31 seats, with Rutte’s party gathering just 23-27 seats – both far short of the 76-seat majority needed. Such an outcome would presage a period of intense haggling to form the next government.
