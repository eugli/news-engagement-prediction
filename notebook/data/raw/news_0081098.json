Rec Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images The Steelers and wide receiver Antonio Brown have reached an agreement on an extension, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter . The deal will make Brown the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL, per Schefter. According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport , the deal will be over $15 million a year. Prior to the extension, A.J. Green is the highest paid receiver in the NFL on an annual basis with $15 million per year. There’s no question that Brown has earned it. He’s been arguably the best wide receiver in the game for the past few seasons, where he’s been an All-Pro. He led the league in receptions in 2014 and 2015, and has put up 10 or more touchdowns in the past three seasons as well.
