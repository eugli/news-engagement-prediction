Seriously?! #Oscar pic.twitter.com/hq1pcEMiFl — Pepper Potts (@blackJaneAusten) February 27, 2017 Can Jimmy Kimmel *not* make jokes about Mahershala's name? Jesus Christ. Come on. It's 2017. #Oscars — PAPER Magazine (@papermagazine) February 27, 2017 Hi I'm Jimmy Kimmel, I don't know anything about movies and I think people should have good white names like Sally and Meat. — Jake Cole (@notjustmovies) February 27, 2017 @jimmykimmel can't let Mahershala Ali win without making fun of his name. Jimmy, your name ain't so common in 3/4 of the world #Oscars — Samuel Black (@potter_black) February 27, 2017 can j kimmel stop making fun of non-white ppl's names thanks — Erika (@ineedhp) February 27, 2017 \nF urther criticism arose following an incident later in the ceremony, during a skit took place in which passengers on an open-top bus tour of Hollywood were ' unexpectedly' ushered into the Oscars venue and introduced to celebrities. \nKimmel spoke to an Asian woman who told him her name was \"Yulerie\" - at which he looked confused and asked her to repeat it. \nHe then asked another of the tourists his name, at which he said: \"Patrick - now that's a name.\" \nWriting for Refinery 29, Arianna Davis commented : \"It doesn't seem like Kimmel is the type of guy that would purposely try to offend people on a major stage like the Academy Awards. But that's part of the problem: Many people don't stop to think about how their microaggressions toward people of color can wear them down over time. \n\"In addition to constantly being reminded of their 'otherness' for simply being born with different skin, these men and women have likely already dealt with a lifetime of unnecessary teasing or questioning because of their unique names.
