B. Mohammed of the Federal Capital Territory High Court sitting in Jabi, Abuja on a 2-count charge of conspiracy and obtaining by false pretence to the tune of N2.5 million. \nMr. Tangalu, a self-styled native doctor, also known as Babalawo, was arrested following a petition by one Dozie Ugonna, who alleged that he was scammed of over N2.5 million by the accused and his cohorts. \nAccording to the petitioner, the money was meant for the purchase of materials to neutralize some harmful charms purportedly contained in a carton filled with United States dollars. \nThe offence is contrary to Section 8 (a) and punishable under Section 8 (C) and 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act No. 14, 2006. \nThe accused person pleaded not guilty to the charge. \nUpon his plea, counsel to the EFCC, Elizabeth Alabi, asked the court to fix a date for trial and remand the accused in prison custody pending trial. \nShe urged the court to consider the weight of the offence, which according to her carries a minimum of seven year jail term. \nHowever, counsel to the accused, Yusuf Abdullahi, told the court he had a pending bail application before the court. He added that the accused had been granted administrative bail by the EFCC which he had not breached and urged the court to adopt same bail condition. \nJustice Mohammed granted bail to the accused in the sum of N2 million with two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be a civil servant or a community leader. \nThe case has been adjourned to March 20, 2017 for trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:08:59.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
