It was an ordeal I'm going to have to carry with my for the rest of my life.\" \nThe star - who doesn't blame the woman, who has \"expressed concern\", but is no longer in touch with her - also opened up about the scar on the back of his head and possible concussion.

I worry about it. Even moshing on stage.\" James Arthur and Gemma Iveson \nIn a statement following the sentencing, Arthur said: “I would like to thank people for working on this case and I’m glad to put the episode behind me.” \nArthur, who was taken to hospital and needed five staples in his head, had reportedly had a one-night stand with Gemma Iveson after she had broken up with Revell.
