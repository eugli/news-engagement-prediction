They run from your foot to your hip, and they plug in with an air hose to a compressor, which is where all the magic happens. \nThere are five zones in these boots, and they’ll start inflating to the shape of your body. They'll work their way up from the feet, giving you a really snug squeeze, almost working like a massage. It pulses, working its way up to the fifth zone. As it works its way up, it will hold pressure in the zones below. When it gets up high, it will let pressure off, so basically it’s just moving the fluids through your legs, much like a compression sock, but you're getting the massaging benefits as well. \nYou can dial in as much time as you want, for example 20 minutes or 30 minutes, and then how much squeeze you want. A power level offers a pressure gauge of 1 up to 7. Seven is a pretty serious squeeze. While testing it around the Runner's World offices, we've been starting people much lower, around a three or four. \nIf you do have an area you want to focus on, like a hamstring or calf issue, you can hit the zone boost button and it’s going to stick around in that area and give you more work. \nThe compressor unit is rechargeable, meaning you can plug it into the wall at home and charge it up in case you are going to a remote area for a race or trail run. \nWe're going to continue testing the Normatec Pulse for an upcoming gear feature in Runner's World magazine. It retails starting at $1,595. You can head over to Normatec’s website to either purchase or find a location near you to try one out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:47:12.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
