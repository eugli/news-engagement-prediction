RBC Capital Markets \nThere are, of course, many uncertainties when it comes to the impacts that both Ryan and Trump’s tax plans would have on Canada’s economy. \nBut the economists leave little question that a tax on imports from Canada or other countries could take a financial toll. \nThis chart, also from RBC, shows how Canadian exports to the U.S. compare to other trading partners: \nThis pie chart shows how Canadian exports to the U.S. compare to other trading partners. RBC Capital Markets Story continues below \nSectors that would suffer most from Ryan’s tax reform plan include export-oriented industries such as computers, chemical, machinery and transportation equipment, Shenfeld and Tal noted. \nThe changes proposed in “Better Way” could also motivate companies to leave Canada and relocate south of the border, Shenfeld and Tal wrote. \nBut quantifying precisely how bad these measures would be for Canada is a difficult task, they added. \nEvaluating the potential impacts of these changes would require consideration of several factors. \nThat includes the falling value of the Canadian dollar, competitive challenges arising as a result of the tax reforms, and monetary policy set by the Bank of Canada, among other things. \n“The truth is that nobody can model such a change with any degree of credibility,” Shenfeld and Tal wrote. Fighting back \nThe measures contained in “Better Way” don’t represent the first time that a new border tax has presented potential issues for America’s trading partners. \nIn 1930, the U.S. enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which imposed a 20 per cent tax on imports, Shenfeld and Tal noted. \nCanada led a number of countries in retaliating against the U.S.; it imposed a tariff on U.S. exporters, stalling global trade and creating “just one more factor in a deepening Great Depression.” \nThe names Smoot and Hawley have since gone down in “economic infamy,” Shenfeld and Tal wrote. \nHopper cars and railcars with intermodal shipping containers on Canadian Pacific tracks along the waterfront, downtown Vancouver, B.C., Sept. 9, 2016.
