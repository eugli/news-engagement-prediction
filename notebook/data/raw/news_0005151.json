Photo courtesy KTVI \nMARISSA • Cadaver dogs found the body of a young woman in a landfill Tuesday after St. Louis homicide detectives seeking a missing person traced the trash collection route from a city neighborhood to the dump, Marissa police chief Tom Prather said Tuesday. \nPrather said the dog team located the body about 10:30 a.m. in an area in which Waste Management Inc., which runs the Cottonwood Hills landfill, determined where the trash would have been buried. Prather said St. Louis detectives contacted his office Monday that they were following the trail in a missing-person case. \nWaste Management Inc. takes waste from the city Refuse Department and operates the Cottonwood Hills landfill in Marissa. Prather said detectives suspected that the body of a woman missing since last Thursday, had been put in an alley trash container in the city. \nPrather said investigators had not identified the body but added, \"We suspect it is the missing female.\" He said the Illinois State Police and the St. Clair County coroner's office also were working on the case. \nSt. Louis police identified the missing woman they were seeking as Brandy Renee Morrison, 23, whose family reported her missing Thursday. \nJeannette Morrison, the missing woman's aunt, said she had talked with relatives Tuesday about the case. \n\"I just pray to God it's not her,\" she told a reporter. \nMarissa is about 30 miles southeast of downtown St. Louis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:50:46.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
