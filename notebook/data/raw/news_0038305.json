AnC attack targets CPU cache management component \nWhat researchers discovered was that this component shares some of its cache with untrusted applications, including browsers. This meant that researchers could send malicious JavaScript that specifically targeted this shared memory space and attempted to read its content. \n\"We have built a side-channel attack, specifically an EVICT+TIME cache attack, that can detect which locations in the page table pages are accessed during a page table walk performed by the MMU,\" researchers said . \n\"For example, on the x86_64 architecture, our attack can find the offsets that are accessed by the MMU for each of the four-page table pages. The offset within each page breaks nine bits of entropy so even a perfect ASLR implementation with 36 bits of entropy is not safe.\" \nIn layman's terms, this means an AnC attack can break ASLR and allow the attacker to read portions of the computer's memory, which he could then use to launch more complex exploits and escalate access to the entire OS. \nASLR is a memory protection mechanism deployed with all major operating systems, which randomizes the location where code is executed in the memory. By breaking ASLR, an attacker will know where code executes, and prepare an attack that targets the same area of the memory, stealing sensitive information stored in the PC's memory. AnC attacks work via Chrome and Firefox on 22 CPU architectures \nResearchers said they successfully tested AnC JavaScript attacks via Chrome and Firefox on 22 different CPU architectures, even despite several protections built within those browsers, such as broken JavaScript timers. \nEven worse, researchers say AnC attacks can be used to revive previously blocked cache attacks, opening the door for many-years-old bugs, which vendors thought to have mitigated. \nAccording to researchers, the only way users can protect themselves against AnC attacks is to deploy an extension like NoScript, which stops untrusted JavaScript code from running in the browser. \nIssues with AnC attacks are tracked via several CVE identifiers. CVE-2017-5925 is assigned to track the developments for Intel processors CVE-2017-5926 is assigned to track the developments for AMD processors CVE-2017-5927 is assigned to track the developments for ARM processors CVE-2017-5928 is assigned to track the JavaScript timer issues in different browsers \nBelow are the 22 CPU models and microarchitectures that researchers tested and found vulnerable to AnC attacks. More microarchitectures could be vulnerable as well, as not all were tested.
