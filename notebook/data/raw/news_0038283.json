Insists he hasn’t banned all bikini adverts.\n— Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) September 23, 2016 H owever, not everyone agrees. Green councillor Caroline Russell claimed to have had complaints from constituents about the advert.\nShe told the Standard: \"People taking the Tube should not have to be bombarded with adverts that imply their bodies aren’t good enough.\n“Young people receive this negative message from enough social media channels and it’s appalling that this is being reinforced on Tube platforms, against the Mayor’s own policy, when people are taking trips to school, to work, or going out to socialise. \nWatch | Sadiq Khan reveals he used to party at Fabric 02:15 “I am urging the Mayor to look again at these adverts that challenge young people to ‘keep up’ with reality stars known for idealised and unrealistic body shapes. He needs to enforce his own guidelines and live up to his manifesto promise to Londoners.\n“Every body is a good body and TfL should be promoting inclusion and making their stations welcoming spaces. Allowing these adverts risks making people lose confidence in themselves.”\nT he Advertising Standards Agency removed Protein World's controversial \"beach body\" advert after complaints and protests.\nGreat response from Dove to the recent ProteinWorld ads #beachbodyready pic.twitter.com/yFTqN31OOE \n— Andrew Bloch (@AndrewBloch) April 29, 2015 I t said at the time: \"We've met with Protein World to discuss its \"Are you beach body ready?\" ad campaign.\n\"It's coming down in the next three days and, due to our concerns about a range of health and weight loss claims made in the ad, it can't appear again in its current form.\n\"Although the ad won't appear in the meantime, we've launched an investigation to establish if it breaks harm and offence rules or is socially irresponsible.\n\"We will now carefully and objectively explore the complaints that have prompted concerns around body confidence and promptly publish our findings.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T15:59:14.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
