Louise Hermida, 75, and her son were attacked early Monday at their home in Queens, police said. Hermida had trauma to her body and was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The son was treated for leg trauma.\nNeighbors said the woman had planned to take the dog, a mastiff, to a shelter on Monday because of its aggressive tendencies.\nNeighbor John Brien told WABC-TV that the same dog attacked another neighbor's small terrier while being walked on a leash 10 days ago.\n\"He just pounced on it and started chewing it like a rag doll,\" Brien said. \"It started ripping it to bits. We tried to jump in. The owner of the white dog got bit on the hand.\"\nAnother neighbor, Rosa Ortiz, said the attack led Hermida to want to get rid of the dog. She said Hermida had owned the dog for about four years and owned several other dogs as well.\nShe described the scene of Monday's attack as horrifying.\n\"When I saw her there, it broke my heart,\" Ortiz said. \"She was all bloodied. Her head, her arms. It was really bad. It was a tragedy.\"\nThe dog is now in the custody of Animal Care and Control of New York City.\nAn ACC spokeswoman said the dog was adopted from Animal Care Centers almost six years ago and was about a year old at the time.\n___\nInformation from: WABC-AM, http://www.wabcradio.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:23:27.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
