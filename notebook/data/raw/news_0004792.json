It's not just down to you being grumpy (maybe) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nIf the sound of someone eating a bag of crisps can throw you into a near-murderous rage, or if someone chewing gum or breathing heavily can bring you out in a cold sweat - we've got some good news for you. \nIt's not just down to you being grumpy (although you may also be grumpy). Read More Microwaving fish, slurping tea and loud typing: Things you only know if you work in an office \nScientists have found that people who get angry because of someone chewing or breathing loudly may actually have a genuine brain abnormality. \nIn research published by a northern university scientists have found a physical basis for the people suffering from a condition known as misophonia. \nMisophonia is a condition where people have a hatred of sounds such as eating, chewing or repeated pen clicking. \nThese 'trigger sounds' can promote an immediate and intense fight or flight feeling. \nIn research published in 'Current Biology', scientists claim to have identified evidence of clear changes in the structure of the brain’s frontal lobe in sufferers of misophonia and also report changes in the brain activity. Read More \nBy using brain imaging researchers found brain activity that came from a different connectivity pattern to the frontal lobe. \nThis suggests that the condition is real despite previous medical scepticism.

He said: “For many people with misophonia, this will come as welcome news as for the first time we have demonstrated a difference in brain structure and function in sufferers.

This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a sceptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder.” \nIn one case study provided by the university a misophonia sufferer said her GP laughed when she told him about her symptoms. \nOlana Tansley-Hancock, 29, from Ashford in Kent, was eight years old when family meals became unbearable for her. \nShe said: \"The noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals. \n\"I can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating - and anyone who knows me will say that doesn't sound like me.\" \nTim Griffiths, Professor of Cognitive Neurology at Newcastle University and UCL adds: “I hope this will reassure sufferers. I was part of the sceptical community myself until we saw patients in the clinic and understood how strikingly similar the features are. \n“We now have evidence to establish the basis for the disorder through the differences in brain control mechanism in misophonia. This will suggest therapeutic manipulations and encourage a search for similar mechanisms in other conditions associated with abnormal emotional reactions.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:58:32.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
