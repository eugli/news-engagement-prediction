It was sacred to them because of their faith-based belief that the founders of Judaism are buried there. In 1929, a genocide occurred. The entire Jewish population was attacked and either killed or scattered. For Canada now to take the position that Jews cannot live in Hebron is to legitimize the 1929 genocide, a position that is contrary to fundamental international law. \nLikewise, Jews have been the majority in Jerusalem, latterly in its Jewish Quarter, over much of two millennia. Jordan, on conquering the walled city in 1948 shortly after Israel declared its independence, killed or displaced every single Jew. For Canada now to prohibit Jewish resettlement is to support a grave form of racial discrimination, prohibited by international law. \nIn 1948 and 1967, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and other Arab States organized a campaign to destroy Israel. On May 27, 1967, Egyptian President Nasser publicly issued the following threat: “Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel.” \nIsrael successfully defended itself. To discourage another try, defeated aggressor states are traditionally punished by a transfer of territory. Security Council Resolution 242 of Nov. 22, 1967 provided that a post-1967 peace settlement would give Israel enlarged, “… secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force.” This wording was used specifically as an agreed framework to deter further attempts at Israel’s destruction. For Canada to take a position in 2017 denying housing of Jews in population blocs around Jerusalem as part of the envisaged defensible borders plan would reward aggression, which is contrary to international law. \nSome rules of customary international law are so fundamental they can never be overridden, not by states, nor by courts, nor by institutions. These rules are termed “ jus cogens .” They include prohibitions against genocide, racial discrimination and aggression. These fundamental elements of international law do not permit any country or institution (not even the UN Security Council) to interpret Article 49 in the maladroit manner set out above. The Nuremberg trials confirmed that “following Nazi orders and laws” was not a defence because such statutes were contrary to the natural and generally accepted fundamental rules against murder, extermination and deportation. \nCanadian policy must be very considered in its definitions of “Israeli settlements,” “occupied territory” and “Palestinian territory,” both in general and specifically in relation to the recent Security Council Resolution 2334, which labeled the settlements “illegal,” if at the same time Canada does not apply the label to similar practices elsewhere. Canada can and should set an example for other democracies to follow. \nJason Reiskind, a specialist in international law formerly at the department of External Affairs (now Global Affairs Canada), was a Foreign Service officer and Justice Canada counsel.
