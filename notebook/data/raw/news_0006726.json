It didn't take long at all before [the house] was fully engulfed in flames.

I can't even imagine what the wee boy is going through. \n\"They were all OK, but the boy was upset about his chickens. They didn't make it out.\" \nFire Service spokesman Brent Dunn said crews from Kaiapoi and Woodend battled the fire, which took several hours to contain. \n\"It was well ablaze when the crews arrived. [The family] had been alerted by the smoke alarms so everyone got out with no injuries\", he said. \nHe said the house was \"badly damaged\" by the flames. \nAn investigation was under way on Wednesday to determine the cause of the fire. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:58:33.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
