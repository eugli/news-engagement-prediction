OTTO Engineering President Tom Roeser had them demolished last week. (Erin Sauder / The Courier-News) \nWashington Street in Carpentersville is looking a little more deserted. And village officials couldn't be happier. \nRecently, the two empty Quonset hut buildings, called \"eyesores\" by Village President Ed Ritter, were demolished. \n\"They were ugly, ugly, ugly,\" Ritter said. \"I personally, and I'm pretty sure all the village trustees, were also very interested in having them come down.\" \nOTTO Engineering President Tom Roeser made it happen. For the past several years, he has spent millions of dollars revamping the area surrounding his company. \nYears ago he purchased the lot on Washington Street nearest to the bike trail.

Construction fencing surrounds the site where two Quonset huts used to be located. (Erin Sauder / The Courier-News) \n\"The village was going to allow a crematorium to be put there. I thought, 'That's just not the right thing for a neighborhood,' so I bought the property and made it open space,\" Roeser said. \nIn 2007, he bought the hut at 208 S. Washington St., formerly a chiropractic office. The second hut, which Roeser purchased in 2015, at one time housed a veterinarian clinic. \nHe has been working with the village's current engineer, Kevin Gray, also assistant director of public works, on the demolitions. \nRoeser said he plans to leave the area as open space for \"quite a while.\" \n\"We're going to do some landscaping in the Quonset area in the next week or two,\" he said. \"The weather has been good enough so we can plant some bushes.\" \nRitter envisions an upscale condominium development on the site. \n\"A lot of rivertowns have done that with the riverfront,\" he said, citing the developments near the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin. \nHowever, \"it's Tom's property,\" he said. \n\"I can only express the long range hope of mine,\" Ritter said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:42:11.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
