Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said. \nApart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:56.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
