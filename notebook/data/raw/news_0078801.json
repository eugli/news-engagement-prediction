Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe odds may be up against Southampton in Sunday's EFL Cup final against Manchester United , but at least they'll be wearing their lucky kit. \nThe Saints are undefeated in the white garb they'll throw on at Wembley, having only worn their third kit once this season - in a 3-1 victory at rivals Bournemouth. \nUnited will wear red after being drawn as the home side for the final, while Claude Puel's men were expected to wear black.
