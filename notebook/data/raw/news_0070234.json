However, AHS said because residents moved in at different times after the facility’s opening, their health service usage numbers were calculated per client. \nAmong the report’s findings were that inpatient hospital admissions of Ambrose Place residents dropped by 58 per cent, an 81 per cent drop in the number of inpatient days in hospital, a 45 per cent drop in the number of emergency room visits and a 68 per cent decline in the number of “noted addiction and mental health related EMS events.” \nDespite some of the positive findings, AHS’ report found “there was no significant difference made on the number of events that resulted in transportation to a medical facility.” It also found there was no significant change in the frequency of traumatic injuries suffered by residents from before they moved in compared with afterwards. However, AHS said previously those traumatic injuries were more likely to include gunshots and stab wounds but after residents moved in to the facility, any injuries were more consistent with trip- and fall-related injuries. \nThe report found that “access to culturally-appropriate services and staff who provide residents with patient-centered care improves residents’ mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health.” \nREAD MORE: Homeless piano man now off Edmonton streets \nWatch below: In March 2015, Ryan Arcand played the piano at his new home after getting off the streets. \nAmbrose Place, a partnership between AHS and Niginan Housing Ventures, sees residents supported by a combination of indigenous elders, health workers, independent-living workers, social workers and addiction counsellors. According to AHS, the supportive housing approach sees workers meet residents where they are at to try and improve their health and well-being. They also say workers deal with residents “in a non-judgmental and gradual fashion.” \nAmbrose Place operates as a supportive housing unit that tries to help its residents reduce their use of alcohol and drugs and manage their addictions at home. \nAHS said its most pressing concerns for the facility’s residents before they moved in were related to substance abuse: overdoses, psychiatric disorders, withdrawal symptoms and public intoxication. \nAccording to AHS, Ambrose Place will now undergo a more qualitative review of its performance. The data for that will be collected through sharing circles led by residents. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
