He has the perfect physique for a front man and can resist a strong challenge.\nIn the first half of a recent game he competed well against a tall, imposing central defender. As the game progressed, his timing improved and he stopped the centre backs clearing properly. He was isolated as his team were forced back, but still a danger. He looks a finisher, thudding a shot against the bar after a brilliant twist and turn.\nHe shows determination and I was impressed when, after taking a heavy knock, he staggered back on, becoming a threat again. It's a strong character trait. He has scored 21 goals in 30 appearances for Sweden's junior teams.\nThe Swedish-born striker has played in the EFL Cup for the Black Cats this season\nWHAT DOES HE NEED?\nHis hold-up play was not overly tested but, when challenged with the ball played to his feet, he only retained the ball 50 per cent of the time.\nThe few crosses played into him were not accurate enough to show his heading qualities.\nPrimarily, he needs the confidence of boss David Moyes. Sunderland are in a relegation battle and, while Asoro is inexperienced, he has something about him. Why not throw him in? He could play without fear.\nHis pace can surprise defenders and he can share some of the front-line duties with Defoe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:28:06.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
