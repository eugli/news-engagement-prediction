Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Updated: February 14, 2017 7:09 am Sasikala at the Chennai resort Monday where AIADMK MLAs have been camping for four days. PTI photo \nCareful not to criticise Governor C Vidyasagar Rao over the delay in administering her the oath of office, AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala hit out Monday at caretaker Chief Minister and rebel O Panneerselvam , accusing him of being in league with arch rival DMK. On her way to the Golden Bay Resorts in Kuvathur, where her party MLAs have been camping for the last four days, Sasikala spoke to a few reporters, including The Indian Express: \nDo you think the Governor is biased against you? \nLet us wait for some more time. Why jump to conclusions. \nWhy do you think the Governor has not invited you despite your claim of majority (support)? \nWe don’t know the reason. We are waiting. \nDo you think the Centre has a role in this? \nYes, many people are saying that. \nSo why the hurry to become Chief Minister when the (disproportionate assets) case is pending before the Supreme Court? \nThe case has nothing to with it. But when (DMK leader) Duraimurugan made that remark — that DMK will support Panneerselvam for four years if he requires support — Panneerselvam could have stood up and replied that we are a majority government. But he didn’t do that. That incident triggered suspicion. \nDo you think the case may be the reason for the delay (in swearing-in)? \nThe case has nothing to do with this delay. \nThere is anger (among the cadres)… Who exactly is the political heir of J Jayalalithaa ? What do you think? \nWhat matters most to me is to continue whatever Amma did. I am doing that. People will support us. \nDo you feel you are being targeted? \nOpposition parties are instigating protests against us. Because I am a woman in politics, that is why I am being targeted like this. \nWill you ask your partymen to stop attacking journalists? They attacked some last night. \nI don’t know about that. It should not have happened. In our party, Amma was particular that we should have military discipline. So we will not do such things. Some miscreants may have done it. \nIn this crisis, what role is your family playing in supporting you? \nSasikala did not answer the question. She simply rolled up the car window.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:09:57.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
