They are accusations meant to instill in the listener a sense of danger, provoking an existential fear of the president of the United States. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \nNow why would someone want to do that? And what could possibly be the result of creating that toxic environment? \nReagan was painted as both an existential threat and a bumpkin. Some did call him a Hitler, as Bruce recalls. Others called him ‘Ronald Ray-gun’ pushing nuclear weapons and a war against the Soviet Union to blow up the world. At the same time, he was constantly drawn as dumb by the smart set, incapable of intellectual thought. \nAs Bruce notes, if you paint someone as an existential threat, what is the natural result of such thought? \n90 days after he was elected, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley, trying to impress Jodie Foster. There was nothing that Foster did to suggest that she would want any harm to Reagan. But clearly a good part of the Hollywood community did view Reagan as an evil/doltish threat. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nBruce sees the same “drumbeat” going against Trump. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nSo far, the drumbeat against Trump is virtually identical. In the middle of the campaign, The Washington Post delivered an editorial titled, “Donald Trump is a unique threat to American democracy.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nThe usual Hitler-fascist accusations are a daily narrative. Within the last two weeks, Democratic legislators started openly suggesting the president is mentally ill. The Hill reports, “A growing number of Democrats are openly questioning President Trump’s mental health. …. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., during a weekend interview with CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ said that ‘a few’ Republican colleagues have expressed concern to him about Trump’s mental health.” \nBut he’s both a dolt and an evil genius, just like Reagan. Plus, maybe even syphilis! \nNPR also decided to get into the act just a few days ago with an article that mused, “At 70, Trump is the oldest American president to ever take office. Couple his age with a family history of dementia. …” Yeah, subtle. \nSo on one hand, he’s a Machiavellian traitor cohort of Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the other, he’s a guy who is mentally ill. Oh, heck, let’s make it both. The New Republic, a leftist rag, chimed in with its obscene suggestion that the president is possibly suffering from an undiagnosed case of syphilis. Because … why not? \nNicholas Kristof posts a headline like this in the New York Times on February 18. \nLast week, a middle-school student was arrested for throwing a wooden block that hit the presidential motorcade in Florida. He fingered 4 other friends who were with him as well. \nCriticism is one thing and have at it. \nBut, as Bruce says, where are the people trying to tamp down the violent and suggestive rhetoric? \nThey’re not trying to tamp anything down, rather they are ratcheting it up. \nJust yesterday, Hillary Clinton encouraged people to continue the “resistance with persistence” despite ‘resistance’ translating to riots, threats and assaults. \nWhere such ratcheting up can lead is a danger to us all… LIKE this article?
