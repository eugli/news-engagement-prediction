The SC ruling implies that Sasikala is now barred from contesting an election for the next ten years. \nHere are some quick reactions:- \nAIADMK quotes Sasikala \n-In the past whenever 'Amma' was in crisis, I also suffered this time also, I will take it upon me. 'Dharma' will win. \nVenkaiah Naidu, BJP \nSC verdict out today. Need of the hour is to enable an able and stable government in Tamil Nadu as per the wishes of the people of State. \nSubramanian Swamy, BJP \n-I was expecting the conviction. I don't think she can escape the 4 years sentence. \nMK Stalin, DMK \n-After 21 years justice has finally prevailed. \nTamilan Prasanna, DMK \n-This is a great success for Tamil Nadu people. It is a victory of truth and judicial system. \nBV Acharya, former Chief Public Prosecutor \n-I am not surprised by the judgement: \nSoli Sorabjee \nThere is no split verdict by Supreme Court, she can't possibly be CM; She will have to serve the sentence. \nRS Surjewala, Congress \nGovernor whose role has been circumspect, must call special assembly session and both AIADMK factions for way forward.
