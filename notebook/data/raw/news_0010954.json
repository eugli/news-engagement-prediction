King Rodriguez/PPD MANILA, Philippines — South Korea expects the Philippines to provide swift justice to the family of Jee Ick-joo, the businessman who was kidnapped and killed by anti-drug operatives. The message was relayed by South Korea Prime Minister and Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn during his meeting with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo last February 3. President Rodrigo Duterte sent Panelo to South Korea to apologize for Jee’s death, an incident that prodded the Philippine National Police (PNP) to cleanse its ranks of scalawags. “I personally conveyed, on behalf of President Duterte, the profound and sincerest Philippine Government's apology to the Korean government and the Korean people for the dastardly crime committed against the Korean national Mr. Jee Ick-joo by what appears to be suspected police scalawags,” Panelo told reporters Monday in Malacañan. “Prime Minister Hwang accepted my offer of apology on behalf of the Philippine government, and noted that President Duterte apologized as well to the widow of Mr. Jee Ick-joo,” he added. “Aside from declaring his optimism that the incident shall deter the commission of similar crimes against Korean nationals in the Philippines, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also expressed his expectation that swift justice will be delivered to the family of Mr. Jee Ick-joo.” Panelo said he also relayed to Hwang the government’s “commitment and strongest assurance” that it would prosecute to the fullest extent of laws the persons behind Jee’s death. “I also told him that our countrymen share in their sorrow and grieve over the brutal slaying of their countryman and expressed regrets for its occurrence,” he said. The presidential legal adviser also assured Hwang that the Philippine government would continue to go after criminals who target South Koreans. Witnesses said Jee was kidnapped by members of the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group in Angeles, Pampanga on Oct. 18, 2016. He was reportedly strangled to death inside Camp Crame, the main headquarters of the PNP. The businessman’s body was then cremated in a funeral parlor, his ashes flushed down a toilet, according to witnesses. The kidnappers then made it appear that Jee was still alive and demanded P5 million ransom from his wife. Duterte has ordered the abolition of all anti-drug units of the PNP and has directed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the military to undertake the campaign against narcotics. Panelo said Hwang thanked him for conveying the Philippines’ apology and vowed to share Duterte’s message to the Korean people. “Prime Minister Hwang also requested I extend his gratitude and appreciation to President Duterte. We both concluded that the unfortunate death of Mr. Jee Ick-joo shall also serve as an opportunity to cultivate deeper relations between the Philippines and South Korea,” he said. Panelo also mentioned the “vibrant bilateral relations” between Manila and Seoul including the participation of Filipino troops during the Korean War and sending of South Korean professionals to areas hit by Typhoon Yolanda. “I also underscored to Prime Minister Hwang the honest character of the South Koreans by saying that I have heard several stories from my fellow Filipinos residing in South Korea that when they lose or misplace something in public, South Koreans, who find the same, will always find a way to return it to their owners,” Panelo said.
