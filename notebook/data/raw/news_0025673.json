Fightingfyt (@neetu54) on Dec 25, 2016 at 3:47am PST \nWhile Kapoor family get-togethers have always been the talk of the town, one wonders what dominates the clan conversation at these khandaani parties. “Booze, women, sex, dirty jokes… what else?” guffaws Randhir. “We don’t sulk and cry on each other’s shoulders. We don’t do any bitching or back-biting about other people in the fraternity. We’re not even concerned about what anyone else is doing in life. We’re so busy among ourselves – too busy to bother about others.” We don’t do any bitching or back-biting about other people in the fraternity. We’re not even concerned about what anyone else is doing in life \nAnd do they also talk about the next generation of Kapoors — their relationship status, marriage plans, films? Randhir says, “We’re like the stock exchange — we know everything that’s happening in the family. Since our kids are in the same profession, we all know how they’re placed. As a joke, maybe, we discuss their girlfriends, boyfriends, marriage etc, but not with an intention of interfering.” \nIn the Kapoor clan, he adds, “everyone is free to take their decisions in life. We’re very united, we’re together all the time – to eat, drink, and sing, but we don’t interfere in each other’s business.” \nAsked to recount a special birthday memory, Randhir gets emotional, saying, “All birthdays are good. You’re getting closer to death. You’re getting older. You can smile and laugh at it. It doesn’t have to be bad. We all have to go one day. So I just want God to bless me with good health.” \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:53.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
