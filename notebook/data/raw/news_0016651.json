'Is this real?': the farmers forced to defend their land against the Australian military Read more \nJoyce said he did not see the decision as “being a major detour from what we’re doing in any case” as properties bought by defence so far had all involved “a willing seller and a willing buyer”. \nBut the Queensland agriculture minister, Bill Byrne, a former commander at the Shoalwater Bay base in central Queensland slated for expansion, said it was a “humiliating climbdown” for federal MPs who had defended the plan. \nThis included Queensland senator and the minister for Northern Australia, Matt Canavan, who “even in the last few days, has been insisting that compulsory acquisitions were inevitable”, Byrne said. \n“It has been an extraordinary saga to get to this point and I have no doubt it would not have happened if it had not been for the determination of the graziers and the local community,” he said. \n“The sense of betrayal in Marlborough and Rockhampton was palpable and the political pressure we were able to exert proved irresistible.” \nThe decision followed lengthy talks in recent days between Joyce, the defence minister Marise Payne, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. \nTurnbull was last week asked to personally intervene by the Queensland Liberal National opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who panned the ADF’s handling of the issue. \nJoyce said that “obviously the major concern was people did not want their property purchased against their wishes”. \n“We’ve always prided ourselves on being a government that hears the concerns of people,” he said. \nThe position now was that “if you wish to sell you can. If you don’t wish to sell, that’s fine”. \nPayne said the ADF would continue to pursue deals with willing sellers around the Marlborough and Charters Towers districts, which have been slated for expanded training sites for 14,000 Singapore troops a year. \nThe government’s “masterplanning process” would be “finalised within a fortnight or so”, she said. \nGuardian Australia has been told the Queensland government is set to continue an investigation of the impact of the defence expansion plan on the beef supply chain, as it remains unclear how many properties within the state’s prime cattle country are now slated for acquisition. \nThe revelation of possible forced sales only after the federal election has placed significant local pressure on the local federal member, Capricornia MP Michelle Landry, who occupies one of the Coalition’s most marginal seats. \nLandry thanked Turnbull, Joyce and Payne for the outcome which she said was “a win for the whole community”. \n“It’s been a very controversial issue in my electorate obviously, and I’ve had a lot of upset farmers there,” she said. \nNicholls said it showed “the prime minister is prepared to listen and act in the best interests of Queenslanders”. \n“Following my phone call to the prime minister, I welcome his commitment today that farmers will not be forced to sell their land in central and north Queensland to the defence department,” he said. \nByrne said the federal government had been “dragged kicking and screaming to the right conclusion” after political pressure that began with state Mirani MP Jim Pearce “highlighting the plight of the graziers”. \n“There are still a number of very difficult questions for the Coalition to answer today about the shonky process and the anguish they have inflicted,” he said. \n“The people of Capricornia in particular know they were misled at the federal election and they will not forget that key details of the Singapore deal were deliberately hidden from them.” \nThe state MP for Keppel, Brittany Lauga, said the government had been “shamed” into a backflip by “people power”, including a protest rally of 400 in Rockhampton last week. \nLauga said the Turnbull government had “caused incredible stress and heartache to the people in the Marlborough district by declaring he was taking their homes and livelihood without any consultation”. \nNearly 50 properties in the region, representing 170,000 hectares of land holding 100,000 cattle, had been in the firing line, she said. \nLauga said landholders who wished to sell their properties would now be in a stronger negotiating position without the threat of force sales hanging over their heads. \n“They can take it or leave it,” she told Guardian Australia.
