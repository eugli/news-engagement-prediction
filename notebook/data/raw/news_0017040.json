Politics is amazing.” \nBut Obama wasn’t the sole subject that O’Reilly and Trump covered in their interview. \nThey also talked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. O’Reilly called Putin a “killer” at one point. \n“What do you think? Our country’s so innocent?” Trump responded. \nThe U.S. president then explained the respect he has for Putin. \n“I respect a lot people but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him,” he said. \n“He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world – that’s a good thing.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
