PAUL, Minn. â€” Minnesota could take the first step toward erasing the state's ban on Sunday liquor sales.\nThe House was expected to vote Monday on a bill that would allow liquor stores to open on Sundays. It's a perennial issue at the Capitol that consumes plenty of attention but has never moved forward.\nHouse Speaker Kurt Daudt says he expects it to easily pass, citing a growing appetite among Minnesota residents to repeal the old Prohibition-era law. But the real hurdle is in the Senate, where more lawmakers still favor the ban.\nJust a vote on the House floor is a sign of massive change at the Capitol. Previous efforts have only cropped up as amendments to bigger bills. Those votes have generally failed by wide margins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:51:57.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
