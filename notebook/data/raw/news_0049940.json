But the second she saw West Elm's reclaimed wood buffet , she knew she could refresh this basic piece into a showstopperâ€”and save over $1,100 in the process. (Image credit: Aniko Levai ) \nAniko got the wood for free from a local business, and spent $17 on stain and lacquer. That's a pretty hefty savings! \nCheck out her blog, A Place of My Taste , for more photos and a tutorial on how she made the oversized art that hangs above her new buffet. \nThank you, Aniko!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:12:50.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
