Carolyn Kaster/AP Michael Flynn resigned on Sunday night The Times now reports that intercepted phone calls show the Russians made contact with Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Trump’s campaign chairman. In late August, Manafort resigned from that job after disclosures by The Associated Press about his firm’s covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine’s former pro-Russia governing party. Current and former US officials interviewed by the Times declined to identify other Trump associates contacted by the Russians. The anonymous officials told the Times they found no evidence that the Trump campaign was working with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election, reports the Associated Press. This is what longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone—who the FBI has investigated for potential ties to Russia—said on October 2nd. https://t.co/bTgstGXPex — Matt O'Brien (@ObsoleteDogma) February 15, 2017 Wednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks . — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 2, 2016 Questions have also been raised about when Trump was informed of the call that led to Flynn’s resignation with White House officials saying he knew just six days into his presidency, yet still backed him despite Flynn being at risk of blackmail from the Kremlin. Carolyn Kaster/AP Kellyanne Conway during a TV interview earlier this week. The FBI continues to sift through call logs and intercepted communications links between Trump’s associates and the Russian government, as well as the hacking of the Democratic National Committee which led to the leak of emails damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. . @SenJeffMerkley : \"It's very possible\" Donald #Trump is hiding something re: Russia https://t.co/uqZR7b9UJC https://t.co/VDdSAYvaAm — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) February 15, 2017 In an interview on Tuesday, Trump advisor, Kellyanne Conway , said it was the misleading of the Vice President and not that actual call that led to Flynn’s resignation. This appeared to imply the national security advisor would have kept his job had he not stood down, simply because the President is “extremely loyal”. — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 14, 2017 \nThe second scandal involves Conway herself as the US government’s ethics watchdog urged the White House to investigate and possibly discipline her for comments she made about Ivanka Trump’s fashion line. \nThe Office of Government Ethics wrote to White House attorneys that there was reason to believe that Conway violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive employees by endorsing the president’s daughter’s products during a television interview last week. \nAppearing from the White House briefing room, Conway urged viewers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff” before adding that she was going to “give a free commercial here. Go buy it today everybody, you can find it online”. \nThe White House shakeup marks another jarring setback for a new administration already dealing with tensions among top aides and a legal fight over the president’s travel ban order. Yuri Gripas / Reuters Trump in the Oval Office. \nFlynn’s firing also heightened questions about the President’s friendly posture toward Russia. Democrats called for investigations into Flynn’s contacts, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Congress needed to know whether he had been acting with direction from the president or others. \nTrump initially thought Flynn could survive the controversy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the president’s views, but a pair of explosive stories in The Washington Post in recent days made the situation untenable. \nAs early as last week, he and aides began making contingency plans for Flynn’s dismissal, a senior administration official said. While the president was said to be upset with Flynn, he also expressed anger with other aides for “losing control” of the story and making his young administration look bad.
