The invitation to former vice health minister Huang Jiefu to the conference comes as the Holy See bids to improve relations with the Asian giant, long stalled over conflicts about who should control the Catholic church in China. Beijing issued its first regulation banning the trade of organs in 2007, but trafficking remains common as the country suffers a drastic shortage of donated body parts. The practice of using executed prisoners’ organs for transplants was also banned in 2015, but some international medical groups suspect prisoners may be reclassified as voluntary donors to get around the rules. Huang previously admitted that China did use the organs of convicts for transplants before the country had a public donation system in 2010, but has since insisted this is no longer the case. “This is the first time that China is invited to a summit on organ transplanting held by an authoritative international organisation,” Huang was quoted by the Global Times as saying on Monday. Francis Delmonico, a surgeon and academician of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, told the paper the Vatican’s invitation was because Beijing had shown greater willingness to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on organ donation. But it also comes as the two powers seek to boost relations as China’s Catholic population grows. Beijing and the Holy See have not had diplomatic ties since 1951 and remain at odds over which side has the authority to appoint senior clergy. China’s ratio of public organ donations is 0.6 to 100,000 people, one of the lowest in the world, Huang told a meeting in 2014 according to the Global Times. Earlier this month, 16 people, including two surgeons, were given prison sentences of up to five years for involvement in a vast illegal trade in kidneys, the official Xinhua news agency said.
