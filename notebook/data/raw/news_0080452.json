Article continues below \nSince the heavy 4-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, they have lost just one game - the second leg of the EFL Cup semi-final against Hull. \nNevertheless, former captain, Roy Keane is not totally convinced by the progress made with Mourinho this season. Article continues below Roy Keane names the PL player he would 'love' to see join Man Utd \nKeane was speaking at a fundraising event before the EFL Cup final and thinks that a favourable run of games has made United's form deceiving. \n\"I’ve very little time for Mourinho. I look at United and the run they’re on now,\" Keane said, as per The Mirror . \n\"They're sixth in the league. People are like, 'I can see progress' - [but] they're sixth in the league. They've beaten no one in three months. \n\"I judge United on the big games. Chelsea and one or two others are coming up now. If you want to play for United and be successful they are the games you have to be winning.\" \nOf the current top six, Man United have played Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool since the loss to Chelsea - picking up two draws and a win. \nAlthough they are unbeaten, Mourinho will undoubtedly have preferred to pick up three points against each of those sides to help their pursuit of a place in the top four. \nBut between now and the end of the season, the Red Devils face all of the top four so could still prove Keane wrong. \nThe ex-midfielder also revealed that he would like to see Seamus Coleman move to Old Trafford. \nKeane, now Martin O'Neill's assistant for Ireland, believes the Everton full-back would slot straight into the setup at his old club. \nHe added: \"I'd love to see Seamus at Man United. It would suit him down to the ground. \n\"Obviously, he's at a very good club in Everton. He isn't getting any younger. \n\"From a selfish point of view, from an Irish point of view, you want players like Seamus playing in the Champions League and getting a taste of football at that level. \n\"Saying that, joining United might not mean Champions League at this moment in time.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
