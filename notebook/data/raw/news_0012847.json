Mrs Clinton was unable to move past the perception that something suspicious was going on inside her private email server. Lady Gaga couldn’t get anyone beyond her hardcore devotees excited about her new authentic incarnation. Not even her most blindly devoted followers could deny that their deity went into the Super Bowl 51 half-time show in the uncharacteristic position of underdog . \nLast year, Beyonce released the Formation video the Saturday before her halftime show. By the time she took the stage the following day, a sizable percentage of the 112 million viewership already had an opinion, pro-or-anti, about the song, the images in the video and the performer. Lady Gaga, by contrast, was coming back from an album that might as well not have existed. — The FADER (@thefader) 6 February 2017 \nT here were anticipatory rumblings that, just as Beyonce’s dancers gave black power salutes last year , Gaga would use her massive platform and captive audience to make a similar statement about America’s current regime . As it turned out, she did something much safer but ultimately much smarter. She reminded the watching millions why they liked her. \nRelying on her first two career-igniting albums, The Fame and Born This Way, rather than her subsequent pair of momentum-halting ones, Gaga descended from the roof of Houston’s NRG stadium— where she warbled a heartfelt God Bless America— swinging and somersaulting on a harness like a panto Peter Pan while belting out Poker Face. . @LadyGaga kicks off her #SB51 halftime show with 'This Land Is Your Land.' pic.twitter.com/UrvVbni6hs — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) 6 February 2017 \nS he tore through Born This Way and Telephone, before strapping on the keytar for Just Dance. These songs aren’t classics from a distant bygone era, but Gaga’s lengthy, frustrating hiatus from being entertaining imbued her handful of formative hits with the thrill of rediscovery. \nEven when she sat down at the piano and launched into Million Reasons, one of the few memorable songs from the quick-to evaporate Joanne album, it was hard to feel resentment at her for slipping a comparative misfire inbetween her wall-to-wall hits.

But that’s what happened to Lady Gaga over the past half-decade. Lady Gaga in pictures \nA rtpop was filled with half-baked ideas. Her escape into American Horror Story and her two jazz duet albums with Tony Bennett and the largely dreary Joanne combined to diminish the memory of what made Lady Gaga special in the first place. \nThis Super Bowl performance was a spectacular reminder. It’s hard not to imagine millions of one-time fans firing up the hits she played at the Super Bowl and wishing she’d come up with a few new songs with similar impact.
