News 23 Feb 2017, 21:22 IST We wish Naomi a speedy recovery What’s the story? \nAccording to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter , Naomi injured her left knee when she performed the Split-Legged Moonsault near the end of her Elimination Chamber match against Alexa Bliss. \nIt was also noted that the injury is similar to the one Rollins suffered. While WWE has not revealed the details of her return, GM Daniel Bryan suggested that Naomi could be out of action for a minimum of 30 days. In case you didn’t know.. \nIn case you missed the last episode of SmackDown Live, Alexa Bliss became the champion for the second time after she defeated Becky Lynch, albeit with a little help from Mickie James. \nCheck out the highlights of the title match, as it happened: The heart of the matter \nAs noted on the latest episode of SmackDown Live, Naomi was forced to relinquish her SmackDown Women’s Championship as she was unable to defend it, due to the injury she suffered during her Elimination Chamber match against Alexa Bliss. \nHere is a video of Naomi relinquishing her title: What’s next? \nAt this moment it is still unknown whether Naomi would recover in time for Wrestlemania. As far as SmackDown Women’s title is concerned, it looks like Bliss and Lynch would renew their rivalry. Allwrestlingnews has suggested that Tamia could also be thrown in the title picture. Sportskeeda’s take \nAfter Finn Balor, another Superstar’s rise to the top came to an abrupt stop end due to the unfortunate injury. On the other hand, SmackDown's plans in relation to the Women's division are in jeopardy as renewing the Bliss-Lynch rivalry is not ideal, considering that Lynch is already in a programming with Mickie James. \nTamina’s return could sort their vows, but for now, things don’t look good for the blue brand. As for Naomi, we wish her a speedy recovery and hope that the injury does not hinder her momentum. \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:27:22.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
