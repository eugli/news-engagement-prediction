That was 3.3% above an upwardly-revised 5.51 million in December and 3.8% higher than a year ago.\nEconomists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a 5.55 million rate in January.\nThere were 3.6 months’ worth of homes available for sale in January, the 20th consecutive month in which inventory declined on a yearly basis. Homes available for sale declined 7.1% compared to a year ago – even as prices spiked 7.1% higher. The median price was $228,900.\nMost regions had sales increases in January. The one exception was in the Midwest, where sales dropped 1.5%.\nStrong sales in the face of challenging headwinds shows consumers’ “tremendous resilience” and desire for homeownership, said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.\nBut Yun said he was “very disappointed” with the recent Fannie Mae decision to securitize Wall Street investor purchases of single-family homes for rental.
