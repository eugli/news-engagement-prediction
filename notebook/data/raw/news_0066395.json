Will MCA be objecting to amendments to Act 355 - yes or no? \nWhat does, \"MCA has no plan whatsoever to interfere in issues relating to Islam, including the proposed amendments to the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965 (Act 355)\" mean? \nFellowMalaysian: Ong, your president Liow Tiong Lai and deputy president Wee Ka Siong have solemnly declared they will resign from their high, noble positions as ministers if PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang's amendments are passed in Parliament next session. Just a gentle reminder. \nHeadhunter: These MCA leaders are running away when they should be standing their ground. Didn't they brag earlier that they will vehemently object to the implementation of hudud? \nCQ Muar: Ong, can you assure us this won't affect non-Muslims in the future should Act 355 be amended? \nPAS, under the leadership of Hadi, is now apparently in harmony with Umno. Both are making use of each other to pursue their respective interests. \nIt is accepted you should not interfere in Islamic affairs, but MCA should firmly voice its stand regarding syariah law being amended in view of the impending impact on others. \nExcept those in PAS and those hypocrites in Umno, the majority are vehemently against this bill. If MCA is concerned about the Chinese, you need to firmly protest and not be afraid to defy your political master or masters, Ong. \nMCA keeps declining in the eyes of the Chinese after nearly six decades, hence you should salvage your image this time around. Otherwise your party is as good as dead and gone. \nNo-Brainer: Ong and all MCA leaders, what interference are you talking about? First of all, whether you interfere or not doesn't make any difference. \nIt is not a big deal as Umno doesn't even want to discuss anything concerning the Act 355 amendments with you because you're nothing in the eyes of Umno leaders. \nSo, your interference on this hudud affair makes no difference because you can't even bark. Also, they know you are a traitor to the Chinese community because you have sold your souls to them for the ministerial posts and other financial benefits. \nOng and all MCA leaders, you are a disgrace and a shame. \nDavid Dass: Yes, what a disgraceful position to take. They merely voiced their opinion. To what purpose? \nThe failure of leadership has brought us to the sad state where almost 100 percent of my Chinese friends say they see no future in Malaysia and are asking their children to leave. \nMacMac: Only DAP has been portrayed as anti-Islam for opposing the Act 355 amendments while MCA, MIC and Gerakan are sweet-toothed in their opposition. What a bunch of gutless leaders they have in these three parties. \nThere are more brave Muslims who oppose Hadi's bill than these bunch who call themselves leaders. \nGuyintheglass: Ong, you are an MP and a minister. Do you represent only the Chinese or everyone in your constituency? \nAnd are you an MP dealing with all issues in Parliament or just those that do not touch on religion? I suggest you and your party step aside if you do not know your role. \nRupert16: Let's see how MCA MPs will vote on the ‘hudud’ bill. I bet these ‘dedak’ eating MPs will most likely abstain from voting and their excuse would be, \"We don't want to interfere.\" \nPAS' unlikely ally in promoting understanding of hudud \nGoldee: Malaysia is a multicultural society and we can't have two sets of laws governing the country for different sets of people for the same offence. \nPAS and some Umno leaders who support hudud laws are deceiving the people by claiming that these laws do not apply to the non-Muslims. \nIf so, why do the religious bodies raid unisex saloons, impose non-halal food restrictions in certain eateries, raid hardware shops and stationery shops for selling brushes of porcine bristles? \nIs this not a form of encroachment and enforcement of Islamic values on the non-Muslims? \nDavid Dass: Non-Muslims cannot take the view that if it applies only to Muslims, it should not concern non-Muslims. We are Malaysians and must speak for all Malaysians. \nIf Muslims adopt the attitude that if unjust laws do not affect Muslims they should not bother, then we are all in trouble. Creating a parallel criminal law system is a step in the wrong direction. It cannot work. \nIt will create the perception of Muslims being treated unfairly as these proposed punishments are harsh. It is unconstitutional. \nDemi Rakyat: If this ‘forum on hudud’ is a discussion, why are there no persons on the opposing view on the panel? Ex-Gerakan leader Ronnie Ooi is just organising a platform for PAS' propaganda. \nDon't be duped by attending a purely PAS event. \nOMG!: Every conflict in history produces collaborators. Collaborators work for the winning side or whomever they think is stronger, in order to get benefits for themselves. \nA forum is a public space for open discussion. It remains to be seen how open this discussion will be. \nWhy don't they invite Party Amanah Negara to send representatives to have a vigorous discussion \"with the other side\"? With the present setup, Ooi is going to be seen, with justification, as a PAS collaborator. \nAnonymous #19098644: This matter and all the facts have been debated before, written and discussed so many times. What else is different or new that can come out of this forum? \nYou either support the federal constitution and take the stand that all Malaysians are equal under the law, or you don't. \nYou can't have one set of laws for one segment of society and another set of laws for another set of society. Provisions for religious laws has already been made on family matters, but not so much criminal laws. \nMosquitobrain: Ooi, can you get PAS to talk on 1MDB, the RM2.6 billion donation and PAS' alleged RM90 million windfall as well. We too, have many questions to ask on these matters. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
