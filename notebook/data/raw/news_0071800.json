The pope didn't mention Trump in his tweets, but his reminders that the Bible preaches acceptance for immigrants and foreigners were unmistakably inspired by recent events.\n\"The throwaway culture is not of Jesus,\" the pope wrote on Feb. 15. \"The other is my brother, beyond every barrier of nationality, social extraction or religion.\"\nThe throwaway culture is not of Jesus.

That means you must also love immigrants because you were immigrants in Egypt.\"\nLater, God reminds , \"Don't obstruct the legal rights of an immigrant or orphan.\" and goes on to emphasize , \"Cursed is anyone who obstructs the legal rights of immigrants, orphans, or widows.\"\nIf God is indeed all-powerful and all-knowing, the Bible just may be the original subtweet.", "external_links": ["https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/831843001412358144&quot;", "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+27%3A19&version=CEB", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/831843001412358144", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/834379729373380609", "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+24%3A17-18&version=CEB", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/832930172579876866&quot;", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/834379729373380609&quot;", "https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/832930172579876866", "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2010:17-19&version=CEB"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:50:21.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
