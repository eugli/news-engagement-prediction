I'm an avid Starbucks People Watcher and Professional Wingman who spends every day just trying to make 'em laugh (Singing in the Rain reference). Want more? I was born and raised in a small suburb northwest of Chicago (Bartlett). I'm the type of guy who breaks the awkward silence in an elevator just to make it more awkward and I LOVE music. I'm dancing or making weird sounds 98% of the time, live FIRMLY by the idea of living each and every moment as if it's your last....OH and I'm currently learning to fly a plane, so....ya know...might be a good idea to keep your head up and watch out.Keep in touch!
