(Oli Scarff/Getty Images/File) \nIn a break from its 700-year-long history, the UK’s University of Oxford is considering opening its first-ever foreign campus in France in order to continue receiving EU funding post-Brexit, a media report said on Monday. \nOne of the world’s oldest and best-known educational institution is reportedly considering the plans as a direct result of Britain’s referendum in favour of an exit from the European Union (EU), which could impact EU funding. \nOxford University has been told that any campus opened in France could have French legal status and would continue to receive EU funding following Brexit, ‘The Daily Telegraph’ reported.

To have high quality institutions from the UK working in our territory, interacting together in terms of research and collaboration,” Blanquer told the newspaper. \nLast month, Oxford University’s head of Brexit strategy Professor Alastair Buchan said: “We have got to be absolutely sure we are open. Every student and every staff member that comes to Oxford is a benefit for this country because we recruit quality, people that play in the top league.” \nA spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Britain is home to some of the world’s best Universities and research institutions and the plan is to secure the best possible outcome for the UK’s research base after Brexit. \n“We have already taken steps to provide assurances by committing to underwrite Horizon 2020 grants bid for prior to the UK’s departure from the EU and put science and research at the heart of our Industrial Strategy with an extra 2- billion-pound investment per year – and will seek agreement to continue to collaborate with our European partners on major science, research and technology initiatives,” the spokesperson said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:14.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
