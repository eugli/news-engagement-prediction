Susan Tompor , Detroit Free Press Personal Finance Columnist 11:45 p.m. ET Feb. 22, 2017 Many younger consumers take out 401(k) loans for home repairs or emergencies or to pay off credit card debt. But it can be a costly move, especially if you're looking to change jobs soon. Millennials on the go often are juggling student loan debt, credit card debt and even 401(k) loans. (Photo: Susan Tompor) Story Highlights About 8% of millennials in Fidelity-administered 401(k)s have taken a loan in the last 12 months. The average loan for the millennials from Fidelity-administered 401(k) plans was $5,300. See the Smart About Money site at www.smartaboutmoney.org for tools, tips and calculators. CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMillennials could be risking their financial future as they craft ways to tackle their student loans, car payments and credit card debt. \nNew research indicates that many are overusing credit cards, racking up fees with late payments or overdrawing checking accounts and in some cases even taking loans against 401(k) plans. \nWhat's worse: Millennials may have less wiggle room for financial mistakes. In many cases, millennials could be earning about 20% less than their parents did when they were in the 25- to 34-year-old age range, according to a generational comparison by the nonprofit the Young Invincibles. \nMillennials — defined for this study as those who are ages 23 to 35 — may be experiencing a disconnect with their money, according to new research funded by the National Endowment for Financial Education and conducted by George Washington University. \nMore than 70% have at least one long-term debt — be it a student loan, home mortgage, car loan. And 34% of millennials are juggling two or more loans. \nYet many millennials are taking on extra costs and risks as they juggle the bills. A quarter of those with checking accounts, for example, had overdrawn their account in the prior 12 months, according to the survey for the National Endowment for Financial Education. \nAbout 23% of those with a self-directed retirement account either took a loan or made a hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) plan or other self-directed retirement account in the prior 12 months, according to the survey for the National Endowment for Financial Education. \nHaving confidence about dealing with your cash doesn't equate to knowing the right moves to make when juggling debt or getting socked with an economic shock, such as an costly car repair or job loss. \nSo what are some practical moves that millennials can make? Here are three thoughts: \n• Re-examine how you're tackling your student loan debt. \nMany millennials won't likely pay off their student loans entirely before settling down to buy a home. So how do you pull off qualifying for a mortgage while juggling student loans? \nSome experts advise that if you're shopping for a mortgage and have a lot of student loans, you might consider switching to an income-driven repayment plan for federal student loans to make sure you have enough cash to make the monthly mortgage payments. \nA federal income-driven repayment plan — there are four different types of such plans — initially will reduce your monthly payment to take into account your income and family size. You're stretching payments out 20 years or 25 years, depending on the plan. \nWhile it's an appealing idea to try to slash that monthly student loan payment, remember there are extra costs. In general, the longer you turn to such safety nets, the longer you build interest debt. \nKatie Bossler, a counselor for GreenPath Financial Wellness, said it may not be easy to come up with $300 or $350 a month to pay off $30,000 in college loans in 10 years with a standard repayment plan. \nBut Bossler noted that you could save thousands of dollars in the long run by opting for a 10-year standard payment plan for federal student loans. \nMillennials, she said, are better off if they avoid basing a decision on a short-term fix that isn’t financially healthy for the long term. \nHowever, an income-driven repayment plan can help you make sure that you don't become delinquent or default. The remaining balance on an income-driven repayment plan is cancelled after 20 years or 25 years in repayment, depending on the plan. Some borrowers will have paid off their debts before hitting that year mark. (Note: The dollar amount of the loan that is forgiven after 20 years or 25 years in repayment is taxable under current law.) \nOther strategies might be worth considering. \nA small percentage of employers — less than 5% based on some estimates — offer their employees help with repaying student loans, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of strategy for Cappex.com . \nSome companies might match the employee’s monthly loan payment, up to a monthly or annual limit. \nFidelity Investments rolled out its Step Ahead student loan assistance program in early 2016 for employees with more than six months on the job. The employees can receive $2,000 a year toward their student loans up to $10,000. More than 6,000 Fidelity associates have already enrolled. \nKantrowitz said these types of loan repayment assistance programs would represent taxable income under current law. At some point, advocates say that may change. \nCollege grads also should review the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives remaining debt after 10 years of making payments while working full time in a government or nonprofit job. The debt forgiven under Public Service Loan Forgiveness is tax-free under current law. \n• Save $10 a week or more for an emergency fund — emphasis on emergencies. \nOften, millennials — and those in the Gen X and Baby Boom generations — take out a loan from a 401(k) to pay off credit debt or for home repairs, according to research from Fidelity Investments. \n\"Most people aren't using them for a vacation or big-screen TV,\" said Meghan Murphy, director for Fidelity Investments. \nThey treat a 401(k) as an emergency fund, which it is not. \nFidelity's numbers show that about 8% of millennials participating in Fidelity-administered plans have taken a loan from their 401(k)s within the last 12 months. The average loan for the millennials: $5,300. \nTypically, Fidelity sees even more loan activity with Generation Xers in the 40-to-45 age group. \n\"When a lot starts to happen in life, we see peak loan usage,\" Murphy said. \nMurphy said some people don't realize that the money must be paid back if they lose their jobs or take a job at another company. The rules vary by 401(k) plans, but the pay back time might be 30 days to 90 days. \nTo be sure, the rate on a 401(k) loan might sound attractive — possibly the prime rate plus 1% or the prime rate plus 2%. But you're losing some tax benefits and the opportunity to make money by having that money fully invested. \n\"We're seeing employers put restrictions in place to help money stay in the plan,\" Murphy said. \nSome employers are limiting the number of loans that can be taken out, Murphy said. \nTo be sure, a consumer can recover after taking out a small 401(k) loan, she said. But a cycle of 401(k) loans over one's working years will hurt a retirement nest egg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:04:47.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
