The Hampton, Va. standout chose Florida over Tennessee one day before National Signing Day.\nIN HIS OWN WORDSâ€¦\n\"I really love Florida and my mom loves Florida,\" Conliffe said. \"It's a great staff and they have a great campus. It's a really good place.\n\"I felt really comfortable with the players and being around everything,\" he said. \"I feel pretty close with Kyree Campbell , my host for my official visit.\n\"Coach Mac ( Jim McElwain ), coach Chris Rumph , and all the coaches will help me become the best player I can be,\" said Conliffe. \"They'll coach me hard.\"\nRIVALS' REACTION\nConliffe is a big lineman with good athleticism and impressive power. He makes a surprising number of plays in the backfield and he's able to change directions quickly for a player of his size. Once he gets on campus, he will have to reshape his body and get used to the speed of the game. Conliffe could see time in certain situations as a freshman, but he will be an important player for Florida down the road.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/sxxa05kayoarabuv0lce", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/sxxa05kayoarabuv0lce)"], "published": "2017-02-01T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:49:07.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
