(Jacob Barker/CBC)\nThe temporary workers were initially brought on to alleviate fatigue, and to help fill shifts that some employees said they were being forced to work.\nIt was also meant to reduce the number of outside contractors the company was using on site.\n\"The only thing is our members are still quite sour about how they've been treated on the floor,\" Thomas said.\n\"I know we have new management now and [it] has talked about a good relationship, but our members are still quite sour and I don't know how the vote's going to go.\"\nIf members agree to the proposal, the union said the company has agreed to 60 new full-time hires but will also be able to continue to use the temporary workers, who receive fewer benefits.\nWorkers are voting on whether to allow IOC to continue to use a temporary workforce at the Labrador City mine. (Jacob Barker/CBC)\n\"It is beneficial when you look at [it]. We're going to get 60 full-time hires out of it and I hope our members will vote for it,\" Thomas said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:44:55.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
