The police protect us, and we’re going to protect the police.\" \nBut the Police Grant Report, slipped out during a House of Commons Brexit debate earlier this month, shows the core cash grants given to police forces will fall nearly £100m next year to £7.325bn. \nThere are extra pots of anti-terror cash, but core funds will only be protected if police forces hike council tax. Read More Tories quietly slash police fund after George Osborne promised 'no cuts at all' \nAnd once inflation is counted, shadow Home Office minister Carolyn Harris accused ministers of \"salami slicing... with real-term cuts of 2.7%\". \nMs Harris said of the Tories: \"They have broken their promise to Parliament that they would protect frontline policing. MPs heard ministers had \"broken their promise\" not to cut police budgets \n\"They have left police forces across the country without the money they need to keep our citizens safe from crime. \n\"With funding cut every single year there are now 21,000 fewer police officers than there were in 2010.\" \nShe added: \"They blithely promise Parliament that they will protect the frontline, just as they take away the cash that is needed to do so. \n\"They pass the buck to local taxation, even though the areas that need more resources are those with the least ability to raise funds. \n\"In the absence of any credible policy, the Government just keep cutting year after year in the hope it will all be okay. But it is not okay. \n\"The Government’s incompetence lets down the taxpayer. Their broken promises about further cuts to frontline services let down the public and are insulting to the hard-working and brave police officers right across this country.\" \nPolicing Minister Brandon Lewis rejected the claim. No cuts? Here are grants to police forces in England and Wales are in 2017/18... ... and here's what they were in 2016/17, courtesy of the government's own files \nThe Tory minister said: \"This funding settlement provides a fair and stable funding for the police that enables essential policing reform and transformation to go further and faster so that we make sure we are helping the vulnerable, we are cutting crime and supporting our communities.\" \nHe added: \"Last year we protected police spending when precept is taken into account and I am pleased to say that the 2017/18 police funding settlement maintains this protection for police spending.\" \nBut former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham warned the minister may have \"misled\" Parliament - because funds were not protected in Manchester. \nHe added: \"The promise at the 2015 spending review was real-terms protection for the police throughout this whole Parliament. Have you met that promise, yes or no?\" \nMr Lewis replied: \"Actually we have, as I have already outlined twice to you, met the promise at the spending review and for those police and crime commissioners who maximise their precept they actually are in the same position.\" \nMr Burnham later called on Mr Lewis to \"tell the truth\" on the issue as he warned local tax rises could not cover cuts in funding. \nThe Government is currently working on creating a fairer funding formula for the police but Mr Lewis said he would not set a timetable for it to be finished. \nHe said: \"I have been very clear from the beginning that this is a very, very big piece of work. It is an important piece of work to get right.\" \nDespite the row MPs backed the motion to sign off the police grant by 275 votes to 179, a majority of 96. \nNo Labour MPs voted in favour and just one Tory, Philip Davies, voted against.
