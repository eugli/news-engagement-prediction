During the Second World War, his talents were used by the military and he was working on a H2S, an airborne radar system when he was killed. On June 7, 1942, the Halifax bomber he was flying in – converted into a flying lab – caught fire at 15,000ft and crashed at Welsh Bicknor, in Herefordshire. All the other ten passengers and crew, including five other top scientists, were killed. The project was completed by RAF engineers. The first film with a stereo soundtrack was of a steam train travelling from Hayes Station in Middlesex in 1935 (pictured) Like another genius engaged in top-secret work for the war effort, artificial intelligence pioneer Alan Turing, Mr Blumlein's life is soon to get the big-screen treatment. Universal Music Group – which merged with EMI in 2012 – said Mr Blumlein's life is being developed into 'an as-yet untitled film project'. Radar and stereo were not the scientist's only fields. During his 13 years at EMI he filed some 121 patents. He also pioneered the Marconi-EMI television system which was adopted by the BBC and was the basis for TV broadcasting until the switch to digital. Simon Blumlein, his son, said of the Grammy: 'It is a great honour for my father and the Blumlein family. We're immensely proud. He's always been held in the highest esteem by recording engineers and so to now receive this from the wider music industry is simply wonderful.' Universal boss Sir Lucian Grainge said: 'Alan Dower Blumlein and his prolific period of invention whilst at EMI, not only transformed audio and music recording technology, but also helped shape modern media communications for generations to come through his pioneering work in television.'
