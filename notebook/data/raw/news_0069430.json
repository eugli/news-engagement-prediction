Parents can also talk to their children and monitor their movements to check on what they are doing,” he said.\nMalaysia National Cycling Federation deputy president Datuk Naim Mohamad said there was nothing wrong in modifying bicycles by fitting them with motorcycle accessories as long as the bicycles were used at proper places. \n\n“We want youths to have creativity and innovation and there is nothing wrong in trying to ‘re-create’ the bicycles. \n“However, they should organise their cycling programmes at a proper place – either at a closed vicinity or roads or an open field. \n“Road users should also be careful as they are sharing the road with cyclists. Most importantly, cyclists should always follow the traffic laws,” he said.\nIf cyclists wished to use public roads, Naim said they must inform the police or the local authorities before doing so.\n“It must be at the right time and not at night. If it involves a big number of cyclists, they must get permission from the local authorities so that their welfare and safety will be protected,” he said.\nHe proposed that all schools set up their own cycling clubs so that students could organise their own activities through proper channels.\n“We can start by having clubs in primary and secondary schools, with instructors who can guide these young cyclists.\n“At the same time, students can also be exposed to basic mechanical knowledge when they have to repair their own bicycles,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:09:55.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
