He was described by the US treasury as a drug \"kingpin\" who worked with traffickers in Mexico and Colombia to ship drugs to America.\nHe accused the US of \"imperialist aggression\" in response and President Nicolas Maduro demanded a public apology.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D7C4/production/_94663255_mediaitem94663254.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:16:54.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
