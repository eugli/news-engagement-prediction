Maybe for the mobs who are trying to shut down freedom of speech for anyone but themselves. Because they live in a bubble reinforced by the liberal media, the ACLU ’s brain trust apparently doesn’t realize or care that it’s out of step with most Americans, who polls show support the temporary travel restrictions and want secure borders. \nACLU Legal Director David Cole on Jan. 28 castigated the president for clearly identifying America’s enemies: \n“In signing the executive order on Friday, Trump pledged to ‘keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.’ Not ‘terrorists.’ Not ‘radical terrorists.’ But only ‘radical Islamic terrorists.’ Of course we should be keeping terrorists out, but why limit our concern to those of one faith?” \nMaybe because “radical Islamic terrorists,” unlike Catholics, Methodists, Mormons, Hindus or Buddhists, are committing terrorist acts every day around the world and have specifically pledged to wipe the United States and Israel off the map? Honestly, do you know any Presbyterians or Zen practitioners who are turning their sweet young children into suicide bombers? \n“Radical Islamic terrorists” killed 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. And they blew up the Boston Marathon with pressure cooker bombs hidden in knapsacks in April 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others without limbs or with other serious injuries. They have committed mass murder at Fort Hood, Texas, San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Florida, and beheaded a woman in Oklahoma, among other atrocities. \n“Radical Islamic terrorists” of ISIS have tortured, raped and crucified countless Christians and Yazidis and burned down churches, as have “radical Islamic terrorists” in many countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. They also target Muslims who disagree with their brand of Islam, strapping suicide bombs to hapless women and children, some of them mentally impaired and unable to resist. \nIn Germany, Angela Merkel’s policy of flooding her country with a million migrants, many of them unmarried young men, has destabilized her government and led to countless crimes against German citizens. Even in the face of at least 1,200 sexual assaults, including dozens of rapes, by young, male migrant gangs during the 2015-2016 New Year’s Eve celebrations in Cologne and other German cities, she stuck to her guns, oblivious to the outcries. Now that she’s running for re-election, she says she’s shocked, shocked that migrants are causing problems in Germany. \nIn France, the terrorized city of Paris is spending $22 million on a barrier around the Eiffel Tower. It is hoped the new structure will be sound enough to withstand mobs of rampaging Quakers, Baptists or American tourists from Long Island. “Sadly, the risk of terrorism hasn’t gone away,” Deputy Mayor Jean-Franois Martins told a press conference. “It’s not a wall, it’s an aesthetic perimeter.” Whatever. \nIn the lawsuit to end the “ban” on travelers from the seven countries where terrorists flourish, the ACLU attorneys warned, “Rarely in American history has governmental intent to discriminate against a particular faith and its adherents been so plain.” \nWell, they might want to research Thomas Jefferson about that. He acquired a Koran specifically for insight into how he could defeat the Muslim pirates of the Barbary Coast of North Africa who were laying waste to American shipping and enslaving our sailors. \nAdding to their litany of efforts to leave America less secure, the ACLU just issued a report that says the Transportation Security Administration shouldn’t train its agents to look for suspicious behavior in airports. “Behavior detection” doesn’t work, the ACLU says, because lots of people at airports look nervous or shifty. \nPerhaps they’re on to something, because who would know better than they about the nuances of shiftiness? • Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:09:35.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
