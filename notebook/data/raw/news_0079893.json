REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo 3/3 By Anna Irrera | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and more than two dozen other companies have teamed up to develop standards and technology to make it easier for enterprises to use blockchain code Ethereum in the latest push by large firms to move toward distributed ledger systems. \nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) will work to enhance the privacy, security and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, making it better suited to business applications, according to the founding companies, which said they plan to announce the initiative on Tuesday. \nMembers of the 30-strong group also include Accenture Plc ( ACN.N ), Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ), BP Plc ( BP.L ), Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.S ), UBS Group AG ( UBSG.S ), Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria ( BBVA.MC ), ING Groep NV ( INGA.AS ), Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) , Thomson Reuters Corp ( TRI.TO ) and startups ConsenSys and BlockApps. \nThe EEA joins a growing list of joint initiatives by large companies aiming to take advantage of blockchain, a shared digital record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. \nCompanies in a wide range of industries are hoping that it can help them streamline some of their processes, such as the clearing and settling of financial securities. \nAbout 70 financial firms are involved with a R3 CEV, a New York-based startup focused on developing blockchain technology for the finance industry, while technology firms such as International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) and Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) are part of the Hyperledger Project, a group led by the Linux Foundation. \nThe EEA underscores the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, but also highlights some of the hurdles that companies must still overcome before they can deploy blockchain on a large scale. This includes ensuring that the technology can support the vast number of transactions processed by large corporations, while being secure enough to meet their stringent security standards. \nUnlike some other collaborative efforts, members do not need to pay a fee to participate in the EEA, for now. \nEthereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications, was invented by 23-year-old programer Vitalik Buterin. Several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. \nAlex Batlin, global blockchain lead at BNY Mellon, one of the companies on the EEA board, said over the past few years banks and other enterprises have increased collaboration with the Ethereum development community, facilitating the creation of the EEA. \n\"There is a lot more synergy in thinking than was ever possible before,\" Batlin said. \nThe EEA will collaborate with the non-profit foundation that promotes the development of Ethereum, the companies said. \n(Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In Technology News Buffett tells CNBC Berkshire bought 120 million Apple shares in 2017 \nNEW YORK Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc had more than doubled its stake in Apple Inc. since the end of 2016, making it one of Berkshire's biggest equity holdings, and that U.S. stocks overall were not in \"bubble territory.\" Tesla plunges another 5 percent on fears of Model 3 delays \nSAN FRANCISCO Shares of Tesla dropped on Monday after a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, bringing the electric carmaker's decline to 11 percent since its quarterly report last week stoked worries about how much cash it is using to launch its Model 3 sedan. \nBARCELONA, Spain Streaming video pioneer Netflix held out a vision of cooperation to potentially skeptical telecom partners on Monday, saying it could deliver a quality experience to mobile phones without hogging bandwidth needed for other services.
