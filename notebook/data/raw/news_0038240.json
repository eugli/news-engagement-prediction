Close School girls brawl in western Sydney shopping centre UP NEXT VIDEO School girls brawl in western Sydney shopping centre \nThe Blacktown Advocate reports the latest after school-fight to receive a live broadcast occurred at the Blacktown Westfield Shopping Centre. \nWhile the fact that it went out live to social media users is a uniquely 21st century problem, the motivation for the fight appears much more traditional. One of the pair appears to accuse the other of soliticiting explicit photographs from her boyfriend. Photo: Supplied \nThe expletive-riddled audio suggests the pair were fighting over a boy. \nThe video shows two young girls in school uniforms pulling at one another’s hair and throwing each other to the ground inside the shopping centre. \nThe suburban Sydney newspaper said the girls came from Wyndham College, Quakers Hill. \nThe fight was filmed on February 9. Eventually other children wearing school uniforms appear to intervene and pull the pair apart. Photo: Supplied \nThe paper quoted a department of education spokesperson saying the fight had occurred off school grounds and out of hours. \n“The police have been notified of the incident [and] Wyndham College has taken appropriate disciplinary action,” the statement said.
