One already strung together a pretty solid one, in the form of \" Beauty and Lord Voldemort ,\" a fake trailer for a love story between Belle and He Who Must Not Be Named. And now, fans are on to another theory.\nDisney recently dropped another clip from Beauty and the Beast , which features Emma and company singing the show&apos;s lively opening number, \"Belle.\" If you still remember all the words from the original animated film, you may recall the baker&apos;s dramatic uttering of, \"Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up!\" However, the live-action clip reveals that the line has unfortunately been cut. Instead of a chat with the baker, Belle converses with a villager named Monsieur Jean.\n\"Have you lost something again?\" she asks him. \"Well, I believe I have. Problem is, I can&apos;t remember what.\" Sound familiar, Harry Potter enthusiasts? As a Redditor points out , back in the first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone , Neville receives a Remembrall in the mail. A Remembrall is a clear ball filled with smoke that turns red when the owner has forgotten something. When it turns a fiery red, Neville sheepishly tells his fellow Gryffindors, \"The only problem is, I can&apos;t remember what I&apos;ve forgotten.\"\nMagical, right? Well, one Redditor begs to differ. After a few Redditors expressed excitement at the BATB / HP reference, a user by the name of WaxyPadlockJazz kindly shut them down. \"I hate to play devil&apos;s advocate, but this is one of the oldest gags in the book...,\" the user wrote . \"While the whole &apos;forgetting something you&apos;ve forgotten&apos; bit is a line in HP , it&apos;s not a HP specific reference. It&apos;s a joke that&apos;s been used many times over.\" Yes, true, it&apos;s a pretty classic one-liner. But we&apos;re still holding out hope that Beauty and the Beast found a way to nod to Hermione.\nRELATED: Emma Watson Weighs in on This Popular Beauty and the Beast Fan Theory", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/5v77at/sneak_preview_of_belle_from_live_action_beauty/ddzxd01/", "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/emma-watson-beauty-and-the-beast-harry-potter-mashup", "https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/5v77at/sneak_preview_of_belle_from_live_action_beauty/"], "published": "2017-02-22T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:29:48.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
