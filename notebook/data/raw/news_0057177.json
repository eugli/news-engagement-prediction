Lorelei Nicoll, District 4 Cole Harbour–Westphal. \"It's most transparent and most accountable.\"\nThe fee was originally put on the water bill after the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board ordered the municipality in 2013 to pay an annual bill of $3.9 million to Halifax Water.\nConfusing charge The charge confused people because they were already paying a stormwater fee for the runoff from their own properties (sometimes referred to as the ditch tax) so regional council moved their charge to the property tax bill.\nThat had unintended consequences for people who live in condominiums and trailer parks.\n\"It totally does not work for my whole district,\" said Coun. Russell Walker, District 10 Halifax–Bedford Basin West. \"This is totally ridiculous.\"\n'Best of a bad choice' Councillors rejected using the general tax rate last November.\nOn Tuesday they voted down using an area rate, even though some argued it was the fairest method.\n\"We all use the roads and sidewalks,\" said Coun. Waye Mason, District 7 Halifax South Downtown. \"It's the best of a bad choice.\"\nRebates for 3,724 properties Regional council asked for a new bylaw to move the stormwater tax back to the water bill. That proposed bylaw will have to come back to council for final approval.\nMeanwhile councillors also agreed to a rebate for those who paid the stormwater charge two or three times because parking spaces and storage areas in condominiums have separate deeds.\nThe rebates will apply to 3,724 properties.\nComplaints over Halifax Water's 'ditch tax' to be heard by new officer Halifax Water stormwater fee structure could change by 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:50:43.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
