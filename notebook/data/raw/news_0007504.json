So she said the fire department came. The fire department was unable to remove BART so instead, Glawe said she went to the emergency room, where doctors numbed her ear and lubed her and Bart up and were able to get the snake out of the hole. \nAnd that, children, is why you never let a snake near your gauge hole. \nBart, said Glawe, is totally fine. \n-- Lizzy Acker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T23:03:59.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
