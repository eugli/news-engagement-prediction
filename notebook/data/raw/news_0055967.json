and Joaquin Correa strikes, but remain firmly in the last-16 tie BY GARY STONEHOUSE AND GRAEME BRYCE 22nd February 2017, 9:35 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments JAMIE VARDY kept Leicester City’s Champions League hopes alive as he grabbed a vital away goal in their 2-1 defeat in Sevilla. \nAfter surviving long spells off pressure, and falling behind to strikes from Pablo Sarabia and Joaquin Correa, the England striker claimed the precious strike with 18 minutes remaining. Getty Images Jamie Vardy scored a vital away goal in Sevilla to keep Leicester’s Champions League hopes alive \nThe goal sets up a thrilling second-leg at the KingPower Stadium next month. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Leicester news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary. \nAs expected, the La Liga high-flyers started on top and had Claudio Ranieri’s men penned in for long spells as they dominated possession. \nAnd after almost taking the lead courtesy of Christian Fuchs nearly heading into his own net, Sevilla were handed the perfect chance to break the deadlock just before quarter of an hour. related stories FIVE THINGS WE LEARNT Christian Fuchs needs a kick up the backside, Ahmed Musa won't muck in and Kasper Schmeichel is too good Sweet FA Jose Mourinho fumes as Man United's FA Cup tie at Chelsea is moved to Monday on Europa League week SANTI KO Santi Cazorla set to miss rest of the season with ankle injury in huge blow for Arsenal BEAT THE CLOCK Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino says it will only take a minute to tell if they can beat Gent ABU HAVING FUN? Manchester City's stars arrive at their luxurious 5-star Emirates Palace Abu Dhabi hotel - where the cheapest room is £500 A NIGHT \nLeicester captain Wes Morgan dived in on Joaquin Correa inside the area to give away a penalty, but goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel came to the rescue as he saved the victim of the foul’s effort from the spot. \nThe Danish stopper was in fine form as he denied Sergio Escudero, but he was powerless to stop his side falling behind on 25 minutes as Pablo Sarabia rose above Christian Fuchs to powerfully head home at the back post. \nLeicester just could not get hold of the ball, and Schmeichel was again on hand to deny Correa to keep the score to one at the break. \nThe Sevilla tides of attack continued after the restart, and the visitors had the woodwork to thank after Samir Nasri teed up Vitolo, but the Spanish winger’s shot came off the foot of the post after squeezing between Schmeichel and the frame. \nThey weren’t so lucky on 61 minutes though when the inevitable second arrived as Correa drove a fierce strike into the roof of the net. \nBut Vardy had the last say, racing onto Danny Drinkwater’s pass to finish and grab his first goal since December 10. Stats, facts, goals and lols Sevilla fans don’t half love their team! The scenes as the players boarded their bus – for the 90 SECOND drive from their hotel to the stadium – were truly awe inspiring. Around 1,000 fans gathered to serenade their players who were greeted like rock stars as they clambered on board. Red smoke bombs, massive waving flags, flares, fireworks, the FRENCH national anthem … wow … just wow! Leicester pulled off a neat trick by turning up in CHELSEA colours as they tweaked their usual all blue kit by wearing white socks! Smart move from Claudio – trick Seville into thinking they were playing the Premier League’s runaway leaders. Unfortunately Ngolo Kante didn’t come with the new look! Seville flew out of the traps, as Sarabia rippled the roof of Kasper Schmeichel’s net, then Fuchs and Schmeichel gave each other the jitters with a mix up which almost saw the Austrian head into his own net. Sevilla seemed to be coping nicely without coach Jorge Sampaoli who was peering down from the soaring stands, serving the second match of his two match Uefa ban. The Argentine was sent off by Mark Clattenburg for dissent during his side’s 3-1 home defeat by Juventus in November – an extra match was added when he was caught passing on messages to the bench in his next match against Lyon. The 13th minute proved unlucky for Wes Morgan who was collared by ref Clement TURPIN (I kid you not) for tripping Joaquin Correa in the penalty area. That is what you call a bad Correa move for the big fella! Kasper Schmeichel has been Leicester’s best player in the Champions’ League by a long way and proves it by saving Correa’s penalty low to his right and holding it! The Dane has come to Leicester’s rescue again. The 2,500 Foxes fans pitched high in the far corner of this atmospheric stadium lapped up the moment going crazy in their section – with another 7,000 ticket-less Leicester supporters doubtless doing likewise in Tapas Bars all around Seville. Leicester briefly sensed a wobble from Jorge Sampaoli’s side and Jamie Vardy ran at Sergio Escudero and Clement Lenglet for the first time before Wes Morgan flashed a header just wide to prove Claudio Ranieri’s men could get out of their own half. However Sevilla are real killjoys and soon spoiled the moment ….. by scoring! Even Kasper Schmeichel couldn’t save his mates this time as Pablo Sarabia soared above Christian Fuchs at the back post to power an inch-perfect header beyond the helpless keeper, in off the back stick. That was the first goal Schmeichel has lost in five Champions’ League games this season – he broke a bone in his hand and missed Leicester’s last two group games, just as he was on course to become the first goalie in Champions League history to go through six group games without conceding. Stevan Jovetic almost scored from Charlie Adam territory but Schmeichel manager to claw it over as the former Man City striker demanded MORE noise from Sevilla’s frenzied fans. On a scale of 1-10 that would be an 11 Stevan. A police message at half time told one anxious Leicester fan he could collect his PASSPORT from the police desk at full-time. You have to hope the guy had packed spare underwear. You could say the same for Leicester’s defence after Joaquin Correa added Sevilla’s second – Sampaoli in the stand even allowed himself a rare smile. It looks as if he believed the hard part had been done. Jamie Vardy had other ideas though!
