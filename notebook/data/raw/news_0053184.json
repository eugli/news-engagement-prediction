(Rebecca Droke/Post-Gazette) Don Hopey /   \nINDIAN HEAD, Fayette County — On the rocky Laurel Highlands knob that is Duck’s Maple Farm, long, spaghetti-like strands of blue plastic tubing criss-cross the woods, linking more than 2,200 maple trees to Don and Sherry Hess’ syrup cooker. \nThe maple sap, what Mr. Hess refers to as “sugar water,” or just “water,” started flowing from the maples and through the Rube Goldberg-like configuration of collection tubes in mid-January, a full month earlier than normal, due to an early and extended stretch of warm weather. \nGetting an early start on sap collection and syrup cooking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But due to the unseasonably warm weather continuing this month, Mr. Hess and the state’s other 250 maple syrup producers can be added to skiers, sledders and snowman makers on the short list of Pennsylvanians hoping for a return of cold winter weather. Or any winter weather. \n“For the sap to keep running we need warm days followed by cold nights, below freezing, to drive the sap down and keep the trees from budding,” said Mr. Hess, 58, a retired road construction worker. “If it doesn’t get cold again, I’m done.” \nBelow-freezing nights followed by warmer days, a weather pattern that usually starts in Pennsylvania in early to mid-February, are necessary to start the maple sap flowing and keep it flowing through March, and even early April in the northern tier counties of the state where most maple farms are located. \nUnless subfreezing nighttime temperatures return, maple sap collection could end almost before it normally begins and earlier than it ever has, said Gary Bilek, president of the Pennsylvania Maple Syrup Producers Council, who has been tapping trees on his Erie County farm since 1988.

(Rebecca Droke/Post-Gazette) (Rebecca Droke/Post-Gazette) \n“It’s an unusual season for sure — a really warm winter. I’ve never had a season like this with so many long stretches of warm days in January and now in February too,” said Mr. Bilek. “There’s a lot of concern among producers statewide if this warm weather continues and brings an early end to the [sap collection] season, maybe the earliest ever.” \nIf night temperatures don’t dip below freezing and days stay warm, the trees will bud out and sap collection will end, Mr. Bilek said. Once trees bud, the flavor of the sap becomes unpalatable. \nMr. Bilek said he has 1,900 taps in 1,400 maples on his farm 20 miles south of Lake Erie, and produces between 500 and 600 gallons of syrup a season. \n“I’m at about 50 percent of my average syrup production, right now,” said Mr. Bilek, “If we get another month of cold nights, I’ll have a very good year. If we get two or three weeks of cold nights, I’ll have a good year. If we get another week, it will be a short year.” \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, Pennsylvania annually produces about 60,000 gallons of syrup a year, with an average crop value of over $1.9 million, ranking from fifth to seventh in the U.S. \nMost Pennsylvania syrup producers are located north of I-80 on the Allegheny Plateau in the northwestern part of the state and in northern tier counties in central Pennsylvania, according to statistics compiled by the Pennsylvania maple Syrup Producers Council. There’s also about 75 maple syrup producers in the Laurel Highlands of Somerset and Fayette counties. Maple syrup jarred and ready to be sold from Duck's Maple Farm in Indian Head, Fayette County. (Rebecca Droke/Post-Gazette) \nVermont is the biggest syrup-producing state, pouring about half a million gallons a year. Quebec is the largest producer of syrup in North America with production exceeding 6.5 million gallons. About 50 gallons of sap cooks down to produce 1 gallon of syrup. \nThis is the second year in a row that the sap has started flowing in January, said Mr. Hess. In 2016 he tapped his maples on Jan. 20 and production continued into mid-March. \nHe said this year the “spiles,” or tree taps, were drilled and went in a week earlier, and he’s hopeful the sap season will stretch out just as it did last year. And it could, based on AccuWeather’s long-term forecast for the Somerset area, which predicts nighttime temperatures will dip below freezing on up to 25 of the next 30 days, although on most nights just barely. \n“We just take it as it comes. If it would turn out like the long-range forecast, well, I just might run through all of this wood, and that would be a good thing,” Mr. Hess said, pointing to a neatly stacked floor-to-ceiling woodpile that fills a carport sized-structure next to the building that houses his syrup cooker. \nDon Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1983, or on Twitter @donhopey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:40:49.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
