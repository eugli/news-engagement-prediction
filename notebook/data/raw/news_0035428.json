A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 7:42am PST \nA post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 16, 2017 at 11:42am PST \nThe beauty guru swears by her “fav moisturizer” by Shea Moisture, going as far as writing, “Use on children and yourself !” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 7:44am PST \nThe actress also swears by her Babyliss Pro TT blow dryer, writing, “Best little blow dryer. And has a low setting that kind of diffuses, which is good for us girls with curls! If ya know what I mean. Love this red tool.” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:34pm PST \nHer Flower beauty line foundation stick made the cut, with Barrymore writing that it’s “creamy and blend able. But gives coverage. Even on blue, red and brown. It just truly works!” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 3:39pm PST \nPerhaps Barrymore’s biggest secret to not getting facial fillers is her favorite mask by Hanacure Effect. “@thehanacure nuts when you take it off you are 10 years younger,” she writes. “You paint it on with a brush. It starts to dry. It pulls. It gets so tight that it literally pulls your face.” \n“But it makes you look so fresh when you wash it off,” she continues. “And it’s so effective. How fun is that in a package. #notttooenvasivebeauty #kbeauty thank you @crystalmeers for the info that’s changed my life.” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 3:47pm PST \nWho said you should stop at one mask? Barrymore’s got a dozen or more, as she showed on Instagram. “#beautyjunkieweek there is no end to masks. Don’t mess with your face. I’ve not used fillers or tricks yet. So I turn to innovation in skin care and beauty. Let me turn you on to attainable solutions. Be your best YOU.” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 8:09pm PST \nAnd for those with oily skin or acne, Barrymore says your solution is Clinique. Although, she does agree it’s “not cheap,” but also “not unattainable.” A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 8:27pm PST \nSome drugstore products go a long way, especially with Aquaphor, and Barrymore owns a lot of it. “I love you @aquaphorus,” she writes. A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 17, 2017 at 8:35pm PST A post shared by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Feb 18, 2017 at 6:05am PST \nBarrymore’s cleansing secret is French favorite Bioderma, which she calls “by far the best make up remover I have ever used.” \n“This used to be only available in France,” she continues. “But now it is much more common in beauty supply stores, chemists and on line! Do not skip this step. It’s so clean. Like water. But doesn’t sting and is an old favorite of the fashion and beauty world.” \nBarrymore told The New York Times in late January that the secret to her youthful Hollywood look was simply a testament to how much she takes care of her skin. \n“I would say 90 percent of my life, I wear zero makeup,” she says, adding that she relies on Flower’s Skincognito Stick Foundation “because it covers blue, red, brown, purple,” as well as one new lipstick shade every month. \nAs far as her skin is concerned, the star says she swears by using toners, esthetician Christine Chin ‘s skincare products, and washing her face diligently at least three times a day. While she doesn’t have much time for facials or treatments, she does clear her schedule once a year, when she sees Dr. Roy Geronemus for a “barnacle removal. He treats my face like the bow of a boat.” \nBut Barrymore is confident that at least for another decade, there are zero needles in her near future. “He knows I’m not going to do anything beyond lasers, so he doesn’t even bother talking about it. He did suggest some fillers the last time I was there. I was like: ‘Not happening, Dr. G! Talk to me in 10 years.’ I’m not putting anything in my face until it’s so bad I have nothing to lose.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:51:13.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
