When he realised that his father was out of sight he started walking faster. \n“That was when a police van stopped across the road and one of the officers asked my son why he kept looking back,” said the mother. \nShe said the police officers instructed the boy to cross the road and come to them. \n“The police coincidentally reversed into my son’s friend’s driveway. \n“They asked him what he had dropped on the floor because he kept looking back and my son explained that he didn’t drop anything but was looking at his father,” she said. \nThe mother alleged the police suspected her son had dropped drugs on the road when he saw the police van. \n“They told him to take off his shoes and unbutton his pants so they can strip search him. They shoved their hands down his pants to feel for drugs. He wasn’t wearing underwear and his privates were exposed. He was even more embarrassed because his friend’s sister was outside her house and saw this happening.” \nThe mother said when the police could not find any drugs on the boy they allegedly started verbally abusing him. “They called him a ‘f***ing p**s lightie’ and told him that they will f**k him up if he didn’t tell them where he threw the drugs,” she said. \nShe said when they were finished searching him, her son struggled to put on his shoes as it had started raining. \nCrying and shaking \nShe said the police officers continued to harass the boy and asked him what grade he was in. \nWhen the youngster revealed what grade he was in at school, she said the police allegedly started laughing at him and called him stupid for not being able to put on his shoe. \n“My son came back home crying and shaking,” she said. \n“He told me through his tears what had happened,” said the mother. \nThe mother has since opened a criminal case against the two police officers at the Mountain Rise police station. \nEbrahim said a more detailed statement would be taken late yesterday afternoon. \n“The South African Police Service does not condone the actions of these members. This type of behaviour is unacceptable in the police service. \n“Whilst on one side one or two are bringing disrepute to the station, there are on the other side the majority of members that are working to the best of their ability to fight crime. This is an isolated incident which will be investigated properly at the station,” said Ebrahim. | \nsubmitted via MyNews24 . Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
