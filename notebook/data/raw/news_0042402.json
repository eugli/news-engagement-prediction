Greg Inglis will start the season at fullback. Source: Getty Images \n“I want to play fullback and fullback is where I’ll start in round one.” \nAfter a disappointing turnout in 2016, Inglis is confident his side can turn things around and that the addition of Robbie Farah has boosted the side’s title hopes. \nBut he also sang the praises of young hooker Damien Cook, who is likely to relegated to second fiddle behind Farah as their first choice No.9. \n“I think so (can challenge for the title). But we also have Damien Cook there,” Inglis said. \n“I know we picked up Robbie but the way Damien played at the back end of last season really got us going. \n“We are looking to carry and improve that momentum from last season into this year. \n“Bringing Robbie in is a bonus to the whole group — his professionalism, his leadership around the group is sensational. \n“To bring in Robbie when we already have a good quality hooker, it’s just a credit to what Souths has been doing recruiting wise.”   View our Privacy Policy A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.
