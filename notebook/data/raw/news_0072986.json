The record showcased a departure from Gambino’s off-kilter rap style. \n“Well, first of all, I love the ‘Stay Woke’ [lyric] — that’s what this movie is about,” he explains to HipHopDX Editor-in-Chief, Trent Clark. “I wanted to make sure that this movie satisfied the black horror movie audience’s need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent and observant people would do.” \nDaniel Kaluuya stars opposite Allison Williams as Chris Washington and Peele went on to explain how he fit the bill for the common sense focus they wanted the lead to have. Comedian Lil Rel Howery is also featured, some might say, as the voice of reason. \nBut what was Donald Glover’s reaction upon hearing his alter-ego’s song in the movie? Nothing but positive of course. \n“I’m a huge Childish Gambino fan, a huge fan of Donald’s and I had him in there to see the movie,” Peele gushes. “I put the song and there was kinda like looking at him. And he loved it. I was very honored by his reaction.” \nCheck out the exclusive conversation with Jordan Peele up above.
