According to China Press , the estranged half-  leader Kim Jong-un walked about 15m to the airport service counter for help after the attack on Monday on the 4th floor near the departure hall. Citing police sources, the newspaper reported Friday that Jong-nam had a pained expression on his face when he uttered his last few words in English. After that, he could only groan. Service counter staff then stopped auxiliary policemen for help to take the North Korean to the airport clinic on the third floor. However, he had lost consciousness and the doctor at the clinic deemed the situation serious enough for him to be immediately transferred to Putrajaya Hospital. Jong-nam, however, died on the way to the hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:08:20.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
