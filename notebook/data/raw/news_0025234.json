Residents near the largest dam in the US have been ordered to flee as a spillway threatens to overflow. Source: Storyful \nResidents below the dam were abruptly ordered from their homes on Sunday when an emergency spillway that acts as an automatic overflow channel appeared in danger of imminent collapse from severe erosion. \nA mandatory evacuation of more than 180,000 residents remained in effect on Tuesday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a news conference. \nThe potential danger for the Feather River valley below the dam was still being reviewed, he said. \n\"We need to have time to make sure that before we allow people back into those areas it is safe to do so,\" Sherrif Honea said. At least 188,000 people have been evacuated in Northern California due to flooding risks. The evacuation was triggered due to the Oroville Dam's emergency spillway being damaged by erosion. Close Residents evacuated as Oroville dam threatens to collapse UP NEXT \nAlfred Ybarra had gone down to the Feather River with his children on Sunday to watch the swollen waters. \n\"Within minutes the water was up to the tires on my car,\" Mr Ybarra said. \n\"I told my kids, 'You have to pray. It's the only thing that you can do.\" \nAsked whether he thought officials had overreacted by ordering evacuations, Mr Ybarra said, \"Absolutely not.\" \nJodye Manley of Olivehurst said she and her husband were having dinner on Sunday at her daughter's house in Sacramento when she was alerted by a city council friend her area would probably be evacuated. \nShe said the couple filled their car with petrol and made a mad dash to pick up their four dogs and three cats. \nMs Manley said she and her neighbours were completely panicked and that the scene \"was almost like a movie.\" \nShe said the traffic-filled return to Sacramento was terrifying, with people thinking the spillway would go at any moment. Dozens of cars were stuck in a traffic jam in the outskirts of Yuba, Northern California, as residents try to leave the city.

Both spillways are to the side of the dam, which has not been compromised, engineers said. \nThe situation grew less dire several hours later on Sunday as water levels subsided behind the dam, leaving the weakened unpaved emergency spillway largely intact. By Monday, the level of the lake had dropped enough so that water was no longer pouring over the hill. \nState water resource officials said they were continuing to assess the damage before proceeding with plans to shore up the emergency spillway with rocks and boulders dropped into the hillside by helicopters. \nAt a staging area beside the dam on Monday, construction equipment was lined up with rows of large, white rock-filled sacks waiting for operations to begin. \nThe aim is to lower the reservoir's overall water level by 15 metres, to prevent further spillover down the emergency hillside channel, before more rain arrived in the coming weeks and before snow-melt run-off began in the spring.

Dam \nMeanwhile, water could be seen gushing from the main concrete spillway as dam operators for the California Department of Water Resources continued controlled releases through the paved chute into channels that route the water away from populated areas. \nState authorities and engineers last Thursday began releasing water from the dam after noticing that large chunks of concrete were missing from the main spillway, opening a gap 76 metres long, 52m wide and 12m deep. \nEvacuation centres were set up at a fairgrounds in Chico, California, about 32km northwest of Oroville, but major highways leading south out of the area were jammed as residents fled the flood zone. \nAnother storm was forecast to arrive as early as Wednesday or Thursday, though officials said they expected much of that precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain. \nThe earth-filled dam is just upstream and east of Oroville, a city of more than 16,000 people north of the state capital of Sacramento. \nAt 230 meters high, the structure, built between 1962 and 1968, is the tallest US dam, exceeding the Hoover Dam by more than 12 meters.
