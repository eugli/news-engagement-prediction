(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:04 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:04 p.m. ET \nEmmitt Smith has a message for Cowboys fans still wondering about the ego-driven breakup of the Jimmy Johnson-Jerry Jones Super Bowl champions. \nThose 1990's Cowboys teams under Johnson could have won four Super Bowls, not three, says Smith on Wednesday night's new episode of \"Undeniable with Joe Buck\" from AT&T's AUDIENCE Network. \nSmith doesn't sound too jazzed about ex-coach Barry Switzer's leadership. \nThe 1995 Cowboys came back to win the Big One — \"in spite\" of its head coach, says the NFL's all-time leading rusher. \nAs all Cowboys fans know, Johnson's Cowboys won two straight Super Bowls during the glory days of 1992-1993. But then Jones decided he wasn't getting enough of the credit. He jettisoned Johnson, hiring his old buddy Barry Switzer. \nSwitzer's Cowboys lost the 1994 NFC Championship Game to Steve Young's eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. \nSwitzer and the Cowboys came back to win the Big One in 1995. \nBut it was the last flicker of the Smith/Troy Aikman/Michael Irvin dynasty. \nThe 1996 Cowboys lost in the playoffs. Brett Favre's Packers became the new class of the NFC. \nEver since, Dallas fans have wondered: Could we have won more Super Bowls if Jones' ego had not run amok? \nThe answer is yes, says Smith on tonight's Undeniable (9 p.m. ET), that can be viewed on DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&T U-verse. \n\"Could we have won four in a row? Perhaps. Perhaps,\" says Smith about the 1994 season. \nThe team still had the \"tools\" to win because the Cowboys offense had not changed, says Smith. But Johnson's loss made the difference. \nWhile the 1994 Cowboys came up short, the 1995 team \"went out and did it — in spite of who was the head coach.\" \nDuring another part of his one-on-one interview with Buck, Smith recalled what was probably his first concussion playing football — at the age of 10 while playing against 11 and 12-year-old kids. \n\"I didn't want to do it no more,\" he says. But he learned a good lesson: \"Avoid contact at all costs.\" \nHere's a preview of tonight's episode: \nIt took 22 years but Jones finally admitted he let his ego get in the way of winning championships, according to ESPN's Jean-Jacques Taylor. \nDespite an NFC-best 14-2 record, the 2016 Cowboys fell short again. \nHow 'bout them Cowboys?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:27:39.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
