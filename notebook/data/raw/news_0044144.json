That’s not normal, but it is something that does happen.” \nBaroness D’Souza claimed the lord was one of “many, many, many who contribute absolutely nothing, but who claim the full allowance”. \nThe Electoral Reform Society is leading calls to reform the House of Lords, which was described by one peer as London’s best “elderly care home”. \nChief ­executive Katie Ghose said: “This provides more evidence that we urgently need to move to a fully elected chamber. \n“Let’s fix this broken House before the situation gets any worse. Lord Palmer How the Daily Mirror reported the original scandal (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“We already knew some peers claim their £300 without speaking or voting, but to hear this from the former Lords Speaker herself is astonishing and shows just how severe this problem really is. \n“Baroness D’Souza has exposed a truly scandalous situation. The public are sick to death of this kind of behaviour.” \nThe new revelations come after years of Tory austerity, with ministers often branding people struggling on benefits as the ­“something for nothing” society. \nAnd it follows the Mirror’s 2013 report on the clocking-in scandal involving ­disgraced former Tory peer Lord ­Haningfield. \nWe caught the expenses cheat repeatedly popping into ­Parliament for barely half an hour at a time to secure his daily payment of £300.
