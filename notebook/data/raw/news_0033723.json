After being contacted by The Sunday Times last week Amazon promptly decommissioned the books for sale from the aforementioned countries. However the works are still available to UK customers as denying what is considered to be the deadliest genocide in history is not illegal. The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews is available on Kindle download for just 99p Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, labelled Amazon's decision to allow the purchase of such books as 'shocking and wrong'. She said: The Holocaust was one of the most well documented and researched periods in history, yet even in 2017, over 70 years later, there are still those who deliberately deny, denigrate and belittle the memory of the Holocaust. 'Holocaust denial is highly offensive and the intent is anti- semitism, pure and simple. To have this offensive material widely accessible via any retailer is shocking and wrong.' There are dozens of books and pamphlets available to buy on the internet store's UK site Although some Amazon reviewers have left scathing comments on the website others have applauded the authors for their work. One review said that The Six Million: Fact or Fiction Paperback was an 'excellent source of information' while another claimed The Six Million: Fact or Fiction is a 'must read in these times of long accepted facts.' Historical records and extensive research concur that six million Jews were killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators in a number of concentration camps in German occupied territories. A further five million non-Jewish people were murdered in such camps bringing the total up to 11 million deaths.
