Doing otherwise would be viewed \"dimly\", he warned. \nMr Corbyn has imposed a three-line whip - the strongest possible sanction - on his MPs to back the bill, which is only two lines long. \nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the vote a \"difficult decision\" for Labour - most of whose MPs supported Remain in the referendum - but it had to \"accept the result\". \nTwo shadow ministers have quit Labour's front bench in order to oppose the bill, while MPs Stephen Timms and Lyn Brown told the Commons they would also vote against it. '30 Labour rebels' \nA government source said up to 30 Labour MPs were expected to defy Mr Corbyn. \nIf the vote goes the government's way, the bill will return to the Commons next week for the committee stage, when opposition parties will try to push through a series of amendments. \nThe bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered. \nIt rejected the government's argument that Mrs May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:21:03.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
