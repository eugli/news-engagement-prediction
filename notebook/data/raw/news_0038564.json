A post shared by Axle Preston Price Ethington (@axleethington) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:05am PST \nYosemite’s Firefall can only occur only when weather conditions are perfect : The skies have to be clear, there has to be enough rain for the falls to pour over the edge and rays from the setting sun have to hit the water at just the right angle. \nThe result is a lava-like flow that only lasts for a few minutes . \nBelow, see photos of this year’s Firefall illuminating Yosemite its famed golden glow.
