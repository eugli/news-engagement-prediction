[Credit: Marvel Comics] By Jack Carr , writer at Creators.co You are the Princess Shireen of the House Baratheon, and you are my daughter. \nRemember that time the #XMen franchise took the iconic Dark Phoenix Saga, quite possibly the greatest comic book story of all time, and made the greatest comic book movie of all time? Of course you don't, because what they actually made was X-Men: The Last Stand , a freak mutation of a movie so rotten it basically killed the X-Men movies for five years (a solid four years longer than Jean Grey ever stayed dead!). \nDespite not having been confirmed as a thing that exists by Fox yet, this week it was reported that production on Apocalypse sequel X-Men: Supernova will begin in April, shooting almost simultaneously with X-Men spin-off New Mutants in Montreal. \nWhy Fox are being so secretive is anyone's guess — after being burned by the unfairly negative reaction to Apocalypse on social media, they might prefer to keep this one under wraps — but one thing we do know as of this week is that Supernova has a new working title, and it's this: 'X-Men: Teen Spirit' \nMost movies have working titles during the production shoot, and most of them are totally random and not worth dissecting, but X-Men: Teen Spirit is actually super-interesting on multiple levels.

Perhaps we'll see him buried under some a mountain of old-man prosthetics... \nMore X-Men: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:11.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
