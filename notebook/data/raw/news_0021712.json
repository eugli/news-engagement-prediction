'How I was tortured in a Syrian jail' Why is there a war in Syria? Al-Qaeda's influence in Syria operates largely through an affiliate jihadist group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham , formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nThe group announced in mid-2016 that it was no longer affiliated with any external group, prompting speculation that it had cut ties with al-Qaeda, although the latter group was not mentioned by name.\nIt is thought that the leadership structure of Fateh al-Sham is still intertwined with al-Qaeda.\nA US operation against al-Qaeda in Yemen last week - the first military action authorised by new president Donald Trump - resulted in the death of a Navy Seal and up to 16 civilians, including children, according to reports.\nMr Trump's administration declared the operation a success, saying it had yielded valuable intelligence.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35005825", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36DB/production/_94234041_gettyimages-1864430.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36924000", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35806229"], "published": "2017-02-09T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:38:27.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
