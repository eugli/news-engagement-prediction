Before this, no one has explored my beauty on screen. I was given a fake nose in Revolver Rani and a set of fake teeth in Tanu Weds Manu Returns,” Kangana said in a statement. \nThe film, which also stars Saif and Shahid Kapoor , is scheduled to release this Friday. \n“It’s a very strange feeling that you’ve lived with a dream for seven years and now it’s no more yours. It’s that of the audience. To see it come alive on the big screen is a very happy feeling,” said Vishal.
