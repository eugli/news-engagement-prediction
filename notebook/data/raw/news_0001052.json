He completely ruined her and she turned into this scared, overreacting woman,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin .\n'Mum was very much by herself. Looking back, Dad would overrule her decisions. He was very dominating and they are the little signs people should look for in a marriage.'\nMs Tulloch said her mother was never allowed to see her side of the family, and later in the marriage not even spend time with her friends.\nThough she and her two brothers, aged 28 and 18, and their 15-year-old sister watch their dad psychologically abuse Ms Lock, the beatings always happened in private.\nMrs Tulloch said the relationship 'broke' her mother (left), leaving her 'a scared and overreacting woman' before she was killed (Samara pictured far right with her family)\nMrs Tulloch is now married and moved to Tasmania with her husband (pictured)\nShe said the siblings were out a lot because life at home was 'uncomfortable', and she now wishes they knew enough to stay home and protect her.\nLike Ms Bradford, her mother eventually left and moved her family out of town, but a few weeks later agreed to meet him at the Helensvale McDonald's.\nThey had agreed to sign the divorce papers, but Stephen Lock planned the murder-suicide weeks in advance.\nMs Tulloch now lives in Tasmania with her husband and like the AVO that did nothing to save Ms Bradford, she thinks the system let her mother down.\nMs Lock was shot to death in the car park of the Helensvale McDonald's\nParamedics try to save Mr Lock but he died after killing his estranged wife\nShe laughs at suggestion battered women can easily up and leave, as her mother tried for months but Mr Lock always 'found ways to weasel his way back'.\nMs Tulloch said her mother was so scared of her husband she told no one about the abuse, even her children, and deleted all her text messages in case he saw them.\n'If you think something's happening, just try to get them to talk. Mum wouldn't talk to anyone. Her whole life had been filled with mental abuse so she didn't know who to trust,' she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/crime-court/daughter-of-mcdonalds-murdersuicide-victim-reveals-heartache-of-domestic-violence-tragedies/news-story/778c17c2fc101dd429c8683cd84e7027?login=1"], "published": "2017-02-03T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:31:13.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
