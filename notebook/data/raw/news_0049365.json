He should face the Police in Calabar to explain his complicity in the criminal allegations leveled against him before a competent court. \n“His recent attempt to blackmail the leadership of University to us is an attempt to divert attention from his unholy acts which set both students and members of the institution on a collision course with Mr. Agi’s ego and penchant for mischief which is known everywhere in the University. \n“If he is confident that his hands are clean he is free to approach equity and should then exercise patience for the outcome. Mr Agi has gone before the National Industrial Court in Uyo and should be patient for the judiciary to do its work. \nShe accused the ex-bursar of sponsoring negative propaganda against the University as well as importing cultists and thugs to the school premises to harass and harangue staff that he advertently short changed. \nShe said, “CESJET notes that Mr Agi could not have embarked on this destructive crusade alone. He is clearly doing the hatchet job for certain vested interests. \n“We have traced the connection and we know who his backers are and we also know their motives. We have become aware of meetings at which it was agreed that UNICAL should be sabotaged so that it can be used as an example of how the anticorruption fight is crippling institutions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:50:58.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
