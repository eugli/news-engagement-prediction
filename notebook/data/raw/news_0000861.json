Trump was set to tour the Milwaukee factory on Thursday to sign executive orders about American manufacturing. \nAn administration official clarified that it was not the signing of executive orders but the threat of large-scale protests which have plagued Trump at other venues. JUST IN: President Trump’s trip to Milwaukee canceled because company feared protests https://t.co/MS4418r5Qk https://t.co/4jLWwkv8Te \n— The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) January 31, 2017 \n“Harley-Davidson decided that it wasn’t comfortable hosting the president amid a flurry of protests that had been planned for what was supposed to be the president’s visit to Milwaukee on Thursday,” CNN’s Jeremy Diamond reported. “The company apparently told Trump administration officials that it wasn’t necessarily what the president was planning to do there, where he was potentially going to sign some executive orders on American manufacturing, but it was really the presence of protests. Protests planned because of the president’s immigration ban.” \n“So we’re seeing the continued effect here snowballing as the president continues to implement his agenda,” Diamond continued. “He’s hitting roadblocks once again, in part because of his controversial immigration executive order.” \nTrump’s executive orders re-ignited the sparks of protest that were lit at the massive “Women’s March on Washington” held the day after his inauguration. The week after the inauguration was consumed with debates about whether the attendance for the protests was larger than that for the inauguration. The new protests sprung up after reports that immigrants and others were being detained at airports because of Trump’s travel ban which many criticized as unconstitutional and immoral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:28:58.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
