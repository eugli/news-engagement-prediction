'However, we could replace all the EU funding that currently takes place in the UK and still have about £8bn left over which we could use to reduce the deficit.' During the referendum campaign, the official Vote Leave campaign suggested there would be £350million more every week to spend once Britain left the EU. That is the equivalent of around £18billion a year. A dividend of £8bn would equate to around £150m a week. Theresa May (pictured) indicated in her Brexit speech that significant contributions to the EU will not go on post Brexit Theresa May indicated in her Brexit speech that significant contributions to the EU will not go on post Brexit. However, ministers have said spending on individual EU programmes - such as Europol, the policing agency, or research , will continue after we leave. There is also likely to be a Brexit 'bill' to cover future costs such as pensions liabilities. Senior EU figures have demanded £50 billion - a number dismissed as 'absurd' by cabinet minister Liam Fox. During the referendum campaign the IFS was accused of supporting 'Project Fear' after suggesting Brexit could extend austerity by two years. The 'Green Budget' stated: 'It is quite possible that the government will choose to spend less than £13.4 billion – not least because the UK pays more into the EU budget than the EU spends in the UK – so there is some upside risk here. In recent years, the amount the UK contributes to the EU budget, net of both the rebate and the spending done by the EU in the UK, has been running at about £8 billion a year.'
