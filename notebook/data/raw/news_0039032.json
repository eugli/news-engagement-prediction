Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKerry Katona has admitted that she “regrets” asking Michelle Heaton to join Atomic Kitten for their tour in Australia. \nThe former Liberty X star is filling in for Liz McClarnon during the girl band’s international tour dates because Liz doesn’t like to fly long-haul. \nBut appearing via live link on Lorraine this morning, Kerry joked that she regrets asking Michelle on board. \n“Liz didn’t feel comfortable going all the way to Australia and the girls asked if I would step in and I was over the moon!” Michelle gushed. Atomic Kitten appeared on Lorraine this morning (Photo: ITV) Michelle Heaton explained pictures of her boozy day out (Photo: ITV) Lorraine asked the girls if they'd gone 'wild' (Photo: ITV) \n“Yeah, we regret now though,” Kerry joked. \nMichelle also addressed the boozy daytime drinking session that saw her being sick at the side of the road . \nThe trio were spotted enjoying glasses of wine on Waiheke Island in Auckland, New Zealand before a difficult drive the morning after – with the taxi having to pull over for Michelle to throw up. \nBut this morning Michelle insisted it wasn’t as “wild” as it looked. The girls are enjoying their comeback \n“Do you know what Lorraine, I’m so embarrassed,” she explained. \n“It was the first day that we got there, we were so jet lagged and we had to stay up - we got there at like 5.30am in the morning. \n“We went on a boat ride and I had a few glasses of wine and it was during the day and I just got, I got a bit of sun stroke, I did a two-hour workout in the gym and I just got sick and that’s it. There’s no excuse and we’ve all been there.” Atomic Kitten on tour in Australia Michelle performs with Kerry and Natasha \nHer bandmate Kerry jokingly added: “I’ve not”. \nThe girls have been letting their hair down on tour, and Liberty X singer Michelle is making the most of the opportunity. \n\"Kerry and Natasha are a bit more wild than I'm used to in Liberty X but I'm crazy too, so it's perfect,\" she previously admitted. \n\"We're all mums so when we're away we let our hair down. We don't get to do that at home.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:08:18.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
