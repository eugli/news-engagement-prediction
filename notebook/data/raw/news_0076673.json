PUBLISHED: 11:27,   11:39,   Jose Mourinho wants two or three summer signings for Manchester United Manchester United spent big last summer, breaking the world record transfer fee to bring in Paul Pogba for Â£89million. The Red Devils also splashed the cash on Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Eric Bailly but were quiet in January and did not do any business. But Jose Mourinho has claimed United will be back in the market in the summer for \"two or three\" players which he has already identified. \"I think we will be ready in July to open the door for two or three good players to help us to improve our level,\" Mourinho told Sky Sports . \"We are stable in the way the team plays and we need one more push - the next push is the next transfer window. \"We didn't use it in the winter and we are obviously going to use it in the summer and trust the players we have. \"Like Mr [Ed] Woodward was saying, we will keep a huge percentage of the players we have at this moment in the squad. We need the next push.\" And when asked if he had already identified his two or three targets, Mourinho replied: \"Yes.\" United have been linked with a number of huge summer signings, including Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid and Barcelona's Neymar in recent weeks.
