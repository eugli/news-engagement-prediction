Bailey and his wife, actress Sha Cage, to premiere their movie at the Sundance Film Festival. It just felt like it. They were up against 9.000 other submissions in the short film category, and Sundance, as competitive as it is prestigious, selected just 68 — less than 1 percent — to showcase.\nTheir eight-minute family drama “New Neighbors” was filmed on one location for one day with five actors and a budget under $2,000.\n“We submitted and didn’t really put a lot of stock in it. Never in a million years did we expect we would get in,” Bailey said the day after they returned home from their film’s Sundance premiere. “It’s like Mount Everest. You dream of being there. Lives can change overnight. But it’s harder to get in there than into Harvard.”\nThe morning he got an e-mail from Sundance announcing that their film was accepted, “I literally ran into the room. Sha was saying, ‘What’s wrong, what’s wrong?’ ”\nWhen he told her and their sons Jordan, 7, and Jalen, 5, “we jumped up and shouted, ‘Congratulations!’ and we were dancing and the kids joined in, in their underwear, jumping around. It was pretty hilarious.”\nFor many young filmmakers, getting exposure at Sundance is a dream come true. Sundance is the go-to spot for creative people, businesspeople and audiences looking to discover the next big thing, as much a launchpad for promising new talent as it is for potential hit films. It can lift a newcomer such as “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle from a virtual unknown into a highly sought-after Hollywood success story.\nAnd while mainstream Hollywood still struggles to hire black writers and directors, offering exposure to filmmakers of diverse backgrounds is a significant part of Sundance’s mission.\nThe list of breakout filmmakers and actors who got their first major exposure in Park City is long, and it features a number with strong local connections. It’s where Joel and Ethan Coen premiered their Minnesota-funded debut, the hard-boiled black comedy “Blood Simple,” 32 years ago and won the Grand Jury Prize. The locally filmed college satire “Dear White People,” written and directed by first-time director Justin Simien, won a special jury award for breakthrough talent there in 2014. It returns as a 10-episode network series on Netflix on April 28.\nNow Bailey and Cage, longtime collaborators in multidisciplinary fields from Guthrie theatrical productions to radio to spoken-word performance to poetry, have a chance to follow a similar path — if not through this year’s movie, then through the next or the one after that. After presenting their film, about a black mother introducing her family to the all-white residents of their new Twin Cities neighborhood, Sundance programmers told them, “We will stay with you whether it takes a year or 10 years to do something.”\n“Becoming a part of that is phenomenal,” Bailey said. “There is a validation that comes with it.”\nHe added, “Sometimes when you’re in a market like Minnesota, it’s a small market. It’s not always a market where people say, ‘Let me look here for filmmakers.’ And so you make work and it may not get out” unless it’s introduced to the film industry in a major national showcase.\n“We met with production companies that are interested in having us pitch them work,” he said, “big industry meetings that would have been impossible” otherwise.\nGuthire’s Haj part of the mix\nThis year there were significant opportunities for the local theater community to form new Sundance contacts, especially veterans of the Guthrie. The theater’s artistic director, Joe Haj, was invited last summer to join the Sundance Institute Theatre Program for a two-week creative retreat in Arles, France, which he called “an astonishing thing.”\nMeeting with a group of international theater makers, “We tried to solve all the problems of the American theater and the world around these dinners. It’s a major, major generator of art and a major regenerative force for artists.”\nEven more important to Haj, the gathering gave him a rare opportunity to set aside the daily demands of running a theater institution and concentrate on staging risk-taking work. He spent his free time digging into his latest project: “Making a ‘King Lear’ worth watching.”\nAmong his creative partners in staging the new production, now running at the Guthrie through April, were Bailey as assistant director and Cage, playing the King of France. Even though this is the Guthrie’s first presentation of “King Lear” in two decades, rehearsed for five weeks before opening, Haj was convinced that the two of them should take a week off before the opening to travel to Utah for their film’s premiere.\n“In any major theater, to have anybody leave for a couple days can really throw off a production, especially assistant directors or actors,” Bailey said. “And I have to say I really appreciate the support of Joe Haj in being so generous in allowing us to go and experience that.”\nCage said, “They were happy for our success, like it was their success. We are on fire now. We’ve got a million and one ideas right now, and we have a unique energy that’s grounded in our cultural narratives. I believe if we get one door open, five more are going to open.”\nHaj said, “It seemed obvious that they would come back to the theater with a lot of energy and a sense of excitement. It was thrilling how E.G. and Sha came back so full from that experience. And of course, that reflects on the ‘Lear’ rehearsal room, as well. We’re very proud.”\nAnd not just from the Guthrie’s standpoint, he said. With about 500 professional actors mixed throughout the Twin Cities, he feels that the area has a shared acting company that all can feel pleased with.\n“How they move from theater to theater to film is, I think, a great feather in the cap of this region. It has such extraordinary artists by any measurement,” Haj said.\nCage said Haj’s wife, Deirdre, was one of the first to support “New Neighbors.” Director of North Carolina’s acclaimed Full Frame Documentary Film Festival and a board member of the Twin Cities filmmaking organization IFP Minnesota, Deirdre Haj promoted the project during an on-stage conversation when it screened at Walker Art Center’s politically timely Cinema of Urgency series. It found another advocate there in IFP Minnesota executive director Andrew Peterson, whose nudge to connections in Sundance’s programming team encouraged Bailey in his plan to submit it.\n“I think any major marketplace for the arts, whether it’s here in the Twin Cities or New York or Sundance or Toronto, is going to be valuable to other artists,” said Deirdre Haj, who has long-term creative connections to Sundance through her own festival.\n“If you stay in your own echo chamber and work with the same people over and over again, you’re never going to grow. So anything that interrupts that is a creative spark for something new. I think that’s enormously valuable.”\nIt is equally important because, while the amount of money invested in the arts per capita in the Twin Cities is second only to New York City, “we don’t have that infrastructure or leadership in the film community here. Which is weird,” she said.\nActors contribute, too\nThe Guthrie’s acting troupe also was visible at Sundance 2017 with supporting roles in “Wilson,” a dark comedy about family dysfunction starring Woody Harrelson and Laura Dern. Shooting in the Twin Cities in 2015, director Craig Johnson filled the film’s 50-plus speaking parts with members of the theater’s acting company.\nDuring an interview after the film’s Sundance premiere in January, he praised Guthrie stalwarts Shawn Hamilton, Richard Ooms, Rachel Weber and Bruce Bohne by name. “There’s such a tremendous depth of talent there. It was wonderful to work with all of them,” Johnson said.\nSundance is sometimes called Disneyland for film nerds, and beyond nonstop busy days in screenings and industry meetings, Bailey and Cage found time to enjoy it in those terms. “We brought the munchkins,” Cage said, making their film debut a family trip with time to go snow tubing with the children.\nThat was the part of the “phenomenal” trip that Cage remembers with the greatest happiness.\n“E.G. was telling Jordan, ‘Thank you for coming to Sundance and our screening,’ and Jordan replied, ‘I’ll always be at your special moments, Daddy.’ That’s the Quote: that made us melt.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:58:34.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
