Lindsay Lohan claims she was ‘racially profiled’ while traveling for wearing headscarf Posted at 11:59 am on February 21, 2017 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nRacially profiled? \nNot to be nitpicky but wouldn’t thinking only certain races of people wear headscarves make you a racist? \nIt’s so hard to tell with today’s progressive brouhaha. \nAnyway, Lindsay Lohan seems to think she was racially profiled at Heathrow Airport because of a headscarf: Lindsay Lohan claims she was 'racially profiled' at Heathrow Airport while wearing a headscarf https://t.co/ASM9881R2P pic.twitter.com/8eIxBygMMe \n— Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) February 21, 2017 \nNo, we’re not making this up. \nAlthough she could be making it up … who knows. Trending 'What are y'all smokin'? Women's March champions menstrual equity, is mocked ruthlessly \nPer Lohan: \n‘When I was flying to New York recently. I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped at the airport and was racially profiled for the first time in my life.’ \nHuh? Alrighty then. \n— Ó Scolaid Òg (@WeWhoDieSaluteU) February 21, 2017 \nApparently Headscarfian is a race we’ve never heard of before. @DailyMailCeleb anything for attention \n— bet (@betmartin1957) February 21, 2017 \nSadly this is probably more true than not. She can't get insured to star in a movie so now she's playing dress up to pretend she's being profiled and discriminated a/g? Sounds legit. https://t.co/mWKwUMRRdY ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:10:16.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
