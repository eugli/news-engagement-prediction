This boom has been buoyed by record lending to first-time buyers, separate figures published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders show. They borrowed £53.2billion in 2016, up 13 per cent on the previous year and the most since the CML started collecting data in 1974. In total, home buyers borrowed £127.7billion last year, up 7 per cent.

Last night MPs and estate agents said the resilience of the housing market had proved the ‘doom-mongers’ wrong. Last year the Remain campaign, led by former chancellor George Osborne, warned that even the uncertainty before the referendum would put the brakes on the housing market in the first half of the year as prospective buyers put any purchases on hold.
