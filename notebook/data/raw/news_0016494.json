After hearing about the Republican-backed legislation, Young said \"I'm trying not to laugh. \n\"Young said Republicans are trying to use \"scare tactics\" and says this bill goes \"beyond the pale.\" He says that he does \"not take [the sanctuary city legislation] lightly\", and says this will not change council or the mayor's mind. \nColorado is the only other state in the Union considering similar legislation.
