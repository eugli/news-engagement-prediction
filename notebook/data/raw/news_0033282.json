Indian media reports say police have entered the resort to arrest her. \nActing chief minister O Panneerselvam, who alleges he was forced to resign to make way for Sasikala, is likely to now stake a claim for the post. \nNever given any formal role by Jayalalitha in the party or the state government, Sasikala's role was always that of aide and confidante. \nBut analysts say her proximity to power allowed her and her extended family to wield huge influence. \nSasikala's influence over Jayalalitha also became the source of intense media speculation and tabloid gossip. \nHer appointment as chief minister elect by the ruling party had created outrage in Tamil Nadu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:12:02.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
