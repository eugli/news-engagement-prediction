And unlike many records that seem revolutionary in the moment, \"Kings\" has managed to retain its quirky charms, from the Burundi beats that set the tone for \"Dog Eat Dog\" to the chanting of Native American tribe names on the final track, \"The Human Beings.\"\nThe most unusual quality, of course, was Adam Ant, who threw himself into the cult of personality he'd fashioned with an odd blend of camp and conviction while urging the listener to \"Unplug the jukebox / And do us all a favor / Yeah, that music's lost its taste / So t-ry another flavor / Antmusic.\"\nAnt checked in from England to talk about the album as he was preparing to launch a U.S. tour that makes its way to Tucson on Saturday, Feb. 11, on which he's playing the entire album and following through with a survey of his catalog, including such obvious choices as \"Stand and Deliver,\" \"Vive Le Rock\" and \"Goody Two Shoes.\"\nQuestion: How does it feel to go out and perform this album? \nAnswer: Well, I did it the year before with “Dirk Wears White Socks,” the first album with Adam and the Ants, and that worked really well. And the “Kings” album, obviously, is a special one. It’s probably my favorite album. So we’ve been paying great attention to detail. It’s a labor of love every night, trying to get it as close to the album as humanly possible. It’s a challenge but it’s good. We enjoy it.\nQ: You said it’s probably your favorite album. Why is that? \nA: Well, it was the first time we enjoyed success commercially and we didn’t compromise ourselves. It was the way we wanted it to be. I think it was a real experimental piece, really, and it’s one of those ones that seemed to come together at the right time. We were in the right place at the right time. So I was very grateful for that.\nAdam Ant   (Photo: Courtesy of the artist) \nQ: You mentioned having done the “Dirk Wears White Socks” tour before this. That’s a very different sort of album. Could you talk a bit about how your approach evolved from “Dirk” to “Kings”? I mean, I know the lineup changed but so did your approach. \nA: It was a lot more sort of glamorous and colorful. And more of a hybrid. The source material was based on heroic characters like pirates and highwaymen, who were great inspirations to me. And the Native American Indian culture impressed me and still does. It really did take it from there. But it was a really positive kind of celebratory record, I think, stating our case and being quite proud of what we were doing. It was unusual for a rock and roll record.\nQ: Among the things I love the most about that record is it seems to have retained that quality that made it sound like nothing else in 1980. \nA: Well, I’ll tell you, we didn’t want to sound like anybody else. Or look like anybody else. And I think we were successful in that effort. Maybe that’s why it’s lasted, because it didn’t try to jump on any bandwagon or be part of any particular movement or scene. It just had an energy of its own, really. And that fortunately appears to have lasted. Certainly, when we perform it live, it’s got an energy of its own.\nQ: Did something in particular inspire the use of two drummers and the overall percussive nature of the album? \nA: Well, I needed two drummers because of the beats I’d been listening to. The Burundi beats and these different tribal beats I wanted to incorporate. I remember seeing James Brown at the Hammersmith Odeon. He had two drummers and that was quite powerful – one to hold the beat, one to do all the flourish-y bits. That really did impress me also. I was learning from those who went before me. Different elements went into the sound and fortunately to a great degree I think they seemed to blend so that the sound itself did stand out a bit.\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Phoenix local music news | Concerts this week | February concert guide \nQ: (Sex Pistols manager) Malcolm McLaren recruited the guys who played on “Dirk” for Bow Wow Wow while he was also serving as your manager. \nA: It was a bit of a mutiny, really, but we all made up a few years later. And a couple of those guys played with me on the “Dirk” show at the Hammersmith Odeon a couple years ago. But it had to happen. And it eventually was best for both of us. I moved on and did “Kings,” which has a bit of grandeur about it. I think the tympani drums were different from what Bow Wow Wow were doing, which was also very good but different.\nQ: You probably wouldn’t have made the record “Kings” turned out to be if those guys hadn’t quit. \nA: I don’t think so. No.\nQ: When you were in Bazooka Joe, before the Ants, you played on the Sex Pistols first show. What impact did that have on you? \nA: Well, that was their first gig, supporting the band I was in, in 1975 in London. They turned up and I thought their general demeanor, attitude and the simplicity of it was very effective. So it was a bit of a catalyst. I realized that this is perhaps the future. So I quit the band I was in that night and got on forming my own band. It really made you want to start your own band and get on with it. So that was the effect for me, really – the attitude. There were no rules left. You made your own rules, which was an unusual thing to be able to do.\nAdam Ant   (Photo: Courtesy of the artist) \nQ: Did you see yourselves as part of the punk scene? \nA: We always felt on the outside of it, not really part of that gang. We had our own gang, as it were.\nQ: What do you think it was about “Kings of the Wild Frontier” that you were able to connect with people in a way you hadn’t – at least not on that scale – with “Dirk”? \nA: It had very catchy hooks. And it’s quite colorful and quite exciting with heroic characters, and I think people tend to respond to that. Who knows what attracts people to a particular band or look or sound?\nQ: From what I’ve read, the U.K. rock press wasn’t wild about you guys at first. Was “Kings” received more favorably? \nA: A little bit. There was a bit more of a reaction at the start than there was before, and I think they saw the benefit of it. Then again, it’s a bit hard to argue with a hit record. After several years of saying it was rubbish, for it to be successful kind of took the wind out of their sails in terms of knocking it. A lot of them changed their attitude about the band.\nQ: What do you recall of the making of “Kings of the Wild Frontier?” \nA: It was in a very remote studio in Wales, Rockfield Studios, and there were no distractions. It was done in the countryside. So we just concentrated on the work. And it got done pretty quick. The remoteness, I think, benefited us.\nAdam Ant   (Photo: Courtesy of the artist) \nQ: What impact do you think your appearance on “Top of the Pops” that first time had on the album’s success? \nA: It was very important. I think it’s the first time the public were able to make their own minds up and nobody else. The public saw and thought, “We like this and we’re going to get this.” So that was quite gratifying.\nQ: In 2013, you came back with your first album in 16 years. How did it feel to be back in the studio creating new music again? \nA: It always feels good to be doing new work and moving forward.\nQ: Have you thought at all about the next release? \nA: There’s always things in the pipeline. I’ve got stuff that I’ll be working on. I have to finalize all that and see what happens.\nQ: Do you think diving back into these albums will have any sort of impact on the music you make going forward? \nA: I don’t know. I mean, playing live gives you a great energy that extends into the songwriting. And creativity is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets.\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
