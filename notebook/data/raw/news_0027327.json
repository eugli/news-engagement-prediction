But the search giant can also take over your TV with its Chromecast , a streaming dongle that got a colorful makeover in 2015 and a 4K \"Ultra\" upgrade this year. \nThe Chromecast was atop Amazon's list of best-selling electronics for two years until Amazon stopped selling streaming devices that don't support its Prime Video streaming service. Not to worry, the gadget is still available directly from Google, as well as Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and Staples. \nThe Chromecast Ultra will set you back $69, but it's really for those who already have a 4K TV; be sure to check out the differences between the two devices before picking one up. \nWhichever one you choose, part of the Chromecast's appeal lies in its pure portability, but there's also the price: just $35 to wirelessly stream Netflix, Spotify, HBO, Hulu, and more from your mobile device or PC to the TV. Not to mention apps for music, working out, and catching up on sports. When the Chromecast was released in July 2013 , it quickly sold out , and is still going strong. Sales have now topped 30 million. \nWhile the ultraportable device is pretty much plug and play , there are a few tips and tricks that can make casting more magical. Check them out in the slideshow.
