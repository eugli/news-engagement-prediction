Critics say she has been fighting with staff and families ever since. \nTownsend Harris Student Union President Alex Chen led Friday’s demonstration, the latest in a string of student protests against the unpopular principal. \n“Jahoda needs to go,” Chen told the cheering crowd. “She’s damaged our school. Now we need to heal.” Student Union President Alex Chen led the demonstration. (Susan Watts/New York Daily News) \nStudents and parents accuse Jahoda of threatening kids’ chances of attending college by withholding their transcripts, refusing to help students with disabilities and ignoring Muslim student leaders when they reported discrimination. \nJahoda, 55, has said the accusations against her are inaccurate and has a clean disciplinary record with the city Education Department. \nLocal politicians, including Queens Assemblywoman Nily Rozic, called on city schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña to remove Jahoda in a letter sent to Fariña earlier this week. Muslim Students Association co-president Sangida Akter speaks out. Acting principal Rosemarie Jahoda has been accused of ignoring reported Muslim discrimination. \nRozic said she supports the protesting students. \n“I stand with the students and the school community in opposition to Ms. Jahoda,” Rozic said. \n“Our students deserve better and the community has rightfully come together repeatedly to voice their frustration,” Rozic added. \nEducation Department officials said they will name a permanent principal for Townsend Harris by early May, but they will not say whether Jahoda is in the running for the permanent post.
