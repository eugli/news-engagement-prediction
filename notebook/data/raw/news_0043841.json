Fitness trackers may not aid weight loss, study finds Read more \n“I am sure that these apps are causing problems,” he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Boston. Hager cited the one-size-fits-all targets provided by some fitness trackers, such as the Fitbit, which sets users a goal of taking 10,000 steps a day. \nHager claimed the 10,000 steps target dated back to a 1960s Japanese study that showed there were health benefits for men who burned at least 2,000 calories per week through exercise – roughly equivalent to 10,000 steps each day. An early pedometer was known as the manpo-kei, which means “10,000-step meter” in Japanese. \n“But is that the right number for any of you in this room?” Hager asked. “Who knows. It’s just a number that’s now built into the apps.” \n“We have an incredible number of apps in the wild basically being downloaded by people who may or may not understand what they are actually telling them or what the context for that is,” he said. “Until we have evidence-based apps you could amplify issues. I mean, imagine everyone thinks they have to do 10,000 steps but you are not actually physically capable of doing that, you could actually cause harm or damage by doing so.” \nHowever, others suggested that the fears had been overblown. \nProf John Jakicic, of the University of Pittsburgh, whose team last year found that fitness trackers did not help people lose weight , said: “We need to be careful about relying solely on these devices. However, there is a place for these, and so we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, in my opinion.” \nSimon Leigh, a health economist at the University of Liverpool, said that of far greater concern were health apps that made recommendations about medication , such as adjusting insulin dosage. \n“These have the huge opportunity for error,” he said. “Exercise apps on the whole may result in a small number of incidents, but in general they are promoting healthy behaviours. So the opportunity for damage, although increased for some, such as diabetics who suddenly up their exercise, is likely to be minimal.” \nFitbit ambassador and former Olympian, Greg Whyte, said: “As 10,000 steps equates to around five to six miles, which will take around two hours, it is a daily target and not necessarily a single exercise session target.” \nHe added that over reliance on wearable tech could be a problem. “Remember, your tech works for you, not the other way around,” he said. \nThe Fitbit website states that the 10,000 target was designed to match the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommendation that adults should exercise for at least 150 minutes each week, and also notes that this target might not be suitable for those new to exercise. Can apps improve your mental wellbeing?

Then it was ripped off by unscrupulous fraudsters.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:06:01.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
