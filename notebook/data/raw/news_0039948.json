A lot. Just in the last few days, he’s claimed that the people outside his Mar-a-Lago resort were supporters, rather than resistance fighters. He’s already claimed today that he earned the “biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan,” conveniently forgetting George H. W. Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. He was even bragging, at today’s news conference, about the “massive crowds” at a rally that hasn’t even happened yet! \nNow we know the regime strategically traffics in lies. The formula is simple: one-third of the public will believe anything Trump or his people say. Therefore, you provide lies to fuel their fake news network. \nOne-third of the public is like us—reality based. We see the bullshit a mile away and stare incredulously at the brazenness of their lies. \nThe last third looks at all the arguing, shrug their shoulders, and say “both sides are arguing, so who can know the truth?” Maybe they even split the difference between reality and the regime’s lies. “Trump says 3 million voted illegally, reality says 0 million did. So the truth might be 1.5 million?” \nSo if one-third believe the lies, and one-third is confused into submission, that means that in the end, only one-third actually knows the truth . Mission accomplished. Republicans need an ignorant electorate to survive. \nSo as a strategy, that works great for the regime. But as for Trump, is he a willing participant in this charade, or does he actually believe the bullshit? Does he actually look at those protesters and, in his mind, see supporters? Does he walk around truly believing his victory was the greatest since sliced bread? \nNo one can truly know, but what do you think?
