The choice, however, as TheAntiMedia.org's Nick Bernabe reports, is not being celebrated by everyone in the party . In fact, the progressive so-called “Bernie Sanders wing” of the Democratic Party is up in arms, using the hashtag #DemExit, over Perez’ win. \nProgressives favored Keith Ellison, who was backed by Bernie Sanders, and see Perez as another establishment tool that conspired to boost Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 primary. As The Intercept noted , Perez was overly friendly to big banks as secretary of labor under Obama, granting privileges to banks that plead guilty to market manipulation. \nCalls for a #DemExit have now began to resurface, and Twitter has been flooded with disgruntled Democrats looking to leave the party. You can see the progressive meltdown unfold in the tweets below: \n\n— Filthy Pleb (@flowerpower4420) February 25, 2017 Inside the mind of new #DNCChair Tom Perez: Email to John Podesta during his campaign against @SenSanders https://t.co/EoJNbOffN5 pic.twitter.com/PAyXo3lBLW ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T18:22:47.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
