We have submitted a memorandum to the CEC where we have pointed out there has been security breaches in strongrooms where the EVMs are kept”. \nAlso Read | AAP asks EC to impose restrictions on activities near EVMs in Punjab \n“We have also mentioned that the May 2015 notification of the EC, which lists out instructions regarding the storage, physical verification and movements of EVMs, is not being complied with,” Sisodia said. \nAlleging that EVMs were moved out of a strongroom in Patiala, he termed it “absolute violation of EC norms”. \n“The returning officer, along with a few other officials entered the strongroom on the pretext of procuring certain documents. It was, however, found that they were moving steel boxes in which the EVMs were kept. We have demanded an inquiry into the matter,” Sisodia said. \nAAP leader Raghav Chadha alleged that in some districts, EVMs are kept in schools where there is regular movement of teachers. “Also, as per the May 2015 notification, there has to be uninterrupted power supply to strongrooms and EVM warehouses so that the CCTV cameras are operational 24x7 and any movement can be captured. “But there have been instances of no electricity for three hours in some places which is a violation of the rules and needs to be looked at,” Chadha said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:05.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
