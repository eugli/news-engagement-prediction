Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Brutal Tory cuts have sliced more than £1billion off spending for social care, devastating research reveals.\nTheresa May has boasted she is giving councils \"more money\" for care as she refuses their demands for a fresh cash pot.\nYet 'real terms' spending - once inflation is counted - has plummeted 8.4% since the Tories took power, the House of Commons Library said.\nIn a new briefing for MPs, the respected independent body said England's spending on social care was £14.4bn in 2016/17 - down from £15.7bn in 2010/11 when measured in last year's prices.\nRead More How much will my council tax be in 2017? Our payments calculator as bills soar for social care The figures emerged today as town halls warned of more cuts to bin collections, parks, libraries and leisure centres after ministers failed to offer extra cash from April. \nThe House of Commons Library revealed how spending has fallen in real terms (Photo: House of Commons Library) Cash-strapped councils had pleaded for new funds as they face a £5.8bn budget black hole by 2020 - £2.6bn of which relates to social care.\nBut the final local government finance settlement for 2017/18, slipped online by Tory ministers at 8pm on Monday night, did not make any new offer of help.\nLocal Government Association boss Lord Porter condemned the \"hugely disappointing\" statement and warned even 5% council tax hikes, planned by more than half of authorities, will not plug the huge gap.\nThe Commons Library also confirmed his warning that the benefits will vary massively across England - saying poor areas will lose out.\nCouncils \"with higher levels of deprivation tend to have a lower potential amount per head to raise\" by hiking bills 5%, the Commons Library said.\nAnd it showed deprived areas benefit less from hiking council tax by 5% (Photo: House of Commons Library) Lord Porter said: \"Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers remain united around the desperate need for new government funding for social care.\n\"By continuing to ignore these warnings, social care remains in crisis and councils and the NHS continue to be pushed to the financial brink.\"\nHe added: \"This will push councils perilously close to the financial edge over the next few years and force them all to make significant reductions to the local services communities rely on, including filling potholes, collecting waste, maintaining our parks and green spaces and running children's centres, leisure centres and libraries, to plug growing funding gaps.”\nThe government’s summary of the settlement shows English councils' ‘core spending power’ falling from £43.3bn in 2016/17 to £43bn in 2017/18.\nShadow Communities Secretary Teresa Pearce branded the settlement \"smoke and mirrors – pushing numbers around but not offering any new money\".\nShe added: \"Shifting the burden on to council tax payers creates a postcode lottery in social care services. Wealthy areas will prosper whilst poorer communities will struggle.\n\"Libraries, youth centres and Sure Start centres have closed. Child protection services are creaking. Frail elderly people and vulnerable disabled people are being left lonely and isolated.”\nPrime Minister Theresa May told MPs in December: \"The government are putting more money into social care through the better care fund, and by the end of this Parliament it will be billions of pounds extra… We have been putting more money into social care and health.\"\nThe government is letting councils raise up to £900m extra for care over the next two years, but £240m of this comes from raiding another council pot, the New Homes Bonus, and the rest comes from council tax.\nA Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"Our historic 4-year funding settlement gives councils the certainty they need to plan ahead, with more than £200 billion available until 2019/20 to spend on services local people want.\n\"The figures published yesterday simply confirm the final funding allocations for the second year of the four year offer accepted by 97% of councils.\"\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Conservative Party NHS Theresa May Government cuts Council tax Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:32:55.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
