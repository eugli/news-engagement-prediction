'The more you learn the less you know,' she cryptically posted last Thursday. 'Question f***ing everything'. Relationship goals no more: Alexis and Jay (here together in February 2016) have been an item for around two years 'Made me think of you': Alexis has been showing her ex exactly what he's missing, posting this sultry picture at the weekend Ouch: She used her well-followed Twitter account to blast her ex's manhood She went on to add: 'How you feel is not my problem & how I feel is not your problem,' appearing to talk directly to her ex despite confirming she'd blocked him. 'Love will teach you,' Alexis continued, with a philosophical follow up that read: 'That time you confused a lesson for a soulmate.' In response to questions about why she split with Jay, the beautiful star told fans that it was 'crazy' how wrong she'd been about her ex-beau. Betrayed? She seemed to imply that she had been misled during her relationship Wrong: She used her rant to prove that she had been wrong but learned a lesson Being used? She insinuated that she felt used by her relationship with the filmmaker No longer followed: The original 'realtionship goals' pair are no longer following each other Fame: She hinted that fame had been a contributing factor to the demise of their relationship Self love: She branded the model a 'f***boy' in her explosive rant '[It] was a manipulated as f*** ending,' she added. 'Pushed me to my limits so I broke it so he wouldn't get blamed for ending it.' Alexis' relationship with Jay is her most famous because they are still dubbed the original 'relationship goals' couple, who have worked together on producing beautiful travel content since around 2015. Even though fans began to speculate that the picture-perfect romance between Alexis and Jay was over in August 2016 - with some even speculating that he had moved on with a Danish model - Jay's last post about Alexis seemed to have been this January. On the sweeter side to their relationship, Alexis previously said of Jay in August 2015 that he made her feel beautiful every day. Beautiful: The couple had seemed like a perfect match at first (here in December 2015) Marriage material: Fans speculated that the relationship had come to an end in late December She told For Love & Lemons : 'I'm not up early for my workout I usually wake up to him rubbing my back or kissing me. 'I never wake up not feeling like the prettiest girl in the world with him.' Continuing her Twitter rant on Sunday, Alexis seemed to suggest that there was an ulterior motive for Jay moving on from Alexis and that 'fame' had changed him. She wrote: 'The relationship wasn't good for his business anymore. F***ed uuup' and she added: 'Love makes you blind tho I can't deny I felt something was wrong.' Found fame: Alexis found fame on Instagram, thanks to her enviable looks Striking: Her Instagram is filled with incredible pictures of the star Read more: Share or comment on this article 71 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:24:36.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
