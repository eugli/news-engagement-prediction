FACEBOOK \nWhen Alex Morley came across Shelley Crooks she was standing on the bank of the Fox River, her clothes discoloured, her shoes in tatters. \nMorley, a recently arrived visitor from the UK, was looking for a place to cross the Fox River, near Dilemma Creek Gorge about 6pm, when he noticed the tall woman standing beside the rapidly flowing water. \nREAD MORE: \nMorley said he was about six hours into his day tramp and was surprised to see anyone else, so he yelled a \"hello\". The woman did not respond. JOANNE CARROLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nAlex Morley found Shelley Crooks near Dilemma Creek, six weeks after she was reported missing. \n\"I thought, 'that person doesn't look like they're having much fun'.\" \nHe walked up to the woman and noticed she was distressed. \nCrooks' outdoor clothing was discoloured and she seemed vacant – barely talking above a whisper. \nWhat was left of her shoes hung in tatters, Morley said. Ad Feedback \n\"When I first saw her shoes I thought she'd just wrapped some rags around her feet.\" \nHe was aware there was a woman missing in the area, and while he didn't remember her name, he recalled the woman was about six-feet tall (1.83 metres). The woman standing before him was about the same height. SUPPLIED \nShelley Crooks was found in West Coast bush after going missing before Christmas. \nMorley said Crooks had lost weight: \"She looked a lot rougher than her pictures.\" \nHe put two-and-two together and started asking the woman questions about how long she had been in the bush and to what extent her feet were injured. \nThe 36-year-old Opotiki woman had last been seen in Punakaiki, 44 kilometres north of Greymouth, on December 22. \nShe said she had spent the past six weeks in the bush, after setting out on a four-day tramp and becoming lost. \nNeither Morley or Crooks had search beacons – Crooks said hers had been washed away during a river crossing, along with her sleeping bag. \nMorley couldn't get reception on his phone so he left her with his sleeping bag, some energy-rich snacks and clean water. \n\"The adrenaline took over,\" he said. \nThe 44-year-old plunged into the river, with his phone between his teeth, and was almost swept away. \nHe hopped out and found a safer place to cross, then made his way west out of the bush towards the Fox River Bridge, where the local Sunday markets were held. \nMorley said he was not the fittest guy and definitely was not a runner, so took breaks along the way to sip on water and ease his cramps. \nHe made it to the site shortly before 7pm, where he dumped his bag and ran towards a phone. \nLocals helped him make calls to emergency services. \n\"At which point I accepted a beer,\" Morley said. \nCrooks was then picked up by the West Coast Rescue Helicopter and flown to hospital in Greymouth. \nHer family arrived on the West Coast from Opotiki on Monday and a statement from the West Coast District Health Board said Crooks was recovering in hospital. \n\"[She is] pleased to be reunited with her family. She is focusing on getting well and has asked for privacy,\" it said. \nPolice said Crooks used her extensive bush craft knowledge to survive six weeks in the bush with a leg injury. \nShe had told a friend she was hitchhiking to Opotiki in the Bay of Plenty, where she was originally from. \nGreymouth search and rescue was not involved in the search but said on Facebook Crooks was a \"very lucky girl\". \n\"Great she was found just a shame she didn't leave a note with someone where she was going and expected return dates. We could have possibly saved her many weeks.\" \nGreymouth police sergeant Michel Bloom said Crooks had set out to do a four-day walk in the Mt Bovis area when she became disorientated and sustained a leg injury. \n\"This is a remarkable story of survival . . . She was well-equipped and has extensive bush craft knowledge, enabling her to survive for six weeks as she attempted to slowly make her way out of the bush.\" \nThe DOC website says the Inland Pack Track is 25km long from Punakaiki to Fox River. The area where Crooks was found was near Dilemma Creek which has many river crossings. \n\"There are many river crossings along the Inland Pack Track, so a fine weather forecast is a must..Streams can rise very quickly following rainfall and a swollen river should never be crossed,\" according to the website. \nPolice said Crooks wanted to express her gratitude to the tramper who found her, and everyone involved in the search and rescue efforts to try and locate her. \nMorley said he was due to leave the West Coast on Friday but his motorbike broke down. He was also considering tackling another track during Waitangi weekend but picked the Inland Pack Track due to the poor weather. \n\"I don't believe in fate and I don't believe in karma but I just happened to be in the right place at the right time,\" he said. \nMorley had worked in conservation and the outdoors all his adult life but was not expecting to help in a rescue mission during his time in New Zealand. \n\"I came to New Zealand to learn bird song and learn about trees and nature conservation practices in New Zealand.\" \nHis weekend plans included eating dumplings outside his tent at the Ballroom Overhang - a local geography feature. \n\"It was quite a traumatic experience. And it was almost certainly a lot worse for Shelley and her family.\" \nMorley said the thought of Crooks' young children drove him on, during the run back to the market site. \n\"If anybody's got an amazing ability, it's Shelley.\" \nIn January, John Crooks said his daughter enjoyed tramping and hunting and was capable of living without electricity. \n\"We've always been outdoor people ourselves, hunting, fishing, Shelley is a competent food gatherer, diver and she has lived without power as well so she does have that skill level,\" he said at the time. \n'POSITIVE OUTCOME' \nPolice thanked everyone who helped in their efforts to find Crooks during the past six weeks. \n\"We are ecstatic this had had a positive outcome.\" \nJohn Crooks said on Monday the family was \"really grateful for everything\". \nThe past six weeks had been \"terrible\". \nCrooks has four children – 5-year-old twins, an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old. The children live with other family members. \nSue Findlay, from the Punakaiki Beach Camp, said she was relieved to hear Crooks had been found. \nCrooks had last used her eftpos card when she stayed at the campground on December 21. \n\"It is amazing she's been found. I can't believe she's survived that long. I feel quite awful that she was out there fighting for her life and we were here going about our daily lives not very far away,\" she said. \nShe questioned why LandSAR had not been involved and whether police had checked the tracks with sniffer dogs in the six weeks Crooks had been missing. \nPolice had been working on reports that Crooks intended to hitchhike north. \nA police spokeswoman said police had not searched in the area where Crooks was found. \n\"We had received no information that she was still in that area. . . . We followed a line of inquiry that she had been hitchhiking.\" \nPolice on Tuesday refused to release further details about Crooks' \"remarkable survival\" tale, because \"it's Shelley's story to tell\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:27:40.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
