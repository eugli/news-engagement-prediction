Maybe the Beatles are insignificant to some of the post baby boom generation, but we could use more anniversaries like that to celebrate. \n[Wilson, 1996] \nThe Beatles never went out of fashion with the Americans … When they appeared on the Ed Sullivan show in 1965 [sic], American juvenile crime fell on that one night because everyone stayed home to watch it. \n[Robinson, 1997] \nThe fact that the Beatles story is old and well-told does not diminish its magnitude. On 9 February, 1963 [sic], for example, they almost literally stopped America. When they appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, 73 million people watched. As John Lennon later pointed out, even the criminals stayed home. And indeed, for that one sweet, manic hour, there was hardly any crime in the United States. false false ORIGIN \nThe phenomenon of Beatlemania that had been spreading throughout the U.K. (and other parts of the world) in 1962 and 1963 reached a crescendo in early 1964, when the Fab Four paid their first visit to America. After landing at New York’s Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964 (where approximately 3,000 hooky-playing teenage fans waited to experience their arrival), the group spent two weeks in the U.S., during which time they made live appearances on the highly-rated Ed Sullivan Show from both New York and Miami (and taped a third set of performances to be aired after their departure), performed their first concerts in North America (at the Washington Coliseum and Carnegie Hall), and attended innumerable press conferences, interviews, and record industry functions. \nNo aspect of that first U.S. visit looms larger in the Beatles’ legend than their initial appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show , a performance (actually two performances, since Ed Sullivan was cagey enough to put them on at both the beginning and the end of the program in order to keep the audience tuned in throughout) witnessed by an estimated 73 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:20:47.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
