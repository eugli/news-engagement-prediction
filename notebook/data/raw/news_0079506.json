Stephen Lovekin via Getty Images Donald Trump eating a piece of steak. \nMost people who order a 28-day dry-aged steak that costs over $50 will relish it for the carefully prepared piece of meat that it is. But Donald Trump ? He’s likely to order it well done and with a side of ketchup . \nAccording to the Independent Journal Review , that’s just what the president did when dining out at BLT Steak by David Burke in D.C. on Saturday night. We’ve long known that Trump likes his steak well done , which according to experts in the food world is simply the wrong way to order meat . But eating it with ketchup just adds insult to injury. \nKetchup, a beloved condiment among children, has a powerfully sweet flavor. So strong that it overpowers other foods , such as the subtle umami flavors that can only be found in a $54 28-day dry-aged steak. Considering the other things we’ve learned that Trump eats , we’re not entirely surprised. But we are disappointed. And we aren’t the only ones. Twitter was outraged.
