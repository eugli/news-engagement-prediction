(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Soon movie fans and royalty fans will get to indulge their joint fantasies of touring Princess Grace Kelly's childhood home. \nPrince Albert II of Monaco, Grace's son and the current reigning prince of the tiny Mediterranean principality she married into, says the childhood home of his late mother will reopen to the public next year or earlier. \nAlbert told People that the Philadelphia home he purchased last year for $754,000 will house regional offices for the Princess Grace Foundation and a U.S. extension of Monaco's Princess Grace Irish Library. It will also be made available for public events once it is renovated. \nAlbert says that since the home sits in a residential neighborhood, \"it won't be exclusively a museum.\" \nThe brick, Georgian-style house on Henry Avenue and Coulter Street in the East Falls area was built by his grandfather, John B. Kelly, Sr., six years after Grace's birth in 1929. \nGrace grew up there in a household headed by her father, a three-time Olympic gold medal-winning rower in the 1920s, before she departed for Hollywood and movie-stardom — and an Academy Award in 1955 for The Country Girl . \nGrace Kelly before she became Princess Grace of Monaco.

I remember rolling about on the carpet in the living room. The house is filled with little moments like that. Moments of being a family.” Prince Albert of Monaco buys Grace Kelly's childhood home in Philadelphia \nThe 4,000-square foot house stayed in the Kelly family until 1974, before being purchased by Marjorie Bamont, who lived there for more than 40 years. She died April 20 at age 84. \nAlbert visited the home in October to discuss with locals his plans for it. At the time, he said he wanted to ensure residential and community concerns were addressed. \nMaintaining the neighborhood’s residential quality is essential, he said. “While it is a historical landmark, I don’t think that a dedicated museum is the right avenue to take. There will be, though, any number of events which will facilitate public viewing.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jSSNmJ NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
