There, he learned how to read and developed a love for learning.\nBut at the age of 15, when his \"owner\" died, he was forced to return to plantation life, where he endured years of hunger and beatings. \nAfter two unsuccessful attempts, he managed to escape from slavery in 1838, at the age of 20. He changed his name to Frederick Douglass.\nDouglass became a prominent abolitionist and suffrage campaigner. For 16 years he was the editor of an influential black newspaper and achieved international recognition as an inspiring speaker and writer.\nHe immortalised his years as a slave in Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. In this and his two subsequent autobiographies - My Bondage and My Freedom and The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass - he gave an insight into his experiences as a slave as well as a record of his escape and eventual freedom. \nAs well as fighting for African-American rights, Douglass also fought for women's rights. He held several public offices, and in 1872 became the first African American nominated for the vice presidency of the United States as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for presidency of the US.\nSource: Al Jazeera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:11:26.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
