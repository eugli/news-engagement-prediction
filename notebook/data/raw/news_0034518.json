A three-star officer is heading the panel. \nThe two countries have been discussing the project for several years but are yet to sign a $4-billion research and development (R&D) contract. India has already spent around $22 million on the preliminary design stage (PDS) of the FGFA project. \nThe Indian Air Force has flagged some concerns about the fighter’s design. It also wants the plane to have a more powerful engine as the existing one doesn’t give it super cruise capability. The ability to super cruise or sustain supersonic speeds in combat configuration without kicking in fuel-guzzling afterburners is a key Indian requirement.

The first prototype flew its maiden sortie in January 2010. \nIndia has a requirement for 120-130 such swing-role planes with stealth features for increased survivability, advanced avionics, smart weapons, top-end mission computers and 360-degree situational awareness. \nThe IAF does not have sufficient number of warplanes to tackle a combined threat from China and Pakistan. The count of IAF’s fighter squadrons has shrunk to 34 compared to a desirable strength of 42, a capability gap the air force is struggling to fill. \nThe IAF hopes to add more muscle with the induction of French-built Rafales, the indigenous light combat aircraft, more Sukhoi-30s, the FGFA and a medium-weight warplane to be built in India in collaboration with a foreign player. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:18.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
