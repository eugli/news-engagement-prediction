J. Wendell Mapson, Jr., senior pastor at Monumental Baptist Church of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, preaching a sermon in January 2017. \nThe Rev. J. Wendell Mapson, Jr., senior pastor of Monumental Baptist Church of Philadelphia, gave a lecture earlier this week sponsored by The Baptist Pastors and Ministers Conference of Philadelphia and Vicinity (BMPC) on the state of the church following the Barack Obama administration. \nIn an interview with The Christian Post, Mapson explained that a key theme of his lecture was that \"Christianity in America has been wedded to American patriotism and the biblical understanding of the faith has been compromised.\" \n\"Christianity has been separated from being Christ-like, meaning that the concern for the 'least of these' the lost and the left-out, the very people Jesus came to save,\" said Mapson. \n\"Many who claim the Christian faith are more patriotic than Christ-like. For them, personal salvation is more important than social justice.\" \nMapson also told CP that at the event \"feedback appeared positive and the response was encouraging,\" adding that it \"is the cross of Christ that remains at the center of our Christian witness, not the flag.\" \nThe lecture Mapson gave was the first of an annual lectureship named for the Rev. James S. Hall, pastor of Triumph Baptist Church and a former president of BPMC. \nIn addition to the lecture by Mapson, the one-day program concluded with a sermon by the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood from Brooklyn, New York. \nFree sign up cp newsletter!
