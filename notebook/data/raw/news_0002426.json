It’ll be one of four new Shamrock-branded drinks added to its existing seasonal mint-flavored milkshake. Shamrock syrup will also be squirted into its hot chocolate, mocha, and a chocolate chip frappe—a blended frozen coffee drink. \nOther off-the-menu McDonald’s items that may, in the future, find its way to the menu board: \nThe Mc10:30. A Big Mac where you substitute the middle bun with hashbrowns and the bottom beef patty with sausage. It’s a sandwich you can only get at 10:30 a.m. when the restaurants is changing over from its breakfast to lunch menu. \nThe McNeapolitan. One-third vanilla milkshake, one-third strawberry milkshake, one-third chocolate milkshake. \nThe McRussian. A Filet-O-Fish with an added hash brown, plus Big Mac special sauce in place of tartar. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .
