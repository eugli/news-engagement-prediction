It was a hit and run and have thus made a police report... I noticed there are 2 cars parked directly opposite my car, a black mercedes SFX425D and a white bmw SKG6217K, with in car video camera... Appreciate if they could provide me with the footage captured by their cameras, which will be of a great help to me... \nPlease help share for awareness! \n‎Andy Ng‎ A.S.S Contibutor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
