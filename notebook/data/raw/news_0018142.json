The interior ministry confirmed that explosives had been found. \nFrance, which will hold the first round of a presidential election in just over 10 weeks time, remains on high alert over possible Islamist militant attacks. \nMore than 230 people have died in a series of assaults since the beginning of 2015, and the country has been in a state of emergency since November of the same year. \n“The initial indications are that an imminent attack on French soil has been thwarted,” interior minister Bruno Le Roux said in the statement on Friday. \nThe government has said it foiled 17 attacks during 2016. In July, 86 people were killed when a man deliberately drove a truck into a crowd in the city of Nice . \nOn Friday, a makeshift memorial was being dismantled in Nice ahead of a carnival that was due to begin on Saturday. \nSeparately, a top French judicial body ruled as unconstitutional a law that aimed to catch would-be Islamist attackers. The law, which bans people from regularly consulting jihadi websites that encourage “acts of terrorism”, was brought in last June. \nLast Friday, a man was shot and seriously wounded when he attacked soldiers with machetes outside the Louvre museum in central Paris .
