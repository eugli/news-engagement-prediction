moves at training.\nJuly 4th 2016 8 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/Politics/ Australian soccer player Elli Carpenter shows off her skills. Parramatta Footballer Ellie Carpenter scores NewsLocal’s Junior Sports Star medal Tony Bosworth, Parramatta Advertiser February 23, 2017 12:00am Ellie Carpenter makes debut for Matildas at just 15 Rio 2016: Ellie Carpenter becomes Australia’s youngest Olympian SHE’S only 16 but footballer Ellie Carpenter has already proven age is no barrier in reaching the top of her game.\nShe became the first millennial athlete — born in the 2000s — to be selected in any national team, male or female, when she debuted for the Matildas in an Olympic qualifying game against Vietnam last year.\nThe Western Sydney Wanderers defender went on to make headlines as the youngest female footballer ever to compete at an Olympic Games when she took the field for Australia in Rio de Janeiro.\nmedia_camera Ellie Carpenter was the youngest girl to qualify for the Matildas. Picture: Adam Taylor\nNow Carpenter has taken out the top honour at the NewsLocal Junior Sports Star awards, winning the overall medal for outstanding performance in 2016. The awards, sponsored by Rebel, are open to rising sporting stars aged from 10 to 16 and were presented at a gala dinner held at Bicentennial Park’s Waterview conference centre on Wednesday night.\nCarpenter joins an illustrious list of past winners, many of whom have gone on to become household names in their chosen fields. They include dual Olympic kayak medallist Jessica Fox and former world champion discus thrower Dani Samuels.\nThe young footballer from Pemulwuy accepted the award by video, as she was en route with the Matildas to Portugal to take on Sweden, The Netherlands and China in an international tournament — the team’s first outing since the Olympics when they were eliminated in a heartbreaking penalty shootout by hosts Brazil.\nmedia_camera Ellie Carpenter exploring Brazil.

Picture: Jonathan Ng\n“I feel very honoured to receive the NewsLocal Junior Sports Star award as there were so many fantastic nominees this year,” she said.\n“It’s also great to be in the company of past winners such as Jess Fox and (Australian football and cricket representaive) Ellyse Perry.”\n“I have very specific goals I want to achieve in women’s football and it is such a huge focus in my life. I’m focused on Europe now and I want to try and raise the bar in my own game and hopefully become a more complete player.”\nOriginally from Cowra, Carpenter was talent-spotted at a football academy in Canberra. For several years, twice a week, she and her brother made a four hour round trip, driven by their parents, for specialist coaching in the national capital. They did their homework in the car on the way and did not get home until after 11pm.\nmedia_camera Ellie Carpenter of the Wanderers is challenged by Alyssa Mautz of the Glory during at match against Perth Glory.

It is truly a team effort.”\nCarpenter thrived and was the only girl selected for an academy tour of Japan.\n“I always played against the boys growing up in the country and they learned fairly quickly they didn’t have to go easy on me because I was a girl,” she said.\nCarpenter eventually moved to Sydney to continue her development at Westfield Sports High from where she was signed by the Wanderers. She made her debut at 15 and played every minute of the 2015 W-League season.\n“I think a fair amount of people underestimated me because of how young I am, but you’ve just got to prove them wrong.”\nmedia_camera Hills baseball junior team who represented Australia at the Little League World Series in the US earned the Team Spirit prize. Adam Yip/The Daily Telegraph\nNow in their 12th year, the Junior Sports Star awards turn the spotlight on outstanding young athletes with nominees publicised each week in NewsLocal’s community newspapers in Sydney and the Central Coast.\nMore than 600 athletes and their families attended last night’s dinner along with Renee Forth from the GWS Giants AFLW team, Sydney Kings basketball captain Kevin Lisch and 400m runner Jessica Thornton, another Rio Olympian, who won the Junior Sports Star medal in 2015.\nIn other categories at the awards, the Team Spirit prize went to the Hills Junior Baseball team which competed at the Little League World Series in the US and the Service to Sport award was presented to Norman Hill who has been a member of the Coogee Surf Life Saving club for 77 years. Supporting sponsors of the awards were SportsTG and Simonds Homes.\nmedia_camera Norman Hill, a member of Coogee Surf Life saving club for 76 years was presented with the Service to Sport category.
