Bowling his fourth over, Jayant bowled Warner round the legs, but the celebration immediately turned into disappointment after the umpire called it a no-ball. \nWatch the incident here: \nHowever, Warner could not make the best of the opportunity as he was bowled by Umesh Yadav. \nConsidering the number of cracks present on the pitch, skipper Virat Kohli introduced R Ashwin in the second over of the innings. Warner and Renshaw looked vulnerable against the spinners, but negated the spin with some aggressive shots.
