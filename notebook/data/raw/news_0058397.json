But you won’t catch longtime drummer Travis Barker grabbing sliders at a Grammy after party or munching a pulled pork sandwich off the catering table on tour. The dude looks like he hasn’t gained an ounce of fat since joining Blink in the late ‘90s (and we’d know -- he’s been shirtless almost the whole time) which probably has a lot to do with healthy eating habits. \n“I’ve been vegan for many years and vegetarian for even longer,” Barker says in a new video ad for PETA's \"Never Be Silent\" campaign, premiering today on Billboard . This time, the costar isn’t Mark Hoppus or Skiba, but his 11-year old daughter Alabama, a vegetarian herself. \n“Alabama is quite the animal lover,” says Barker. “She would have a farm if I had the land.” \nCheck out the video below, and watch the Barkers swap drumsticks for carrots, while shouting out some of their favorite veggie-inclined restaurants. And when you’re done, feast your eyes on fellow California punk alum Davey Havok, who stripped down for PETA last year .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:25:39.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
