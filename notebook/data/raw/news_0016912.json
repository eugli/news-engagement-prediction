Hits like 'Poker Face' & 'Just Dance' came off well, but her best performance came in the 'Million Reasons'.\nGaga opened the half-time show with a poignant medley of 'America the beautiful' and 'This land is our land' -- an alternative national anthem .\nThe subtle dig wasn't missed by one viewer - Hillary Clinton .\nThe former Presidential candidate, who lost out to Trump in the Presidential elections, tweeted her praise for Gaga.\n\"I'm one of 100 million Super Bowl fans that just went Gaga for the Lady, amd her message to all of us,\" she tweeted.\nI'm one of 100 million #SuperBowl fans that just went #Gaga for the Lady, & her message to all of us. https://t.co/8AoNqjwr1b\nâ€” Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 6, 2017\nCaught & clicked: Lady Gaga smoking marijuana on stage! 01:17\nAmerican Music Awards highlights 1 28 American Music Awards highlights Model and TV personality Heidi Klum arrives.
