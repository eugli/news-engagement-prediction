The family was sitting down preparing to eat, Channel 2 Action News reported.\nA restaurant is 1 of the last places I'd think a gun would accidentally go off.

Tate Washington told the news station.\nThis is the kind of holster the gun was in when the 2yr old got it out of his Mom's purse.

Snider said the investigation is ongoing.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TyishaWSB/status/831187827329265665", "https://t.co/VGxxeg2Phg", "https://twitter.com/TyishaWSB/status/831224416738635776", "https://t.co/APu3j7gzyo"], "published": "2017-02-14T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:22:03.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
