(Supplied: Defence) \nLater this week the F-35s will go on public display at the Avalon Air Show in Victoria, where they are expected to be met by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Defence Minister Marise Payne. \nEarlier this month the Defence Minister told the ABC the impending visit of the combat planes could send an important message to critics. \n\"I think it's an important undertaking and I think Avalon is a perfect time to do it,\" Senator Payne said. \n\"I know that the Air Force is particularly pleased to have the opportunity and I look forward to some chances for people who have been following this story for some time to actually see it over our own continent.\" \nThe Federal Government is preparing to spend $17 billion on 72 F-35 aircraft, with the first expected to be delivered to Australia in 2018 and enter service in 2020.
