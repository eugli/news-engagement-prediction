When the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation forensically investigated the phone they discovered he had paid for the pictures. They were able to track the payments to South Africa. “He was using wire transfers to send the money,” said Niemand. \nThe suspect, she said, was allegedly using Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with the girl and her family. \nUS authorities, she said, initially tracked the money transfers to an address in Port Elizabeth, but when police visited the premises they discovered the family had moved. The hunt then moved to Gauteng but again police discovered the family were no longer living there. \nThen, the police got lucky, Niemand said. Detectives obtained an address in Vredenburg. \nOn February 14, the police swooped and found the family. \nNiemand was able to piece together how the alleged crime unfolded. “He first befriended the child sending her messages. Then the mother jumped on to the bandwagon wanting payment. He would send messages asking for specific positions he wanted the girl to be photographed in.” \nPolice believe the mother had been allegedly sending photographs of her daughter for three years. “They told us they did it because they are unemployed and needed to buy food.” \nThe girl, Niemand added, had believed the man in the US was planning to marry her. \nPolice were surprised that the mother had no prior criminal record related to child pornography. \nThe Vredenburg arrests are just the latest in a number of high-profile child sex crimes that have rocked South Africa. \nOn Tuesday, the Metro police and SAPS raided a brothel in Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni. They found teenagers, some as young as 15 years old who were believed to be working as sexworkers. The teenagers were allegedly lured to the premises with promises of employment and opportunities to study further. \nNext month, 33-year-old Jayde Sheldon Bailey is to be sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court after it was discovered he was part of an international child pornography ring called the “gigatribe” that shared images among one another. \nBailey, the father of 15-month-old twin daughters, and his wife are alleged to have distributed footage of rape, torture, and the murder of babies, including newborns. \nThey are charged with importing, possession and distribution of films that encourage or promote child pornography or the sexual exploitation of children. \nThis investigation involved the SAPS, the FBI and Belgian police. \nSaturday Star ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:13:22.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
