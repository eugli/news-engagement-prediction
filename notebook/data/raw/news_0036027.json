Thankfully, there are DMs which might give you a better chance of being seen and heard. \nSeth Rogen realized that Donald Trump Jr . was following him, so he decided to send him a friendly tweet requesting that he tell his father to resign: Yo! @DonaldJTrumpJr ! I noticed you follow me on Twitter. Please ask your dad to resign before he destroys the planet. Thanks dude. \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nBut, then he realized that he could DM him, so he did that instead. He’s hoping to be able to get Donald Jr. to get his father to “go back to hosting game shows.” Let’s see if this works! pic.twitter.com/q5b3d8U4Nx \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 If @jasoninthehouse won’t investigate Flynn’s ties to Russia, maybe I can get his boss’ son to help me do it. pic.twitter.com/bmOfDDepC3 \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 Sliding in to your DMs like: pic.twitter.com/zsUT4e2CnG \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nSo far, Rogen hasn’t posted any responses. We’ll let you know how that goes. \n[Helga Esteb / Shutterstock, Inc.] \nHave a tip we should know?
