(Reuters Photo) PUNE: As India stare down the barrel in the first Test against Australia, the question being asked is whether the strategy of preparing a spin-oriented pitch has backfired on the hosts. At the end of the second day's play, 24 wickets had fallen for just more than 500 runs at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium here. India have chased a target of 387 for an improbable win against England in Chennai in 2008, but the Gahunje pitch could be far more difficult to bat on than the one at Chepauk was. \"There is nothing wrong with the wicket. It has not changed in the two days and it is not going to change in the remaining days,\" said Pandurang Salgaoncar , the host association's curator. \"We all knew since the beginning that the ball was going to turn. It turned for India, and so it did for Australia.\" What has made it interesting is the presence of BCCI curators Dheeraj Parsana and Daljeet Singh who have been overseeing the preparation of the pitch. So, the question is, who is ultimately responsible for rolling out a certain type of pitch? And, did the curators get any inputs from the team management regarding the same? Yet, it is not as if the pitch is diabolic. The fact that Australian openers stitched an 82-run partnership after electing to bat on Day 1 and that their No. 8 Mitchell Starc hit a stroke-filled halfcentury, not to mention India's own KL Rahul making 68, showed that batting could be difficult, but runs could be made with patience and careful shot selection.
