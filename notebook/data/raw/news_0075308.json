Chief Rochas Okorocha \nOkorocha added that Buhari’s administration was only laying the foundation for development. \n“This is not the time to weep or complain in the struggle to nationhood, it is a time to comply. Nigeria must write the history of this recession just like other developed nations in their journey to greatness. \n“President Buhari is building a strong foundation for sustainable growth of the nation. Whoever that is waiting for Buhari to build sky scrapers and historic tunnels may be wasting time as his job is to lay a solid foundation so that successive governments will have a good foundation to build upon. \n“We must all support him and pray for him as his coming as the President is divine and its purpose must be fulfilled. \nOkorocha who also conferred on Emeka Offor, the chairman governing council of the Imo state polytechnic also said that the days of frivolities has gone. \nHe said: “We must adopt wisdom by tying this institution around the neck of successful business men in our society because government alone cannot carry this responsibility. \n“To the graduands, the institution has honoured them with certificates after years of tiling, reading, burning candles, but let me tell you that this is the beginning of your journey. \n“The certificate in your hands would determine your future depending on how you apply and use it. The days of white collar jobs are gone. The days of frivolities are over. This is the time to think outside the box and see a way to contribute your quota to nationhood.” \nAlso the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Babachir David Lawal, said that corruption has dwarfed Nigeria and prevent it from progressing. \nThe SGF, who was conferred with a fellowship award of the institution noted that “What has held us down as a nation is corruption.” \nAccording to the release, “In this bid, we must in earnest commence a new journey of rapid and sustained economic growth that will usher in prosperity for all our citizens. \n“Despite the challenges that we are confronted with, Nigerians should not despair. The journey for a better Nigeria has commenced in earnest. \n“Nigeria being a great nation is not in doubt that with our population and natural resources our economy should be amongst the best in the world. What has held us down as a nation is corruption. \n“Corruption in government at all levels has totally destroyed our nation. It is evident in key sectors like educational system, healthcare delivery, infrastructural development and provision of social services. \n“Massive corruption has crippled our economy and dwarfed our individual potentials including limiting the enterprising and intellectual capacity of our people.” \nAlso, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:54:12.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
