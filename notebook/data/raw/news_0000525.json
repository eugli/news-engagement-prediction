Londoners visit the East London Mosque during Visit My Mosque Day last year (East London Mosque) \nMatthew Wilkinson, a research fellow at the Centre for Islamic Studies at SOAS, told the Standard the current political climate meant the day was particularly important to help “demystify the mosque”. \nHe said: “I think we’re seeing a perfect storm of polarisation. The combination of far-right fear mongering and the legitimate fear caused by Islamist terror is uniquely polarising. A sign for Visit My Mosque Day last year \n“It probably is a uniquely important time for mosque doors to be thrown open, to show it’s a place where people of other faiths are welcome and a place where human diversity is celebrated. \n“It’s not a panacea for anything but it’s important because Islam is a faith which tries to be open and encourages civility, and in the current climate these values have been lost or covered over.” A talk given at the East London Mosque during Visit My Mosque Day last year (East London Mosque) \nHarun Khan, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, also stressed the day’s importance in the current political landscape. \nHe said: “As the world recoils at President Trump’s so called ‘Muslim Ban’ and now the mass killing at a mosque in Canada, Visit My Mosque Day is a much needed antidote to the poisonous atmosphere we find ourselves in. \n“This Sunday, February 5, the British public, Muslim and non-Muslim have an opportunity to come together and renew bonds of friendship.” \nTo find your local Mosque visit the website .
