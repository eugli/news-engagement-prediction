They say the government hit the mark with 40,000 total refugees expected to enter Canada in 2017.\nBut 41 per cent say the total is too high, the Angus Reid survey reports.\nOnly 11 per cent said the number of refugees Canada is taking is too low and more should be allowed in.\nThis past weekend, the RCMP reported 22 asylum seekers were detained at Emerson, Manitoba.\nThe Angus Reid survey found while many communities across Canada have welcomed refugees, concerns still linger among a significant portion of the public regarding acceptance.\nClose to four-in-ten Canadians, or 38 per cent, say that many people in their community would not be welcoming to a refugee family. This number is highest in Quebec at 46 per cent and drops ten points below average in British Columbia at 28 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:46:42.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
