Palaubsanon   Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Lloyd Dino has tagged Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmena “anti-business and anti-poor.” \nIn a press conference yesterday, Dino said this is reflected in the mayor’s recent actions against businesses such as Banco de Oro, Filinvest Land Inc., Ayala and SM. \n“Definitely he is anti-business and anti-poor. Big businesses were being bullied. He is a bully,\" he said. \nIn particular, the mayor is going after BDO for allegedly lying on its income, while FLI recently announced it is rescinding its contract with the city for the purchase of 19.2 hectares of the South Road Properties, among others. \nDino said the situation has set a very bad precedent, making business owners and those who are supposed to invest in the city jittery. \n\"Businessmen are very jittery with what happened now and I want to calm them and show my support,\" he said.   \nHe was, however, unaware of the alleged report circulating in the business community that what made Osmeña upset at FLI, Ayala, and SM were the three payments made to the city when Michael Rama was city mayor despite Osmena telling them not to. \n\"I am not privy to that issue but if that is true then I think that matter has to be investigated,\" said Dino. \nHe said FLI withdrawing interest on the 19.2-hectare lot is a very alarming and sends the wrong signal that the city is not business-friendly and that the city is regressing instead of moving forward. \n\"Before, proud kaayo ta sa Ceboom. Karon wala nay Ceboom but Sibat na!\" Dino said, adding that if investors leave the city, Cebuanos, especially the poor, would be the ones to suffer. \nBusinessman and international designer Kenneth Cobonpue had said that with the situation aggravated by the traffic situation and the garbage problem of the city, they would think twice in doing business in the city, especially that there are other places in the country to invest in. \nMark Canton, co-convenor of the Movement for a Liveable Cebu, said that the business community in the city is now getting confused. \nDino said President Rodrigo Duterte is already aware about Osmeña’s “threat” to close all BDO branches in the city. \n\"The President knows about it and he is checking on it,\" Dino said. \nThe FREEMAN tried to contact the mayor for his comment on this but he was not available as of press time. \nMeanwhile, despite their differences, Dino said he supports the Cebu-Cordova bridge that Osmeña and former Cordova mayor Adelino Sitoy proposed. \n\"Of course I support that project. It is good for the Cebuanos. It will surely help lessen the traffic problem in Metro Cebu,\" Dino said. \nDuterte is expected to grace the groundbreaking ceremony of the multi-billion bridge on March 2 in Cordova town.
