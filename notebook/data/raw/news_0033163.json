The court listed the mater for February 28. \nThe court was hearing an application filed by Bhatia’s parents, who challenged a January 9 circular claiming that it has arbitrarily clubbed CWSN with the Economically Weaker Sections and Disadvantaged Group category.

There should be a separate quota for CWSN,” the petitioner said in his plea. \nThe counsel added that disabled persons require special attention in order to cross the barriers that they face. \n“This categorisation of children with disability, thus, stands distinct from others mentioned in the broader category of ‘disadvantaged group’,” the plea said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:53.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
