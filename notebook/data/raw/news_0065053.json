Gareth Bale Exclusive: Wales not doing a Leicester, THAT England loss & being a film star \nSo it’s quite understandable that St Etienne would rather Ibrahimovic wasn’t involved in tonight’s second leg. However, they’re not supposed to publicly admit that. \nBut their winger Romain Hamouma couldn’t help but be honest upon learning Jose Mourinho plans to play a strong side, despite holding a 3-0 advantage, and that Ibrahimovic will likely be involved. \n‘Ibrahimovic isn’t playing, right? He is? Shit!’ said Hamouma in the build-up to the game. Romain Hamouma is not looking forward to facing Ibrahimovic tonight (Getty) \n‘I mean, what can you say? How many goals has he scored against us? 17, right? \n‘What do you want me to say!?’ Manchester United fixtures \nSt-Etienne – Europa (A) – Wed 22 Feb Southampton – EFL (N) – Sun 26 Feb Bournemouth (H) – Sat 4 Mar Southampton (A) – Sun 12 Mar Middlesbrough (A) – Sun 19 Mar West Brom (H) – Sat 1 Apr Everton (H) – Tue 4 Apr Sunderland (A) – Sat 8 Apr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:34:17.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
