He looks gutted (Photo: yesalexkim/Twitter) \nBut another one would have been extra nice, we're sure. \nViewers immediately started speculating exactly how it happened, with some believing the presenters were handed the wrong card by producers. \nSome thought they were actually holding the card that announced Emma Stone as the winner of Best Actress in a Leading Role for La La Land, and therefore read out that film by mistake. \nBut Emma has revealed that that couldn't possibly be the case. \nHolding her Best Actress award, Emma spoke out backstage.
