There have been no prosthetic cheek implants, metallic blue lipstick, or lightning bolt-shaped liner. No more wild wigs or hats made of meat. Just classic, simple makeup looks like the one she wore at the AMAs . But all that changed tonight.   makeup was quintessential Gaga, complete with a shimmery purple eye shadow, bright red lips, and a crystal-studded mask that did a disappearing act halfway through her act (more on that in a second). \"My inspiration for Gaga’s makeup look was…Gaga,\" said makeup artist Sarah Tanno. \"I looked at every era from her career and created something that felt iconic to Gaga and just elevated it into something new. I wanted her to be able to look back at this 10 years from now and have it feel timeless.\" You May Also Like Celebrity Super Bowl 51: Gisele Bündchen Had Custom 'Brady's Ladies' Jerseys Made for Her Squad To create Gaga's dazzling purple shadow, Tanno laid down a base of glimmery pewter cream shadow ( Marc Jacobs Beauty Twinkle Pop Stick Eyeshadow in Au Revoir ) and smudged shimmery lavender pencil all around her eyes ( Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Crayon in Violet Femme ). She then buffed a plum-colored powder shadow along the creases of the eyes to add depth and pressed a lighter lavender powder from the Marc Jacobs Beauty Style Eye-Con No. 7 Plush Shadow palette in The Tease on top of the lids to brighten things up. She highlighted the brow bone with a frosty pale pink color and drew a dramatic winged line along Gaga's top lashes with black pencil, followed by a liquid ( Marc Jacobs Beauty Magic Marc'er Precision Pen Liquid Eyeliner in Blacquer ). To complete the look, Tanno added lots of mascara and traced Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon in Pink of Me along the waterlines.
