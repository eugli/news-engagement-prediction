Now one 'soccer' player wants to pay tribute to him by naming his son after the Quarterback. \nBrady won his fifth Super Bowl ring on Sunday night when he once again led Bill Belichick's New England Patriots to glory in the 51st edition of the competition. \nThe Patriots quarterback struggled early in the game against Atlanta Falcons and the Falcons led by 25 points in the third quarter and looked set to win. \nHowever Brady inspired the Patriots to level the score at 28 all to take the match into overtime where they won 34-28. \nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic revealed that to honour Brady, only the second man to win five Super Bowl rings, he would name his firstborn son after the NFL legend: If I'm ever lucky enough to have a son, he will be called Brady.

It was unbelievable. I'm so proud of these guys. \n\"James White is everything you want in a team-mate. Dependable, reliable, durable. He brings it every day. We kept going to him and that speaks for itself.\" \nIt's not the first time that Begovic has praised the American footballer on social media: A photo posted by asmir1 (@asmir1) on Dec 5, 2016 at 3:08am PST Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:58:52.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
