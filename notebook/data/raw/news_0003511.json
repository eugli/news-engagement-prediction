On both occasions, the then in-form Raptors got the better of the Celtics. In the first of those two games, Kyle Lowry schooled the Celtics with his leadership and gritty play, leading all scorers with 34 points as the Raptors were able to come out on top in a close game behind his stellar performance. \nIn the more recent meeting (on Jan. 10) between the two teams, the Raptors were again able to get the better of the Celtics, with DeMar DeRozan going off for 41 points,. The 16-point, come-from-behind victory was, perhaps, the Raptors’ last statement win, coming against a direct rival in the East, who they will now face twice in the month of February. Form Guide: \nToronto Raptors: (30-19, 13-10 on road): LLWLW \nWATCH: Toronto Raptors 102, Milwaukee Bucks 86 \nThe Raptors have now lost six of their last eight games while the Celtics have won four games on the trot, displacing Toronto for the second spot in the Eastern conference standings in the process. DeMar DeRozan didn’t play in two of the Raptors’ losses against San Antonio and Memphis and also sat out their most recent win against the Pelicans . His absence and the matchup against a direct Conference rival in such poor form doesn’t bode well for the Raptors. \nBoston Celtics (30-18, 16-8 at home): LWWWW \nWATCH: Boston Celtics 113, Detroit Pistons 109 \nThe Celtics have had a fine run of form. They’ve not had to play any of the top three teams in the league and have taken advantage of the home-friendly schedule in the month of January. They’ve only played four games away from home this past month, and were 2-2 on the road. Not to be forgotten are Isaiah Thomas’ fourth-quarter heroics that have bailed the Celtics out time and again when they’ve had the need. The Celtics have, for the most part, taken care of business and have seen their consistent form pay off in the form of a 10-4 record for the month and a second-place standing in the Eastern Conference.

Besides Lowry and DeRozan, the Raptors also boast of the scoring talent of big man Jonas Valanciunas. At their peak, the Raptors were leading the league in scoring but the recent drop-off in play sees them as the league’s fourth-best offensive team, tied with the Cavaliers for 109.6 points per game . The Raptors aren’t really reliant on the three-point shot that so many of the league’s teams live and die by. They rank 22nd in the league for 3-point shots attempted , yet it doesn’t affect their scoring output because in DeRozan and Valanciunas, they have two very good mid-range finishers. \nBoston Celtics Photo by Brian Babineau/NBAE via Getty Images \n\nThe Celtics have moved from the bump-and-grind days of the low post era to a far more sophisticated pace-and-space style marked by their significant rise in three-point attempts (32.8) and makes (12.1) . They convert a good 36.9% of their long distance shots (good for seventh overall in the league) which puts them in a position to let Isaiah Thomas play his dribble-heavy, penetrative style and get them buckets in the crunch time. The Celtics also sit at third in the league for highest percentage of the team’s points that are three-pointers ( 33.5 ). The Raptors will have to buckle down and run the Celtics off the three-point line if they are to stand a chance at going toe-to-toe with their opponents in the crucial encounter. The Alpha Star \nToronto Raptors \nWATCH: Kyle Lowry 33 points vs. the Pelicans \nThe Raptors are a team led by a one-two punch of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Just who the alpha star between the two is up for debate, but given DeRozan’s injury status, we pick Lowry. The Raptors’ point guard is a more than competent shooter from deep, averaging 42.9% from 3-point range and ranking third in the league with 158 three-pointers made for the season so far. On Tuesday night, it was Lowry’s clutch bucket that delivered the W for Toronto. If DeRozan does not play, it will be on Lowry to carry the team on his shoulders. \nBoston Celtics \nWATCH: Isaiah Thomas goes for 41 points vs. Pistons \nIsaiah Thomas is the undisputed star of this Boston Celtics team. He has been supernova-like in the fourth quarter in January. Thomas leads the league in fourth-quarter points with 10.0 per game . He’s also the second-leading scorer in the league, with 29.4 points per game and is also assisting at a career-high 6.4 assists per game . Just to give some context about just how impressive the man has been – \n1 – He’s scored 20 or more points in the fourth quarter on four separate occasions this season. \n2 – 15 or more points in the fourth quarter – nine times. \n3 – He had never scored 40 or more points in a game before December 20 this season. He now has four such games. The Stat \nAfter averaging just over 20 assists per game for the months of December and January, the Raptors have moved more towards jacking up their own shots and averaged 16.7 assists per game for the month of January.
