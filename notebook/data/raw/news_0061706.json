So I think it is a problem.\" \nMs Neal said she believed such interventions were turning people away from the party. \n\"People don't want their time wasted by game-playing in politics, they want a democratic selection process, they want a candidate they know and trust who lives locally ... not these sort of head office games,\" Ms Neal said. \nMs Neal has had a colourful career in politics but is best remembered for the notorious \"Iguana-gate\" incident, when she was allegedly involved in an altercation with staff at a Central Coast bar . \nThe other expected candidate, Anne Charlton, has thrown her support behind the Paralympic gold medallist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:10:58.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
