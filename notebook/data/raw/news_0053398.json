Gil-Garcia is among the members of the Chicago Public Schools Latino Advisory Committee who resigned. (Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Juan Perez Jr. advisory committee for Latino students have resigned to protest school budget cuts that have landed hard on schools with largely poor and minority populations, the committee's chairman said Wednesday.\n\"We see this not just as an assault on Latino students, neighborhoods and families, but we see this as a continuation of cuts in the African-American community and now cuts in the Latino community,\" committee member Jose Rico said while backed by three City Council members and former school board member and interim CPS CEO Jesse Ruiz. \n\"We see this as one and the same,\" Rico said, adding that nearly all of the committee members had submitted their resignations. \nSchools officials responded by saying the schools can use an appeals process to recover money. \n\"We knew there would be consequences. It became very clear very quickly that some of our schools, and frankly many of our Hispanic schools with large populations and poverty, were disproportionately impacted,\" school board President Frank Clark said. \"Obviously we have to correct that.\" \nThe public rebuke by Latino elected officials and prominent community members came as the Chicago Board of Education was scheduled to approve its latest budget for the year, a $5.4 billion spending plan that includes a series of cuts and an expectation that state lawmakers will send $111 million to balance the budget by summer. \nChicago Public Schools ... \nMoving a long-running political battle into the courtroom, Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's school board sued Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Illinois State Board of Education on Tuesday, accusing the state of employing \"separate and unequal systems of funding for public education in Illinois.\" \nChicago Public Schools ... (Juan Perez Jr., Patrick O'Connell and Bill Ruthhart) \nDistrict officials have blamed Gov. Bruce Rauner for the cuts, which include a $46 million freeze on nonpersonnel school spending that Latino leaders targeted Wednesday. \nInstead of cutting teachers, many schools have had to turn to federal and state funds targeted for impoverished and minority students to balance their budgets. That has put items such as after-school programs and supply purchases at risk. \n\"This is about time that the Latino community stands up on its own two feet and says, 'Enough is enough, this has to end,'\" Ald. George Cardenas , 12th, told reporters. \"We're going to demand changes in CPS leadership and leadership structure. This cannot continue.\" \nRauner's office has said the governor scuttled a measure that would have provided $215 million to CPS this year because Democratic legislators went back on a deal that tied school aid to broader changes to the state's highly indebted employee retirement system. Chicago Public Schools officials have been trading barbs with the state over the district's budget woes, speakers at two public hearings Monday on the district's latest budget plan found plenty to criticize on both sides.\nThe hearings at CPS headquarters, which followed $104 million in spending... \nWhile Chicago Public Schools officials have been trading barbs with the state over the district's budget woes, speakers at two public hearings Monday on the district's latest budget plan found plenty to criticize on both sides. \nThe hearings at CPS headquarters, which followed $104 million in spending... (Juan Perez Jr.) \nCPS CEO Forrest Claypool on Wednesday said the veto forced the district to evaluate options that included cutting teachers or an \"uneven distribution of cuts from unspent funds.\" \n\"Ultimately given this 'Sophie's Choice,' we chose to protect our teachers, and through them the continued progress of our students,\" Claypool said. \"While we have limited options for making this more fair, we will work with schools to smooth out the most disproportionate impacts.\" \nRauner's office issued a statement on Wednesday critical of CPS. \n\"The Rauner Administration strongly condemns cuts implemented by the Chicago Public School District, which were caused by decades of fiscal mismanagement, and disproportionately affected low-income students,\" spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis said in a statement. \nThe Latino Advisory Committee was formed in 2014 under former CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett in an effort to bulk up the district's outreach to a growing population within the school system. Rico and Ruiz said the committee had been ignored in the budget-cutting process. \n\"We understand that these are tough budget decisions, and the role of the council has always been to be able to provide some input and to be able to deliberate on these decisions, and we were not used in that capacity,\" Rico told reporters before Wednesday's school board meeting. \nRuiz, now president of the Chicago Park District board, said the effects of the budget cuts on predominantly Latino schools and the lack of consultation added \"insult to injury.\" \n\"These are desperate times not generated by CPS, generated by, in the immediate course, our governor's veto of a bill that would've provided adequate funding this year,\" Ruiz said before the school board meeting. \n\"That's the cause of this, that's causing unfortunate decisions to be made. But with making those unfortunate decisions, you have to reach out to the communities that are potentially impacted and seek out, perhaps, alternatives that aren't as disproportionally impactful to certain communities,\" Ruiz said. \nTwitter @Perezjr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:36:11.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
