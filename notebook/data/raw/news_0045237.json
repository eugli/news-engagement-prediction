According to the outlet, the unnamed musician, who is Hispanic, was apparently offended by the comment. He re-entered the venue and attacked Carter onstage, breaking a computer and a speaker in the process.\nTMZ reports the younger brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter was left “bloody” and transported to a nearby hospital. He has since taken to Twitter to explain the incident, claiming he didn’t mean for the comment to come off as racist and that authorities are investigating the attack.\nI didn't get beat up I got a hit and pushed when I wasn't looking and they ran out the club and I stood on the speakers waiting for them? https://t.co/vmeeqdiOEZ\n— Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) February 18, 2017\nMaybe he should've not been a fake security guard causing liability to the venue and antagonizing me and my fans mid show… https://t.co/vmeeqd1dNr\n— Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) February 18, 2017\nThis dude sized me up after I said he had to go and said bye Felipe like bye Felicia the male version..
