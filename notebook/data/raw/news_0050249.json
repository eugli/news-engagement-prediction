We are 18 points behind the Tories and third place in Scotland and in Copeland, the reason why lifelong voters aren’t backing us is Jeremy Corbyn. \nHe didn’t look riled when I said this. He said just ‘get out there’ and thanked everyone who’s been campaigning.” \nThe scathing attack came as Mr Corbyn faced MPs at the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting in Westminster to discuss the elections and their dire ICM/Guardian poll ratings. \nA source said Mr Corbyn’s long-held anti-nuclear views are affecting voters in Copeland in Cumbria, where the Sellafield nuclear power station is the area’s main employer. \nEarlier Tottenham MP David Lammy and Mr Coyle tweeted about warning letters they had been sent from the chief whip Nick Brown after they defied the party to vote against the triggering of Article 50. \nMr Coyle, who led the rebellion of London MPs against Brexit, said he is auctioning off his letter to raise party campaign funds, and has already received an opening bid of £100. \nHe said: “Some local members have begun bidding for my letter of reprimand so I guess I should thank the chief whip for helping me raise vital campaign funds.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:36:39.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
