The Japanese manufacturer has indeed delivered, as it unveiled four new models at the show. The new high-tier Xperia XZ Premium and XZs were clearly the focal points of the presentation, but Sony also introduced the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra - two very intriguing smartphones that enhance the company's already rich mid-range lineup. Compared to the first members of the XA line which premiered last year, the XA1 and XA1 Ultra feature improvements in four key areas: camera, SoC, system memory, and internal storage. The main camera on the new XA models looks very promising Both phones come with the MediaTek Helio P20 chipset and a 23 MP main snapper, but there is a noticeable difference with the selfie cams: the XA1 features an 8 MP front camera capable of reaching a max ISO number of 3,200, while XA1 Ultra sports a 16 MP sensor that can reach an ISO number of 6,400, with the added bonus of front-facing Flash and Optical Image Stabilization. Another interesting contrast is the fact that the XA1 Ultra will rely on a USB Type-C cable for charging, whereas the XA1 will use micro USB.Design-wise, the handsets mirror the Xperia XZ look quite successfully, as Sony is continuing the “unified design concept” that was introduced at MWC '16. The XA1 and XA1 Ultra respectively feature 5- and 6-inch edge-to-edge screens, which are encompassed by a sleek metal frame.Here's a quick look at the specs highlights for the two phones: Sony Xperia XA1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:56:23.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
