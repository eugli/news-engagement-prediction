Source: CNN Man salutes cardboard cutout of President Trump everyday \nUnlike previous presidents, Trump chose not to focus on his administration's transition into power but rather aiming to reconnect with with his tribe of largely white, male middle-class voters. \nAnd he did just that - inviting the most loyal of followers, car salesman Gene Huber, to join him on stage. \n\"Come on up here... I'm not not worried, I'm not worried about him,\" Trump said as the fanatic raced to the stage. Donald Trump could be seen stopping his secret service detail, telling them to let Gene Huber on the stage. Source: Twitter Follow Gene Huber on Twitter! Here's his account: @Squeakey6 pic.twitter.com/W0K7AKPHeS — Trump 2020 (@TrumpSource) February 19, 2017 \n\"When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was gonna do for us, I knew he was gonna do this for us,\" Huber said on stage after giving the 45th POTUS a hug. \nTrump shook Huber's hand and said \"A star is born\" as Huber left the stage. \nObsessed would be putting Mr Huber's feelings towards the President lightly. \nAfter the rally, he told CNN that he salutes a cardboard cutout of Trump every day. The Best Vistor I could ever have!President Trump came to Florida to see me! Wow, never will forget this!@realDonaldTrump @thebestcloser pic.twitter.com/galTF85biz — Gene Huber (@Squeakey6) January 9, 2017 Mr Huber shared a screenshot of a phone call that he claimed to be from Donald Trump. Source: Facebook \n\"I love our president. He's coming out for us, we the people,\" Mr Huber added. \nHe said he was first in line, arriving at 4:00 am to see his Republican political hero. \nHuber and many other Trump fans around him were dismissive when asked whether they were concerned that Trump, as the country's 45th president, was employing the same contentious style from his time on the campaign trail. \n\"No jitters at all,\" Huber said. \"This is a world leader now who's taking control.\" \nNot everyone was so convinced by Trump's sudden warmth. Gene Huber was staged. Def not a random.
