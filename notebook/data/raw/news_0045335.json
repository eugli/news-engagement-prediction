Unfortunately, that was because the checkpoint had been left completely unattended. \nThe TSA has a lot of explaining to do. Shortly after 6:00am Monday at John F.

A K9 team was present at the checkpoint at the time of the incident, ” the TSA said in a statement. “ TSA conducted security measures at the passengers’ arrival airport. ” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:38:03.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
