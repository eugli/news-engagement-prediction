'Step in' \nNeil Carmichael, who chairs the committee, said that while some trusts produced excellent results and made \"a valuable contribution to our education system, a considerable number are failing to improve and are consistently at the bottom of league tables\". \n\"If the government is to pursue the goal of further academisation, it will need to work with local authorities and allow those councils with a track record of strong educational performance to use their expertise within their education department to create MATs,\" said Mr Carmichael. \nBut the Department for Education says there is no legal framework to allow councils to sponsor a school. \n\"Local authorities are already able to be part of a Mat with up to a fifth of its board having links to their local authority,\" a spokesman said. \n\"We encourage all trusts to work collaboratively and the best already do so, but maintaining their independence is a crucial part of encouraging the innovation that has driven up standards in so many schools.\" \nCurrently councils cannot run multi-academy trusts as legally less than 20% of members and trustees are allowed to be \"local authority influenced\". \nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said that with 91% of council schools now rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, it was time for the government to recognise councils' record in school improvement. \nRichard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said allowing local authorities to set up trusts would mean that parents worried about an academy could be sure that \"the council and its directly elected councillors, who know their local schools and the communities they serve better than anyone else, will be able to step in and help\".
