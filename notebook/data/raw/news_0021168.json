It reads: \"Put a small kitten in each box. Close the boxes. After some time open the boxes. What do you see? The kitten inside the box without holes has died.\"\nThe book's publisher has promised it will not appear in the next edition, according to the Indian Express .\nParvesh Gupta of PP Publications said: \"A parent had called us a couple of months ago and asked us to remove the text from the book because it was harmful for children. We recalled books from our distribution channel and will come out with a revised book next year.\"\nShocked Indians shared their disgust online, saying the book was wholly unsuitable for children.\n\"Person who wrote such experiment must be put in instead of animal. Fools,\" wrote a tweeter with the handle Thinking Indian.\nTextbook says 'ugliness' causes dowry Indian textbooks say 'Japan nuked US' Five bizarre 'lessons' in Indian textbooks \"It might be stupid, but they were endangering the lives of the children and animals by citing such an experiment,\" Vidhi Matta, spokeswoman for the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, told the AFP news agency.\nShe admitted she did not know of anyone who had attempted the experiment.\nControversies over Indian textbooks are not uncommon.\nA book in the western state of Gujarat made headlines in 2014 for claiming that Japan had dropped nuclear bombs on the US during the Second World War.\nJust last week, a row erupted in Maharashtra state over a textbook that said \"ugly\" and \"handicapped\" brides had led to a rise in dowries being claimed by the groom's family.\nCarnivores have also been a target for bile.\nIn 2012, a national text for 11-year-old students was discovered that said people who eat meat, \"easily cheat, tell lies, forget promises, are dishonest and tell bad words, steal, fight and turn to violence and commit sex crimes\".", "external_links": ["http://indianexpress.com/article/education/need-air-for-life-to-find-out-put-kitten-in-a-box-says-textbook-4513055/", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6F9D/production/_94237582_kitten.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:32:17.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
