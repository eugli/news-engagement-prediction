The Nebraska senator said that while \"not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad.\" \"There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality,\" he said. \"The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries. That's been a disaster. And here's the second way to fail: If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion. Both approaches are wrong, and both will make us less safe. Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\" \nRep. Justin Amash also used social media to voice his dissent to the 90-day travel restrictions, In a Facebook post, the Michigan Republican said the order \"overreaches and undermines our constitutional system. It's not lawful to ban immigrants on the basis of nationality. If the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress.\" \nCharlie Dent, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania told the New York Times that he hopes President Trump will \"halt enforcement of the order.\" News: @RepCharlieDent , a PA Republican who reps a large Syrian comm tells me:\"I urge the admin to halt enforcement of this order...\" (1/— Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) January 28, 2017 \nMeanwhile, Jeff Flake voiced similar concern on social media. The Arizona Republican said : President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it's unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry. Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.
