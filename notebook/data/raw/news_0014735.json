Sivasangari and Zoe Foo celebrate with their medals and trophy after winning the girls’ title at the Asian Junior Team Squash Championships yesterday. \nPETALING JAYA: The Malaysian girls rose to the occasion to nail their eighth Asian Junior Team Squash Championships title in Hong Kong. \nThe defending champions, playing in front of a large home crowd, saved their best for last as they downed Hong Kong 2-0 yesterday. \nBut the Malaysian boys failed to make it a grand double when they were outgunned 2-0 by top seeds India. \nOng Sai Hung started strongly against British Junior Open Under-19 champion Velavan Senthilkumar but faded badly as he lost 10-12, 0-11, 2-11. \nDarren Rahul Pragasam had the chance to force a decider but the 17-year-old was left in tears after blowing a two-set lead to lose 12-10, 11-7, 5-11, 12-14, 6-11 against Abhay Singh. \nThe Malaysian girls came to the rescue and lived up to their favourites’ tag. \nWorld No. 48 S. Sivasangari bounced back from a surprise defeat against Japan’s Satomi Watanabe in the semi-finals to thump Hong Kong’s No. 1 Lui Hiu Lam 11-5, 11-5, 9-11, 11-5. \nIt was sweet revenge for the 18-year-old who was beaten by Hiu Lam during the final of the 2015 edition. \nAndrea Lee, playing in only her second match of the tournament, sealed the win when she defeated Cheng Nga Ching 11-9, 11-6, 11-13, 11-4. \n“I’m really happy to get the winning point for the team ... and I’m glad that the coaches put their trust in me to play today,” said an elated Andrea. \n“I was pretty much rested throughout the whole tournament so I’m happy to feature in the final and win it for the team.” \nSivasangari added: “I played badly against Satomi in the semis but I handled myself well today.” \n“I didn’t put pressure on myself at all and it really feels good to give the team the first point.” \nNational junior coach Andrew Cross was also pleased with the way the girls handled themselves in a major final. \n“The girls are looking forward to do well at the World Junior Team Championships in New Zealand (in July) and this was a big test for them,” said Cross. \n“They were under a lot of pressure as the favourites but they certainly rose to the occasion. \n“As for the boys, it was massive improvement from the world juniors last year. Darren played well and there are a lot of positives to take away from this tournament.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:08:59.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
