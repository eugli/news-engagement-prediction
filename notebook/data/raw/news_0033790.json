Article continues below \nAntonio Conte has worked wonders since taking over last summer, with the likes of Eden Hazard, N'Golo Kante and David Luiz all thriving under the Italian. \nLast season saw Chelsea's players struggle both in front of goal and defensively, but this time around they've been superb in all areas of the pitch.

CHELSEA TAKE ON FIFA 17 SKILL GAME \nAfter watching Batshuayi's terrible effort, Hazard stopped himself from bursting with laughter before shouting at David Luiz: \"David, I cannot change you for Michy?\" \nIf only that was allowed, with Luiz later showing off his passing ability by finding one of the black containers with his first attempt (see at 1:48). \nWhile Batshuayi is dispensable under Conte, it's Hazard who has become the Italian's most prized asset this season. \nTen goals and three assists in 24 league games is a superb return and one that only adds to the fact Conte would never consider selling him. \n\"I'm not very good to put a price on a player,\" he said recently, per the Independent . \"I think Eden, for sure, is a great player. A top player. He's in a level very high. \n\"But I don't see the problem, because we don't want to sell him. He hasn't a price now.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
