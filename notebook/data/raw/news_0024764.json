This congestion can be experienced in many ways, including dizziness, and is sometimes linked to sinus problems, colds, or allergies. You may feel a popping in your ear, a reduction in hearing capacity, a sound that is similar to wind rushing through a tunnel, or an overall feeling that there is mucus or other liquid within your ear. But you also may feel like your ears are congested when the air pressure inside the middle ear changes, such as on an airplane or with another change of altitude. To relieve general ear congestion, try using gravity, irrigation, decongestants, or steam to clear the blockage. There are also some specific techniques you can try if the congestion is caused by pressure, earwax, or infection. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad2.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/49\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/49\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 1 Determine the cause of your ear congestion. If you have just been on an airplane, you may feel a blockage in your ear that will clear itself. However, if you have recently had a cold or suffer from allergies, you may be experiencing ear congestion that is similar to nasal congestion. If you are having difficulty hearing, you also may be suffering from excessive wax buildup. Seek the advice of a doctor if your symptoms last longer than 48 hours and are accompanied by pain. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/54\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad1.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/54\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 2 Use gravity to your advantage. Some of the time, ear congestion will be due to fluids caught in the Eustachian tubes, which are a part of the middle ear. If you think you might have fluids caught in your ear, here are some tricks using gravity that you can use to relieve congestion. Stand on one foot, tilt your head to the side (preferably the side that has blockage), and hop slowly and steadily on one foot. Be careful doing this â€” you don't want to fall down. This can sometimes help dislodge fluid that is caught in the ear canal. Lie down on your side with your head resting on a pillow. Keep the ear that's congested facing downward. Rest like this for an hour. Again, gravity may help pull the fluid out from your ear. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/22\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad1.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/22\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 3 Try irrigating your nasal passage or using a neti pot. Sinus congestion feels a lot like your ears are plugged, and so sinus congestion might really be masquerading as ear congestion. For some, nasal irrigation may bring quick relief of sinus symptoms without the use of medications. [1] The neti pot works by thinning out mucus and flushing it out of the nasal passage. Note that you should not put fluid into your ear if you have a perforated eardrum or suspect an ear infection. See a doctor instead. All neti pots come with their own set of instructions that should be followed. Typically, however, one first prepares an irrigating solution made up of 16 ounces lukewarm (and sterile) water, along with 1 teaspoon of salt. Fill your neti pot with the saline solution. Tilt your head at a 45 degree angle and bring the tip of the neti pot to your top nostril. The saline solution will go into one nostril, travel through your nasal cavity, and come out of the other nostril. If the solution drips into your mouth, just spit it out. Blow your nose and repeat the process on the other side. How often should you irrigate with a neti pot? People suffering from severe sinus problems or allergies found relief irrigating daily. [1] Once symptoms get better, the recommended usage is three times per week. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad1.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad1.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 4 Use a decongestant. If your ear congestion is a result of seasonal allergies or a cold, take decongestant as directed. This will work to reduce swelling in your ear canal. You also may take an antihistamine and a decongestant together as long as you follow label instructions. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 5 Put your finger in your ear and try to create a vacuum. Try putting your index finger in your ear and moving the index finger gently upwards. Ears are shaped differently, so this may take a bit of finessing. Move your finger around gently until you have created a vacuum. Try to suction the fluid out of your ear. {\"smallUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad1.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/27\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-460px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/pad3.whstatic.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/27\\/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\\/aid1663820-760px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} 6 Try a steam treatment using hot water and a towel. Put hot, slightly steaming water in a large bowl, cover your head with a towel, and rest your covered head over the steam bath. The steam may help thin out and loosen the mucus, which you can then spit out into another bowl. Try putting tea or other herbs into your steam treatment. Some teas like chamomile have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities, making them a nice addition to the steam treatment. Hot showers, trips to the sauna, or humidifiers will also do the trick. Avoid placing any steaming object near your ear, as the steam produced this way can sometimes be too hot.
