Is that the right number for any of you in this room? Who knows? It’s just a number that’s now built into the apps.\n“I think apps could definitely be doing more harm than good.” \nThe five most ridiculous fitness trends ever O f course, it's predominantly true that walking is good for you – it's low intensity, good at promoting blood flow, and, according to a 2015 study, a useful way of relieving stress. But Dr Hager's point is that you shouldn't necessarily live your life worrying about achieving 10,000 steps (five miles, roughly speaking ). Instead, you might be better served by concentrating on walking a bit every day and finding out a distance that works for you.\nThe 10,000 steps myth is not the first to have infiltrated the fitness community. Here's five others, which you can henceforth approach with caution ....\nMYTH 1: Sitting at a desk all day will kill you Despite the macabre surge of horror stories about how your desk job is turning you into a cross between Jabba the Hutt and a latter-day Henry VIII, an extensive study of 5,000 people over 16 years, conducted by the University of Exeter and University College London, found that extended periods of sitting are not associated with an increased risk of dying – provided that people stay physically active.\nStanding desks have become more commonplace in the office Credit: Varidesk A separate study by the University of Missouri’s School of Medicine proved that regular 10-minute walks during the working day reverse any adverse effects on the heart caused by sitting down. So long as you weave low-intensity physical activity – like walking to the park or clambering up the stairs to the office – into your daily routine and commit to regular exercise sessions, there is no need to quit your desk job and become a Zumba instructor.\nMYTH 2: Cheese is your enemy For years cheese has been vilified as a fat-stained ticket to an early grave but an intriguing study by scientists at Aarhus University in Denmark, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, revealed that men who regularly consume cheese have higher levels of the compound butyrate, an anti-inflammatory fatty acid which is associated with reduced obesity, lower cholesterol and a higher fat-burning metabolism.\nFeta is your friend Credit: Alamy S tick to lower-fat options like feta, cottage cheese and ricotta and avoid high-fat choices like mascarpone and Red Leicester.\nMYTH 3: Skip the weights room if you want to lose fat Venturing into the gym weights room, with its unmistakeable fug of sweat and intimidating cacophony of clanging metal, it’s easy to assume that this is a realm reserved exclusively for men hell-bent on sculpting the physique of a Marvel superhero. But lifting weights is also a potent way to burn body fat.\nLifting weights can help you lose weight Credit: Alamy Y es, cardiovascular training like running and cycling may burn more calories per minute, but combining this kind of aerobic exercise with weight training will aid your cause. That’s because muscle burns more calories than body fat during both exercise and inactivity – so people with more muscle torch extra calories even when they’re sitting on the sofa at home watching Sherlock.\nBy building a few extra kilograms of muscle, you can help shed yourself of unwanted blubber – a point demonstrated in a study by Pennsylvania State University which proved that overweight people who performed a mix of weight-training and aerobic exercise lost more body fat than those who just did cardio.\nMYTH 4: Low-intensity exercise is a waste of time High-intensity interval training has been shown to burn body fat, boost cardiovascular fitness and increase metabolism – all within the time it normally takes to watch an episode of Coronation Street.\nWatch | Tabata: the four-minute workout that could replace your hour-long run 03:28 B ut it’s a mistake to conclude that old-fashioned forms of longer, lower-intensity exercise have no value. If you take part in endurance sports, such as cycling or running, extended low-intensity sessions will train your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates for energy (which is a more efficient form of fuel) and condition the mitochondria – the energy powerhouses in your cells – to work more efficiently. The result? You can run or pedal for longer.\nThere could be other health benefits too. A study by experts at Maastricht University suggested that lower-intensity exercise could be more effective than high-intensity exercise at improving insulin sensitivity and blood lipid levels – both key markers linked to conditions like diabetes and obesity.\nMYTH 5: Giving up alcohol is good for you Waking up with a skull-splitting hangover five times a week isn’t going to do much for your physical vitality, but alcohol isn’t entirely bad if consumed in moderation .\nWINE LOVER: TYRION LANNISTER IN GAME OF THRONES Credit: HBO E xperts at Oregon State University found that moderate alcohol consumption is linked to higher bone density and a lower risk of osteoporosis, while a study by the University of Calgary showed that people who booze in moderation enjoy higher levels of ‘good’ cholesterol and are 14-25pc less likely to develop heart disease than those who stoically stay off the sauce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:53:06.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
