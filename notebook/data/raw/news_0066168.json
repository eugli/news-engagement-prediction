Rudd and Morgan live with their families in the area. \nSeveral months ago, Morgan promoted the candy store on TV, wearing a Samuel's baseball cap while appearing on the post- Walking Dead talk show Talking Dead and presenting a gift basket from the shop to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show . \n\"Why is Negan bringing me candy?\" Fallon said. \nMorgan talked about the business, saying he and Rudd \"have literally nothing to do with it, other than eating the candy.\" \n\"The kids think it's fantastic,\" he added.
