He will probably need permanent help. I don’t think he will come out of it the same person. \n‘The worrying thing was when they said there was swelling and not much electrical activity after the brain scan. \n‘They need to do a more detailed scan and we should get the results tomorrow. \n‘I saw him awake for the first time last night. He was looking around but he didn’t recognise me.’ Dog owners are more sexually attractive than people who own cats \nJordan, who has previously spent time living on the streets, had most recently been living with a friend in Bolton. \nFather-of-six Edd, from Atherton, in Wigan, says he offered Jordan a place to stay many times but he refused. \nHe says Jordan has been known to take legal highs in the past but had never touched Spice before. \nHe says he cannot understand how his son was able to gain access to Spice, a form of synthetic cannabinoids, while in prison. \nHe said: ‘Last Wednesday the police knocked on my door and asked if I was Jordan’s dad and told me what had happened. Pizza delivery driver leaves note offering 'weed, MDMA, pills, ket, raw coke & much more' \n‘I didn’t even know he was in prison. They said he had been in for six days on remand. I was just in shock and went straight up to see him. \n‘They said it was from Spice but it must have been a dodgy lot. They said there were three people that night who had collapsed from it in Forest Bank. Jordan must have had most of it. \n‘I asked the officer ‘how has he ended up with it in prison?’. They just said they do searches but some of it always remains.’ \nEdd is now warning anyone who may consider taking Spice to stay away from the drug. \nHe said: ‘Just don’t bother. I think people think that just because in the past it was legal it will still be okay to take it. \n‘It destroys families and wrecks lives.’ Bully only stopped attack when someone said 'leave her, I think she's dead' \nEdd has spoken out after one youth support worker spoke out about Manchester’s Spice epidemic. \nJulie Boyle said she knows of at least four deaths linked to Spice, either because their hearts have stopped or it has made them suicidal. \nShe said that people have been raped, trafficked and forced into prostitution because of the highly potent drug. \nThe ‘synthetic cannabinoids’ collectively known as Spice were banned by the government last April. But they are still widely available on Manchester’s streets and in many of the country’s prisons. Seagull caught stealing people's parking tickets \nThe drug is made up of a range of amphetamines and other laboratory-created chemicals that vary wildly from batch to batch. \nBefore the ban, it was being sold either over the counter or online under a variety of brand names such as Annihilation and GoCaine. \nGreater Manchester Police says Spice – and similar substances – are now a ‘big community safety issue in the centre of Manchester’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:47:13.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
