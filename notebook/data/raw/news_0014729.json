(Al Bello/Getty Images) \nFor a 92-year-old man who got out of the hospital less than a week ago, former president George H.W. Bush looked pretty great on Sunday when he appeared the Super Bowl for the pregame coin toss. Accompanied by his wife Barbara, the 41st president of the United States got a standing ovation from the packed-in crowd at Houston’s NRG Stadium.

We know each and every year that more people are going to bet on heads.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:52:41.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
