Their work could pave the way for new ways to control ... Molecular characterization of the autotransport process of Yersinia adhesin A (YadA) January 18, 2017 \nAdhesins are surface structures of bacteria that facilitate their attachment to host cells or non-living materials. Most adhesins do not just bind to any surface; rather, they recognize specific molecules or receptors on ... Calcium induces chronic lung infections October 24, 2016 \nThe bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a life-threatening pathogen in hospitals. About ten percent of all nosocomial infections, in particular pneumonia, are caused by this pathogen. Researchers from the University of Basel's ... Feed a cold, starve a fever? Not so fast, according to research January 26, 2017 \nThe last time you had a stomach bug, you probably didn't feel much like eating. This loss of appetite is part of your body's normal response to an illness but is not well understood. Sometimes eating less during illness promotes ... For viral predators of bacteria, sensitivity can be contagious January 10, 2017 \nBacteriophages (phages) are probably the most abundant entities in nature, often exceeding bacterial densities by an order of magnitude. As viral predators of bacteria, phages have a major impact on bacterial communities ... Video: 'Good bacteria' make diseases less deadly November 16, 2016 \nIn a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, Oxford DPhil student Suzanne Ford from the Department of Zoology shows how the use of 'good bacteria' – or defensive microbes – could help fight diseases. Recommended for you Bacterial survival strategy: Splitting into virulent and non-virulent subtypes February 7, 2017 \nResearchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have discovered a survival strategy that harmful bacteria can use to outsmart the human immune response, resulting in more severe and persistent infections and more effective ... Researchers use tiny 3-D spheres to combat tuberculosis February 7, 2017 \nResearchers at the University of Southampton have developed a new 3D system to study human infection in the laboratory. Female genital cutting has 'evolutionary' drive: study February 6, 2017 \nThe widely condemned practice of ceremonial genital mutilation among girls and young women follows an evolutionary logic, according to a provocative study published Monday. Genomes in flux: New study reveals hidden dynamics of bird and mammal DNA evolution February 6, 2017 \nEvolution is often thought of as a gradual remodeling of the genome, the genetic blueprints for building an organism. But in some instance it might be more appropriate to call it an overhaul. Over the past 100 million years, ... Can sharks be fished sustainably? Yes (but it's going to take work) February 6, 2017 \nConventional wisdom holds that sharks can't be harvested in a sustainable manner because they are long-lived animals. It takes time for them to reproduce and grow in numbers. But, researchers reporting in Current Biology ...
