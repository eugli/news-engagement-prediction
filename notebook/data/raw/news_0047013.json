Isn’t this pure joy? \nUnlike a couple of other celebrity parents who have initially shied away from showing their baby to the world, Tusshar has always been very open to the idea of the same. He fathered a baby boy through surrogacy using IVF last year and when the news broke out, it came to everyone as a pleasant surprise. The first pictures of his son were all over the internet. Remember those pics in which he was seen carrying Laksshya on his shoulder in the balcony of his house? The announcement of the news was not an easy task for him as his family was not too keen on letting the world know about IVF. “Initially my parents were a little bit apprehensive whether I should announce the child to be one born through IVF and surrogacy or not. Because they were like ‘You don’t know how it is going to be taken in India, why even announce it, why don’t you just tell friends, then the friends will tell more friends…,” Tusshar told reporters at an event about IVF technology. “I am happy that I have taken the right decision. Our family is complete now, we are five now, grandparents, me, my sister and little Laksshya,” Tusshar had said while addressing the media at his residence earlier. Being a single parent is a tough and very challenging role but I am sure Tusshar is doing his job pretty well..
