Stars Who Were Fired From Jobs \n\"Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved,\" Yiannopoulos, 33, said in a statement, according to The New York Times . \"They have allowed me to carry conservative and libertarian ideas to communities that would otherwise never have heard them. They have been a significant factor in my success. I'm grateful for that freedom and for the friendships I forged there.\" \n\"I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues' important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone,\" he continued. \"When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.\" Talk Show Controversies and Feuds: The Biggest Ever \nThe alt-right British journalist's announcement came after a pair of videos filmed last year surfaced on Sunday, February 19, in which he appeared to defend sex with young boys and joking about his own underage sexual past with a Catholic priest.
