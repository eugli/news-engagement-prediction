Her lifelong wish? To get herself arrested. SEE ALSO: Researchers built an origami-inspired bulletproof shield to protect police officers \nIn anticipation of hitting her 100th birthday, the Nijmegen-Zuid resident and her niece hit up the police station, requesting to be put behind bars. As the ABC reports , Annie has long wanted to \"experience a police cell from within.\" \nShe certainly looks like she's having a great time in the photos police officers posted to their Facebook page. \nA spokesperson from the police station told Buzzfeed they picked her up at place in a cop car, before locking her up briefly. \"We don't usually do this, but we made an exception for Annie,\" they said. \"It was just a couple of minutes in the cell ... We don't know why it was on her bucket list.\" \nBless you Annie, and long may you run from the law.
