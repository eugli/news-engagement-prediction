In the video above, we see Danny roaming the streets of New York looking like he’s fresh off a stint at Burning Man (read: K’un-Lun), and generally punching things with his big, glowing fists. Also featured in the trailer: an uncomfortable mashup of electronica, rap, and Asian appropriation . \nIron Fist continues the current line of shows leading up to a Defenders mini-series, along with Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and Luke Cage . The show stars Finn Jones as lead Danny Rand, Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple, and Daredevil alum Wai Ching Ho as the mysterious Madame Gao. Colleen Wing and Claire Temple are especially of note, as Colleen plays the partner to Luke Cage ’s Misty Knight and Claire has appeared in every relevant series so far. \nIron Fist premieres on Netflix on March 17th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:07:39.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
