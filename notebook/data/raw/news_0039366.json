People will never accept it,\" said Rizvi. \nThe BNP leader reaffirmed the party's stance over the 'Padma Bridge graft' that is making headlines again following a Canadian court's verdict. \nThe Ontario Superior Court has acquitted three business executives of charges that SNC-Lavalin Group Inc staff planned to bribe Bangladesh officials in a bid to win a $50 million contract to supervise the Padma Bridge construction. \n\"The accusations of grafts are still relevant as the World Bank has still not rolled back their allegations.\" \n\"Why did those allegations surface in the first place? The letter written on a letterhead of the minister's contractor firm cannot be ignored.\" \nRizvi slammed the government saying: \"Now they are loud on television as if they have achieved a certificate from the Canadian court.\" \nHe claimed Awami League leaders and their wives had created a 'Begumganj' in Canada with the money looted from different sectors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:59:51.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
