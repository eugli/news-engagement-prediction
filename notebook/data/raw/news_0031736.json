She doesn’t bring all the dancers and props, she can just stand there and she just stood there and sang the song and that’s it, and this is why she wins.” \nOn Sunday, Beyoncé took home the Best Urban Contemporary Album award for “Lemonade,” while Adele took home the night’s top prize ― Album of the Year ― for “25.” \nMembers of the Beyhive, including Adele , weren’t impressed with the result, which led many to voice their frustrations on social media.
