What we do know is that they are part of Dubai’s strategy to facilitate a quarter of all journeys within the Emirate through autonomous vehicles by 2030. \nTo make this happen, the RTA will employ Chinese firm Ehang’s 184 , which is the world’s first passenger drone. It’s capable of a range of about 30 miles on a single charge and can carry one person weighing up to 220 lbs, as well as a small suitcase. The entire flight is managed by a command center; all you need to do is hop in and choose from the list of predetermined destinations where you can land.

However, the 184 won’t be seen ferrying passengers in the US until it’s cleared for use by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). \nSo if you want to ride an autonomous drone before that, Dubai is your best bet. Al-Tayer is confident that the system is ready for prime-time: “This is not only a model. We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai’s skies.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:14:13.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
