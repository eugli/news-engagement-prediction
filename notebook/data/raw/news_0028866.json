Silva went toe-to-toe with the younger foe and took some punishment but dished out enough of his own to earn the win. â€” #UFC208 (@ufc) February 12, 2017 \nSilva, 41, won for the first time in more than four years. Silva was apparently just aggressive enough in the judges eyes to offset what appeared to be a slight advantage in significant blows for Brunson. \nIn round two Silva did land a nice spinning back fist, but Brunson responded with a takedown and got in some more solid shots. \nBrunson was a prohibitive favorite entering the fight. He improved to 16-5 while Silva improved to 34-8-1 in his storied career. \nSocial media reaction was mixed after the bout, with many of the belief that Brunson was the winner of the fight. In fact, Brandon Wise of CBS Sports said in the site's live blog, \" That is an all time shocker to me.\" \nHere is what Silva said after the fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:45:09.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
