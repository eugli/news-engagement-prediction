Credit: Idaho Fish and Game Magic Valley \nA family in Idaho were woken in the early hours of the morning to the sound of a moose crashing through their basement window and landing in their living room. \nAnimal rescuers were called to help get the female moose out of the property, a post shared by Blaine County Sheriff said. \n\"[Officers] attempted to herd the moose up the stairs and out the front door to freedom. The moose was having none of it, charging the officers several times,\" the post said. \nEventually, Wildlife manager Daryl Meints was called to sedate the animal. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \n\"With all hands on deck, the sleeping giant was carried up the stairs and out the front door. It woke up in the snow covered street, groggy and confused, but free,\" the post by Idaho Fish and Game Magic Valley added. \nAccording to Blaine County Sheriff's Office, deep snows in Idaho bring wildlife close to homes in the search for food. \nIt is not the first time residents in Hailey have woken up to find a wild guest in their home. \nIn 2015, another resident woke up to find an elk in a basement bedroom .
