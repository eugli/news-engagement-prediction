(Credit: Comstock/Thinkstock) \nDETROIT (AP) — Two men have been sentenced to prison for conspiring to rob drug dealers when they were Detroit police officers. \nFormer Lt. David Hansberry was sentenced to 12 ½ years Wednesday, while former Officer Bryan Watson got nine years behind bars. \nEvidence at trial showed the men arranged drug deals and fake arrests so they could steal drugs, money and personal property. They were convicted of conspiracy last summer but acquitted of other charges. \nIn a court filing, the government said Hansberry and Watson “made a mockery of the criminal justice system” and endangered Detroit neighborhoods. \nWatson declined to speak in court. Hansberry said he had to lie to get drugs off the streets. \nIn an unusual move, four Wayne County assistant prosecutors wrote letters to the judge, seeking mercy for Hansberry. Their boss, Kym Worthy, was not happy. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
