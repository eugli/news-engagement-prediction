Advertisement \nThe father of the children had entered the UK without valid immigration papers and the mother was an overstayer. She first arrived in the UK in 2004. The husband lost his job in 2013, and because they were ineligible for state benefits, the family became destitute by April 2014. \nThe parents were referred to local authorities but they refused to care for themselves and wanted the authority to be wholly responsible for providing for the family. \n\"The father's extreme behaviour was exhibited as early as May 14, 2014 when he threatened to jump into the river off a bridge together with the children if a new house and financial assistance to the level sought were not provided,\" noted the judge in charge of this case. \nThe court heard that the couple used their children as leverage and failed to care for their emotional well-being. They used them to demand more money, kept them out of school and even hid them in cupboards to prevent social workers from seeing them. \nIn 2015, the father coached the girl to falsely make serious allegations of sexual abuse against the school and social workers, which triggered a full probe by the police. The boy's school attendance was also falling away and his behaviour was deteriorating. \nIn August 2015, the authorities placed their 2 eldest childrenin foster care to prevent them from further absconding after they tried to flee Birmingham to Glasgow.
