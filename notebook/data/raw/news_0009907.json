The actress is currently shooting the biopic, I, Tonya , in Atlanta, Georgia, and photographers captured her on set, performing a skating routine. Photo: AKM-GSI In the photo, Robbie glides on the rink with a big smile, wearing a short purple dress and shimmering white ice skates. In the movie, Robbie will portray the two-time Olympian, who was involved in one of the biggest scandals in the history of sports. Harding's career infamously came to an end after she conspired with her ex-husband and bodyguard to injure Harding's rival, Nancy Kerrigan, ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee but recovered seven weeks later, and ended up taking home the silver medal at the Olympics. Harding finished in eighth place and was later banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life after she pleaded guilty to conspiring to hinder prosecution in the attack. ET sat down with Harding in 2014, where she talked about her lifetime ban. \"That's the one thing that's truly missing in my heart,\" Harding admitted at the time. \"I wasn't able to go out and do the shows and skate for the people that wanted to see me skate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:02:59.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
