I saw many tear-stained faces during the marathon 10-minute version. GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nBruce Springsteen performs at Christchurch's AMI Stadium, in front of a sold-out crowd. \n​But this wasn't just a concert to bring back thoughts of what we've been through and how far we've come. It was also a reminder of great afternoons and nights past. \nThis will surely rank alongside Dire Straits in the 1980s, U2 in the 1990s and Crowded House's Summertimes concert in Hagley Park as a musical memory to be cherished by those who were there (especially the lucky few plucked up onto stage by The Boss for one number), as they kept on dancing into the dark. \nEarlier, Aussie noughties band Jet got the crowd rocking, after humble local hero Marlon Williams had thoroughly entertained with a short set of his brand of sweet, soulful countrified tunes. In fact, he even kicked off the gig a little early, catching out some who had taken to relaxing under the shadow of the main stands to escape a sweltering early Christchurch summer's evening. GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ \nChristchurch's own Marlon Williams warmed up the crowd during Tuesday night's concert. \nIt was a mood set on the way to stadium, as the Lincoln Rd bars got their slice of the Springsteen action, with punters in no real hurry to make their way towards the stadium. \nThis time, The Boss was the only one late to the party and he more than made up for it. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:57:10.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
