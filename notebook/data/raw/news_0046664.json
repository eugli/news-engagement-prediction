Now A routine traffic stop ends with Whittier police in 'a gunfight for their lives,' leaving one veteran officer dead \nOne officer was killed and a second injured in a shootout with a gang member who was wounded, authorities said. Tony Barboza and Richard Winton . His condition is unknown, but he’s expected to survive.\nPiper said he and others were devastated by the death of Boyer, who was known for his friendly disposition and willingness to lend help and advice. \nHe leaves behind two adult sons, according to the department. \nBoyer joined the department in 1989 as a jailer and dispatcher before becoming an officer in 1990. \nOne of his pastimes was performing as a drummer with Mrs. Jones’ Revenge, a classic-rock tribute band in Temecula that played at wineries and weddings. \nBand leader Jeff McNeal said drumming “was probably a nice release for him, with the kind of high-stress work he does.” \nBoyer’s skills “elevated” the band, said McNeal, 57, calling him “probably the easiest guy in the whole band. Always willing to play. He loved the music. It was his passion.” \nMonday’s shooting marked the third time a Whittier police officer had been slain in the line of duty in the department’s 100-year history. The Police Department has about 128 sworn officers who patrol the cities of Whittier and Santa Fe Springs in southeastern Los Angeles County. \n“This is a very sad day for our officers, the families involved, the Whittier Police Department and our community,” said Mayor Joe Vinatieri. “But we’re pulling together. And we're going to take care of these families, and we're going to take care of this police department.” \nA procession of police vehicles traveled from UC Irvine Medical Center, accompanying Boyer’s body to the Orange County coroner’s office. Their cars were greeted by law enforcement officers and firefighters who saluted as the vehicles drove by, some wiping away tears. \nIn the evening, the city held a vigil outside the Whittier Police Department. A crowd of about 1,000 police officers and other mourners overflowed onto the sidewalks of civic center, standing silently and holding candles while an enormous American flag hung from a firetruck. A framed photo of Boyer was placed in front of the memorial for the two other Whittier officers killed decades ago.
