You are not a United States citizen, despite being given the same rights under our Constitution. \nOther countries aren’t quite as nice to illegals as we are here in the states, but at least we have a man in charge who is committed to fixing the problem. \nHowever, a group of influential Mexicans is now looking to cause a big problem by urging illegals to jam the courts in order to fight President Trump and remain in the country longer. \nHmm. How about no!? \nFrom The Blaze : \nA nationalist surge has arisen in Mexico due to what many there see as President Donald Trump’s intent to broaden the scope of deportations of undocumented immigrants, but it’s taking an odd shape: a push by influential Mexicans to jam U.S. courts to keep Mexican illegals in the U.S. \nAccording to The   a group called Monarca — named after the Monarch butterflies that migrate across North America — is pushing several measures that aim to help Mexican migrants living in the U.S., one of which involves an ad campaign urging those targeted for deportation to take their cases to court. \n“The backlog in the immigration system is tremendous,” former Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda, a member of the group, told The Journal. He wants to double or triple that backlog, “until [U.S. President Donald] Trump desists in this stupid idea.” \nThe left will support this idea just like they do every other bad idea. \nHeck, they love them some Black Lives Matter, even though the group advocates for the deaths of police officers. \nProtecting illegals from deportation is just a way for Democrats to ensure they can keep the vote totals close on election day. \nTo Monarca, I say adios. And yes, I am speaking for America. LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:27:04.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
