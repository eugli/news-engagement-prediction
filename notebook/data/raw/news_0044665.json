However, the Prime Minister’s office has told her Mrs May was too busy to sit down with campaigners. \n“Margaret Thatcher wrote two handwritten letters to my mum regarding the Harrods bombing and the Brighton bombing,” said Ms Dodd. \n“My family met the Queen many years ago, and if she can find time in her busy diary I’m sure the Prime Minister can find one hour to hear from victims about what they have suffered over many years.” \nHorror: Melanie and Susanne Dodd at the funeral of their father (Associated Newspapers ) \nInspector Stephen Dodd, 34, was one of three Met officers killed by the IRA car bomb in Hans Crescent, near the side entrance of Harrods. They answered the call after terrorists telephoned a warning 37 minutes before the 25lb bomb exploded, leaving six dead and 90 injured. \nLike several other major IRA bombings in London, including the Docklands, Hyde Park and Regent’s Park attacks, the bomb contained Semtex high explosive supplied by Gaddafi as part of his campaign against the West. \nThe Government has revealed that Gaddafi salted away £9.5 billion in investments in Britain before he was deposed and killed in 2011 — money that campaigners say could help scores of people left seriously injured or bereaved. Ms Dodd wrote to Mrs May, asking her to meet campaigners who include a cross-party group of senior MPs. \nShe received a letter stating: “The Prime Minister appreciates you taking the time to write to her. However, owing to the tremendous pressures on her diary, I regret that it will not be possible to arrange a meeting.” \nRevealing that David Cameron had also refused to meet her when he was prime minister, Ms Dodd added: “I feel like the Government does not care about the issue that victims are raising.” \nRomford Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, who is helping to pilot a Bill for compensation claims, said: “It is about time that victims and families of victims received the compensation they have long deserved.” \nThe Treasury recently told Parliament that Libyan assets frozen in the UK are worth £9,467,630,000, including cash, properties and shares. \nA Downing Street spokesman said the Government hoped to secure a compensation package “once stability returns” to Libya. \n“We are determined to see a just solution for UK victims of Gadaffi-sponsored terrorism and the Foreign Office continues to encourage the Libyans to engage with UK victims and their legal representatives seeking redress.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:36:54.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
