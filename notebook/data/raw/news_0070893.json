(Getty) More A deflating season for South Florida men’s basketball got even more embarrassing Friday when the team left two of its players behind at an airport in Houston.\nThe Bulls, 7-20 and 1-15 in the AAC, lost Thursday night at Tulsa, then flew to Houston, where they would board a connecting flight back to Tampa. However, according to the Tampa Bay Times , two players, Troy Holston and Geno Thorpe, fell asleep at the airport. Nobody noticed, and the two were left behind when the team’s flight took off.\n[ Tourney Pick’em is open!

Both players arrived safely home in Tampa later that afternoon at approximately 4:25 p.m., where a staff member met them at the airport. They are joining the rest of the team in a charity activity today.”\nMonique Holston-Greene, the mother of one of the players left behind, ripped the program shortly after hearing of the incident.\n“It’s very disappointing, and it’s a reflection of how terrible a program the men’s basketball program is,” Holston-Greene, told the Tampa Bay Times .\nShe also went off on Twitter:\nWhen U think it cant get any worse THEY LEAVE UR SON+1 BEHIND SLEEPING AT THE AIRPORT GATE!
