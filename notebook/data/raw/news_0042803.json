News.com.au has contacted the private charter company for comment. \nMr Quartermain was flying the plane which crashed not long after taking off from Essendon Airport this morning. \nNews.com.au understands the plane was carrying four American tourists on their way to King Island for a golfing trip. There were no survivors. \nGreg De Haven and Russell Munsch, both from Texas, have been named as two of the victims. \nWorkers at Essendon Airport businesses and several aviation sources told the Herald Sun Mr Quartermain was “a great guy’’ and experienced pilot. \nThe company’s website says that Mr Quartermain had an Air Operations Certificate for more than 38 years and an “impeccable safety record”. Pilot Max Quartermain was one of five people killed in a Melbourne plane crash today. Source: Supplied Deeply saddened by the tragic accident at Essendon today. Our hearts & prayers are with the victims and their families. — Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) February 21, 2017 \nBut he had been involved in at least one “close shave”. \nOn September 3, 2015, Mr Quartermain was the pilot of one of two charter planes carrying a total of 18 people that came within one nautical mile of each other in a frightening close call in bad weather at Mt Hotham. \nThe two Beechcraft B200 King Airs from separate firms were ferrying Audi customers to an exclusive snow-driving event, from Essendon Airport and from Bankstown Airport in western Sydney, the Herald Sun reported at the time. \nNear the destination, Mr Quartermain’s plane from Essendon came as close as one nautical mile (1.8km) horizontally and 90m vertically to the Sydney plane. It landed on the runway in the wrong direction, in heavy cloud and poor conditions. \nThe Sydney pilot said in his report: “If this event did result in a midair collision, two aircraft would have been destroyed and 18 people would have been killed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:50:06.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
