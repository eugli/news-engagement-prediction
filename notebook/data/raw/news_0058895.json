Steve Williams broke his silence on the disappearance of his sister, admitting the past eight months have been \"horrific\". After forensic testing, police confirmed a body found in Macedon Regional Park was that of missing mother Karen Ristevski. \n\"Everything is very surreal,\" Mr Williams said. \n\"Yesterday just confirmed what we thought and knew all along. \n\"(I feel) upset, anger, but the strange feeling is almost relief.\" Mr Williams said the hardest part of the past eight months has been \"not knowing\". \nMr Williams, who is Ristevski's only sibling, said he knew from an early stage in the investigation that his 47-year-old sister would never come home, but it was the \"glimmer of hope\" that was the toughest part. \n\"The glimmer of hope, the glimmer of hope, glimmer of hope, and you know it's not going to come,\" he said. Mr Williams said \"no one ever said a bad word about Karen\". \n\"It's the question mark, is the toughest part.\" \nMr Williams said his sister was a dedicated mother to her 21-year-old daughter Sarah, and they shared a \"special\" bond. \n\"She was very dedicated to Sarah,\" he said. \n\"No one ever said a bad word about Karen, you can't. Mr Williams remembered his sister as a dedicated mother to her daughter Sarah. \n\"Nothing in regard to this has been fair, especially not to someone like Karen.\" \nMr Williams admitted that while his sister's body being found was an important development, it simply marked the beginning of another stage in the investigation. Borce Ristevski said earlier that his wife did not run away because of financial struggles. \n\"Finding Karen is only part of what's going on, there is other things to be wrapped up,\" he said. \n\"Everything Victoria Police have done, we greatly appreciate it. \n\"Obviously, they still have a lot to do, but I’d like to publicly thank them.\" Detectives arrived at the Ristevski home yesterday, just minutes before they confirmed Ristevski's body had been found. (9NEWS) \nRistevski's husband, Borce, turned up at his lawyer's office on Queen Street in Melbourne’s CBD this morning just hours after detectives confirmed the remains found in the park were that of his wife. \nMr Ristevski declined to speak with reporters. \nWhile police have not named any persons of interest in the investigation, and are yet to confirm if Ristevski was in fact murdered, Mr Ristevski’s lawyer told reporters this morning that his client was being treated as a suspect. \nMr Ristevski has always denied any involvement in his wife's disappearance. \nHe told police in August his wife vanished after an argument over a few hundred dollars. He stressed his wife had not \"done a runner\" over their finances. \nAnyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:15:13.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
