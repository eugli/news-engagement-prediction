He was 66. His death was confirmed by his wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley, a professor at Rutgers University. No cause was specified. Mr. Colmes, the grandson of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in New York. He worked in radio and as a stand-up comic before he was recruited in 1996 as the counterpart to Mr. Hannity, an Atlanta talk-radio host who had been selected by Roger Ailes, the Fox News founder and chairman, so far in advance that some insiders referred to the show as “Hannity & Liberal to Be Determined.” After auditioning prospective co-hosts, Mr. Hannity, a conservative firebrand, was said to have preferred the affable Mr. Colmes. “Hannity & Colmes” was born and remained on the air nightly until 2009. \nAdvertisement Mr. Colmes also ran the Liberaland blog, contributed to AOL News and wrote several books, including “Red, White & Liberal: How Left Is Right and Right Is Wrong” (2003) and “Thank the Liberals for Saving America” (2012).
