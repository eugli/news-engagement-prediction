Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg steps in as the acting national security adviser as of Tuesday. \nIn the resignation letter, which came less than a month into the job, Flynn said he had calls with the Russian ambassador during Trump's transition and relayed \"incomplete information\" about those discussions to Pence. Pence initially said Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Russia, but Flynn later said he \"couldn't be 100 percent sure\" the issue didn't come up. \nEarlier on Monday, Conway had said Trump had \"full confidence\" in Flynn. Press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump was \"absolutely not\" aware that Flynn had possibly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. \nLauer opened his interview with Conway on Tuesday by recalling her Monday defense and asking, \"Were you out of the loop on this?\" \nLauer said Conway's story was starting to make him believe that Flynn wasn't freelancing when he made the call to the Russian envoy, but that he instead was making that call on behalf of the incoming administration. \n\"No, it would be a mistake to conclude that,\" said Conway. \"Remember, in the end it was misleading the vice president that made the situation unsustainable.\" \n\"Which the White House knew about last month,\" he retorted. \nMany in Hollywood were swift to react to the development Monday night on social media. \n\"This administration is less than a month old and is steeped in scandal, incompetence, conflict of interest and internal disarray,\" tweeted Alec Baldwin, who famously portrays Trump on Saturday Night Live . \nWhile CNN and MSNBC went wall-to-wall with coverage when the Flynn news broke Monday night, Fox News largely ignored the story and mainly covered the breaking news through Twitter and its on-air news ticker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:38:20.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
