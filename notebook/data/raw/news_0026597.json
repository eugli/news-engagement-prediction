In this season of giving, and in this cold weather, a young woman found a way to help those in need, and then took it a step further. Here's linsey Davis. Reporter: It all started as a college assignment. We were tasked with going out into the community and coming up with things that Detroit could use. Reporter: This is what Veronika Scott came up with. A coat that converts into a sleeping bag. And has since morphed into much more, thanks to a woman that yelled at her. Full-on screaming at me, yelling, saying, look, coats don't matter, this is pointless, I need a job, I don't need a coat. Reporter: A sentiment we heard for ourselves. We're not interested in a handout. We need a hand up. Reporter: So, Veronika, just 22 years old at the time, created a blog with a donate button. That button raised over hundreds of thousands of dollars. That allowed me to hire the first three individuals from the shelter. Reporter: Since then, the empowerment plan has shipped out 20,000 coats worldwide, all donated. They currently employ 36 people who all started out in a shelter. They're not just teaching me how to sew. They helping me move on with my career. Reporter: Are you aware of the impact that you are making? If it was just me, all alone, this would not be here. It's an amazing group of people behind me that I owe everything to. Reporter: A coat of many comforts, also helping many get back on their feet. So, we choose Veronika and everyone at the empowerment plan. From all of us at ABC, have a great holiday. A zamboni mishap shutdown city hall.
