During the In Memoriam segment, in which the Academy pays tribute to figures from the film world who have died over the previous 12 months, a photo of a still-living film producer was accidentally included. \nThe image of Australian producer Jan Chapman appeared in the montage film, with accompanying text naming costume designer Janet Patterson, who died in October 2016. hey @TheAcademy you need to pull this and replace with a photo of Janet Patterson, not very much alive Jan Chapman https://t.co/REY9xRh8Cb — palace films (@palacefilms) 27 February 2017 \nM s Patterson was previously nominated for four Oscars , for her work on The Piano, Portrait of a Lady, Oscar and Lucinda and Bright Star. \nMs Chapman, who had worked on Bright Star and The Piano with Ms Patterson, told Variety she was \"devastated\" by the error saying: “I am alive and well and an active producer.” This came up in the In Memoriam section at #Oscars2017 . But isn't this (living) Australian film producer Jan Chapman? pic.twitter.com/YKIMGBUv5E — David Berthold (@DavidBerthold) 27 February 2017 \n“I was devastated by the use of my image in place of my great friend and long-time collaborator Janet Patterson. I had urged her agency to check any photograph which might be used and understand that they were told that the Academy had it covered. Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up.” \nT he In Memoriam tribute film featured stars including Carrie Fisher, Prince, and Debbie Reynolds, and was accompanied by a performance of the Joni Mitchell song Both Sides Now by award-winning singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles.
