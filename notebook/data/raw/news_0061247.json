A Kansas man was charged on Thursday with shooting to death an Indian man and wounding another Indian man and an American in a bar, and federal authorities are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Adam Purinton, 51, was charged in Johnson County, Kansas, with one count of premeditated first degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated first degree murder, Johnson County District Attorney Stephen Howe told a news conference. Purinton is accused of shooting and killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and wounding Alok Madasani, also 32, in the Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, on Wednesday evening, according to a statement from the Olathe Police Department. At least one bystander told the Kansas City Star that the man shouted \"get out of my country\" before shooting the Indian men. He is also accused of wounding American Ian Grillot, 24, who was shot when he tried to intervene, the Kansas City Star reported. Two officials from the Indian consulate in Houston were going to Kansas to meet the injured men and police to \"ascertain more details of the incident and monitor follow up action,\" Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Vikas Swarup said in a statement. \"I am shocked at the shooting incident in Kansas in which Srinivas Kuchibhotla has been killed. My heartfelt condolences to bereaved family,\" Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj said in a Tweet. The US embassy in New Delhi condemned the shooting. \"The United States is a nation of immigrants and welcomes people from across the world to visit, work, study, and live,\" US Charge Affaires MaryKay Carlson said in a statement. \"US authorities will investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case, though we recognise that justice is small consolation to families in grief.\" Howe would not elaborate on the details of the incident or the motive for the shooting. \"We want to be able to be sure about our facts versus speculation. So we are not prepared at this point to talk about the particular facts of the case because this is still very fresh,\" Howe said. 'INCREDIBLE SHOCK' Kavipriya Muthuramalingam, a friend and former colleague of the shooting victim, has raised more than $250,000 via a crowd-funding website to help his family with funeral and other expenses. \"This came as an incredible shock - as he is one of the most gentle, nicest human beings you would meet,\" Muthuramalingam said. \"He was non-confrontational, non-controversial, easy-going, always smiling.\" The killing led news bulletins in India and drew strong reactions on social media, amid growing concerns that US President Donald Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric on immigration and jobs has fueled a climate of intolerance. \"Don't be shocked! Be angry! Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla,\" Siddharth, a well known South Indian actor, tweeted to his 2.6 million followers. Don't be shocked! Be angry! Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla https://t.co/BHiSY7SiCH Trump's election was welcomed at first by many in India who interpreted his calls to restrict immigration by Muslims as signaling support towards Hindu-majority India, which for decades has been at odds with Pakistan, its largely Muslim neighbor.
