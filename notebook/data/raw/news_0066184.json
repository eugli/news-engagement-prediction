When Josh Kulp and Christine Cikowski met in culinary school, after both pursuing other careers, they started hosting an underground supper club in their apartments, known as Sunday Dinner Club. Over the years, their living room dinners became more and more popular and on one fateful night, when they were serving fried chicken with a corn cake topped with honey butter, the butter accidentally ended up on the chicken and the rest was history. In this episode of Chef’s Night Out, Josh and Christine head out with their CDC Cam Waron and friend Maurizio Fiori of Half Acre Brewing Co. They start their night out at La Sirena Clandestina for a Brazilian feast, then go to Billy Sunday for proper cocktails, and finish it all off with steak tacos at Taqueria El Asadero. The night ends back at HBFC, where Josh and Christine whip up fried chicken fried rice for a group of hungry friends.
