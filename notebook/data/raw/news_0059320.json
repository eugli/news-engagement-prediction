They notified people that if they had been at the location on the evenings of Feb. 7 and Feb. 11, they should monitor themselves for possible symptoms. \nArnason would not say which businesses had been contacted because there were several as “the cases” have been at several businesses and locations throughout the area. \n“We’ve contacted the ones we feel that there may be a risk of exposure so they can notify people who may have been at those locations,” he told Global News. \nREAD MORE: Why do parents refuse vaccines?

The rarity of the virus is due to most people having been vaccinated, Arnason said. \nHe said they are also going through the vaccinations of people who became ill and said some have had vaccinations, while others have had incomplete vaccinations. As a result, he said this has prompted the NSHA to review if there are any ways to improve the province’s vaccination programs or ways to get vaccinations to those not completely immunized. \nFree vaccinations are available for anyone in Nova Scotia born after 1970 and Arnason recommends people should check their records to ensure they have received both doses. \nMost people recover from measles within two to three weeks, however there is a higher risk for complications in infants, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. \nSymptoms of the virus include: Cough ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:29:25.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
