Cameron resigned as prime minister hours after it was announced. \nA spokesman for Rothermere refused to confirm or deny whether Cameron had sought Dacre's dismissal. \nThe spokesman said: \"Over the years, Lord Rothermere has been leant on by more than one prime minister to remove Associated Newspapers' editors but, as he told Lord Justice Leveson on oath, he does not interfere with the editorial policies of his papers.\" \nDacre also declined to comment on whether Cameron had sought his sacking. Paul Dacre is a staunch Eurosceptic Reuters \nIn a statement to the BBC, he said: \"For 25 years, I have been given the freedom to edit the Mail on behalf of its readers without interference from Jonathan Rothermere or his father. It has been a great joy and privilege.\" \nA spokesman for Cameron said: \"It is wrong to suggest that David Cameron believed he could determine who edits the Daily Mail. \n\"It is a matter of public record that he made the case that it was wrong for newspapers to argue that we give up our membership of the EU. He made this argument privately to the editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, and its proprietor, Lord Rothermere.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:36:32.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
