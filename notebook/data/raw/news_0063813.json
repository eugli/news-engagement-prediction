The LA Times has estimated that Trump’s deportation policies could affect nearly eight million people. \nWith that in mind, it’s unclear whether Kelly spoke out of turn today, or simply provided rhetorical cover for the Administration’s ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities remains. What’s clear, however, is that he and President Trump are probably going to have an uncomfortable conversation in the coming days. \nKelly and Trump also seemingly contradicted each other on the question of military involvement in deportations. \nOn Thursday afternoon, during a rambling speech about his newly enacted immigration policies delivered to a roomful of manufacturing CEOs, Trump described the deportation of “bad dudes” out of the United States as a “military operation.” This is notable.
