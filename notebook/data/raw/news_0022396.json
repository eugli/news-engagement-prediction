Having not played since November, Furyk felt like it was the first day of school as he stopped by nearly every hitting station on the driving range to catch up with his colleagues. \nBack home he also worked on changing the selection criteria for the U.S. squad ahead of the 42nd Ryder Cup, to be played September 28-30, 2018, at Le Golf National in France. Jordan Spieth gets into it with 'scums' seeking autograph \nFuryk, who was named captain one month ago, made a minor tweak to the selection of his four captain’s picks. Just as captain Davis Love III did in 2016, three of Furyk’s picks will be made following the Dell Technologies Championship (formerly the Deutsche Bank Championship), the second event of the FedExCup Playoffs schedule to end September 3. \nBut Furyk’s final selection will be made following the BMW Championship, the third FedExCup event which is slated to be completed on September 9, 2018. Last year, the final of captain Davis Love III’s four picks was announced following the Tour Championship, the final event of the playoffs. \nThe change gives Furyk one less week to make his pick. But it was necessitated with the Ryder Cup being played overseas and provides Furyk and his team an extra week of bonding. \nHis other small tweak which could play out big concerns the points system. In 2016, players earned 2 points for every $1,000 earned in the majors. In 2018, the winner will be the only one earning 2 points per $1,000 in the four majors. Others making the cut will earn 1.5 points per every $2,000. \nThe old system awarded more points to someone who finished third in a major than someone who won a PGA Tour event. \n“Because the Major Championship purses are so large, and we thank them for that very much, but we're looking at $10-$10.5 million dollar purses in the major championships. When you double the points in those events you in affect make a $20.5-, a $21-million dollar purse. In effect, they become weighted triple or a little more than a PGA Tour event,” Furyk said. “So when I looked at the finishes, if you finished third in the major championship, you earned more points than a winner in a PGA Tour event. And I really value winning. I want the guys that hit shots down the stretch, that have the guts, the fortitude, the game to win golf tournaments. And I find winning very, very important. So, winning a PGA Tour event with a strong field, to me, is more important than finishing third at a major championship.” \nAs it was for the last Ryder Cup, players will earn 1 point for $1,000 earned in the four majors this season and 1 point per $2,000 earned in the four World Golf Championships events. Players will earn 1 point per $1,000 earned in regular PGA Tour events in 2018. \nThe points system will end August 12, 2018 following the 100th PGA Championship, with the top eight players on the points list securing spots on the U.S. Team. \n“The idea and the goal for every Ryder Cup and for every captain is to try to identify the 12 best players from the United States that I can take to Paris with me, with our group, and to compete,” Furyk said. “So, I think we had a good system in the past. We're not trying to re-invent the wheel, we're not doing anything crazy, but there are a few minor changes.” Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:40:07.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
