The bundles of cash recovered from Former GMD of NNPC, Andrew Yakubu’s residence \n“He may have made recovery in the past. But in the last six years I am not aware of any recovery by the officer to warrant commendation by the Commission,” he said. \nMr. Magu, who spoke after the Commission’s monthly keep fit programme on February 11, urged all staff of the Commission to be dedicated to their jobs as only diligence, professionalism and uncommon courage would be rewarded with promotion.
