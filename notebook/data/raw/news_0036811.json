Here’s a plan to help your wallet, while also lowering your carbon footprint. By Feb. 16, 2017 7:26 a.m. ET Text Size Medium Large \nLiving with green values can be downright expensive. That’s especially true when your eco-conscience compels you to buy organic produce year-round, not to mention eco-friendly shampoo and laundry detergent. Want to take an even bigger stab at cutting your carbon footprint by buying an electric car? That’s going to take some real cash. Even Tesla’s mid-price Model 3 will start at $35,000 when it rolls out to consumers by the end of the year.

Turns out, saving the environment can mean preserving your bank account, as well. Being eco-conscious, after all, is about using less – less energy and less stuff – and that means you’re not spending buckets of money on powering your life or filling your closets. For strategies, we turned to The Story of Stuff Project , a group dedicated to cutting back on the things that fill our lives, particularly of the toxic variety. \nHere are some tips to gain you lots of green cred for next-to-nothing: \nSay no to junk mail: Who wouldn’t want to do that? But few of us actively attempt to put a stop to the mountain of junk mail and catalogues overflowing our mailboxes. As The Story of Stuff says, junk mail is “a huge waste of resources like wood and water.” Not to mention the purpose of much of it is to “sell us more stuff we don’t need.” The group runs a service to opt out of some 10,000 catalogues. Check it out at catalogchoice.org. \nBuy wisely: Not-all eco-friendly products are alike. In fact, the ingredients in many so-called green personal care products aren’t as healthy as they purport to be. To find out whether toxins are lurking in your toothpaste, go to Good Guide . Or avoid toxic worries altogether by whipping up your own household and personal care products with ingredients like vinegar, baking soda and lemon. If DIY isn’t your thing, consider replacing a product or two with a homemade version. Who knows, a big budget-friendly habit could take hold. \nBuy local and seasonal, sprinkled with organic: Buying organic vegetables and fruit, not to mention meat and eggs, adds up. Save your organic dollars for the “dirty dozen” -- produce the Environmental Working Group has found to be the most toxic when grown with pesticides (strawberries and apples top the 2016 list). Otherwise, buy “local seasonal food that isn’t transported halfway around the world,” Story of Stuff says. Bonus: many local farmers use minimal to no pesticides for produce sold close to home. Though they often can’t advertise as organic, buying from a farmer’s market gives you a chance to ask the farmer about their practices directly. \nGet rid of the waste: Here’s an easy way to make a huge green impact: cut your waste to zero. Okay, that’s tough, but you can get there with simple steps like bringing your own mug to your local coffee shop, carrying reusable water bottles to avoid buying plastic ones, shedding your car for the bus, composting food scraps, and upgrading equipment like computers instead of buying new. “Repair and mend rather than replace,” Story of Stuff says. \nEnd the impulse habit: You know, that tendency to throw an extra box of cookies in the shopping cart or to buy shoes in middle of the night when you can’t sleep. Consider that it takes nine pounds of carbon dioxide and 1,300 gallons of water to make a single T-shirt, says Grist, an environmental news site . In eco-terms, it’s fine to buy clothes you plan to wear for years, but not if they end up at the bottom of a drawer . “We have a national habit of making purchases so frequently and automatically that many of us barely even use or eat what we do buy,” Eve Andrews, Grist.org associate editor, tells Barron’s Next. “It’s incredibly easy to just not. Simply ask yourself before you buy something: How likely am I to benefit from this?” \nThen tally up all the money you save by squelching your impulses.
