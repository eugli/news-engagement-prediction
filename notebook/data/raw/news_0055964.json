Unless you're Z Palette, a magnetic palette makeup company that's sold online and abroad. Recently, Z-Palette has been caught under fire for bullying customers in the comments section of their social media channels. First, a bit of background on Z-Palette. The brand has been around since 2009, and has become increasingly popular for customizable makeup palettes, which you can use to insert any makeup pans you'd like. (Very smart. We'll give them that.) But according to Seventeen the social media war between Z Palette and their customers started with the promotion for their new product, the Z Potter, an $85 machine that removes makeup from its original pot so it can be transferred to a custom palette. As with any new launch, fans sounded off liberally, expressing thoughts good and bad on the brand's Instagram page. A few compared the product to a hot plate, which TBH it does strongly resemble . Z Palette, it's fair to say, did not take these comments lightly. The brand's account continuously responded to several customer remarks with offensive commentary. \"You look like a cheap date, but we're not messing with you\" one post read; \"Thank god we don't need your money\" said another. Some fans noticed the hostile tone and thought Z Palette may have been hacked. (No dice.)
