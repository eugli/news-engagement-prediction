And the next year, I just thought, instead of sending a new one, I'd send the old one back as a joke,\" Trentham told the Calgary Eyeopener on Tuesday. \n\"The next year he sent it back to me again, so that's how we started doing it, and that's kept us in touch with one another over the years.\" \nDespite not always living in the same city — and sometimes not even the same province — the two have remained close, still meeting for lunch every few months. \n'We argue, but not over religion': Jewish man, Muslim woman fall in love, get happily married Pair chocolate with this wine for your Valentine: Laurie MacKay's pick of the week Bob Trentham, left, and Don Borwick, together on the Sylvan Lake pier in 1942 at age 14.
