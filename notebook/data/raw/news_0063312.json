After the cop pulls the teen into a hedge, the boy's friends lunge at the officer, which causes him to pull out his gun and fire it. \nThe 13-year-old was arrested along with a 15-year-old, and the trigger happy officer is on administrative leave while the incident is under investigation. \nThere were no injuries from the gunshot, but the boy's grandmother told press he had suffered \"a lot of bruises.\" \nJennifer Dorscht said the boy was standing up for a 13-year-old girl who had originally been in a spat with the officer, and accused the cop of using profanity against the kids. She told NBC News : \n\"It's just a terrible situation. It could've been handled completely in a different manner. He's a good kid. He does all the right things, he has a good heart. I think that's why he stuck up for this girl.\" \nThe LAPD, however, says the videos \"do not depict the entire event.\" Their internal investigation found that the standoff \"began over ongoing issues with juveniles walking across the officer's property.\" \nRelated: Migos Reportedly Beat The Shit Out Of Sean Kingston! \nIn a statement, the department said the boy allegedly \"threatened to shoot the off-duty officer, at which time the officer attempted to detain the male… This led to a physical confrontation between the off-duty officer and several other juveniles.\" \nThe statement added the boy was booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for criminal threats and battery. His 15-year-old friend was arrested for assault and battery, but was released to his parents. \nJennifer Rojas , a policy advocate at the American Civil Liberties Union said the organization is \"deeply disturbed\" by the reports and demanded \"a full explanation of why, in an altercation between the police officer and youths, the youths were arrested but not the officer who fired his gun.\" We don't disagree. \nAs for the growing protests, the Anaheim Police Department encouraged \"peaceful protests in accordance with the law\" in a Facebook post, but noted \"acts of violence or vandalism will not be tolerated\": \nWhat a mess. \nWhat do U make of all this? Watch the original footage (below) to see the heated altercation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:12:15.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
