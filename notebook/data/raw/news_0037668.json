Whilst in Malaysia, everyone have to obey and follow our rules and regulations ... that includes North Korea.\" \nOn Friday (Feb 17) night, North Korea's ambassador in Kuala Lumpur Kang Chol accused Malaysia of concealing something because it would not release the body to the embassy. He said Malaysia was colluding with \"hostile forces … desperate to harm\" North Korea. \n“We will strongly respond to this act by the Malaysia side and the hostile forces of DPRK, and we will bring this matter to the international court…,\" he told the media, after seemingly trying to enter the National Institute of Forensic Medicine at Hospital Kuala Lumpur where Kim Jong Nam’s body is being held at about 11.40pm. \nNorth Korea had wanted Malaysia to release the body without a post-mortem. Malaysia rejected this request, completing the post-mortem on Wednesday. \nMalaysian police told Channel NewsAsia it would not release Kim's body to anyone until DNA sample is obtained from a family member and investigations completed. - CNA/de", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:25:05.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
