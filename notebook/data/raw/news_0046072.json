( IPL auction, live updates \nIt is the highest ever price paid for a foreign player in the marquee franchise league’s 10-year history. \nThe Pune franchise, to be led by Australian Steve Smith this season, exhausted all but Rs 3 crore of their kitty to bag the biggest player in this year’s IPL auctions. \nThe 25-year-old Stokes, among the seven players who had the highest reserve price of Rs. 2 crore, triggered a bidding frenzy at the auctions in Bengaluru. \nWatson eclipsed \nThe Rs. 9.5 crore paid for Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was the previous record paid for a foreign player. \nIt initially involved Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore before Delhi Daredevils and current champions Sunrisers Hyderabad jumped in. In the end, Rising Pune Supergiants, a team launched only last year, netted him. \nBen Stokes has taken giant strides as an impact all-rounder, and displayed his skills in the recent Test and limited-overs series played in India. \nThe record buy comes almost a year after Stokes’ heartbreak in India, after West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite’s final over heroics of four sixes saw England’s victory hopes vanish in the final of the World Twenty20 at the Eden Gardens. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:28.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
