PHOTO | COURTESY By AGENCIES \nThe new Nokia 3310 device, unlike its predecessor, comes with a 2 megapixel rear camera and a LED flash. \nTragically for social media enthusiasts there is no front camera for selfies on the new phone. \nThe updated version of the 90’s icon, famed for its seemingly indestructible qualities was unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Sunday. \nAnticipation of the device, a phone that doesn’t even have 3G, has been high ever since news of its release leaked earlier this year. \nThe relaunched 3310 is produced by new mobile firm HMD Global, which licensed the Nokia brand last year. \nSLIGHTLY BIGGER \nThe phone has a slightly bigger screen than its namesake, and in colour this time. It also has a camera on the back, which the original did not. \nIt does have a removable back cover and battery, and runs an updated version of the original’s S30 software. PHOTO | COURTESY \nThe software behaves so much like the original and follow-ups, with games like Snake built in, you might think you were caught inside some sort of time loop. \nHMD promises that the new Nokia 3310 will be as durable as the old one, often seen as practically indestructible by the teens of the 2000s. \nThe new 3310 is about half the thickness of the original and has 10 times the talk time, with 22 hours, and twice the standby time: one month – a duration almost unheard-of in 2017. \nHEADPHONES SOCKET \nIt’s charged via micro USB, so there’s no need to carry the pin Nokia charger of old, and there’s even a headphones socket in the bottom. \nFor all the great things that modern smartphones do, they have terrible battery lives. On this front, the new 3310 harkens back to the good old days. \nThe new 3310, which will feature the same “indestructible” body and long-lasting battery as the original, will retail for Sh6500 and it is expected to ship with software packing the same clock, calculator, reminder app, and games as its ancestor.
