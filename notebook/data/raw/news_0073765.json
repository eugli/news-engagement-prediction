Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe Washington, D.C. crowd has been on pins and needles for quite a while now regarding the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, also known as #NerdProm. Any other year, of course, journalists would be giddy over the idea of attending the fundraiser with their celebrity guests, but with Donald Trump in office and calling out media outlets over fake news, no one quite knew what to do. \nOn Friday, it was reported that CNN was “discussing internally” whether to attend . And just a week before that, ABC News’ chief political analyst floated the idea that the dinner be canceled altogether . \nCancel the dinner, boycott it, disinvite the president … what to do? Much of that hand-wringing came after Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and Bloomberg had canceled their pre- and post-dinner parties. All press outlets should boycott the WHCA dinner until the White House's abhorrent behavior towards members of the press stops. https://t.co/w2HYO28V7X \n— Mika Brzezinski (@morningmika) February 25, 2017 \nSpeaking of hand-wringing, President Trump wasn’t doing any Saturday, using his thumbs instead to send his regrets. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nSo, can the show go on without all the drama now? Is the question of attending no longer a moral dilemma?
