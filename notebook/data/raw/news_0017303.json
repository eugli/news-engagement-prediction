The app lets members of the public send off for parking tickets \nT he app is designed to be used by small businesses who cannot pay to patrol their own car parks, and want to ward freeloaders off their property around town centres or other busy locations. \nAfter users download the i-Ticket app and create an account, CPM will send them signs to put up around their parking spaces. If a car then parks on it, they can snap a photo on their phone and upload it to the app, entering details including the licence plate number. \nCPM will then use DVLA data to send a parking ticket to the vehicle owner of £60, which rises to £100 if not paid within two weeks. The photographer receives £10 for every paid ticket. The app is likely to lead to fears that private companies will issue more large fines from parking infractions Credit: Rex Features \nT he company describes the service as \"completely confidential\" and says it offers \"complete privacy\". However, it has raised concerns about private companies finding it even easier to issue large fines for minor offences. \n\"The sharp practices of parking companies are already regularly called into question with paid officials dishing out fines, but with members of the public being financially encouraged to shop motorists who overstay, it’s a recipe for disaster,\" the RAC's Simon Williams told The Mirror . \nParking enforcement has increasingly embraced technology in recent years by using devices such as automatic licence plate readers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:37:47.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
