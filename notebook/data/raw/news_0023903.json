Luckily for all of us, a WWLP reporter from Springfield, Massachusetts, got some help from a leafy man-creature lovingly dubbed “Pot Sasquatch.” \nA person in a giant costume of faux-weed leaves ambled ever closer to meteorologist Jennifer Pagliei on live television, stealing the show from all the stuck drivers attempting to navigate Winter Storm Niko on all-seasons. \nWWLP later released b-roll footage of Springfield’s happiest, hungriest snowman on their Facebook page, showing the man hiding behind a shrub and having a properly dank frolic in the snow as plows stand by to clear the roads of slippery fun.
