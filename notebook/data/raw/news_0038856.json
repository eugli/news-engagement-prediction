Nathan, ADL National Chair, and Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO, said: \"On two separate occasions over the past two days, President Trump has refused to say what he is going to do about rising anti-Semitism or to even condemn it. It is mind-boggling why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction. This is not a partisan issue. It’s a potentially lethal problem -- and it’s growing.\" Trump shut down a Q about bomb threats against Jewish centers. Let's ask @realDonaldTrump : \"What about the bombthreats\"? #answerthequestion pic.twitter.com/EMffFgcEoH — ADL (@ADL_National) February 16, 2017 On Wednesday, Trump evaded a question about the spike in antisemitic rhetoric and attacks across the country since his election win, responding by touting his victory in the Electoral College. A day later, Trump shut down a question by a haredi reporter of Ami Magazine about how the administration intended to tackle the rise in antisemitic incidents, which has included dozens of bomb threats targeting Jewish Community Centers across the US. \"In light of the bomb scares, online harassment, physical vandalism, death threats and other hate crimes, there is a simple question at hand that Americans of all faiths deserve an answer to – what is the Trump Administration going to do about the recent surge of anti-Semitism? What concrete steps will the White House take to address intolerance?\" the ADL statement read. \"We are going to keep asking these questions – and urge others in the press and public to do so as well – until we get a clear answer from our President.\" STATEMENT: AJC DISMAYED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TREATMENT OF REPORTER, UNWILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS ISSUE OF ANTI-SEMITISM https://t.co/4gPKi1hNM5 pic.twitter.com/eyLnSnXntN — AJC (@AJCGlobal) February 16, 2017 AJC CEO David Harris described Trump's handling of this subject as \"worrisome and puzzling.\"While acknowledging the presence of Jews in Trump's administration and family, Harris stressed the need of the government to help combat the phenomenon of antisemitism.“Respectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of fellow Americans, but rather, to help solve a problem that for many is real and menacing,” Harris said.
