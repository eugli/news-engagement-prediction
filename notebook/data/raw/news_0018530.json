newspapers and check out television.\nTrump says that at the start of his presidency he's been surprised by \"the size, the magnitude of everything.\" He says being president can be a \"surreal experience in a certain way.\"\nBut he adds, \"you have to get over it because there's so much work to be done.\"\n___\n7:40 p.m.\nThe White House says President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have discussed their \"shared commitment to combatting terrorism in all its forms.\"\nThe White House says Trump reiterated U.S. support to Turkey \"as a strategic partner and NATO ally\" in a phone call Tuesday with Erdogan. Trump also welcomed Turkey's role in countering the Islamic State group.\nTurkey's relations with the U.S. were strained under the Obama administration, with Ankara expressing frustrations over what it perceives as U.S. reluctance to extradite a U.S.-based Muslim cleric whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating the failed July 15 military coup.\nTurkey has also been angered by U.S. support to Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State forces.\n___\n7:05 p.m.\nThe Spanish prime minister has told U.S. President Donald Trump that Spain is in the best position to be the new U.S. administration's partner in Europe.\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy spoke with Trump during a 15-minute phone call Tuesday.\nA statement from the Spanish government says Rajoy argued that Spain's GDP growth of more than 3 percent puts it in a good position to be a link between the U.S., Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. It says Rajoy also reminded Trump that Spanish investment has created 80,000 jobs in the U.S.\nThey also discussed security, with special attention on the May meeting of NATO leaders in Brussels and cooperation between their two governments in fighting international terrorism.\n___\n7 p.m.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office says he has held a telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump.\nOfficials at Erdogan's office did not immediately provide details on their discussions, which took place early Wednesday in Turkey.\nThe conversation was their first since Trump's inauguration.\nRelations between NATO allies Ankara and Washington were troubled under the Obama administration over Turkish demands for the extradition of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating Turkey's failed military coup, and by Turkey's insistence that Washington stop supporting Syrian Kurdish fighters who are affiliated with outlawed Kurdish rebels in Turkey.\nAnkara has pinned hopes for improved ties on Trump's presidency and the call was being closely watched in Turkey.\n___\n5:30 p.m.\nThe chairman of the House Oversight Committee met with President Donald Trump at the White House but says the two men did not discuss oversight.\nRepublican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah says he met with Trump for 30 minutes Tuesday in the Oval Office, along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.\nChaffetz says that before he even sat down, \"The president said: 'No oversight. You can't talk about anything that has to do with oversight.' I said 'fair enough.'\"\nChaffetz says he is unlikely to grant Democrats' requests to investigate possible conflicts of interest with Trump's sprawling business empire, but insists his committee will pursue a \"vigorous oversight agenda\" under an all-Republican government.\nThe lawmaker says he's \"not the president's cheerleader, but I do want to fix things.\"\n___\n4:50 p.m.\nThe White House has tapped aides to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Sen.

The remark followed Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson's criticism of an unnamed state senator who believes police shouldn't receive forfeiture money unless a case ends in conviction.\nTrump responded: \"Who is the state senator? Do you want to give his name? We'll destroy his career.\"\nThe sheriff wouldn't say and it was unclear to whom Eavenson was referring.\nRepublican state Sen. Konni Burton has proposed the most sweeping forfeiture reforms but wouldn't stop to answer questions Tuesday outside the Senate in Austin, Texas.\n___\n4:20 p.m.\nThe 2016 election is never far from President Donald Trump's mind.\nWhen Trump met Tuesday with a group of sheriffs from around the country, he saw not just lawmen but battleground states.\nTrump talked about his victories with officials from Pennsylvania and North Carolina. And when a sheriff from Minnesota introduced himself, Trump said if he had campaigned in the state one more time he would have won it.\nMore than two weeks into his presidency, the president is still fixated on the 2016 campaign.\nMany of his public comments include references to his election performance. At times, the comments appear to be light and boastful while in other moments, he's awkwardly interjected election talk into forums that are decidedly apolitical.\n___\n3:30 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump plans to welcome the New England Patriots to the White House to honor their fifth Super Bowl win.\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump was looking forward to hosting the team. He called the Patriots' 34-28 win over the Falcons a \"spectacular game.\"\nThe Super Bowl-winning team traditionally visits the White House.

Mexico's government denied the comments.\nA White House official later confirmed the comments, but said they were meant to be \"lighthearted.\"\nTrump said in a weekend interview with Fox News that he made the offer and Pena Nieto seemed interested in help.\nBut Sanchez said the Mexican constitution would not allow that.\n___\n2:10 p.m.\nThe White House is asserting that President Donald Trump \"respects the judicial branch\" despite his tough talk over the pushback against his immigration ban.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer asserted Tuesday that there is \"no question\" over the president's respect of the courts.\nEarlier, the president told members of the National Sheriff's Association that the court fight over his refugee and immigration executive order could end up in the Supreme Court.\nTrump said he's going to take his fight to uphold the directive \"through the system.\"\nTrump lashed out last weekend over a court order to block the ban, saying on Twitter, \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\"\n2 p.m.\nA White House spokesman says President Donald Trump will host Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.\nTrump has been calling his resort the \"Winter White House,\" and Press Secretary Sean Spicer says that Abe's trip there is a testament to the close relationship between the U.S. and Japan.

Over the weekend, Seattle U.S. District Judge James Robart temporarily blocked the order, sparking harsh criticism from the president of both the judge and his decision.\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says he can't believe his administration has to fight in the courts to uphold his refugee and immigration ban, a policy he says will protect the country.\nTrump says some people with \"the wrong intentions\" are trying to \"take a lot of our powers away.\" He says that more Americans support his policies than those protesting against his executive order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and blocked entries from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nOn Tuesday, state and federal lawyers will argue over the ban before a panel of federal appellate court judges.\nTrump says his order will keep bad people out of the U.S. His comments came during a White House meeting with county sheriffs.\n___\n10 a.m.\nTurkish officials say President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will hold a telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump â€” their first since the American leader took office.\nOfficials from Erdogan's office said the conversation would take place around 2100 GMT, or 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\nTurkey's relations with the United States under the Obama administration were strained, with Ankara frequently expressing frustrations over what it perceives as U.S. reluctance to extradite U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating the failed July 15 military coup.\nTurkey has also been angered by U.S. support to Syrian Kurdish militia fighting the Islamic State group.

He also once bragged about how well he knew Putin, but he has since walked back those comments, amid accusations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:42:14.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
