Sharon Meijland put this sign up in her restaurant Credit: Rainbow Vegetarian Cafe/Restaurant \nA vegetarian café owner became the target of internet trolling when she refused to accept the new £5 note at her business. \nSharon Meijland had said: \"Our whole business is based around not having dead animal products on the premises.\" \nMore than 130,000 people have signed a petition against the use of tallow to manufacture the polymer notes, which were released in September.
