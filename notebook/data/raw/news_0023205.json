It’s time to shed more light onto these challenges, so I had a candid conversation with Barb, a former patient and four-year breast cancer survivor, about her experience. I hope other women will benefit from these insights. Dr. Terstriep: When did you first notice a change in intimacy? Barb: I noticed an issue very soon after my [breast cancer] diagnosis, but it was probably nine months into my journey before I had the guts to talk to you about it! There was so much energy going to chemotherapy and radiation, plus grief and fear – and just feeling lousy – [that] sex was at the bottom of any ladder I was on. I thought things would change when I finished treatment. Certainly my husband was interested, but I had no libido. A lthough it’s rarely discussed, women commonly face relationship problems in sex and intimacy following a breast cancer diagnosis, and these side effects can linger far beyond treatment. I know it was a combination of things. The chemo threw me into menopause. [The medication] Arimidex stopped all estrogen development. So there were huge changes in my body. There was a complete lack of lubrication vaginally [and] no tone in my breasts. And all of those sexual feelings, like in the nipples, just weren’t there. Dr. Terstriep: How have you tried to improve things? Barb: One thing you said, I took to heart: I needed to be honest with my husband, to sit down and talk about how I was feeling. That was my first step. I told him it wasn’t related to how I felt about him. I also had friends who would say, “Try erotica! Do whatever it takes to get that spark back!” I read 50 Shades of Grey and things like that. I’d like to say that it helped, but it really didn’t. A lthough it’s rarely discussed, women commonly face relationship problems in sex and intimacy following a breast cancer diagnosis, and these side effects can linger far beyond treatment. Dr. Terstriep: Do you find pleasure once sex is initiated? Barb: Occasionally, but sometimes not. I do it because I love my husband. He’s been 100% supportive, but he shouldn’t have to live a celibate life – although I probably could. Dr. Terstriep: Were you prepared with the possibility that you might face these issues after your treatment? Barb: I didn’t expect that there would be zero interest. I didn’t expect to see the changes in my body. I should have known that when you go into menopause you’re going to see that your skin sags, that your breasts sag. But that’s not why I’m not interested in sex. Dr. Terstriep: You don’t think it’s your body image? Barb: I really don’t. One thing that other women may have faced is that I didn’t have great desire before I was diagnosed. A lthough it’s rarely discussed, women commonly face relationship problems in sex and intimacy following a breast cancer diagnosis, and these side effects can linger far beyond treatment. Dr. Terstriep: So you were starting at a low level of what you thought was normal? Barb: Yes, and hormonal testing confirmed it. All the treatment just zapped what little I probably did have. It’s tough. Also, to be honest, intercourse is not comfortable. Even with those lubricants. Dr. Terstriep: Then we need to talk about that. I’d recommend trying Replens, which can offer moisture. Use it three times a week, and then use Astroglide or KY [lubricant] during intercourse. If that’s not enough, there are low-dose estrogen options. The lowest is Vagifem; it’s a vaginal tablet you take daily for two weeks, then two times per week. Barb: I thought that when you have an estrogen-based cancer, you don’t have any estrogen? Dr. Terstriep: Right, so this is vaginal estrogen. The idea is that there’s little systemic absorption. So far, studies don’t suggest an increase in recurrence with using vaginal estrogen in combination with a hormone blocker like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. These studies have been small, however, so we don’t know for sure. I think it’s reasonable to do a short course of low-dose vaginal estrogen to relieve symptoms if the vaginal moisturizers aren’t enough, and then lower the dose to the minimum needed.

Barb: Do you use that over a period of time, and then you don’t need to use it anymore? Dr. Terstriep: Sometimes just getting it back into a lubricated state is enough to get you by for a couple months. And sometimes once a week is enough. Do you have any advice for other women in your shoes? Barb: Talk with your physician. And most important, talk with your spouse. Don’t be afraid to try something outside your comfort zone. If you’re comfortable with your spouse and willing take some risks, that’s what you have to do.
