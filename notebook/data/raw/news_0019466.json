Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe new coupling of Daniel and Sinead in Coronation Street has gone down as badly as a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol station. Chesney chucks Sinead out on the street and goads Daniel whenever they cross paths. \nDaniel’s dad Ken learns of the relationship when he bumps into a half-dressed Sinead and he warns Daniel against choosing love over his studies. \nElsewhere, Luke surprises Tracy with a romantic trip away. But when it turns out he’s decided to take her to Bristol to search for missing Andy, she’s not happy. \nAnd it seems that Adam may not be after Rosie for her brains or beauty (and if he was, he’d be disappointed on at least one count). He learns something about her ex-boyfriend that gives him a money-making idea. \nLove is... terrible on this Street! Another fine stress Leanne rages at Toyah and Peter (Photo: ITV) \nJust when she should be putting her feet up and nesting, pregnant Leanne’s life is stressed to the max. \nShe’s fallen out with her sisters since discovering Toyah’s secret boyfriend is her ex and that Eva knew. When she moans to Simon about them texting her to try to get back in her good books, Simon tracks them down and orders the sisters to back off. By the end of the week she’s facing a parent’s worst nightmare, when, to her fury, Peter lets Simon go to a party at the Trafford Centre and the boy goes missing! Charmer who will harm her Bethany and nasty Nathan (Photo: ITV) \nIt’s not often soap villains have no redeeming features. Well, hello Nathan. He’s a sexual predator who has won Bethany’s trust through flattery. This week he undermines her confidence by getting his friend Mel to post mean comments about her online. \nWhen police question him about a missing girl he begs Bethany to give him an alibi. The girl turns up safe and Bethany feels terrible for doubting him. She begs him to forgive her and reveals her feelings for him. \nThen Nathan drives her home when she’s drunk and it’s clear she’s in terrible danger.
