Quite the opposite in fact. Behind the scenes work is done through mental skills coaches and professional development personnel to minimise pressures that lead to desperate situations, but Umaga acknowledges challenges in this area remain on-going. \n\"In the last week with what's happened to Sione Lauaki and Dan Vickerman it shows that even as rugby players we are not bulletproof,\" he said. \"We can't let pride stand in the way of asking for help if that's what we need to do.\" \nUmaga spoke openly of the efforts he and Blues management continue to make to develop relationships that allow players to express themselves without fear of it impacting their prospects. Ad Feedback \n\"We can give them the resources to understand they can have those discussions. The hardest thing for us, and for everyone, is making it a safe environment to talk where they feel like they can. That doesn't come around by saying it. It happens where they see things being put out there so they can see that they can show their feelings. It's not a male thing to do especially in a rugby context. \n\"Those are some of the barriers we're trying to breakdown now. We've got to help each other; talk, and not just with ourselves but with our families. \n\"We've got to hope that we know enough about our players that we can see certain things when we feel they're off so we can approach and talk about that. That's some of the toughest things; trying to get to know all of the players and their habits so when they do come in and they're not feeling well we can try pick that up straight away.\" \nTraditionally, the life after rugby transition is one many battle with. There is no replacing the feeling of playing in-front of full stadiums; training alongside good mates, and earning exorbitant salaries that allow athletes to live comfortably and provide for those around them. \nUmaga feels fortunate coaching fell into place for him after a glittering 12-year pro career, but appreciates that is far from the case for others. \n\"I had a good support structure in terms of my family, wife and kids keeping me motivated and knowing there's others you want to do it for. \n\"That's sometimes maybe where we do get lost. Maybe you live this life and you think it's going to last forever and then it's taken away and sometimes we get a bit embarrassed about what we used to do but you can't do it anymore and can't provide in the same way. That adds its own pressures so it's having that understanding from family about what that is. \n\"This game doesn't sustain you for the rest of your life. If it does it's only for the top two or three. Other than that you've got to realise you're going to have to work. That was something I realised when I finished. \n\"I want to live a long time. I want to see my grandkids grow up and be around for that. That's a long time out of rugby so straight away you've got to find something else to do that will provide.\" \nPerhaps these conversations need to be had more often. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:25:43.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
