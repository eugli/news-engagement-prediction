Maximo Garcia shows me a text message from a drug mule with a crucial clue about his missing grand-nephew.\nMAXIMO GARCIA , Relative of missing migrant: “Look for him in the coyote arroyo near the border, where there’s some fencing.”\nJEAN GUERRERO: A drug mule using Garcia’s phone said he’d found the young man’s body and phone in the Arizona desert. These men have volunteered to search for him.\nWe are now starting our search for Marco Antonio.\nWe drive into the desert, on our way to hike along one of the most dangerous smuggling routes near the U.S.-Mexico border.\nMAXIMO GARCIA (through interpreter): If we find him, it’s bad news for me. If we don’t find him, it’s bad news either way.\nJEAN GUERRERO: The volunteers prepare their gear for hours of walking in 100-degree heat. They stock up on water and ice. They call themselves Aguilas del Desierto, or Eagles of the Desert.\nThey’re plumbers, farmers, construction workers. Most are immigrants who live in San Diego. They spend their weekends rescuing migrants or recovering their bodies as far away as Arizona.\nELY ORTIZ , Founder, Aguilas del Desierto (through interpreter): So, their relatives will stop having uncertainty about, what happened to my relative to give them that peace.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Founder Ely Ortiz started the group after his own brother, Rigoberto, disappeared trying to enter the U.S. through here in 2009. His coyote, or human smuggler, confessed he’d abandoned Rigoberto during his last breaths.\nELY ORTIZ (through interpreter): I would think, where’s my brother? What happened to him? How did he die? A thousand thoughts went through my head. And I told myself, I’m not going to leave my brother lying out there.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Ortiz called the Mexican consulates, Border Patrol and other agencies.\nELY ORTIZ (through interpreter): I asked everyone for help, and nobody would help me.\nJEAN GUERRERO: So he went out on foot, with the help of human rights activist named Rafael Hernandez. Together, they found his brother’s body. It was closure for the Ortiz family.\nInspired, Ortiz launched Aguilas del Desierto. He chose the name Aguilas because of the eagle’s powerful eyesight and wingspan. His volunteers walk into the desert. Some stay with the cars to rescue us if necessary.\nOrtiz reminds us not to lose sight of each other, for safety. Along the coyote arroyo, the earth is unusually fertile for a desert. It’s one of the most transited border routes precisely because there’s so much vegetation for cover. But that means it’s also impossible to follow Ortiz’s mandate to keep an eye on each other.\nThere’s people to my left inside of the brush and to my right. Signs of migrants are everywhere, tossed Red Bulls, backpacks, dolls.\nHere’s a toy.\nAnd drug mules’ shoes with carpet strips on the bottom to cover tracks.\nThere are all over the place.\nMost prevalent are these black gallon jugs, which smugglers sell as a sort of supernatural, strength-inducing water. I’m following a volunteer named Jose Genis. He says it’s hard to spot bodies in this area because of all the foliage. Dying migrants often crawl beneath trees seeking shade.\nJOSE GENIS , Volunteer: And it makes it difficult for us to find them because they kind of blend in, especially after a body has been decomposing.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Genis is a Navy veteran and a licensed EMT. On previous searches, he has found dehydrated migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally. He has helped save their lives, treating them until Border Patrol could come take them to the hospital.\nJOSE GENIS: I feel American, but, at the same time, I have my roots from Mexico, so I try to help out as much as I can.\nJEAN GUERRERO: The heat is oppressive, even through the trees. There are snakes and scorpions and cattle skeletons. We keep losing each other. We repeatedly have to stop and regroup, finding each other by blowing whistles. We have to make it out before sunset, when smugglers inhabit this terrain. But we’re not covering nearly enough ground.\nJOSE GENIS: If anything, we have one-and-a-quarter miles.\nJEAN GUERRERO: We press on.\nGenis and I find a Bible crawling with insects. I wonder if the person who dropped it made it out of this desert alive. Hundreds of people die crossing the border each year from things like dehydration or hypothermia.\nIn Arizona alone, the death count is astounding. Official figures exclude the countless bodies that are never found.\nEv Meade of the Trans Border Institute says border deaths since the 1990s range as high as 10,000.\nEV MEADE , Trans Border Institute: Yes, this is a large number of people. And this is the kind of number we talk about when we talk about an armed conflict or a war.\nJEAN GUERRERO: He says the deaths are linked to U.S. border fence construction. Border crossing deaths were almost unheard of until the U.S. built long stretches of border fence in the ’90s.\nToday, about 700 miles of the 2,000-mile border are fenced, mostly around cities. This has forced migrants onto remote, dangerous routes through the desert, with its extreme temperatures.\nPresident Donald Trump has already signed a directive to start building a border wall.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’re going to build the wall.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Meade says Trump’s wall could increase migrant deaths by funneling them onto still more dangerous crossing routes. Some are dying on the way.\nEV MEADE: We just really haven’t had a serious policy discussion or a public discussion about the humanitarian consequences of the building of the wall.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Back in the desert, we pass barbed-wire fencing. Could it be the fencing referred to in the text message? Suddenly, someone finds something. I scramble up a hill, following Genis.\nIt might be him, but we don’t know.\nFirst, I see the skull. A few meters away are the legs, clothed in pants. The body has been torn apart by coyotes or some other animal. Genis says the body looks like it’s been decomposing for about a month. Marco Antonio disappeared a month ago.\nMAXIMO GARCIA , Volunteer (through interpreter): Unfortunately, we just found remains of a human being. We’re going to investigate to see if it’s him.\nJEAN GUERRERO: Garcia calls his relatives to tell them what we have found. The Aguilas get to work. They can’t touch the body. It could be a crime scene.\nThey note the coordinates of the remains, which they will share with local police. Officials will pick up the body and take it to the medical examiner for DNA analyses.\nThe men improvise a marker out of a balloon they find to help officials spot the body. Back at the vehicles, Garcia thanks the Aguilas for the search. He says they were the only people willing to help him.\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I’m Jean Guerrero along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n  arizona immigration mexico migrants smuggling  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:18:53.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
