Getty Images 4 Robbie Williams will collect the Brits Icon award and perform at tonight’s ceremony \nA source revealed: “ Robbie is in absolute agony and it’s causing him and his team a lot of stress. \n“He struggled through his rehearsal on Monday but you could tell he was in serious pain. \n“It’s not improved at all since then and he has cancelled some of his promo today so that he can rest up. \n“But Robbie is a consummate professional. He is determined his performance will go ahead and has said he won’t let anything stop him taking to the stage.” Splash News Robbie is due to perform but his back problems are causing issues PA:Press Association 4 He has opened up about his health issues before, revealing he has arthritis in his back \nRobbie opened up about his health issues last year, when he revealed he has arthritis in his back which affects his ability to play football and dance. \nHe said: “I’ve got arthritis in my back so I can’t put my foot through a ball. \n“I have very tight hamstrings, barely existent calves. I dance like a drunk dad at a wedding. But I’ve got to do something to fill the time on stage.” \nBut despite his painful condition, the Angels singer doesn’t have a lavish area backstage to relax in. \nThe 1975 are performing with a 100-piece choir at the ceremony, who have taken over the space which was supposed to be Robbie’s dressing room.

Paddy McGuinness has one. He gave me comedy award. \n\"Phil Taylor has one, Wayne Rooney gave me a pair of his World Cup boots for one — they're just in the house.\" \nGot a story ?
