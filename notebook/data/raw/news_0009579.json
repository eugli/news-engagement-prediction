Mr. Guterres’ first day at UN Headquarters as Secretary General began with the laying of a wreath at the Memorial Wall in the Visitors’ Lobby.\nShortly after taking office two days ago, he made an appeal for peace . “Let us make 2017 a year in which we all – citizens, governments, leaders – strive to overcome our differences,” Mr. Guterres said Sunday morning, urging people to share his New Year's resolution: “Let us resolve to put peace first.”\nHe will serve for a five-year period until 31 December 2021. He was Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from June 2005 to December 2015. He succeeds Ban Ki-moon who served as the Secretary-General from 2007 until 31 December 2016.\nSecretary-General António Guterres arriving at UN Headquaters for the traditional wreath-laying ceremony accompanied by Deputy Secretary-General Amina J.
