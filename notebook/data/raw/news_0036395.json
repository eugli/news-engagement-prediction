It is best that he takes some time out to sort his life out. He appears to be exhausted. \n“As a result, Danny is not filming on the show at all. There is an enforced break that is expected to last a number of weeks. \n“At the end of the day, he remains the biggest star of the show — so everyone is determined to get him back to his best.\" Insiders claim the star is on an \"enforced break\" (Photo: BBC) Read More \nThe star’s departure would cause havoc on the show because he is at the centre of major plot lines which are worked out months in advance, the source added to The Sun . \nDanny, who makes £400,000 a year and is contracted until October, has previously hinted he may leave Albert Square. \nLast month he said: “Four years is a long time. It’s been really rewarding but there’s other stuff out there. \n“I’d love to show other sides to me, I loved theatre and all that.” Read More “The producers are concerned about him for a number of reasons,\" a soap insider claimed (Photo: BBC) \nLast year the star, who joined EastEnders in 2013, was involved in a fight with friends of reality star Mark Wright at V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex. \nHe was left with a black eye following the attack, which happened in front of his daughter Dani, then fiancee Jo Mas and EastEnders co-star Danny Boy Hatchard. \nSpeaking at the time he said: ““I’ve waited nine months to see Justin Bieber and this has ruined it.” Eastenders \nDanny has been acting since he was just 16 including roles in films such as Human Traffic and on stage in theatre productions such as Harold Pinter's Celebration. \nHe landed the role as Mick Carter in 2013 and has been a firm favourite on the show ever since. \nLast night Danny’s representatives and the BBC did not respond to comment.
