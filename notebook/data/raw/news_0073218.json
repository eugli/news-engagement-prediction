This angered some locals who armed themselves in a bid to evict them. \n\"We have arrested about 100 youths over these skirmishes and we are hunting for more,\" said Mukinda. \nThe land is vast and is claimed by many groups but authorities say it belongs to East Africa Portlands Cement. \nThe groups were armed with machetes, bows and arrows as they confronted each other for hours. \nLand issues are emotive and the violence coming ahead of the August elections threatens peace at large. \nMore police officers were mobilized to the scene as the violence escalated affecting traffic flow on the main Nairobi-Mombasa Highway. \nNairobi Senator Mike Sonko visited the scene and said he was there to quell the violence. \n\"I was passing when I witnessed it and decided to intervene to ensure peace,\" he said adding tension was high there but police were on ground", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:38:51.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
