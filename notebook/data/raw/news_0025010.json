Photo: Domain.com.au \nA 2014 report by UNSW’s Department of the Built Environment estimated that there were 8500 apartment blocks, predominantly in the eastern and beach-side suburbs where developers might take advantage of relaxed planning laws and modern building techniques to put more – and more expensive – units in the same space. \nIn this case, the unit blocks were older, red-brick three-storey buildings. The recent change in the 2015 Sutherland Shire Local Environment Plan favours higher density – nine storeys are allowed under the code – as well as commercial zoning for ground floor retail, so it will be a mixed use development. The Sydney-based developer who has bought the units wants to remain anonymous. \n“One of the stratas has been talking with developers for over five years now but with the zoning change and the change in strata laws, they all favoured redevelopment,” said Mr McEvoy. “Six developers lodged interest. We ended up with 100 per cent of the owners wanting to sell. \n“One of the developers offered us the option of residents moving back into the new apartments, but they decided to go with another who didn’t. That can be a pretty risky proposition as if, at the construction stage, the developer goes bust, owners can lose their security and end up with nothing.” \nProfessor Bill Randolph, director of the City Futures Research Centre at UNSW, says this kind of thing can only increase. \n“We need to do some research into buildings in the coastal strip in Sydney to see what kind of buildings are offering themselves to developers, and others where developers are circling them,” he told Domain. \n“A number of leading developers responded to our call for ‘expressions of interest’,” says John Thomas, chairman of the group of residents at 49-51 Gerrale Street.” As you can imagine, getting 32 owners across two properties who have varying opinions and priorities was a challenge, however with implementation of the new strata reform laws … we were able to pull together a compelling offer for all involved.” \nThe new collective sales laws were brought in to help free up prime development land in established suburbs, especially when it was occupied by smaller, older buildings well past their use-by dates but which the owners were obliged by law to maintain and repair. \nThe potential for “hold-outs”– a minority of owners who simply didn’t want to move and others basically holding their neighbours to ransom to maximise their own benefit – led to laws allowing 75 per cent of apartment owners to agree to sell regardless of the wishes of the other 25 per cent. \n“We will see a lot more of this happening now,” said John Cunningham, president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW. “We have a lot of old buildings that are falling down, have concrete cancer issues and are past the end of their economic life and it would be far more expensive to renovate them than to knock them down and start again. \n“There have even been suicides of people hit by levies [that] they can’t afford to repair the blocks. It’s better off to demolish them and the new strata laws with the 75 per cent rule makes that more possible, rather than one person being able to put a whole redevelopment in jeopardy.” \nUnder the new laws, any forced sale ultimately has to be approved by the Land and Environment Court, where unwilling sellers and those who suspect they have been cheated can plead their case. \nBecause strata law demands a cooling off period of 60 days as part of the forced sales process, and the new laws only came into force on November 30, they have not yet been tested in court. One of the first cabs off that rank will be a building in Macquarie Park where CBRE has sold on an 80 per cent share to a prospective developer. \n“No one quite knows what will happen,” said Mr McEvoy. “No one has taken a strata body to court yet. The new strata laws haven’t been tested, so no one knows, and it’s pretty much up in the air. “", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:23:22.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
