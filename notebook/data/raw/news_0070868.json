Hield already had a lot on his plate, having to move across the country on short notice and join a totally new team. According to Kings reporters, a case of missing undies briefly thinned an already sparse wardrobe in his new city: \nBuddy Hield is having a welcome to Sacramento moment. Someone has stolen his boxers. — James Ham (@James_Ham) February 24, 2017 On first glance this would have been nothing more than a bit of rookie hazing, but apparently this isn't the first panty raid conducted in the Kings' locker room: \nWelcome to the King rook. The locker room bandit who steals underwear strikes again. Victim tonight: Buddy Hield. Yes this is a thing — Sean Cunningham (@SeanCunningham) February 24, 2017 It's pretty strange even by rookie hazing standards, but the longevity of this stunt really takes it up a notch. The identity of the thief was a mystery at first, but Hield was eventually able to tie the crime to Koufos. Given the chance to share this tragic story with reporters, Hield revealed the most absurd part of this mess -- he's not yet able to even pronounce the name of the guy who is going through his delicates and holding them hostage: Hield can find solidarity with his new teammates, since he's not the only Kings player to be victimized by Koufos, but that doesn't exactly help clear up the strangeness or the motive behind the repeated larceny. Koufos is in a locker room with a gaggle of millionaires, and could surely freak teammates out by stealing some nice jewelry, or altering the prank so it somehow did not involve underwear. At least this story has a happy ending. The missing pair was eventually returned to Hield, and he'll be able to avoid going commando for the time being. But by the sound of things, he'd better watch his locker closely as long as Koufos remains in Sacramento.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:33:38.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
