Supplied \nA Kiwi Cabs driver, in white car at back, swerves around a car stopped for an orange light to make a dash through a Tinakori Rd intersection. \nKiwi Cabs confirmed the driver would be fired as this incident followed another complaint about him just two weeks before. \nREAD MORE: Supplied \nOncoming cars had the clear to go but fortunately didn't. \nAs the light turns green for southbound traffic to enter the intersection the taxi can be seen swerving around a stopped grey hatchback. \nWith the oncoming lane's light well-and-truly green it heads into the intersection, thankfully dashing through before cars or an oncoming cyclist had started into the intersection. \nOrsman, who has had a dashcam for two years, said this was the worst driving he had filmed, thanks to the swerve around the stopped car and heading into the intersection against a red light. \nHe had not approached police with the footage - as he had with previous footage – as the licence plate of the car could not be clearly read. \nKiwi Cabs general manager Muneer Oraha said the same driver had been warned about bad overtaking just a fortnight ago. This incident was the final straw and the driver would be called in to the office on Thursday. \n\"I'm pretty sure he is done with company – he is fired.\" \nGPS technology meant the company was able to figure out which driver was behind the wheel. \n\"It is affecting the image of the company, we do have a really good fleet,\" Oraha said. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:31:23.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
