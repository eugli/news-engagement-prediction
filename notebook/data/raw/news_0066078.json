Source: Tweet \nFour days after members of Western Sydney's active fan base unfurled the offensive tifo during Saturday's 1-0 loss, Arnold revealed he had not received even a phone call from the Wanderers, who are facing significant punishment from Football Federation Australia over the incident. \n\"I would probably have liked one by now,\" Arnold said. \n\"I haven't heard from them for four days so I don't want one now.\" \nWhile he insisted the tifo, widely perceived as homophobic, did not bother him personally, it had upset his family. \nArnold's wife, daughters and grandson were at the game and saw the Red and Black Bloc's banner along with many others among the 45,000 spectators at ANZ Stadium. Gay football club calls for homophobic A-League fans to be banned A-League players who witness homophobic behaviour by fans during matches should be encouraged to walk off the field, gay rights advocates say. \n\"Does it bother me? Not at all,\" Arnold said. \n\"I've got a thick skin and I've been in this game for 30-odd years. \n\"I've been called a lot worse and been through tougher times. \n\"But I think it's completely inappropriate for my children, my family. \n\"My family were upset, to the fact where my girls have come to every game of football that I've coached and played since I can remember, and they don't want to come anymore. \n\"It's a strong statement from girls and my wife, my wife is extremely upset. RBB slam FFA as 'dictatorial' for banner censure Western Sydney's supporters group Red and Black Bloc has slammed Football Federation Australia as being \"dictatorial\" for condemning a crude banner unfurled during Saturday's A-League derby. \n\"On top of that, all those young kids that turned up to the game with their parents to watch the game. \n\"I don't think it has any place in Australian sport.\" \nDespite FFA's show-cause notice foreshadowing significant punishment to their club, the RBB defended their use of the banner on social media and slammed the governing body as \"dictatorial\". \nThe group refused to back down or apologise, instead posting pictures of potential merchandise depicting the image.
