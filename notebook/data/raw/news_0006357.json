The Terrapins, now ranked 17th in the AP poll, claimed their 20th victory Tuesday night. They've lost just twice this season. Entering the night, Maryland was ranked 40th at KenPom, which is staggering to me. \nMaryland beat Ohio State on the road, 77-71. Star point guard Melo Trimble had 13 points, including seven points and the final rebound in the closing two minutes. The Terps looked composed, even if they took too many 3-pointers. Three things to know \n1. Terps haven't beaten anybody \nThis is what you'll hear critics say. The Terrapins haven't been must-watch this season because they haven't played many teams who are projected as NCAA Tournament clubs. The Terps' nonconference schedule ranks 210th in the nation at KenPom.com, and Maryland is the only team ranked in the Top 25 to not face a Top 25 team yet this season. \nBut this is still a good team and one with a résumé that has become less prone to critiques by the day. With the victory at Ohio State on Tuesday, Maryland has an 8-0 record in road/neutral games. That is massive, because the Terps only have four road games left, so Mark Turgeon's team is guaranteed to have a much better win percentage away from home than at least 85 percent of college basketball. \n2. This team is so good in close games \nTuesday night was a six-point win, but let's look closer. In games decided by five points or fewer this season, Maryland is 5-1. The Terrapins are not just winning away from home, but they're closing out games with small margins and large margins alike, and the opponent isn't dictating that. We've seen variety. They beat Georgetown on the road by one, yet won at home over Illinois by 25. Indiana , Michigan , Minnesota and Kansas State have all taken Ls to Maryland by an average of 5.3 points. There is value in this. When you get so accustomed to playing close in the end, comfort level goes up. This will help Maryland come March. Melo Trimble and Maryland are dominant in close games. USTASI \n3. Justin Jackson is the name, other than Melo, to know \nYet another really good freshman. Man, we have like 60 of them this season. Jackson is a power forward who has exploded in the past two games, going for 50 points and 22 rebounds. If Maryland gets that kind of production out of Jackson, then look out. This team would unequivocally be a top-15 club if Jackson can average 18 points and 10 boards down the stretch. Talk about a blooming rose. Trimble has been a top-20 player this season, and in some ways has carried the Terps. If Jackson starts dominating inside and finding a new level of efficiency, Maryland -- which has just one league loss -- will win the Big Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:58:24.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
