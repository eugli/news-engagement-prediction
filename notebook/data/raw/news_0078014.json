Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway takes a photo as US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House. Picture: AFP Kneeling on a sofa, in heels, while snapping photos of the US President puts Kellyanne Conway back in hot water Staff writers, News Corp Australia Network February 28, 2017 3:06pm SCANDAL, or sideshow? President Trump’s personal adviser Kellyanne Conway back in the headlines ... for digging her heels into a White House sofa. US political commentators erupted as the pictures flashed around the world. President Trump was staging an Oval Office photo-op for dignitaries from US black colleges and universities. Kellyanne Conway accidentally photobombed the show. media_camera President Donald Trump meets with leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office. Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway is on the couch. Picture: AP She was caught kneeling — in heels — on one of the new gold-laced sofas brought into the Oval Office in Trump’s personal makeover. She was snapping shots on her phone before settling back to examine her handiwork. Little did she realise she was putting herself in the line of fire of official White House photographers. Once again, Conway has become the headline. @AFP @KellyannePolls Would u let your daughter sit like that? Show some class every chance you get. The Telegraph left to the fore, demanding the senior US government official ‘show some class’. Others agreed, expressing outrage at the thought of sharp heels digging into such expensive furniture.

But social media reaction wasn’t all one way. Many left to Conway’s defence, saying the comments were ‘vile’ and ‘sexist’. Others called it the ‘downfall’ of ‘real news’. While media obsesses over Kellyanne Conway on the sofa in a dress, this is happening.

The embattled adviser has been sitting on the sideline in recent weeks after sparking controversy for referring to a fake ‘Bowling Green Massacre’ story in defence of President Trump’s travel ban. Then she openly promoted Ivanka Trump’s fashion brand — something considered to be a serious breach of ethics among public service circles. media_camera Forget me, it’s all about him ...
