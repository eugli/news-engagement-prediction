The veteran pass rusher told ESPN that he plans to to play in 2017 and that returning to the Broncos is a possibility. \n“I talked to Vance (Joseph) and he said I’m part of the equation,” Ware told Jeff Legwold . “Hopefully I come back there, and I want to, but it’s also about the man who writes the checks and that’s (general manager John) Elway. But I’m ready, I’m passionate and I want to lead that defense.” \nWare’s 2016 season — the last on his contract with the Broncos — ended early when he was placed on injured reserve and underwent surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his back. \nOver the last two seasons in Denver, Ware totaled 11.5 sacks, 24 quarterback hits and 40 total tackles, but missed 11 games because of injuries. \nIn 2015, he aggravated his back early but returned late in the season and played the entire postseason. After overcoming an infection in his back during the offseason, Ware opened 2016 but played only two games before fracturing his forearm and missing five games to recover. \nHe was placed on IR before the team’s season-finale, against the Raiders on Jan. 1. \n“About two more weeks I’ll be able to do everything,” Ware told ESPN’s Hannah Storm on Friday . “Right now it’s just strengthening everything around it, making sure your core is good so you can go out and play again.” Related Articles ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T21:39:01.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
