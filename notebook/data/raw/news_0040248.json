Last year, McKenna was similarly awarded as one of three writers for Little Big Town’s hit track “Girl Crush.”\nAdvertisement\nThe artist’s solo album “The Bird and the Rifle” was itself Grammy-nominated this year, in the best Americana album category, but William Bell’s “This Is Where I Live” ultimately took that trophy.\nMcKenna isn’t the only Grammy winner with strong Massachusetts ties.\nTexan folk singer Sarah Jarosz, a graduate of New England Conservatory in Boston , emerged victorious in two categories this year: best folk album (for her fourth record, “Undercurrent,” the artist’s first to feature all-original material) and best American roots performance (for “House of Mercy,” that album’s lead single). In his review of that record , Globe correspondent Steve Morse called the singer’s voice “shimmering” and, comparing the sound to that of Simon & Garfunkel, wrote that “Jarosz often conveys a poetic fragility.”\nIsaac Feldberg can be reached at isaac.feldberg@globe.com , or on Twitter at @i_feldberg .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Flori-mckenna-wins-songwriting-honors-grammys%2FHmMtt6SBlwTuSfRLK6WW4M%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tLori", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Lori", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Flori-mckenna-wins-songwriting-honors-grammys%2FHmMtt6SBlwTuSfRLK6WW4M%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Flori-mckenna-wins-songwriting-honors-grammys%2FHmMtt6SBlwTuSfRLK6WW4M%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Lori", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F2017%2F02%2F12%2Flori-mckenna-wins-songwriting-honors-grammys%2FHmMtt6SBlwTuSfRLK6WW4M%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Lori", "http://twitter.com/i_feldberg"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:41:42.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
