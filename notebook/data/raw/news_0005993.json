The size of the pay packet suggests the magnitude of the task. The appointee will be expected to help to secure dozens of free-trade deals for Britain, with both its former partners in the European Union and others around the world, after the country leaves the EU in 2019. Having started last July with just 50-odd trade negotiators, the DIT is now up to about 200.\nIn this section Where should Britain strike its first post-Brexit trade deals?

Brexiteers argue that, unchained from the protectionist EU, Britain can become “one of the firmest advocates for free trade anywhere in the world”, as Theresa May puts it. This is the message the prime minister took to Donald Trump on January 27th.\nReaching agreements with the EU, and then America, appears to be the government’s priority. Where then should it look to do deals in the post-Brexit world?\nThe best place to start, most trade economists agree, is with the countries that already have deals with the EU. Britain is a party to all of these; when it leaves the EU it will at least have a template from which to draw up its own fresh bilateral agreements. Doing this with as little disruption as possible would be best for business, argues Ben Digby of the Confederation of British Industry, a lobby group.\nNot every country will roll over for Britain, however. Take Indonesia, South-East Asia’s largest economy, which later this month will receive Liam Fox, Britain’s trade secretary. Indonesia is already drawing up a trade agreement with the EU. Thomas Lembong, head of Indonesia’s investment board and a former trade minister, says that he has already agreed with British officials that Indonesia’s eventual deal with the EU could simply be tailored a bit to suit Britain. But, he warns, “Of course the UK would be in a much weaker bargaining position outside the EU, so we would expect much more favourable terms of trade against the UK post-Brexit.”\nOther countries will take a similar view. However, argues Jim Rollo, a former trade adviser to the British government, Britain has some cards to play. One reason that trade deals with the EU take so long to negotiate (18 years and counting in the case of Mercosur, a South American bloc) is that European agriculture is strongly protected. Once outside the EU, Britain could abolish the EU external tariff on many food imports and gain concessions in return. For example, the EU subjects oranges to a complex formula of tariffs designed to protect Spanish growers, the world’s main exporters. Britain spends about £135m ($170m) a year on oranges but grows none itself, so could eliminate all tariffs on citrus fruits without undermining its farmers.\nSome of the countries that have already expressed interest in striking trade deals with Britain, such as Australia and New Zealand, have their own agricultural exports in mind. But there will be some awkward trade-offs. Australia will want to export more beef to Britain, and New Zealand more lamb. Britain’s own farmers could be squeezed by this: on February 1st the rural affairs secretary in the Welsh Assembly warned that a deal with New Zealand could “absolutely destroy” the Welsh lamb industry. And loosening regulations on genetically modified crops, something American farmers would like to export to Britain, might provoke complaints at home from farmers and consumers alike.\nThe point of making such concessions would be for Britain to gain access to foreign markets in things that it excels at selling. Services, particularly banking and related professions like accountancy, are among the exports that Britain is keenest to tout, says Shanker Singham, a trade economist at the Legatum Institute, a think-tank. In 2015 Britain exported £225bn-worth of services (constituting 44% of all its exports) and imported just £138bn, whereas in goods it ran a sizeable deficit. Britain might therefore want to target countries with growing middle classes and still-weak services sectors, such as India and China, as well as Indonesia.\nInsurance, for instance, where Britain is strong, has enormous potential for growth. India currently accounts for about 1.6% of all insurance premiums and 2.2% of life insurance premiums, despite being home to about 18% of the world’s population.\nIn many countries, however, services are among the most protected industries. Often this is for political reasons as well as regulatory ones. Analysis by the World Bank shows that even within the EU, many countries are more closed than Britain. The likes of India will be hard to crack (see chart), and offering access to Britain’s agricultural market may not help as it is relatively small.\nThe new chief negotiator will be busy. The freedom to sign trade deals with any country offers a world of potential. But even replacing the deals that Britain will lose on dropping out of the EU will take many years, and new opportunities may be harder to realise than they look.
