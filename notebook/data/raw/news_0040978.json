Ex-Madeleine McCann cop whose claimed Gerry and Kate faked her abduction \nAmaral claimed Maddie had died in the McCann's holiday flat and her parents faked her abduction to cover up the tragedy By Hannah Crouch Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments THE PARENTS of Maddie McCann lost their court appeal to silence an ex-cop who claims they covered up their daughter’s death. 1 Goncarlo Amaral claimed Kate and Gerry McCann faked the abduction of their daughter \nMaddie’s parents faced fresh turmoil with the emergence on YouTube of a controversial TV documentary based on Amaral’s accusations. \nA close pal of the McCanns branded the film a “lunatic conspiracy theory” and revealed the parents are considering legal action. \nBut who is Amaral and what claims did he make about the McCann’s? Who is Goncalo Amaral? \nAmaral is an ex-police officer who led the initial hunt when three-year-old Maddie went missing from the Algarve in 2007. \nThe now retired detective was removed as head of the investigation after criticising British detectives. \nIn July 2008, Amaral released a book called “The Truth of the Lie” which claims the McCanns faked the abduction. What did Amaral claim in his book? \nIn the book, it is claimed that Maddie had died in their holiday flat and her parents faked her abduction to cover up the tragedy. \nThe book was released just three days after Gerry and Kate were told their status as formal suspects had been lifted on July 21 2008. \nAmaral is understood to have earned £344,000 from his book before it was banned and a subsequent TV documentary. Why is there a legal battle? \nThe McCanns claimed the book was hurtful and launched a libel battle against Amaral in April 2015. \nAmaral was ordered to pay Kate and Gerry £430,000 plus interest in damages after losing round one. \nHowever this decision was reversed by appeal judges in April last year, siding with the former police chief and overturning a ban on his book. \nThe decision sparked a fresh appeal by the McCanns to the country’s highest law court. \nThe McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer Isabel Duarte lodged the couple’s new appeal last May after vowing to fight the U-turn by judges over Amaral’s book. \nCriticising the ruling in favour of the ex-police chief, which a friend of the McCanns said had left them “seething,” she said: “This decision was an appreciation of the law and not the facts. \n“We can appeal to the Supreme Court which we will do as we have instructions from our clients.” \nHowever the Supreme Court voted in favour of Amaral. What happens now? \nKate and Gerry could now face a huge legal bill which has which had been frozen until the outcome of the final appeal.
