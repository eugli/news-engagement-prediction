And how are other countries dealing this issue? If you have ever wondered about these questions, this instalment of KiniGuide is for you. \nTo provide some basis for comparison, we will also be citing country rankings on the 2015 democracy index , which is the latest available version of the index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit based in London. \nThere are 60 questions in the democracy index questionnaire used to measure the health of a country’s democracy, including one on whether political financing in the country is transparent and well-accepted. \nWhy should we care about how political financing is done? \nAs with most things in life, running a political machinery costs money. Whether it is just to keep the lights on at a service centre or to run a nationwide election campaign, money is needed. \nIn democracies, most of a party’s funding usually come in the form of donations from individuals and sometimes corporations. This is widely regarded as a part of one’s freedom of expression - that is, to express one’s political belief or affiliation by contributing financially. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
