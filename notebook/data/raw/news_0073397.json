Refreshing the most iconic phone in its history – the Nokia 3310 feature phone – was a masterstroke in so many ways. \nBut I wished it hadn’t. Or at the very least, I wished HMD Global tried a little harder to make the 2017 3310 more appealing than just a modern take on a classic device. \nAt the launch event, HMD Global introduced the Nokia 3310 in a fun, affable manner – this was no smartphone, but the CEO jokingly listed down the spec list as if it was. Members of the press were already expecting this, and so were more than willing to soak it in. \nBut as the euphoria settled as I left the event, something struck me: the new 3310 isn’t exactly great, even by feature phone standards. Not Outstanding – Even by Feature Phone Standards \nLet’s start with price. At 49 Euro or $52 or RM230, this isn’t an affordable device by feature phone standards. Take HMD’s first feature phone release, the Nokia 150 , for example. \nIt is almost a carbon copy of the Nokia 3310 in terms of hardware (2.4-inch QVGA display, Series 30+ OS, microSD card slot, 22hr talk time and 31 days standby time) with only a few differences (VGA camera vs 2MP on 3310, 1,020mAh battery vs 1,200mAh on 3310, and an unspecified internal storage). \nThe Nokia 150 costs $26 (or RM159 in Malaysia ) – half the price of the 3310.Also, it is 2017. Even in developing nations, the popularity of messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat is escalating. Moreover, some previous Nokia feature phones had a dedicated button for WhatsApp , or even had Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp pre-installed . MWC 2017: The Legend Is Back - The New Nokia 3310 Is Here \nYes, developing nations are still heavily reliant on SMS. But if HMD were to truly live up to Nokia’s old “Connecting People” motto, the future would be on messaging apps that work even on basic internet like WhatsApp. After all, this is the same app that has a staggering 1.2 billion monthly active users , according to Statista. \nSo clearly, there is no way that Nokia developed the 3310 for emerging markets – it already has a strong portfolio of feature phones for that. No matter how you look at it, the Nokia 3310 is a lot of money for not a lot of phone (even if it comes with a new version of Snake). \nThis begs the question: Why did HMD release a new Nokia 3310? \nLet’s start by not talking about the device. HMD Global’s major challenge is how it navigates the extremely perilous smartphone market – it is competitive, fickle, and unforgiving; just look at companies like HTC, Sony, and LG. \nAnd as a startup, it does not have the resources required to develop the very most premium flagship that can out-spec the OnePluses or Galaxies in the market. This move, coincidentally, is also a very expensive risk: fail, and you could end up losing the business entirely. \nWhat HMD does have is the Nokia brand, and the nostalgia it carries for entire generations of consumers. Few people have not owned a Nokia phone in their lives, and those who do usually have fond memories involving T-9 keypads, Snakes, and Space Impact. \nIt also has what HMD calls “the most-memed” phone ever made. It may be 17 years old this year, but what other old phone gets compared to an iPhone and win (in a few areas)? Coincidentally, this is also a feature phone that is very cheap to make.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:59:02.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
