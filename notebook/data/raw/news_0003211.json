(Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo \nLarry A. King — a consultant for the city of Detroit with a generous expense package that covered dozens of flights and hotel stays — could be rehired next week, about six weeks after he left the city when his contract expired. \nKing, who lives in Washington, D.C., would get a pay raise under his new contract. But, he now would be responsible for his travel expenses. The new, one-year deal would pay him $215 an hour, up from his previous rate of $175, for an annual total of $357,200. \nThe city of Detroit paid about $307,000 on an annualized basis for King's salary and expenses under the terms of his old contract between April 2014 and July 2016. \nKing's proposed contract was discussed at today's City Council budget committee meeting, where council members pressed Detroit Chief Financial Officer John Hill and other officials for answers about why King's services are necessary. The committee sent the contract to the full council with recommendation for approval. The full council is expected to vote on Tuesday. \nRelated: City of Detroit reimburses CFO for $4,000 rent, flights \nThe Free Press' report in August on King's compensation package was followed by other stories about similar expenses the city afforded to Hill and his chief of staff John Hageman . Mayor Mike Duggan said in October that the city will continue its arrangement to reimburse Hill and Hageman because they are essential to Detroit's compliance with post-bankruptcy requirements. As CFO, Hill’s responsibilities include keeping the city’s budget balanced, making sure the city can meet future pension obligations and restructuring several city departments related to finance. \nAs for King, he will help Detroit finish implementing a sorely needed new payroll system, Hill said. Consulting firm Ernst and Young offered to do the same job as King for $2.1 million, Hill said. \n\"The cost savings that we believe occur are added to the fact that this is the right person who will be able to help us get this done,\" Hill said. \"I don't think we have another consultant in the city at that rate, $215 with no expenses.\" \nKing's contract limits his hours to eight a day and 32 per week. \nCouncil members were interested Wednesday in vetting King's contract because some said they felt they were left in the dark about his previous contract, which cost the city nearly $700,000 as of August. At one point in Wednesday's budget committee meeting, Councilwoman Janeé Ayers said, \"I couldn't have picked (King) out if he was sitting right next to you.\" \nThe City Council played no role in approving King's previous deals, which, as of August, covered $65,724 in expenses for frequent trips to and from his home in Washington for two years. \nThe expenses included 69 round-trip flights and 226 hotel nights in Detroit . King also received per diem for days he worked in Detroit of more than $50. \nHill stressed Wednesday that King would be footing his own travel and lodging bills under his new deal. Ayers asked Hill to repeat that commitment in a louder voice at the budget committee meeting since King's previous expense package rankled some in the community. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:12:58.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
