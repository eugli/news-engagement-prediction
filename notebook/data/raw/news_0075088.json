The last areas Sydney first-home buyers can afford Sydneysider Neha Chopra had never been to Darwin before she decided to uproot her life and move to Australia’s northernmost capital city. \nThe 25-year-old was sceptical when she chose to leave behind her family, friends and job offers in Sydney for the “perfect” graduate policy role with the Northern Territory government. But that was more than a year ago and she hasn’t looked back since. \n“I was actually hesitant because I did a lot of researching beforehand and I was like ‘wow this place sounds really different’,” Neha told Domain. \nSydneysider Neha Chopra moved to Darwin to take up a graduate role with the NT government and hasn’t looked back since. Photo: Shannon Ruddock \nWhile Darwin’s outdoor and laid-back lifestyle, proximity to national parks and multicultural community make the city an attractive place to live, it’s the career opportunities that are surprisingly drawing in an unlikely crowd of young professionals from big cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. \nNeha, like many others young professionals leaving capital cities down south, sees Darwin as a strategic stepping stone for her career. \n“I do love it here, but I feel like Darwin is a great place for career advancement,” Neha, a policy graduate with the Department of Trade, Business and Innovation said. “I think I’ll stay here for a few years, really enjoy it and see where it takes me from there.” \nYoung professionals are moving to Darwin from right across Australia to take up career opportunities. Photo: Tourism NT. \nIt is this trend that has informed Darwin’s highly transient population and has created a unique community, according to Charles Darwin University senior research fellow Andrew Taylor . \n“That happens a lot and is what we call escalated migration, where people are escalating their careers by doing a stint up in Darwin,” Dr Taylor said. “In might be a year or two years and they can jump a lot of levels when they get back home.” \nIt’s a trend that permeates onto the streets. Look around and you’ll find that trendy cafes and small bars are popping up in the city more frequently, while Darwin’s larger iconic venues still manage to lure in big crowds of young backpackers and professionals. \nNeha Chopra believes that Darwin is a great place for career advancement.

Photo: Tourism NT. \nOf the 142,300 people living in Greater Darwin in June 2015, an estimated 7 per cent (10,044) had only moved to Darwin from other states and territories within the previous year, more than half of whom came from other greater capital city areas, according to ABS data. \nBy comparison, only 0.8 per cent (40,981) of Sydney’s 4,921,000 population in June 2015, were estimated to have migrated from other states and territories in the previous year. \nYoung professionals, such as Dr Robert Tait are lured to Darwin by job opportunities, but also the chance for adventure.

It also has a worker attraction program, which matched workers from Launceston, Wollongong, Adelaide and Melbourne in 2016, with in-demand jobs in the Northern Territory. \nThe Lord Mayor of Darwin, Katrina Fong Lim, said she hoped more young professionals would be tempted to make Darwin their permanent home. \nThe Lord Mayor of the City of Darwin Katrina Fong Lim said the biggest challenge for the city was being able to offer the same level of infrastructure and facilities as other capital cities, while creating a welcoming community. \n“The city doesn’t have a dedicated program, but vision of offering a tropical city that is liveable and offering choice, to attract young people to stay and to have their families here,” she said. \n“ A highly transient population can create a situation where people are not necessarily connected to the community … as we are so young, we focus on making it social community, there are so many festivals and outdoor events, the outdoor lifestyle is attractive to a lot of young professionals and does create the opportunity for them to form connections.” \nAfter completing his helicopter training, Roy Smith decided to leave Sydney behind to pursue work in central Queensland, before moving to Darwin to fly for Airborne Solutions.
