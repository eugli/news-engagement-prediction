She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \n\nHouse Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was quick to use the story as a vehicle to further slam the president for going after the Seattle judge who halted the president’s executive order temporarily banning travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, the Washington Examiner reported .\n“Yes, I think it’s inappropriate, but he’s a totally inappropriate president, so it’s totally in keeping with who he is,” Pelosi said, according to the Examiner. She went on to rip Trump for calling U.S. District Judge James Robart, who ruled against his travel ban, a “so-called judge,” the paper added.\nMost of the retailers dropping Ivanka’s line dismiss the idea that their decision to drop it is related to politics, saying that they evaluate stock periodically and make decisions based on performance. “We continually review our assortment and the performance of the brands we carry. And we make adjustments as part of our normal course of business operations,” a Belk spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.\nHowever, the #GrabYourWallet campaign has been actively calling for a boycott of Ivanka and all other Trump-related merchandise since October 2016. The effort began following the release the of the “Billy Bush tapes” that contained audio of Trump telling a reporter he grabbed women by their genitals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:35:49.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
