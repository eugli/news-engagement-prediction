I have to maintain the defence expenditure and you essentially on areas which are tested and tried and are either success stories or absolute development imperatives. That is why we were talking straight as far as expenditure is concerned. \n\nOn taxation, we had to continue our policy of going hard against black money, enlarging the tax base and at the same time, we saw virtues in giving concession to certain categories of people. The MSMEs are huge job creators. I had to identify a section where tax rate had to be brought down as an incentive. \n\nAs far as the small tax payer is concerned, a) he is burdened by inflation , b) he has been a compliant tax payer and c) by making his rate very reasonable 5%, I incentivised the non-filers to start filing. So this was both an economic necessity as also the right thing to do for the honest taxpayer. \n\nMany would say that middle classes expected more from you and they are also your vote bank. Corporate India expected a bigger sweetner this year because given that the investment cycle has not really taken off, you have concentrated only on the pro-poor and rural incentives. \n\nNobody has done more than I have in the last two and a half years for the middle classes. I first raised the Rs 2 lakh limit to Rs 2.5 lakh. Today, with that Rs 2500 rebate on tax, de facto it has become Rs 3 lakh. In fact, with tax planning, if you are earning Rs 4-4.5 lakh, you virtually end up paying little or no tax. So I have helped that class. \n\nSecond, the advantage of the 10% tax slab becoming 5% is also felt by those earning Rs 5-10 lakh and Rs 10 lakh and above. \n\nThird, your housing interest payments is again a middle class problem. I increased it by Rs 50,000 two years ago. The 80C deductions, I increased straight by Rs 50,000. These are all different ways of helping and putting more money in the pocket of the middle class. You can save tax by saving under 80C, you can save tax even by investing in your children's education. There is a deduction for your medical insurance; you can save tax by buying an apartment. \n\nThe kind of incentives I have given to affordable housing this year, isn't that a middle class gesture? Today, 60 metres means carpet area, a small change which effectively means that a 1000 sq ft two-bedroom apartment now becomes affordable housing. It gets infrastructure status. So you get cheaper loans for these constructions. \n\nLast year, I brought a change that all traders, shopkeepers, workshop owners with a turnover up to Rs 2 crore need not maintain any books of accounts. 8% of their turnover is presumed to be profit. This year, I have said if they pay by cheque or digital payment, this 8% will become 6%. \nFor all professionals, lawyers, doctors earning up to Rs 50 lakh, profits assumed at 50% of sales. Over 98% of the professionals do not maintain books of accounts. They have to file a one page return. I am told last year 84 lakh in this category have availed of this scheme. All these administrative and taxation changes, benefit the middle class. \n\nSo you are saying this was not a conscious decision aimed at sending out any message to a constituency that perhaps your government now is trying to attract more aggressively the marginalised and the poor? \n\nWe are a hugely tax non-compliant society and the rich and the wealthy who buy cars, who travel abroad are not necessarily paying taxes. As far as the poor are concerned, they are entitled to the first benefit. So when you say that I put more money in MNREGA that means I am trying to give some sustenance to the informal sector which has been adversely impacted. It is a carryover scheme of the previous government. I do not mind continuing it and strengthening it. Similarly, if I give farmers a subsidised crop insurance scheme, if I provide for irrigation or for housing in the rural areas, all these will help the poor and the marginalised. \n\nSo you are not being consciously politically savvy you were being pragmatic? \n\nSee there has to be a social cause or a social commitment behind this exercise. If India is moving more towards a market economy it must also have a social consciousness. If you earn more from a liberalised economy, who gets the first right to that expenditure? Needless to say it has to be in villages. \n\nBut many would say that it is the suit boot ki sarkar j ibe that Rahul Gandhi made that has virtually hurt you and that is why you are doing this entire makeover for 2019. \n\nI used a phrase in parliament saying this is soojh boojh ki sarkar. In a liberalised economy you have high growth rate, higher revenues. I have 17% growth in revenue per annum last two years. That means I am earning more. What used to be a Rs 8 lakh crore-10 lakh crore budget, is today Rs 20 lakh crore budget. We are earning more, we are spending more and this has to come to the poor people. The mistake that the UPA made was they did not concentrate on increased productivity through a reform process and through aggressively handling the economy, they just redistributed the existing resources. I do not want to do that. I want to earn more. Only then I can help the poor more. \n\nBut your allocation for MNREGA is at a historic high. Does that mean that the sort of salary benefit scheme that was being talked about is now a nonstarter? \n\nNo, it is not. What the Chief Economic Adviser has laid as an agenda for the future is a brilliant idea. Subsidies are an amount which reach an untargeted sector of people - as I said in parliament, an unquantified amount which reaches an unidentifiable section. When you travel by a train, you get subsidised, you are not entitled to subsidy but you get it. While I buy kerosene in Delhi I get subsidised. When my child goes to a Delhi University college, he gets subsidised. Are the rich and the wealthy entitled to that subsidy? That is the basic question. Last year, Arvind Subramanian had a brilliant chapter in the Economic Survey where he asked shouldn't subsidies for the rich get phased out? It was a thought process for the future that he was suggesting and that is what the Chief Economic Adviser is meant to be. He is an independent adviser, at an arm's length distance from the government. \n\nThis year he has put an idea on the table should all these subsidies being given by the centre and the state not be clubbed together and converted into x percentage of families in India getting a minimum salary every month from the government? Now the amounts will tally, the only difficulty that I see and I have discussed it at length with the Chief Economic Adviser that the Indian Politics has to be ready to substitute the present law of subsidy regime with an alternative I certainly feel the alternative is better but the alternative cannot be in addition.. \n  More From Budget Govt committed to fiscal prudence: Shaktikanta Das Assessees can heave a sigh of relief!
