There are four other members of the Guardians of the Galaxy but you'd never know it if you all you paid attention to was the internet. People love Baby Groot -- and for good reason too! Ever since he first danced away at the end of the first movie people have demanded more Baby Groot and now they're getting their wish. Check out this new poster for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 that features Baby Groot front and center. Check out this awesome Japanese poster for Gaurdians of The Galaxy Vol. 2! Baby Groot! #GotGVol2 pic.twitter.com/cNdJGttNRi â€” Geeks of Color (@GeeksOfColor) February 19, 2017 \nThis new Japanese poster for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was shared via the Geeks of Color Twitter account and stars the one and only Baby Groot. This very fun poster deviates from the usual blockbuster design of the heroes oddly photoshopped together in a nondescript setting as the villain looms overhead in favor of something much more simple and original. It features Baby Groot, standing on top of a pile of dynamite with a match in hand. A big smile is carved onto his cute face as he waves towards the viewer, completely unaware of the danger he's in. It's pretty in line with how Baby Groot treats explosives, if the Vol. 2 trailer is anything to go by. \nThere's still a few months to go before Vol. 2 hits theaters, which means we've got a lot more marketing material on the way, that will more than likely feature the adorable and very marketable Baby Groot. Though it's easy to write of Baby Groot's inclusion in the movie as a means to sell more lunch boxes, director James Gunn revealed that originally, Baby Groot wasn't even going to be in the movie. In the earliest drafts of the script, Groot was fully grown again, but Gunn said that something was still missing and he had trouble finding a place for him. Then he decided to set the sequel a few months after the original, which meant shrinking Groot down. From there the film just clicked, everything fell into place and Baby Groot just popped. \nIn Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2 , Baby Groot will have no memories of his previous life, and he has been described as being very naive and rambunctious. Though he isn't mentally a baby , he's learning a lot of things for the first time. There will be a debate in the sequel on if Baby Groot is still the original Groot or if he's a \"different Groot that's sprung up from the seed of the first Groot.\" \nWe'll be able to see Baby Groot and the rest of the Guardians when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 soars into theaters on May 5, 2017.
