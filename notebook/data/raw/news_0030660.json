We need to see who is capable of bringing change in the country, not just want something but reject what we already have,\" he said during a programme with the Gen Y at the Alor Setar Square, in Alor Setar. \nAlso present was the prime minister's wife and president of the Welfare Association of Wives of Ministers and Deputy Ministers (Bakti) Rosmah Mansor, and Kedah Menteri Besar Ahmad Basha Md Hanipah. The prime minister said the current leadership was committed to leaving behind a country in much better shape than was 'inherited from the previous leadership'. Citing the 'Arab Spring', he said, although the west considered it a major change for the people, the fact was the revolution did not promise anything better for them.\"Today, (the countries) involved in the Arab Spring are in a state of chaos, a huge civil war is still going, and so is political conflict,\" he said. Najib said this showed that a sudden change in regime through a revolution has never brought any good to the people.\"There are countries involved in the Arab Spring now owing hundreds of millions of USD to Petronas, because they can not afford to pay as they have no political stability or strong leadership,\" he said. \nHence, he said the people should continue to place their confidence in the current government for the welfare and betterment of the nation. \nEarlier during the programme, Najib cycled a distance of three kilometres with Gen Y participants, and witnessed several activities lined up including a fashion show, aerobics, as well as taking selfies with the youths. Speaking about the younger generation, or Gen Y, the prime minister said they should be ready to have a paradigm shift in order to be more competitive in the future. In terms of employment, for example, Najib said the group should be ready to work in positions which have yet to exist.\"Research shows 65 per cent of those studying in primary school today will fill jobs that currently do not exist,\" he said. Najib said the country's youths, who were considered 'national assets and precious jewels' should prepare themselves more holistically and comprehensively to be able to adapt to whatever situation they faced in the future. At the function, Najib also announced an approval of RM30 million to build a racetrack in Sungai Petani to the delight of Kedah's youths.\"After this, there is no need to be 'mat rempit' on the roads, you can race on the tracks,\" he said. - Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:44:44.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
