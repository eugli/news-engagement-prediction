As its current strategy in approaching the community does not seem to be working and has failed to inspire confidence in its credibility as an alternative to the present government. \nThis was mooted at a round table discussion where some 50 top opposition and civil society leaders signed the ‘Save Malaysia’ initiative, spearheaded by Lim. \nAnnuar to face Mara auditors \nSuspended Mara chairperson Annuar Musa has been summoned to face the federal agency’s internal audit committee at its meeting to be held today. \nIn an unrelated development, Annuar, who is also Umno information chief, said he decided to run for the presidency of Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) out of concern that no other individuals would do so. \nHe also made his first appearance at United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong) to have a better understanding on Chinese education and the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) yesterday, where he joked that the purpose of his visit was to gain votes from the Chinese community. \nMore Kinibites \nThe Kelantan Forestry Department has denied allegations that it burnt down huts built by the Orang Asli community at blockades set up at the logging route in the Balah Permanent Forest Reserve in an operation at Gua Musang on Monday. \nGraphic artist and activist Fahmi Reza’s clown-faced caricatures of Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak have earned him a freedom of expression award nomination by a UK-based non-profit organisation that campaigns against censorship worldwide. \nThe government’s exposure through 1MDB involved only the paid-up capital, which meant that the BMF scandal in the 1980s during the Mahathir-administration is worse , said Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Keruak. \nLooking ahead \nToday, the Kuala Lumpur High Court will be hearing cartoonist Zunar’s judicial review application, to challenge a travel ban imposed on him by the Immigration Department \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:14:03.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
