For the first month, I only took herbs which reset my appetite. In total, I dropped to 64 kilos, stabilising at 69.\" \nIn 2012, Mr Turnbull said of his weight loss: \"I must say that I found the fast extremely Â­informative because it made me realise I am in control of my own body and can control my appetite. It is a very good insight.\" \nOther devotees reportedly include Channel Seven's The Morning Show host Larry Emdur and Aussie Home Loans boss John Symond. \nThe tribunal heard that Dr Liu saw the patient four times in 11 days at his Norwest Clinic at Bella Vista, in Sydney's north-west, in October 2014. \nFollowing the treatment, the patient experienced rapid weight loss amounting to nine kilograms in 11 days, from a starting weight of 68 kilograms. \nGiving evidence Dr Liu said he does not accept the treatment includes \"fasting\" because although no solid food is given, the herbs he prescribe contain at least 250 calories. \nHe later admitted that \"some people may regard it as fasting, but he does not regard it as fasting\". \nHe admitted he did not ask the patient, who cannot be named for legal reasons, if he or she had diabetes or high blood pressure. \nThe Civil and Administrative Tribunal last week found the HCCC had not proven Dr Liu failed to appropriately consider the patient's co-existing medical conditions. \nBut it found he failed to record a complete case history, and failed to record the decoction of 16 herbs prescribed. \nHe also failed to record the acupuncture points he instructed a staff member to use on the patient. \nAs a result, no other health professional would have been able to ascertain how and when the patient had been treated, and in the case of emergency, would not be able to take over, the tribunal said. \nThe tribunal said the proven complaints \"are so serious as to warrant a finding of professional misconduct\". \nDr Liu was found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct. A further hearing will be held to determine the sanctions or restrictions that will be imposed on his registration as a Chinese medicine practitioner. \nDr Liu declined to comment on the tribunal's decision.
