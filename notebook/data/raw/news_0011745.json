The company has been ordered to delete the data it collected.\nSmart TVs - sets that have additional features such as on-demand viewing or video calling - have raised privacy concerns before. In 2015 it emerged Samsung’s models were transmitting potentially sensitive voice data without users’ knowledge .\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/daveleebbc", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F2C6/production/_94005126_whatsubject.jpg", "https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/vizio-settlement-smart-tvs-should-not-track-your-shows-without-your-ok", "http://facebook.com/daveleebbc"], "published": "2017-02-07T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:45:57.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
