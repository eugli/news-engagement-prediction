The girl with the natural curls and tattoos who does crazy dances to “Single Ladies” unfortunately didn’t make it to the Top 13 of Miss Universe. But I’ll make the top of something else that comes on my path. This was not my destiny, but an experience I can add to my journey!” she wrote. \nAt the rehearsals for the 65th Miss Universe pageant last January 26, as the candidates were all lined up in their evening gowns, Miss Netherlands was seen dancing to Beyonce’s “Single Ladies,” lightening up the atmosphere.

Thanks everyone, keep loving yourself AND SEE YOU AT THE AFTERPARTYYYY” Ivory added. \nAs of writing, her video has garnered 19M views. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/aen.macapagal/videos/vb.1288403998/10211387972516868/?type=2&theater", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:08:32.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
