The comedian said in French: 'Hey look, Diaby has returned to the group. Project Champions guys!' The comedian appeared to regret his throwaway comment immediately after making it Diaby has taken upon himself to respond to Cazarre's insensitive comments on social media The 30-year-old slammed the comedian for showing a 'lack of respect' for disabled people Presenter Nicolas Tourriol then says, 'That's a red card for you,' while one of the guests adds, 'We're going to have the Disabled Syndicate on our case.' Cazarre responds: 'Oh no I didn't want to put that one in! But it's a good thing no one is watching us.' The comments were met with a mixture of laughter, jeers and embarrassed glances from within the studio before the audience felt obliged to applaud the attempted humour. The French midfielder has suffered chronic injury set-backs throughout his playing career Diaby has played five times for Marseille and is currently sidelined having had ankle surgery But former France international Diaby has responded to the remarks by posting on Twitter: 'I rarely answer attacks but [it's] difficult to not comment on cheap, contemptuous and cowardly humour from Cazarre yesterday on @jplusun. 'Beyond the insult to myself, the lack of respect for the disabled revolts me. Cheap, hurtful and such little bravery.' Since February 2008, Diaby has been injured for 1,734 days - a total of four years and eight months - due to a mixture of thigh, calf and ankle problems while he was missing for over a year alone after tearing anterior cruciate ligaments in his left knee in March 2013.
