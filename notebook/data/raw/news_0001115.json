The dollar turned weak globally, which supported the rupee up move. But this was offset by fresh losses in domestic equities, dealers said. Yesterday, the local currency ended at 1-1/2 month high of 67.47 by rising 40 paise, its biggest single-day gain this year, on the back of frantic dollar offloading amid expectations of a Fed rate hike delay. In the meantime, the benchmark Sensex traded lower by 50.61 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 28,091.03 in early session.
