By EVE EDELHEIT FEB. 12, 2017 DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Twenty-four hours. One thousand four hundred forty minutes. Eighty-six thousand four hundred seconds. People do not typically think about a full day in seconds, but for drivers in the Rolex 24 at Daytona, every one of those seconds counts. At the Rolex 24, the only daylong professional auto race in North America, 55 teams in four classes — GT Daytona, GT Le Mans, Prototype Challenge and Prototype — compete all at once on 3.56 miles of track at Daytona International Speedway. The race started this year at 2:30 p.m. on Jan. 28 and ended at 659 laps — or 2,346.04 miles — for the new overall champion. Sleep deprivation was unavoidable — and was compounded by overnight rain and temperatures that plunged to 43 degrees.   Each team can rotate through up to five drivers, and no driver can race more than 13 hours over all or more than four hours in a six-hour period. Between shifts, the drivers can retire to luxuriously appointed recreational vehicles for naps. \nAdvertisement   The most ardent fans arrived long before the race, setting up campsites and celebrating stamina and excess. A sign at one site read, “Happy Hour 2:30-2:30.” Ten friends from Fleming Island, Fla., have come to the race together for nine years. They had gathered for poker in a communal tent by about 11 p.m. “The race is nice, but I come to be with these guys,” said one of the men, Bob Jeney. “It’s about the experience; to be able to come for two and a half days and be together is really nice.” Getting Moving At the drivers’ meeting, about four hours before the start of the event, Seb Morris of Action Express Racing laughed with his teammates as he took selfies to post on Snapchat. The room went quiet as a chaplain asked everyone to pray for a safe race. Near the start time, spectators were still filing into the stadium. Many fans watched from the infield, where campsites had sold out in September, and some climbed onto the roofs of their R.V.s for a better view.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:34:44.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
