So it's a double-edged sword\". \n\nThere has been no shortage of examples in recent years. \n\nIn addition to Xiao Jianhua who is believed to be close to Xi's family, a real estate kingpin, Guo Wengui, who had strong political connections, has fled abroad. \n\nSeveral of his supporters who were at the top of the state hierarchy have since fallen in the anti-corruption purge. \n\nThe billionaire Xu Ming, who is close to former top-ranking leader Bo Xilai (a political rival of Xi), died in prison at the end of 2015. \n\nOthers, who had disappeared, resurfaced after claiming to have \"cooperated with investigations\". \n\n\"In China, a joke says that if your name appears in the list of the 100 richest people in the country, then you should be careful because many of these people have been arrested for tax evasion or economic crimes\", said Willy Lam. \n\nThe former leader Deng Xiaoping was attributed with the phrase: \"To get rich is glorious\"; but Lam pointed out another aspect of wealth: \"It is dangerous to be rich in China, certainly.\" \n\nWhile the anti-graft campaign has had few macroeconomic consequences, it nevertheless generates a cautious outlook among the business community, said Klaus Baader, senior economist for Asia at Societe Generale. \n\n\"When you have major anti-corruption drives, what often happens, is that it makes decision makers very reluctant... to take decisions,\" he added. \n\n\"Because they are concerned that any decision could potentially be linked back to some bribery or some degree of corruption of one sort or the another.\" \n\nEspecially in China, economics, politics and the judiciary \"are all linked,\" said Willy Lam. \"If you are arrested by the police, there is no guarantee that you will receive a fair judgement.\" \n\nAs a result, many tycoons domiciled themselves in Hong Kong, reassured by the judicial independence enjoyed by the former British colony. \n\nBut it is not clear how much longer they can shelter there. \n\n\"Until what happened to Xiao Jianhua... many of these top business people thought that Hong Kong was safe, but no longer so,\" said Lam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:36:49.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
