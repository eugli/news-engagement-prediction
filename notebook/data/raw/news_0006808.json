He struggles to find a vein in his left hand, then suddenly cries out in pain. Another nurse jumps in to help him.\n\"I hit a nerve. It was an electrical shock through my whole body,\" he later said. \"I've never experienced anything like that.\"\nSchnell tries a vein in his other hand, then decides to inject the drug into his right shoulder.\nCrosstown Clinic patient Mark Schnell injects his medicated dose of hydromorphone, a heroin replacement, into his shoulder. (Rafferty Baker/CBC)\nFor nearly three decades, Schnell has used hard drugs. For most of that time he was into crack cocaine and crystal meth, but by the time he got into the program at Crosstown about four years ago, he was also dependent on heroin.\n\"Being in this program, the first thing I did ... I quit cocaine after 28 years,\" he said.\nSchnell is one of about 130 participants in the program. About 100 patients are prescribed heroin, the rest receive hydromorphone.\nPatient Mark Schnell gets his dose of hydromorphone from a booth before injecting it at Crosstown in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. (Rafferty Baker/CBC)\nPrescription heroin has been pointed to as a potential fix for the fentanyl overdose crisis that has been ravaging the Downtown Eastside, and affecting people across the province. The drug epidemic killed 914 people in British Columbia in 2016 , according to officials.\nCrosstown lead doctor Scott MacDonald argues its success should be leading to expansion .\nInjectable opioids a homegrown solution to fix the fentanyl crisis But the idea of giving addicts free drugs to inject into their veins is one that gives some people pause, and policy makers have not been quick to adopt injectable therapy as a solution to the overdose crisis.\nThe federal government overturned a ban on prescription heroin in September, but in a recent interview with CBC, federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said provinces, including B.C., \"have not used that opportunity to provide treatment to the people that need it.\"\nB.C. Health Minister Terry Lake told CBC's The Early Edition , \"We don't have physicians that are capable at this point in time in numbers large enough to administer injectable, pharmaceutical grade heroin and finding those particular people that would be helped by that is not simple.\"\nPrescription heroin user Les Kaczorowski, 48, says being in the injectable therapy program has completely changed his life. He used to run into constant trouble with the law, selling drugs to maintain his habit. (Rafferty Baker/CBC)\nMacDonald, said there are another 350 people who have already been screened and would benefit from the treatment.\nHe also said the pharmacist on site could easily accommodate more patients, and clinics could be quickly set up elsewhere; all that would be needed is a room and funding for a nurse.\nFor Schnell and the others in the program, the urgency of the opioid overdose crisis couldn't be any more obvious.\n\"I feel guilty. I feel guilty that I have this and I don't have to worry,\" he said.\n\"I have one less friend now than I had two weeks ago,\" said Schnell. \"If he had been in this program, he would be alive today, as I am.\"\nThe Fentanyl Fix is a week long series exploring potential solutions to B.C.'s opioid overdose crisis.\nFollow Rafferty Baker on Twitter: @raffertybaker", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/raffertybaker"], "published": "2017-01-31T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:31:43.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
