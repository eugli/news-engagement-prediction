It’s Friday, which means it’s time to test your knowledge on the week’s news events. Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science. \nQuestions are multiple-choice, and time is of the essence: You have 50 seconds to answer, and as the seconds tick away, the question’s point value drops from 50 all the way down to zero, so you’ll want to click on your answer as fast as you possibly can. There’s no penalty for an incorrect answer, so feel free to take a guess. \nAt the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatesterwho has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is Slate senior editor Jeremy Stahl. \nCan you ace the quiz and beat Stahl? Good luck! \nRay Hamel hosts the Slate News Quiz. His crosswords have appeared in the New York Times , Los Angeles Times , and Games magazine, and he is the author of The New York Times Trivia Quiz Book . \n‘,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:29:44.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
