There are no more cars than usual, I just don’t understand their reasoning, there is no issue. \n“What are we paying our council tax for? First they make the bins smaller, then this. And they didn’t even bother to consult us on it. \n“People don’t want to be dragging their bins to the main road every time.” \nThe council’s executive member for neighbourhoods Nigel Murphy said: “We always endeavour to collect bins from as close to people’s properties as possible. In this case, a combination of the narrowness of these short cul-de-sacs and an increased number of parked cars means we can no longer safely reverse a bin lorry out of them without potential damage to residents’ vehicles or property or even the risk of danger to residents themselves. \n“While we recognise this is not ideal, we feel that asking residents to take their bins to the end of the street is the only viable option. If anybody will struggle physically to push their bins down these streets they can contact us to arrange an assisted collection.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:15:41.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
