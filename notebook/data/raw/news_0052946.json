[Photo: Kipsang Joseph/Standard] \nIndependence party Kanu has officially declared that it will support the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. \nThe party’s National Executive Council announced its backing for the President Thursday, following a day-long meeting at Lake Nakuru Lodge in Nakuru. \nThe frosty relations between Deputy President William Ruto and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi almost cost Uhuru the party’s support. \nKanu Secretary General Nick Salat has been a conspicuous figure at Opposition meetings, sparking fears the party was set to join the Opposition coalition. \nAccording to sources at the meeting, members were categorical that they were supporting Uhuru but not Ruto whom they accused of openly disregarding the party and carrying a vendetta against former President Daniel arap Moi. \nMr Salat, who read out the resolution, said the party’s top organ took the position after intense deliberations. \nALSO READ: Kanu to support Ford Kenya candidates for governorship in two counties \n“The deliberations were intense and at the end of the day, the majority carried the day,” said Salat. \nThe decision by the NEC deals a blow to the National Super Alliance (NASA), which has been courting the independence party. \nSalat said he put up a case for NEC to support NASA but the majority decision won. \n“I brought my case for the members to consider NASA but as you know we are democratic organ and the majority were for Uhuru’s re-election. That is democracy,” he said, adding that the party would however field candidates for all other elective posts. \nKanu chairman Gideon said he had consulted party members widely before Thursday’s NEC meeting. \n“I have been consulting Kanu members on what direction we should take and today the NEC deliberated on the matter and settled on the decision to support the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta,” he said. \nHowever, inside sources said the debate was between more than 20 members, some of whom pitched for the party’s support for Uhuru’s re-election as others rooted for NASA. \nALSO READ: Kanu to support Ford Kenya candidates \nThe source said those opposing support for Uhuru in the coming elections had issues with the DP, who is seen as a stumbling block to Kanu’s advancement and open hate for the party chairman. \nRuto, the source said, was seen by most members as willing to do anything to destroy Kanu, its leaders and supporters, especially in the Rift Valley, in an effort to be seen as having command and being the only spokesperson for the Kalenjin community. \n“Nobody had issues with the President,” said another NEC member. \nApart from insults directed at Gideon, Ruto recently asked Betting Control and Licensing Board Director Simon Chelugui to run against him for the Senate seat, which is seen as a direct affront to the son of the former president. \nOn NASA support, although some members, including Salat, put up a very strong case, it was knocked out because of the many principals angling for the same position. \n“Members were of the opinion that supporting NASA was a long route to the presidency for Gideon, who members agree must make a stab at the presidency in 2022,” said a source. \n“In the end, although Ruto was a big issue for members, NEC decided the discussions will be between Gideon and Uhuru, and not the DP, who is not party to the deal,” added another member privy to the discussions. \nALSO READ: Blow to Jubilee as leaders decamp to Kanu \nThe source said Kanu’s loyalty would be to the President, not Ruto. \nThe source also said although members were not told specifically what Kanu was going to get for supporting Uhuru, Gideon assured them that the party was going to reap big. \nThe decision by NEC comes after a series of meeting between former First Lady Mama Ngina and former President Daniel arap Moi at his Kabarak home, which was immediately followed by Uhuru’s visit to Kabarnet Gardens last week. \nAmong those who attended Thursday’s NEC meeting were senators John Lonyangapuo, Zipporah Kittony and Paul Njoroge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:12:11.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
