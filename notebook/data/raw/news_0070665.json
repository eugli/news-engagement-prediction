She just goes out and does the dirty work - the stuff that's not on paper.\"\nO'Hara advanced to play Archbishop Wood, a 52-37 winner over Archbishop Carroll in the other semifinal. The Lions and Vikings will square off for the title Monday at the Palestra.\nOn paper, O'Hara (19-5) was consistently great, getting terrific efforts from up and down the roster on both ends of the floor. The result is the first trip to the league title game for the senior class, as well as the first time the squad has beaten the Saints (18-5).\n\"Pretty indescribable,\" Sheehan said. \"We had the mentality that we were going to do it. We are just really excited to get that second chance, especially after how the regular season went. I'm ecstatic, I'm shaking.\"\nWith 54 seconds remaining, coach Linus McGinty subbed out his starters, something Gardler wasn't expecting.\n\"I had my head turned and everyone starting cheering - but that's when I knew we made it to the Palestra,\" said the Villanova recruit, who led all players with 19 points.\nSheehan had that same realization.\n\"Let's do this\" the St. Joseph's recruit said to her teammates as they walked off the court together.\n\"We are going to the Palestra,\" Sheehan added. \"Thirty-two more minutes.\"\nWood 52, Carroll 37 - Point guard Cassie Sebold scored a team-high 16 points as the Vikings (18-60 punched their ticket to the Catholic League final.\nWood held off a scrappy Patriots team (17-7) that stayed in the contest until late in the fourth quarter. Powered by Sebold, the Vikings got strong efforts from Shannon and Katie May, who took turns igniting the offense.\n\"For me, I see the scoreboard but it isn't in my head,\" Sebold said. \"It's about running the offense, getting open shots.\nCardinal O'Hara 11 19 13 14 - 57\nNeumann-Goretti 8 10 13 11 - 42\nCO: Kenzie Gardler 19, Maura Hendrixson 15, Mary Sheehan 10, Hannah Nihill 9, Molly Paolino 4.\nNG: Chyna Nixon 12, Jabria Ingram 11, Tatiana Jones 7, Ashley Jones 6, Minika Glenn 6.\nArchbishop Carroll 9 11 10 7 - 37\nArchbishop Wood 9 14 12 17 - 52\nCO: AC: Bella Sorrentino 9, Theresa Kearney 8, Molly Masciantonio 7, Erin Sweeney 6, Maggie Pina 5, Wynter Bess 2\nAW: Cassie Sebold 16, Katie May 12, Shannon May 11, Meg Neher 7, Bridget Arcidiacono 6\nkharman@phillynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:36:59.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
