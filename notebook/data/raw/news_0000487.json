Their hypocrisy turns my stomach. For the truth is that their anger over the new President’s ban is outrageously two-faced. Let me spell out the facts. Many European politicians treat migrants — and, in particular, Muslims — more disgracefully than they are being dealt with by Trump. For example, Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, wants to build a ‘massive’ fence to stop refugees crossing into his country from the East. He calls migrants ‘a poison’ that Hungary ‘won’t swallow’. Why hasn’t he been subjected to the kind of chorus of opprobrium from those European liberals who greeted Trump’s move to tighten America’s borders? Why have fellow EU leaders not shunned Orban as a racist and a xenophobe? Instead, he is seen as a valued colleague and friend. His Fidesz party is in the same political grouping in the European Parliament as Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats. They work together at European summits, planning a common strategy. Yet this man is much more bigoted than Trump. But do we ever hear talk of banning Orban from travelling to Brussels? Was there a whisper of dissent when he visited London in November to see Theresa May? Does Nick Clegg make strident Commons speeches about the pernicious Hungarian? Of course not. The objectionable Orban is not alone. The Prime Minister of neighbouring Slovakia, Robert Fico, said last year that Islam had ‘no place’ in his country. He speaks of the need to ‘monitor every Muslim’ and won’t let a single Muslim refugee enter his country. With other chilling views — such as describing journalists as ‘dirty, anti-Slovak prostitutes’ — he almost makes Trump sound like an Islington Leftie. Again, where are the denunciations of this man (who has the gall to call himself a Social Democrat) from Mrs Merkel, Labour’s Yvette Cooper, who this week urged the Government to have the ‘guts to speak out’ over Trump’s immigration ban, the liberal Left or the Guardian newspaper? I have searched hard and I can’t find evidence that European leaders have ever criticised Prime Minister Fico, whose country took its turn last year to assume the EU Presidency. As for Jeremy Corbyn, despite saying he is ‘not concerned about numbers’ of migrants, he (along with his fellow Socialist, President Francois Hollande of France) is a member of the same European political group as the virulently anti-immigration Slovakian prime minister. Incidentally, Hollande’s criticism of Trump has been ferocious, while Corbyn has joined the clamour for Trump’s State visit to Britain to be cancelled. Yesterday, I scoured the internet for any condemnation by either Hollande or Corbyn of their bigoted fellow European Socialist party leader. I couldn’t find even a veiled criticism of an inflammatory man who has vowed to stop Muslims ‘destroying the cultural identity of Europe’. It is very plain that a double standard is operating. Whereas bigotry from European leaders is tolerated, Trump is demonised for fulfilling his campaign promises. True, like many, I worry deeply that Trump may make the world a much less tolerant place. But the intolerance which motivates him is at work in the European Union. And not just on the fringes. The truth is that it has contaminated countries which have had proud histories of liberalism. For example, it seems that the anti-Islam Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders — an overt and dangerous racist — will win most seats in the election in Holland next month. Although unlikely to take power, his party will become king-maker. And in April, Marine Le Pen, leader of the ferociously anti-migrant Front National and whose father was convicted over racial hatred, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, has an increasingly strong chance of becoming president of France. True, like many, I worry deeply that Trump may make the world a much less tolerant place. But the intolerance which motivates him is at work in the European Union This widespread and odious hostility to migrants in mainland Europe is one of the main reasons (along with the EU’s economic failure) why I voted Leave in last year’s referendum. That decision has been vindicated by the shameless double standards of many European leaders. They endeavour to make themselves look good by expressing anger about Trump. But they are hypocrites. Meanwhile, there’s been a great deal of idle talk in some sections of the British media about the rise of fascism in the U.S. That may be a genuine worry. But the truth is that the rise of fascism is a far bigger threat across today’s continental Europe than in America — in large part because, sadly, it is in the DNA of so many European countries. A nasty revenge against Ukip Several salacious stories have emerged about alleged expenses fiddling by Ukip members of the European Parliament. I’m suspicious of the motives behind these claims, considering it’s well-known that numerous MEPs fiddle their expenses. Indeed, Frank Antoine-Poirel, head of the EU’s hopeless Parliamentary Assistance and Members’ General Expenditure Unit, admitted as much last year when he conceded that MEPs can claim £120,000 a year in expenses without providing ‘real proof’ of how the money is spent. Shockingly, Mr Antoine-Poirel presides over an enormous taxpayer-funded slush fund which is wide open to abuse. So why the sudden focus on Ukip MEPs? There’s something fishy going on. It looks as if the Brussels establishment, which loathes Ukip, is on a revenge mission. Security headache for the Queen Royal sources have expressed concerns to me that Donald Trump’s proposed State visit to Britain will cause serious security problems. ‘We are trying to avoid him appearing in public places,’ I’m told. ‘This means he’ll be restricted to castles — and other places — with big walls.’ Certainly, Trump will visit Edinburgh Castle and Windsor. Even Arundel Castle, in a West Sussex market town with a population of just 3,000, is under consideration. But in a major break with tradition, the President, I gather, will not be making a speech to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall.
