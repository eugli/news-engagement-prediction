ROBERT'S SECRETS FOR LIVING TO 105 1. Mediterranean diet The diet combines the eating habits of countries that border the Mediterranean Sea - mainly Spain, France, Italy and Greece. It is marketed as an eating pattern rather than a structured diet. Marchand's diet mainly consists of yogurt, soup, cheese, chicken and a glass of red wine at dinner. 2. Increase in VO2 max VO2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake, is one factor that can determine an athlete's capacity to perform sustained exercise and is linked to aerobic endurance. A study, conducted at the University of Evry-Val d'Essonne in France, found that if older athletes exercised intensely, they could increase their VO2 max. Over the course of two years, Marchand increased his VO2 max by 13 percent. 3. Active social life Dr Veronique Billat, who headed the study, has said that Marchand is 'very optimistic' and 'sociable' and has many friends. A 2005 study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die than those with fewer friends. And a 2007 study revealed that chronic loneliness can cause disease at the cellular level. But Dr Veronique Billat, a professor of exercise science at the University of Evry-Val d'Essonne in France, found that if older athletes exercised intensely, they could increase their VO2 max. Lifestyle may also play a factor. Dr Billat told The New York Times that Marchand is 'very optimistic' and 'sociable' and has many friends. A 2005 study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die than those with fewer friends. And a 2007 study revealed that chronic loneliness can actually cause disease at the cellular level. His diet is also a simple one: mainly yogurt, soup, cheese, chicken and a glass of red wine at dinner. These are characteristics of the Mediterranean diet - an eating plan based on the countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. One 10-year study of Greeks found that those who followed the diet were 47 percent less likely to develop heart disease. Back in 2012, Dr Billat and her team tested Marchand's VO2 max, heart rate and other aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness. All were healthy and well above average for someone of his age. After Marchand set his first world record, Dr Billat had him begin a new training regiment with 80 percent of his weekly workouts performed at an easy intensity and the other 20 percent at a difficult intensity. The Frenchman followed this program for two years and, at the end, the doctors retested the same physiological markers they had tested at he beginning. The cyclist's VO2 max was now about 13 percent higher than it had been before and comparable to the aerobic capacity of a healthy, average 50-year-old. Marchand has also been able to increase his pedaling power by 14 percent. At age 102, he pedaled for almost 17 miles - almost three miles more than had been covered in 2012. Marchand celebrates his 103rd birthday in France in November 2014. That January he set a world record for over-100s, cycling for almost 17 miles in one hour However, there could be other factors at play in his ability to live past 100. A study from September 2016 found that some people are destined to age quicker and die younger than others - regardless of their lifestyle - due to an 'internal genetic clock'. But Marchand shows no signs of slowing down. He is hoping to try to break his record again next year, when he's 106.
