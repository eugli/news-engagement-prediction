In another, Zhang threatened to cut off Sun's fingers if the family didn't comply.\nSun's parents ultimately transferred about $340,000 into a bank account of his captors' choosing.\nThe court heard Zhang came downstairs late that night and saw Sun face-down on the ground being Tasered by his accomplices. The men later determined Sun was dead, which an autopsy blamed on strangulation from a zap strap that had been tied around his neck.\n\"When he was killed Mr. Sun's hands and feet were bound and his head and face nearly entirely covered in duct tape,\" according to an agreed statement of facts in Zhang's trial.\nThe documents state Zhang didn't anticipate Sun's killing, nor did he take part, but he still shoulders some of the blame for what happened.\n\"He did deliver Mr. Sun up to his eventual killer(s) and was present in the house at the time of the murder,\" they read.\nHe also made further ransom calls to Sun's parents after the victim was already dead.\nTwo days after the abduction, Zhang and three other men were arrested trying to get rid of Sun's body, which was wrapped in a tarp and left in the trunk of a Bentley parked on a quiet residential street.\nAnother of the accused, Casey James Hiscoe, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to unlawfully confine and accessory after the fact to murder earlier this month. He has yet to be sentenced.\nWith files   David Molko   \nRelated Stories Two guilty pleas in 2015 abduction, killing in North Vancouver", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:03:20.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
