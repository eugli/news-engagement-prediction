This was a promise we all depended on,\" said organizer Mary Robinson, who is a member of the Winnipeg chapter of the Council of Canadians.\n\"It's one of the most important things because it will change everything else. If we can finally have our voices heard by being represented, that changes how things happen.\"\nOrganizer Mary Robinson says going back on the electoral reform promise was one step too far.
