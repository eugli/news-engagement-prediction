They started the second leg as they had ended the first, putting Barca under intense pressure. \nAfter a few forays into the hosts' area came to nothing, Carrasco cut inside and crashed a shot down Jasper Cillessen's throat which the Dutchman punched clear, while the goalkeeper later held a stinging header from Diego Godin. \nBarca struggled to maintain possession and a Suarez shot into the side netting had been their only dangerous moment until Messi skipped clear on the break. \nHe held off four players and fired at Miguel Angel Moya, with Suarez pouncing on the rebound after the goalkeeper could only parry the shot. \nAtletico looked beaten at the start of the second half but showed grit and determination to get back into the game, even after Griezmann had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside and Carrasco was sent off. \n\"Barca were only better than us in goals scored, although that's what counts the most in football,\" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told reporters. \n\"I leave here with a sensation of pride. We played the tie with passion which is what you should always do.\" \n\n\nBarca defender Sergi Roberto will also be suspended for the final after being sent off for a second booking in the second half and Atletico winger Yannick Carrasco was dismissed as well for a second yellow card.\nSuarez was then sent off in the 90th minute for an elbow on Atletico defender Luis Hernandez. Atletico had five minutes of stoppage time to snatch a winner and force extra time, but Barca withstood the pressure.\nBarca, the 28-time winners, will meet either Alaves or Celta Vigo in the final in May, seeking a third successive Cup triumph under coach Luis Enrique.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:34:04.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
