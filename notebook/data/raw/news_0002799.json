We recommend courses be conducted in upper primary or lower secondary school to inculcate among both pubescent boys and girls to be alert for signs of sexual grooming. \nRight to safety and protection \nAcknowledging that the government had tabled amendments to the Child Act 2001 to include a sex offenders registry of which Wanita MCA had been pushing for, and of which the Dewan Rakyat has passed, it is thus time to implement the sex offenders registry to safeguard would-be victims in the vicinity. The right to safety of the general public, especially minor children, takes precedence over the solitary perpetrator’s right to privacy. \nNevertheless, society, too, must not resort to vigilantism once they discover a sex offender in their midst. \nConsidering that the retired Canadian police officer who nabbed Subbiah had warned and affirmed that the latter still poses a threat upon his return to Malaysia or anywhere else in the world and given his affluent family background ( Free Malaysia Today , Feb 3, 2017), this suggests Subbiah has not repented. \nWanita MCA is gravely concerned that Subbiah may end up as another Richard Huckle roaming and lurking on our streets in search of fresh underage prey, in particular, among the illiterate and destitute, and may use his wealth to cajole his way out of liability, especially, since to the penniless, especially urban poor, staving off hunger is a priority. \nReports lodged with the police are the only known reported cases. Many sex abuse victims including and especially males and incest victims encounter trepidation to file police reports, due to fear or stigmatisation, communal and familial ostracisation, or are bullied by their aggressors to not to, reprisals like deportation, foreign wife visa terminated, etc. \nHENG SEAI KIE is Wanita MCA chairperson and adviser on National Unity & Integration in the Prime Minister’s Department. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:20:08.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
