I didn’t know how to reach him.” \nFang then found his way through a gap in the skirting board and burrowed under the house through a hole where the fresh water supply leads into the kitchen. \nMr Sykes called on his father-in-law to help with his power drill so they could gain access behind the cupboards.

I knew he had to be there and I began shining by phone and tapping the pipe. \n“Then I saw his head pop up and he was at the bottom scurrying around. \n“I was really excited he was alive because I hadn’t seen him for two days. My son had been tipping food down the hole so he didn’t starve.” Read More Ex-boyfriend flushed hamster down the toilet in revenge after owner left him Mischievous Fang is now safely back in the hands of his family (Photo: Oldham Evening Chronicle) \nA rescue mission ensued as the family cut off the top of Fang’s cage to form a ladder. \nWhen that failed they tied some old tea towels together to form a rope. \n“We had to be as creative as possible,\" said Mr Sykes. \nThe family contacted United Utilities and the RSPCA to ask for advice but to no avail. \nNext they phoned emergency drainage company Dyno who put a camera down the 1.2-metre drop but after 20 minutes they still could not free Fang. \nOn day three, in a last-ditch effort, Mr Sykes came up with the idea of crafting a piece of chicken wire into the shape of a ladder. \nHe said: “I don’t know how but that eventually worked and as he came out I grabbed him and actually told him he was beautiful. \n“My children were so happy they were jumping up and down.” \nFang has been returned to the safety of his cage, although a temporary roof has been installed while the family buy him a new one.
