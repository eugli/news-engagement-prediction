We are also demanding that one of their hands be cut off so that when we see them, we will know that they are people that have stolen our money. \nAlso speaking, President of TUC, Mr Bobboi Kaigama, said efforts must be made to end corruption in the country as well as promote good governance. \nOn his part, Vice President of IndustriAll Global Union and General Secretary of National Union of Textiles, Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria, Issa Aremu, said before the increment of petroleum pump prices, organised labour had predicted what would be the outcome of the government policy, adding that the predictions had come to fruition. \nSaraki reacts Ag.

When next we meet, I will tell you what the National Assembly has done to improve the living condition of Nigerians.” \nProtesters stopped from entering Villa \nBut the protesters were stopped by security operatives from gaining access to the Presidential Villa to deliver their protest message to Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. \nThe workers were stopped at the Federal Secretariat by heavily armed security operatives at about 11.05 am and were asked to send a delegation to take their message to the Presidential Villa. \nInitially, the workers rejected the request, insisting the Acting President either sends a representative to receive their message or be allowed to gain access to the villa to deliver the message. \nThey, however, nominated 20 representatives from among them to take their message to the Acting President while the rest waited for their leaders as music of legendary Fela Anikulakpo Kuti, late Bob Marley among others, rent the air. \nFalana urges NLC to monitor bail-out funds \nIn Lagos, the protesters, who displayed several placards to convey their grievances, marched from Yaba to Ikorodu Road, Mobolaji Bank Anthony and Obafemi Awolowo Way, enroute Alausa, the seat of Lagos State Government, chanting solidarity songs. \nSome of the placards read: “President Buhari let there be light; End jumbo salary for all political office holders; Prosecute all indicted persons; Jail all looters, no sacred cows; President Buhari take time to review power sector reform; End unpaid salary regime; Pay N56,000 minimum wage; Buy made-in-Nigeria goods and Patronize local fabrics, garments.” \nThe Lagos protest was led by Vice President of the NLC, Mr. Amaechi Asugwani, alongside ace musician, Charles Oputa, alias Charly Boy. \nAt Alausa, Lagos lawyer, Femi Falana, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, joined the protesters and halted normal business activities when they stormed Lagos State House for hours. \nAddressing the protesters amidst solidarity songs, Falana said Nigerians had been suffering, with no hope that the suffering was ending soon. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:41:42.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
