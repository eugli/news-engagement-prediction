Credit Chris Jackson/Getty Images Disney -owned Maker Studios said on Monday night that it had cut ties with one of YouTube ’s most popular stars after a report that he had posted multiple videos featuring anti-Semitic imagery. The announcement came after The Wall Street Journal reported that the star, Felix Kjellberg, a Swede better known by his YouTube alias PewDiePie, had posted nine such videos since August. “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,’’ a spokeswoman said in a statement. “Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.” With 53 million subscribers, Mr. Kjellberg has amassed one of the largest audiences on YouTube by posting clips of himself playing and talking about video games accompanied by humorous commentary. According to Social Blade , which compiles data on social media, PewDiePie is the most popular user on YouTube. His videos have attracted nearly 14.7 billion views. In December, Forbes magazine estimated that Mr. Kjellberg had earned $15 million in the year that ended last June, thanks largely to his book, “This Book Loves You,” and his series on YouTube Red, Google’s paid subscription service, which offers ad-free viewing among other benefits.
