About the Movie Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winner of five, including the top categories of Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. Randle Patrick McMurphy (multi-Oscar winner Jack Nicholson -- \"Something's Gotta Give,\" \"As Good As It Gets\") is a free-spirited, small-time convict who fakes being crazy so he can get transferred from the state penitentiary to what he thinks will be a more comfortable state mental hospital. But his contagious sense of delightful chaos clashes with the numbing routine of the hospital and the woman in charge of making sure nothing disrupts the sedate mood of the floor, Nurse Ratched (Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher -- \"Cruel Intentions,\" \"2 Days in the Valley\"). Based on Ken Kesey's acclaimed bestseller. The superb cast also includes Emmy-winner Danny DeVito (\"Big Fish,\" \"L.A. Confidential\"), Emmy-winner Christopher Lloyd (the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\") and Brad Dourif (the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, \"Murder in the First\").
