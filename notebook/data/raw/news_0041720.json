A few fans landed up on the sets to meet the actor, and SRK happily posed for selfies with them. Anushka Sharma who plays the female lead in the movie was not there on sets, which means SRK was shooting for a solo scene. The film has been shot at some of the best location in the world. Prague, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Budapest were some of the shooting locations. Well, SRK is rumoured to be playing a tour guide in the movie, while Anushka Sharma plays a free spirited girl from Gujrat. The movie is slated to release on August 11. \nThe Imtiaz Ali directorial has been rumoured to be titled Rehnuma, though no official announcement has been made. Initially, the movie was called Production No. 52 or, The Ring, but those were always said to be the working title. Makers are doing their best to milk the anticipation surrounding the title of this one. When the first poster of the film was released, sans the title, Alia Bhatt, Salman Khan along with Anushka and SRK got into a funny banter regarding the same. That was some heavy duty promotional tactic, right there. It got fans even more curious about the title. While many fan clubs are still tagging the film as The Ring, others have started calling it Rehnuma. Let us see which team wins – Team The Ring or Team Rehnuma, when the official announcement is made. We also know that there will be a semi-comic kidnapping sequence in the movie, as revealed by SRK in an interview. But that is about all we know about the project so far. \nImtiaz Ali’s last release was Tamasha which starred Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor in lead roles. This will be first time Anushka and SRK will collaborate with the filmmaker. The two actors have previously worked in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:42:45.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
