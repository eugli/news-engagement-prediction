The TAC sought an injunction and court action followed. Photo: A trailer-load of rubbish is taken away from the Tarkine area.

(Supplied: The Wilderness Society) Court process ongoing \nIn March last year, the Federal Court sided with the TAC, which had argued allowing vehicles into the area would damage places of Indigenous significance, including middens. \nLast year, the full bench of the Federal Court said the State Government could appeal the decision. It asked the parties to try to agree on a way forward, giving them options to send the case back to court or refer the plan to reopen the tracks to the Federal Government. \nUnder the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, any action that will have a significant impact on heritage values must be referred to Mr Frydenberg for assessment. \nA spokesman for Mr Frydenberg said no referral had been submitted.
