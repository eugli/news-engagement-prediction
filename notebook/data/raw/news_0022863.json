That detail called to mind another costume worn by Gaga during her 2010 Grammy's performance, which included two pink triangles going from her eyebrows to her cheeks, fashion writer Landon Peoples noted on Refinery29 Monday.\nThe pink triangle has been used as a symbol of LGBT pride, but it has far darker origins and was first used on gay inmates inside Nazi concentration camps. The LGBT community reclaimed the symbol in the 1970s.\nScroll down for video\nHidden message? A fashion fan noticed the triangular shapes Lady Gaga wore around her eyes during her Super Bowl show - and believes they were a nod to the LGBT community\nDeja vu? Lady Gaga wore two pink triangles around her eyes during her performance at the 2010 Grammy's (left). The pink triangle started as a sign of oppression and has since been used as a symbol of LGBT pride. Gaga's make-up on Sunday night (right) was somewhat similar\nGaga included two pink triangles in her 2010 Grammy's costume - presumably as a sign of support for gay rights, for which she has been a strong advocate.\nThat year's show culminated with her singing Speechless and Your Song during a duet with Elton John, who wore sparkly glasses and a single dangling earring.\nGaga also showcased a pink triangle at the beginning of the video for Born This Way, the LGBT anthem she debuted later in 2010 at the MTV Video Music Awards.\nPeoples found the resemblance between Gaga's 2010 costume and her Super Bowl make-up to be striking, and took it as a nod to gay rights.\nThe shapes she wore Sunday night aren't exact triangles, but they spread from her eyebrows to her cheekbones, not unlike her Grammy's make-up. In both instances, the triangles were made out of glitter.\nThat wasn't the only detail Peoples noticed. Gaga's dancers at Houston's NRG Stadium wore costumes with touches of purple, a color often associated with LGBT pride.\nThe Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation chose it as the color to wear during Spirit Day, during which people campaign against bullying of LGBT youth.\nPurple rain: Gaga's dancers at Houston's NRG Stadium wore costumes with touches of purple, a color often worn during LGBT pride events\nGaga, who sang Born This Way as part of her Super Bowl show, said before Sunday's game that her concert would support values such as inclusion and compassion.\n'The only statements that'll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I have been consistently making throughout my career,' the singer said. 'I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country. It's one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will uphold those philosophies.'\nShe also paid tribute to her fans in a heartfelt Instagram post.\n'I dedicate every second to the love, diversity, compassion, and wild spirit of our fan base. To that kid who felt unwanted, or the grown up who remembers how hard it was to find acceptance. This is for you,' she wrote.\n'It is also for those whose hearts and minds have opened to our message. Thank you for believing in us so we could be here today little monsters this is YOUR stage. And I'm gonna leave my heart on it so you never forget it. Let's do this.'\nGaga also sang Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land during her Super Bowl concert, which many took as a stance against President Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies.", "external_links": ["http://www.refinery29.com/2017/02/139438/lady-gaga-super-bowl-performance-outfit-meaning", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-07T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:54:34.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
