If you want to nail an accent, master the language. “I thought, if I learned to speak Polish, then the diphthongs and the sounds of that language would be in my mouth,” Streep said about her role in “Sophie’s Choice” during a roundtable hosted by “Entertainment Tonight.” She didn’t realize until later that she would be expected to speak German — yet another language she didn’t know — but her Polish ability helped her speak German with a Polish accent. Other accent highlights include Streep channeling not just Julia Child’s irrepressible joie de vivre but also the chef’s distinctive high pitch and breathy cadence. In short, she put “Saturday Night Live” Child impersonator Dan Aykroyd to shame. And while it wasn’t just the Aussie accent that made “The dingo took my baby!” an unforgettable line in “A Cry in the Dark,” it certainly didn’t hurt. Now that you’ve got the voice down Sing like no one is watching Suzanne Vale Postcards from the Edge (1990) The movie version of Carrie Fisher’s semi-autobiographical novel had a few musical scenes, including the big, cathartic finale when Streep sings the country ballad “I’m Checkin’ Out.” The song, written by Shel Silverstein, was nominated for an Oscar. Yolanda Johnson A Prairie Home Companion (2006) “It’s just really fun to sing, and I don’t get to much,” Streep said while promoting Robert Altman’s film, which was based on Garrison Keillor’s radio show. “And at my house I’m not allowed to because, you know, your children can’t stand it when you sing at home.” Streep got to make up for lost time playing one half of a sisterly stage act specializing in folksy ditties. Donna Mamma Mia! (2008) The voice of a certain former James Bond notwithstanding, the movie adaptation of the Abba musical is utterly winning, thanks in large part to Streep. The actress looked like she was having a blast belting out tunes and shimmying to the beat in denim overalls while playing a free-spirited earth mother. The Witch Into the Woods (2014) Streep had done pop and country singing onscreen, but the pure musical theater work she had to do for the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s Tony-winning Broadway musical required a higher level of vocal ability. She played a witch, but — Meryl being Meryl — a subtly sympathetic one. Ricki Rendazzo Ricki and the Flash (2015) To play a woman who traded her family for the rock-star life, Streep had to not only sing but learn to play guitar. Incidentally, Streep’s real-life daughter Mamie Gummer plays her daughter in the movie, so Streep apparently got back at her kids for not letting her sing around the house. Florence Foster Jenkins Florence Foster Jenkins (2017) Streep’s so good at being great that she had to flex some different muscles for this role, portraying a talentless heiress who’s determined to be an opera star even though her singing sounds a little like a crow’s cawing. Everyone loves Meryl “Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice. She’s perfection.” Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) (While picking up an Oscar) “You know what it says? It says, ‘I beat Meryl.’” Brenda (Bette Midler) The First Wives Club (After Michael has watched “The Devil Wears Prada”) “He’s a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’s identified with her character.” Pam (Jenna Fischer) Woman: “You don’t like anybody.”Billy (yelling): “I do! I like Meryl Streep!” Billy Eichner and a random stranger Billy on the Street Sources: The Academy Awards Database, Post research. Photos: Getty Images.
