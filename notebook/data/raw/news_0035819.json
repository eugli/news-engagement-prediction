If you'd like to learn more... - \nEstevan, Sask. police are looking to toughen their approach to drinking and driving by taking away vehicles for repeat offenders. \nPolice Chief Paul Ladouceur wants to permanently seize vehicles of drivers convicted of multiple impaired driving charges. \n“We’ve tried everything. We’ve tried education in the schools, education in the public, posters at local liquor establishments, we’ve tried blitzes, we’ve tried roadside checks, we’ve tried increase penalties,” Ladouceur said. Families impacted by drunk driving welcome new changes to Sask. impaired driving laws \n“[We’re] dealing with the same issues so obviously something isn’t working.” \nLadouceur said the different approach was spawned from an incident three weeks ago. Estevan police had arrested a man for the fourth time for impaired driving. \nREAD MORE: Sask. impaired driving numbers up from last year \nHe said these harsh penalties aren’t directed at first offenders but for drivers who have three or four offences. \n“It’s not uncommon for us to arrest an impaired driver every second or third night,” Ladouceur said. \nNo change in legislation is required to proceed with any vehicle seizures. According to the police chief, it’s entirely legal under the criminal code. \n“The Criminal Code allows for offence-related properties to be seized and we started looking at the fact that we do it all the time with drug traffickers and organized crime,” he said. \n“Why aren’t we doing it with impaired driving, that’s also a criminal offence.” \nLadouceur cites a similar case out of Quebec where a vehicle was successfully seized. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. \nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: \n“It is an available option under the Criminal Code but whether it should be used depends on all the circumstances of the case.” \nPolice wouldn’t be able to just automatically seize a person’s vehicle. \nIt would be on a case-by-case basis and only for repeat offenders, and then ultimately need to go before the courts for final decision. \nEstevan Reacts \nAround the city, reactions to the tougher approach was mixed. \n“Right on. Get them off the roads. They don’t belong on the roads,” Lynn Bryson said. \nAnother resident was in favour of temporarily seizing vehicles, but said permanently goes too far. \n“No… because then you’re paying for a vehicle right? Then you can’t drive. No, I don’t agree with that,” Scott Ferguson said.
