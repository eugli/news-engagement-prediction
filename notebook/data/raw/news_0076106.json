The congregants stood in respect. \n\"We want you to know your family supports you 100 percent,\" bellowed the Rev. Bishop Jeffery Thomas in Mount Rose Baptist Church. \nIt was the first visit by the longtime Dallas County commissioner, a regular there, since his public corruption trial started last week. \nOn Monday, it will be Price who stands out of respect — in the federal courtroom — as the jurors who will decide his fate file into their box. From the defendant's table, he will listen to prosecutors lay out their case that Price took nearly $1 million in bribes, selling his office to enrich himself. He will watch witnesses testify — the first of many, in a trial that could last four months. If convicted of all charges, Price, 66, is likely to face decades in prison. \nBut on Sunday, Price basked in the adoration of his supporters, who promised to pray for him. Women hugged him. Men shook his hand. \nAs the son and father of preachers, Price says he's always considered church a crucial part of his week. Lately, he goes to three churches each Sunday, and even more during the week for constituent funerals. He says he draws encouragement and power from connecting with his people, and with God. And it's never bad politics to be visible; he credits his churchgoing with helping him win election nine times since 1984. \n\"We call it a charging station,\" Price said. \"I come to get charged up so I can make it through the week, with all the stuff I deal with.\" Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price greets longtime friend Diane Miles after a Sunday service at Friendship-West Baptist Church.

Ben Torres/Special Contributor Special Contributor \nPrice arrived at 8 a.m. to his first service of the day at Friendship-West Baptist Church. \n\"We continue to lift up our man downtown, John Wiley Price,\" the Rev. Frederick Haynes III told the crowd. \"Study our history. Whenever you have one of us strongly stand up, you always have those who come after them.\" \nHaynes introduced Michael Eric Dyson, a prominent African-American author and news commentator, to give the sermon. Dyson, who is expected to testify on Price's behalf, said Price was guilty only of fighting for black people. He said President Donald Trump had committed more egregious criminal acts than Price. \n\"Take John Wiley Price off trial and put that man on trial,\" Dyson said, as the audience erupted in applause. \nAs Dyson preached about American political power being steeped in white supremacy, Price yelled out: \"Teach!\" \"Whup us!\" \"C'mon, Dyson!\" \nHaynes, after the service, praised Price for fighting for the black community. Over the years, Price has led efforts to boost hiring and promoting black Dallas County employees and increase minority contractors. \n\"Hashtag Black Lives Matter became popular in the last couple years,\" Haynes said. \"To me, Black Lives Matter has been the mantra of Commissioner Price since he took office. He's loved it. He's practiced it. He shows it. Not the exclusion of others — but he wants to make sure we're included when we talk about who matters in this country.\" \nHaynes showed off a few pieces of African art, carved of wood, in his church's private office area that Price donated. A giant onk, a symbol of Isis, a goddess of ancient Egypt, hangs behind a glass casing on the wall. A tribal mask and a ram's head are displayed nearby. \n\"He is one of the most generous people you'll ever meet,\" Haynes said. \nAfrican art is featured in Price's indictment as one way he hid money from the feds. He's accused of not paying taxes on at least $50,000 he earned from selling art pieces. He kept pieces at Millennium 2000 art gallery on consignment that were called the \"John Wiley Priceless Collection.\" \nThat gallery was owned by Karen Manning, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to filing a fraudulent tax return and agreed to testify against Price. The FBI has said that Manning used her business to launder money for Price. \nPrice's warm reception at black churches during his corruption trial might rankle some in Dallas. But black supporters are so loyal because they see him as a rare advocate in an oppressive world — even if he may be corrupt, said Betty Culbreath, a former Price assistant who now believes the federal allegations against him are true. \n\"The first thing they say is that he didn't do no more than what no white man did,\" Culbreath said. \"Black people still feel so misused and abused, they're loyal to somebody even if he's crooked. All they know is he speaks up for them.\" \nAt Friendship-West, some of Price's supporters said they didn't know the details of the charges against him. \nDr. Charles Mitchell, an orthopedic surgeon, said Price, who has been his patient, is \"one of the most brilliant people in the area.\" \n\"The media has not given him the best credit he should have gotten,\" Mitchell said. \"He's not been fairly treated.\" \nAnother supporter, Joyce Gray, said she knew Price was innocent of \"whatever it is they charged him with.\" \n\"Commissioner Price has been a civil rights leader for the Dallas community for a long, long time,\" she said. \"We hold him in high regard.\" \nOpening statements in Price's trial are set for Monday.
