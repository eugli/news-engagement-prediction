(Photo: Mark Duncan, AP) \nHOUSTON — Marshall Faulk has been outspoken about the New England Patriots in the past, saying at one point they \"cheated\" him out of a championship ring. \nWith the Patriots days away from playing in their seventh Super Bowl in the last 16 seasons, Faulk, a Hall-of-Fame running back and NFL Network analyst, was asked Thursday if he believes the franchise's Deflategate and Spygate scandals were handled properly. \n\"Hey man, I’m still waiting on my 40 acres and a mule,\" Faulk said Thursday at Super Bowl LI. \"You think that was handled right? Who cares? This is how it is right now, we deal with it. You play, you have fun, you live life. Guy bumped the back of my car a couple days ago. It wasn’t fair, that’s how it is.\" \nRead more: \nThe Patriots won their first Super Bowl in 2002, when they beat Faulk's Rams, 20-17. \nFaulk previously told CSNNE.com that he believes the Patriots videotaped the Rams' walk-through before the game. \nWhile no evidence exists that happened, the Patriots were punished for illegally videotaping opponents' defensive signals in 2007. Both coach Bill Belichick and the team were fined, and the team was docked a draft pick. \nTwo years ago, before the Patriots won their last Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks, they once again found themselves in hot water over the Deflategate scandal in which they were accused of intentionally deflating footballs. \nOnce again, the team was fined and forced to forfeit a draft pick, and quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for four games, which he served at the start of this season. \nFaulk said he never could have guessed that Brady would develop into one of the NFL's all-time great quarterbacks when they met in Super Bowl XXXVI. \nAsked what he knew about Brady before he took over as the Patriots' starter, Faulk said not much. \n“I knew about him what everybody else knew about him,\" Faulk said. \"He sucked and he couldn’t beat out Drew Henson (at Michigan). I was never scared of him. What did you know about him? You knew the same thing. That’s it.\" \nBrady will break the record he shares with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback if the Patriots win on Sunday. \n\"I heard Tom the other day, he said I never thought I’d be here,\" Faulk said. \"So guess what, I’m going with what Tom said.\" \nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
