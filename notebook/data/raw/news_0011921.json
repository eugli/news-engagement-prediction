After 17 years of playing Wolverine, Hugh Jackman will hang up the claws next month in Logan . The two trailers released so far indicate that the third Wolverine spinoff will be an emotional and especially intense conclusion to Jackman's tenure as the popular mutant hero, not to mention one of the more unique-looking superhero movies. Even though there was already enough to chew on until Logan 's release, 20th Century Fox wisely acquired Super Bowl ad time today and has released an exciting TV spot for the highly-anticipated blockbuster. Check it out! \nTaking place in the year 2029, when the X-Men have disbanded and the mutant population has shrunk, Logan will follow Wolverine as he protects a young girl very much like him from being captured by the forces of Transigen. The main cast includes Hugh Jackman as the eponymous protagonist, Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Dafne Keen as Laura (a.k.a. X-23), Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, Richard E. Grant as Zander Rice, Doris Morgardo as Maria and Stephen Merchant as Caliban. Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal and Elizabeth Rodriguez have also been cast in undisclosed roles. \nLogan slashes its way into theaters on March 3.
