In a typically Pratchett-like twist, 30,000 fans signed a petition calling on Death to hand him back. \n“Death was listening,” insisted Terry Pratchett: Back to Black (BBC Two), in which actor Paul Kaye deftly reincarnated this most prolific and popular of writers in extracts from his unfinished memoirs. Pratchett gave a number of moving interviews (notably in the BBC film Choosing to Die ) about his condition in the run up to his death.\nBut this tribute, featuring affectionate remembrances from friends, family, former colleagues and fans, was more of a joyful reflection on his life and writings, and the intense bond he forged with his millions of readers.\nPaul Kaye as Terry Pratchett Credit: BBC H e emerged here as a man whose humour and ability to delight inspired fierce admiration and devotion. The on-camera tears, most affectingly from fellow author and collaborator Neil Gaiman, were testament to that. Yet in the sections hewn from his own recollections, Pratchett also emerged as someone torn between wanting to be thought of as both ordinary and exceptional.\nThis, it seems, emerged chiefly due to a clash between a distinctly unliterary upbringing and the unceasing blizzard of creativity and curiosity that swirled inside his cranium from an early age. \nPaul Kaye as Terry Pratchett Credit: BBC A s such, perhaps the most surprising revelation here was the degree to which Pratchett’s writerly ambition was driven by rage. Firstly by a towering, never-forgotten anger at a former headmaster who said he would “never amount to anything”. And, for much of his career, by fury at the literary establishment for cocking a snook at him despite, or more likely because of, his ability to outsell most of them a thousand times over.\nStill, Pratchett was smart enough never to let that spoil things, even if not being able to hang around and enjoy his success into old age was a blow. Were he still alive, he would savour the truth implicit in the fact that it took a large London theatre, not a side chapel, to hold all those eager to attend his memorial service. And what greater tribute could any wit of his generation want, than to be cheered on the path to eternity by Eric Idle giving a heartfelt rendition of Always Look On the Bright Side of Life?\nTerry Pratchett: 50 brilliant quotes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:26:56.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
