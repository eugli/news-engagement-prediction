Youth Allowance is worth $438 a fortnight, while Newstart Allowance is $528. \nJobseekers under 25 will also have to wait four weeks before accessing income support. SHARE Social Services Minister Christian Porter defended the Newstart changes on Wednesday. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nTarsha Jago, 19, from Clayton in south-east Melbourne, is currently on Newstart and would be shifted to Youth Allowance under the changes. \nShe told Fairfax Media she usually doesn't have anything left over at the end of a fortnight once she pays for food, rent and public transport - and she isn't sure where she could slice $45 a week from her budget. Advertisement \n\"I'm working part-time and studying part-time, and without Newstart I wouldn't be able to study. I wouldn't be able to survive,\" she said. \n\"I definitely don't have spare money. Once I pay my rent and put enough money on my Myki to travel to and from uni, that money would very much so be my food money.\" SHARE Students are expected to be among the worst-affected by Newstart changes. Photo: Andrew Quilty \nMs Jago moved from Tasmania to study Law, Politics and Indigenous Studies at Monash University, and found the cost of living to be higher in Melbourne. \nMany of her peers from high school have moved interstate for tertiary education, relying on Newstart to help them relocate and pay rent. SHARE Tarsha Jago, 19, would be shifted to Youth Allowance from Newstart under proposed welfare changes. Photo: Supplied \nBoth of Ms Jago's parents are on a disability pension, meaning they can only offer limited financial help if her payment is cut. \n\"I think it is a problem that young jobseekers will have to wait until they're 25 to access Newstart,\" Ms Jago said. \"That's quite significant. It doesn't seem like a lot [less than Youth Allowance] per fortnight, but over a year that's quite a significant amount.\" \nThe National Union of Students (NUS) has been campaigning against Centrelink as part of its #FixCentrelinkNow campaign . \nNUS welfare officer Jill Molloy said the \"Howard-era\" welfare changes proposed on Wednesday come at a time when people are already stressed about Centrelink's automated debt notices . \n\"It's making everyone out to be dole bludgers,\" Ms Molloy said. \n\"Youth Allowance is much less than Newstart, so putting them on Youth Allowance until they're 25 ... is really unfair.\" \nThe 20-year-old said many students are already wondering if they can keep studying at university as they juggle a high cost of living. Putting them on a lower payment, which they have to wait four weeks for, will cause some to drop out and affect their mental health, she said. \n\"People are struggling. People are unsure if they can continue studying at university. The cost of living is too high,\" Ms Molloy said. \n\"I know many people who have had to call Lifeline in their time of waiting, because they're living off two-minute noodles or nothing. \n\"It's going to impact their health and wellbeing, and it's definitely going to impact their university experience.\" \nIn a speech on Wednesday , social services minister Christian Porter said the changes would help to address youth unemployment. \n\"With youth unemployment more than twice as high as the general unemployment rate, 13.3 per cent compared to 5.8 per cent as at December 2016, it is imperative that the income support system provides incentives for young people to find work and be self-sufficient where they are able, or undertake further education or training to increase their employability,\" Mr Porter said. \n\"Waiting periods, including the one week Ordinary Waiting Period, are applied to ensure that people support themselves in the first instance where they are able before receiving income support payments.\" \nMr Porter said the government had set aside \"emergency relief funding\" for \"any young people who may find themselves in hardship\" during the four-week waiting period.
