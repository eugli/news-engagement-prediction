(Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKansas coach Bill Self has tabbed senior guard Frank Mason III as the \"most deserving player\" he's ever coached to win the Wooden Award. \nSo it's little surprise that Mason has emerged as somewhat of a front-runner in this year's race for national player of the year. But there's still hardly a clear-cut favorite here in mid-February, as both Villanova's Josh Hart and Purdue's Caleb Swanigan could easily springboard ahead. \nHere's a full look at the contenders: 1. Frank Mason III, Kansas \nAs freshman Josh Jackson blossoms, Mason III continues to anchor the Jayhawks. The veteran guard has been an elite catalyst all season. His numbers (20.1 ppg, 4.9 apg, 4.3 rpg) are certainly impressive, but it's his leadership and clutch playmaking that helped him stay atop our rankings, while coinciding with Kansas' latest streak of close wins. 2. Josh Hart, Villanova \nThe heart and soul of the defending national champs, Hart has spearheaded the Wildcats' offense this season to help them stay out front in the Big East standings and currently hold a projected No. 1 seed in the NCAAs. He's averaging 18.7 points and 6.6 rebounds a game. 3. Caleb Swanigan, Purdue \nThe 6-9 sophomore big man has been a ferocious force for the Boilermakers, averaging monstrous numbers â€” 18.7 points and 13.0 rebounds a game. He's the reason why Purdue is near the top of the Big Ten race. \nMORE COLLEGE HOOPS NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:37:27.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
