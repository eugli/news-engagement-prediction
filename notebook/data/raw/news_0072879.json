Image copyright TfGM Image caption The route passes landmarks including Manchester Town Hall and the National Football Museum \nThe Second City Crossing's first phase opened between Victoria and Exchange Square - the area of Manchester city centre that faced the brunt of the 1996 IRA bomb - in December 2015. \nSince work to expand Metrolink began in 2009, the network has trebled in original size and has become the largest light rail network in the UK. \nCouncillor Andrew Fender, chair of TfGM's committee, said the completed route would offer a \"fantastic new view of historic Manchester landmarks\". \nSir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said it highlighted \"how much the city has changed in such a short space of time, and represents a major milestone in Manchester's continuing development and growth\". \nAbout 250 drivers have undergone training on the new route. \nThe line was built as part of the government's £1.5bn investment in tram, bus, rail and cycle routes across Greater Manchester.
