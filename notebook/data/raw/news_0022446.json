(Sam Costanza) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:   1:11 AM \nA civilian NYPD steamfitter who once earned nearly $650,000 for a single year on the job was shot to death in the garage of his Brooklyn home Wednesday, sources familiar with the case said. \nRobert D’Onofrio, 66, was shot in the chest on Bay 8th St. near Benson Ave. in Bath Beach just after 6:30 p.m., cops said. \nHis daughter came across the scene and started screaming, authorities said. \nAn off-duty police officer who lives nearby rushed to her side and called 911, sources said. \nGunman shoots two men, killing one, in Brooklyn \nMedics rushed him to Maimonides Hospital, where he died. \nCops were looking into whether the shooter intended to kill D’Onofrio, or if it was a robbery gone bad. \nAfter the killing, the suspect sped off in D'Onofrio's sports car, police said. \nCops released photos of the car — a blue 2015 Mustang that later turned up in the Brownsville area, sources said. \nTeen shot at Crown Fried Chicken by masked gunman in Brooklyn \nBack in 2012, D’Onofrio cashed in six years of back pay, totaling nearly $650,000, when he got his job back after winning a legal battle with the NYPD. The sum was triple the amount then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly made that year. The gunman fatally shot the NYPD maintenance worker in the chest and then stole the victim’s Mustang. \nD’Onofrio was fired for a host of infractions that an arbitrator later determined to be unfounded. \n“My boss didn’t like me — it’s as simple as that. I never stepped on toes, or spoke out of turn, but they had it out for me,” he told the Daily News at the time. \n“I went from mediocre overtime, to no overtime, to being a top earner. Everything is good now!” \nMan shot in groin after gunman opens fire outside Brooklyn home \nJoan Porcaro, his next-door neighbor, described D’Onofrio as a recent widower, and a father. \n“He was a hardworking man. Everything he did, he did for his girls, as he would say,” Porcaro recalled. \n“He was a very quiet man, never caused any problems at all... He was very respectful to my parents and he loved my father very deeply. I've known him as long as he lived here.” \nD’Onofrio posted two photos of the gleaming Mustang on his Instagram page last May. Other photos show him vacationing in Vegas and the Grand Canyon. \nThe shooter is still at large.
