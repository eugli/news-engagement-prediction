Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), called out the president on the air and, hours later, on SiriusXM. \nThat was “literally the first point I made in the interview,” Cuomo said of his question about Blumenthal misrepresenting his military record in Vietnam. “The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts. That’s not something that any of us have any desire to say on a regular basis, but it keeps being true.” \nThen, Cuomo floated an argument about the destructive nature of being called “fake news,” and said the term is as bad as a racial slur. \n“’Fake news’ is the worst thing that you can call a journalist,” Cuomo said on air. “It’s like an ethnic disparagement. We all have these ugly words for people ― that’s the one for journalists.” \nBlumenthal told Cuomo what he has been telling other journalists since Wednesday: that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, said in a private conversation that the president’s recent attacks on judges were “disheartening.” \nThe statement apparently upset Trump, and he took aim at CNN. Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam.
