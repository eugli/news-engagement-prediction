But Bishop told reporters while on the election trail in Western Australia on Saturday that she understood interviewing and vetting was still taking place.\nProtests held across Australia against Donald Trump's travel ban Read more\n“The agreement is to be honoured by the Trump administration [so] I’m pleased this agreement will continue,” she told the ABC .\nConfusion around exactly what the US president, Donald Trump, meant in saying the refugees would be subject to “extreme vetting” was the reason behind postponing the interviews, according to an unnamed source in the Reuters report. Trump described the refugee agreement as a “dumb deal” in a tweet.\nUnder the settlement deal, the US will take refugees currently held on Manus Island and Nauru in return for Australia accepting refugees from Central America.\nThe immigration minister, Peter Dutton, earlier said authorities were working to get refugees off Manus Island and Nauru as quickly as possible but it was a “difficult juggling act”.\n“We are keen to get people off there as quickly as possible ... we’ve got unfinished business,” he told 2GB radio on Friday. “There’s a long way to go before we can get people off.”\nAustralian officials have been working with US counterparts to look at the individual cases of those held in immigration detention, Dutton said.\nOn Saturday hundreds of protesters rallied in Sydney against Trump’s immigration restrictions and Australia’s offshore detention of asylum seekers.\nDeportation of Iranian refugee from Fiji an act of thuggery, says lawyer Read more\nThe crowd just shy of 1000 people marched from Hyde Park to the US embassy at Martin Place, according to organiser Ian Rintoul, as similar rallies were held in Canberra, Hobart and Newcastle.\nRintoul said they protested against Australia’s offshore detention of asylum seekers and its refugee-swap deal with the US, as well as Trump’s executive order blocking travellers from seven countries. The order was on Saturday subject to a temporary restraining order after a ruling from a US federal judge.\nRintoul said protesters wanted refugees in offshore detention at Nauru and Manus Island to be brought to Australia. He said that even if Australia’s refugee-swap agreement with the US did proceed, it wouldn’t provide for all the refugees at Nauru and Manus Island.", "external_links": ["http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-04/bishop-denies-us-officials-paused-nauru-asylum-seeker-interviews/8241626"], "published": "2017-02-05T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:51:42.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
