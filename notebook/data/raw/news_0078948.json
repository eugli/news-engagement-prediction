Even though co-writer Glenn Thrush says he emailed Spicer to ask about certain details of the Times ‘s story ahead of time, Spicer took issue with a certain aspect of the content: For the record @nytimes @grynbaum can't even get where I was born right and failed to ask https://t.co/hIb3QFxK6P \n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) February 25, 2017 \nEnter Tapper, who came up with this snarky tweet when he took notice of Spicer’s: I imagine it must be really annoying when someone puts out false info about where you were born. Must really bother you!! \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 25, 2017 \nTapper, of course, is referencing the “birther” conspiracy theory that Trump propagated for years before he became president. Trump used to suggest that Barack Obama was not a natural-born American citizen (and thereby, not a legitimate president), and he flirted with the idea for years before finally renouncing it during the 2016 election. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:47:29.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
