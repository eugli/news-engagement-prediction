(Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters)\n\"Those border points are gateways and cartels control the gateways,\" says Ryan Cortez, an undercover drug agent in Oklahoma.. \n\"And they're very territorial. So did [Enrique Harms] have a connection to a cartel? With those amounts, he had to.\" \nUpcoming court cases in Canada American authorities have been concerned for several years about Mennonites bringing Mexican cartel drugs into Canada. The most recent court cases in Canada have been in Ontario. \nFranz Klassen and his cousin Abraham Klassen were both sentenced in a Simcoe, Ont., courtroom in 2016 to six years in prison for smuggling cocaine into Canada.\nMennonite ties to Mexican drug cartels years in the making How a Mennonite trucker was caught smuggling cocaine Another pair of men, Jacob Dyck and Abram Klassen, are expected in court next month in Lethbridge, Alta., on charges of importing cocaine at the border crossing at Coutts, Atla.\nDyck and Klassen's trial is expected to begin in Calgary on March 31.\nThe original Mennonite drug smuggler   The first Mennonite ever to be arrested, and subsequently convicted, for cross border drug trafficking, according to American authorities, was one of Harms's mules — a Manitoba farmer named Cornelius Banman in 1989. \nHarms had a nearly perfect front. He used farmhouses in southwestern Ontario to stash drugs and money and recruited Mennonites like Banman to move his drugs, according to Canadian and U.S. authorities. \nAbraham Harms, shown when he was arrested by Leamington Police Services in 1989, fled to Mexico after being released on bail. (the fifth estate)\nIn 1989, Harms was arrested in an undercover investigation in Ontario. \nOnce he was released on bail by the Leamington Police Services, he fled immediately to Cuauhtemoc, a town in the state of Chihuahua. \nfifth estate co-host Hana Gartner tracked him down there in the 1992 documentary and that interview will be rebroadcast in tonight's episode, \"The Mennonite Connection.\"\nHana Gartner, co-host of CBC's the fifth estate, interviews Abraham Harms in Cuauhtemoc, Mexico, in 1992. (the fifth estate/CBC)\nFour years later, while still a fugitive from the law in Canada, Harms died in a car crash in Mexico. \nSome speculate that his eldest son, Enrique, may have had a hand in that accident, although that has never been proven. \n\"One doesn't know a family's problems. But if money, drugs, that could play into it, it's a possibility,\" says Cortez. \nAfter his death, Abraham Harms's career as a suspected smuggler was immortalized in a ballad by a local Mexican band — Banda Joven.\n\"El Corrido de Abraham\" goes: \nI'm tired of being poor, \nAbraham said to his sons. \nI'm going to the U.S. \nTo sell a few kilos… \nGod took Abraham away \nBut his sons remained. \nArrest in Canada Enrique Harms has only been arrested once in Canada — for minor charges — by a Leamington Police Services officer in the 1990s. He was fingerprinted, photographed and then released. \nSince then he has been indicted at least three times in the U.S. for smuggling drugs — most recently in Colorado in 2013. \nThat indictment for trafficking marijuana came after the Drug Enforcement Agency seized 1,000 kilograms of pot bound for a Mennonite operation in Calgary.  \nIn an interview with former Los Angeles Times reporter Sam Quinones, the Leamington Police Services officer who arrested Abraham Harms in 1989 and Enrique Harms a few years after that said: \"What I've seen in 1988 is that it went from a guy selling a couple of hundred pounds of marijuana to guys who sell hundreds of thousands of kilos of marijuana and cocaine all over the United States and Canada.\n\"[Abraham and Enrique Harms] are the inventors of the Mennonite mob. That's the original family. They're involved in homicides and everything else.\" \nAbraham Wiebe, a police informant for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics, was killed in 1999. (the fifth estate)\n\nThe Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics says that one of their informants, Abraham Wiebe, was ordered kidnapped by Enrique Harms and tortured for two weeks in Mexico before being dumped in a lake in 1999. His body has never been found. \nWiebe's widow said she left her Mennonite faith as a result and has since remarried and moved to another state with their children. \nCortez said arresting Enrique Harms would give him \"closure\" on the death of Abraham Wiebe. \n\"He lost his life helping us. That's just as black and white as I can put it,\" Cortez told fifth estate host Bob McKeown in February.\nDrugs are commonly trafficked on a route from Cuauhtemoc, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas. (the fifth estate/CBC)\nRonnie Jackson, the former Thomas, Okla., police chief who introduced Wiebe to Cortez, says all these years later the case still haunts him.  \n\"The story of [Wiebe] being kidnapped and tortured, it weighs,\" he said, his words trailing off.\n\"I haven't had any issues with it lately but there's times I've woken up seeing it in a dream,\" he said in a telephone interview from Arizona. \nJackson said another informant told the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics that Wiebe \"was castrated, electrocuted and dumped in a lake somewhere in Mexico.\" \nFamily profile Enrique Harms is said to have four brothers and at least one sister. \nHis brother John carved out a career as a film actor, producing and starring in several Mexican movies about drug lords.\nBrothers Jake, left, and Enrique Harms stand in front of the marijuana they were arrested for trafficking in Mexico in the early 1990s. (the fifth estate/CBC)\nDetails are not known on what became of the other siblings or their mother. \nA police source in Canada says that he suspects Enrique and his brothers still go back and forth between Wheatley, near Leamington, and Cuauhtemoc to this day, using fake ID, because of family ties in Ontario.\nEnrique Harms's current location is unknown, although American authorities say they suspect he still lives in Cuauhtemoc. \n\n\nWith files from Sam Quinones", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:31:21.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
