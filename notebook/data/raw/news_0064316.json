Don’t Accept ‘You’re Fine,’ Expert Advises Women Lori Newman, Special to Lifescript Published February 22, 2017 NEXT O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... A new epidemic in the U.S. is attacking women in their prime: ischemic heart disease. Caused by narrowed heart arteries, it’s also called “silent ischemia” because often there’s no pain and no warning before a heart attack strikes, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). And silent ischemia is killing more women at younger ages than ever before, says cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center in the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... “Death rates from heart disease have dropped in older women, but ... they're rising in women under the age of 55 [and] actually going up [in women ages] 25 to 40,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the U.S. More women die of heart disease than from all forms of cancer combined, she says. Why more younger women are dying It’s unclear why more younger women are dying, Dr. Bairey Merz says. Numerous studies are underway at the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center and elsewhere to find the answers. A higher incidence of diabetes in younger, obese women – and an increasing number of women taking up smoking – may partially explain the heart disease epidemic, she says. But the main reason women die from heart attacks? Their condition is often undiagnosed. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... Many doctors still only recognize the typical symptoms of male-pattern heart disease, the chest-clutching “Hollywood heart attack” and clogged heart arteries that show up clearly on a coronary angiogram, Dr. Bairey Merz says. An angiogram X-ray reveals whether the coronary arteries, (the large vessels supplying blood to the heart), are blocked or narrowed, where they’re blocked and by how much, the AHA explains. How women’s symptoms are different Women’s symptoms of heart disease are often more subtle. Although they may include chest pain, two-thirds of women dismiss their symptoms because they don’t recognize them as signals of a heart attack, Dr. Bairey Merz says. [Barbara Fleeman lived for years with a cough that was actually a sign of heart disease. Find out how she got the correct diagnosis .] Female-pattern heart disease symptoms include “heartburn,” which women may attribute to an upset stomach; sweatiness, which they may attribute to hot flashes; or shortness of breath, she says. Many doctors don’t recognize these symptoms either. They may dismiss them because a woman’s angiogram looks normal, even if there’s evidence of heart disease, for example, an abnormal EKG or stress test. [What heart tests do women need? Janet Wei, MD, FACC, a leading Cedars-Sinai cardiologist, explains here .] “Too often, these young women are patted on the back and told they don’t have heart disease,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... Yet, “more than half of the heart-failure cases that we see are female-pattern heart failure,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. A woman should report to her health-care provider “anything above the waist that is unusual for them,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. If your doctor doesn’t believe it’s your heart, find a doctor who’ll give you the proper tests to determine what’s going on with your heart, she advises. [ Tracy Solomon Clark was told she was too young for heart disease, and her symptoms were dismissed. Find out how she got the correct diagnosis . ] Women’s hearts are treated differently One out of five heart attacks in women is undiagnosed, says Dr. Bairey Merz, citing a large Scottish study. “[These women] are not admitted to the hospital. They don’t get the care that a heart attack would need, and they’re much more likely to die,” she explains. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... Other long-term studies demonstrate that women who’ve had a heart attack are much more likely to die than men who’ve had a heart attack, she says. “That’s true at 30 days [after a heart attack]. It’s true at the one-year follow-up, and it’s true at three-to-five-year follow-ups,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. The reason seems to be that women are less likely to be prescribed the life-saving prevention therapies offered to men, she says. “Almost 100% of men will be prescribed those heart attack treatments for prevention, and yet only about 90% of women” receive the same treatments, she says.

In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... Women’s risk factors Women face additional risk factors that are uncommon in men, Dr. Bairey Merz says. These include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s or other autoimmune diseases, she says. The reasons aren’t yet clear, but “women have much more autoimmune disease than men,” Dr. Bairey Merz says. And these conditions often lead to heart disease. While type 2 diabetes strikes men and women nearly equally, it’s a much stronger risk factor for heart disease in women, she says. Breast cancer and heart disease Women have yet another risk factor: breast cancer. Breast cancer treatments can weaken the heart, Dr. Bairey Merz says. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... “Women typically have radiation alone, radiation and chemo, or chemo alone,” she explains. “Both the chemotherapy and radiation are known now to accelerate the risk of premature heart disease.” So, if you’ve been treated for breast cancer, ask to be screened for heart disease and “to be evaluated as to whether preventative heart disease therapy would be in order,” Dr. Bairey Merz advises. Calculate your risk online Another way to become your own health advocate is to get your atherosclerotic risk score [“A-risk”] calculated every year, Dr. Bairey Merz says. “This [calculates] the fatty blockages that cause both female-pattern [and] male-pattern heart disease and deaths,” she says. O ne in five women who experiences a heart attack is told, “You’re fine; you don’t have heart disease.” Then, she's sent home from the doctor’s office or emergency room. In Ask the Doctor , a women’s health video series produced in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, leading cardiologist Noel Bairey Merz, MD, FACC, explains what you can do about it... Because most doctors don’t do this basic screening, Dr. Bairey Merz recommends downloading a free ClinCalc app onto your smartphone – or access it online – to calculate your risk. You enter your age, sex, blood pressure readings and cholesterol counts. The calculator then reveals your 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which includes non-fatal heart attack, coronary heart disease death or stroke. Your risk is then compared with “optimal risk factors” – such as low blood pressure and HDL cholesterol readings – of a similar patient. How to have a healthier heart Dr. Bairey Merz also recommends taking the following steps to help reduce your risk of developing heart disease: Don’t smoke: Smoking is a leading cause of heart disease. Get active: Start with 10,000 steps per day measured by your smart phone or pedometer. For higher levels of fitness, do 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times per week. Maintain a heart-healthy diet: Mediterranean-style foods are best. Eat fish twice a week, have nine-to-10 servings of fruit or vegetables each day, and choose complex carbs over refined flour and sugar. Limit alcohol consumption: A 5-ounce glass of wine with dinner is fine. But ask your doctor whether alcohol is compatible with medications you take or your other health conditions. Avoid weight gain with aging: While losing weight does not reduce heart disease risk, it can help with high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis management.
