ESPN's Glenn Price is now reporting that team medical staff have sent the 27-year-old to Germany for special treatment and the Croatian is consequently a doubt for Monday’s clash with defending champions, Leicester City . It is far from great news for Jürgen Klopp, as it means that despite the return of other big names from the treatment table and international commitments in recent weeks, the Liverpool manager has been unable to field his first choice XI since the 6-1 win over Watford in November. Although Lovren has had an up-and-down season so far, his best performances have come alongside Joël Matip as the lanky Cameroonian’s front-footed approach has allowed the ex- Southampton man to stay back and take the no-nonsense attitude he prefers. Despite a shaky resumption of the defensive partnership following Matip’s lengthy spell on the sideline due to injury and eligibility issues, a solid performance stifling leaders Chelsea (save for Simon Mignolet’s bungling of a David Luiz free kick) showed signs that the German-speaking duo were on the way back to their imperious early season form. Klopp still appears to be undecided on his third-choice center back, as Mamadou Sakho’s self-induced exile from the team on loan to Crystal Palace has left the German oscillating between Ragnar Klavan and long-stay Lucas for the much of the season, although the latter of whom, albeit did put in an excellent shift in corralling Tottenham’s Harry Kane in the recent 2-0 win. However, neither option inspires much confidence among Liverpool fans as medium- to long-term options in the back four, and the hope is that the news on Lovren’s knee over the next few days will not force extended cameos for the backups in the crucial run-in for Champions League places.
