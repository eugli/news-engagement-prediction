Why, what did you accomplish by doing this? Does it make you feel good to drive out and wreck somebody else’s property?” \nThe 60-meter grain bag was carrying approximately 12,000 bushels of durum with an estimated market value close to $100,000. \nAccording to McCullough, they were able to salvage most of the durum. He estimated they lost up to 500 bushels of durum and three days of work. \nAdding in costs of manpower, fuel and wear and tear on their equipment, he said the crime cost them around $5,000. \n“[It] doesn’t sound like much but it’s money. It’s just money out of our pockets,” McCullough said.

McCullough said there’s been a rash of bags being cut. He said he doesn’t understand why people do this. \nAccording to Todd Lewis, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, the perception of petty crime is increasing. \nLewis is urging any farmers to report anything, regardless of how small the crime may be. \n“You know the RCMP are only as good as what’s reported to them, and if we want better service, we have to let police know what’s going on,” he said. \nAccording to RCMP in Saskatchewan, the Maidstone RCMP detachment reported one incident of vandalism in the last six months. However, it doesn’t include other reported crimes in other detachments. \nIn a statement, RCMP said they encourage farmers to report any vandalism and “reporting each and every incident is key,” as those “complaints help them gather knowledge about detachment areas.” \nREAD MORE: Committee tasked with finding ways to reduce crime starts hearing in Regina \nMcCullough said they’re now taking extra precautions and keeping an extra close eye on their product. \n“When we put bags out there, there might be some surveillance that they don’t know about,” he said.
