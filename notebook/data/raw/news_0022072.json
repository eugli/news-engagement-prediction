'The only trouble she has is getting up and down from the floor, all the rest of the dance moves she can do. 'She can even stand on her head now without any hands, which even kids without progeria struggle to do.' While the condition, which decreases muscle and bone density, also prevented her from growing taller than 3ft 5in (pictured aged eight as a cheerleader) Kaylee, from Toledo, Ohio, has managed to defy getting any stiff joints thanks to the four urban dance classes she attends each week (pictured during a performance with fellow dancers) Kaylee was diagnosed with progeria when she was just one-year-old after struggling to gain weight. By the time she was two, she had completely lost her hair and started to develop arthritis. But the arthritis in her wrists and knees isn't too bad, which doctors believe is because of her dancing. People with the condition typically only live until their early teens due to heart problems making them more susceptible to a heart attack or stroke. Mrs Halko added: 'We never think about her having a shortened life span, anyone could die at any point so you can't dwell on that. 'She's so full of life you can't ruin that with negative thoughts, so we focus on the positives. 'When Kaylee found out about the life expectancy for progeria she was very brave and told me, 'Even if I live until 12 that's a long time.' Her mother, Marla, 39, said: 'Performing has really helped her, so I'm happy she dances, it keeps her joints loose and stops them from tightening up' People with the condition typically only live until their early teens due to heart problems making them more susceptible to a heart attack or stroke (pictured centre performing at a dance competition) She continued: 'I don't stress about things in the future, what we do is just concentrate on the happiness of right now and any moments spent worrying is wasting valuable time with her. 'Kaylee doesn't act any differently, she just lives and doesn't think about death, plus who knows there's so much research - you have to be positive.' Hip hop is her best dance and she's very good at it. I think it's all the sass in her - she's very sassy. When she performs she absolutely loves it. Marla Halko Kaylee is currently on a drug trial from the Progeria Research Foundation, where doctors are taking biopsies of her skin cells and blood tests for research. Her parents hope that the drug will extend her life by seven years and continue to provide her with a normal childhood. Marla added: 'When people would ask about her condition when she was younger, Kaylee would say \"I'm small and I'm bald\" because to her, apart from her size and hair, she's just like anyone else. 'When we are out we get a few stares but Kaylee always makes jokes about it, it's her way of dealing with things. 'She's just a typical teen she has a lot of friends, loves her social media and dancing, we try not to make her life too much about her having progeria and let her live like a normal 13-years-old.' Last year, Kaylee became a social media superstar after hitting four million followers on Music.ly - a lip-syncing site where users perform 30 second videos to popular songs. Kaylee was diagnosed with progeria when she was just one-year-old after struggling to gain weight (pictured when she was just a few months old) Last year, Kaylee became a social media superstar after hitting four million followers on Music.ly (pictured on stage at an event) Despite her parents fears that she would be criticised for the recordings, the teen found fame and now has fans who travel to meet her in person. Marla said: 'In her videos she lip-syncs for 15-30 seconds and puts her own twist on the songs, it's really big with the kids. WHAT IS PROGERIA? Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, beginning in their first two years of life. The name derives from the Greek word meaning 'prematurely old'. Children with progeria generally appear normal at birth. During the first year, signs and symptoms, such as slow growth and hair loss, begin to appear. Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria. The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 13 years, but some with the disease die younger and some live 20 years or longer. There's no cure for progeria, but ongoing research shows some promise for treatment. Source: Mayo Clinic 'It's really funny, after performing at dance shows she has fans waiting to meet her afterwards, they all know her from Music.ly and want to take pictures with her. 'Initially we were worried that people would be mean and didn't want her to have deal with horrible comments. 'But for every one bad comment there are hundreds of good ones and people coming to her defence. 'Kaylee tells me, 'there are more people in the world who understand, and those who don't, won't stop me from doing what I want to do.' The Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) believe there are 145 children living with the condition in 45 countries, affecting one in 20 million people. Meryl Fink, executive director of the PRF, said: 'It's very often that a dermatologist that will identify the disease first, one of the earliest symptoms is wrinkles of the skin on the abdomen, other indicators can include slower weight gain and growth rate during childhood. 'There are number of benefits for children being diagnosed earlier, they can be eligible to receive the medication - studies show one of the treatments helps keep children's hearts healthier for longer. 'Diagnosis on the information available in different parts of the world, it's a case by case basis, some children are quite lucky and diagnosed early. 'It's a rare disease and world-wide, so we can share with them what we've learned so far and to join the clinical trial.' One of the initial missions of the PRF was to find the cause for the condition, which was successfully discovered in 2003 - now able to identify it through DNA testing they hope to further research and find a cure.
