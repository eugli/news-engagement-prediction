We’ll start what we call skill development soon.” \n(What's next for the Vols? Make sure you're in the loop — take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Vols newsletter now!) Johnson, aside from adding strength and knowledge for the college game, also is gearing up to add weight, Stripling explained as he also noted Johnson’s strong high school program at Miami Southridge. \n“He comes from a championship program, a real stingy defense,” Stripling continued. “He played inside and outside, very versatile. We’re excited about his growth potential. \n“We would like most of our ends to get to about 250, 260. I think Derek (Barnett) was in the 260s most of his career.” \nJohnson wasn’t the only newcomer being touted by Vols’ coaches as UT’s NSD special got underway. Linebackers coach Tommy Thigpen offered some of his first comments on athletic ‘backer Shanon Reid . \n“We looked at him on tape and thought he was the best outside linebacker in the state of Florida,” Thigpen said. “This kid has played linebacker, knows the position, has all the intangibles.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:06:33.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
