Harding 4-star athlete Lynn Bowden . \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \n\"I will go on the record as saying we signed the best player in Ohio, Marrow said on National Signing Day Wednesday. \"Lynn Bowden is the best player in Ohio.\" \nAccording to the industry-average 247Sports Composite, Bowden was ranked the No. 3 prospect in Ohio, behind Miamisburg offensive lineman and Ohio State signee Josh Myers and Toledo Central Catholic defensive tackle and one-time UK commit James Hudson , who signed with Michigan. \nMarrow said Bowden may have been penalized because he didn't sign with the Buckeyes, who may have extended a late scholarship offer. \n\"If you ask 30 reporters who cover Ohio football they all will say he’s the best player in Ohio,\" Marrow said. \"Sometimes when you don’t go to that other school now he may be the second-best player or third-best player. Ohio was very loaded. We got what we wanted out of Ohio from top to bottom.\" \nWhat you can't argue with is Bowden's astronomical numbers: over 3,600 total yards and 55 touchdowns as a senior, which earned him a ranking of 110th overall and the No. 2 athlete in the country according to 247Sports . \nMark Stoops , a fellow native of Youngstown, said not only is Bowden one of the Buckeye State's best this season, but also historically speaking. \n\"As you know, I grew up in the same hometown, and I can't tell you how many people would call and tell me that he's the best football player they've seen come out of that area in a long time,\" Stoops said. \"Lynn is exceptional with the ball in his hands. He's just exceptional. He's just dynamic. He's the type of guy where he changes the digits on the scoreboard, so you want to put the ball in his hands as many times as you can.\" \nBowden, who is rated as a .9307 by the 247Sports Composite, is the fourth-highest rated signee of the Stoops Era and the seventh-highest at Kentucky since 2000. \nSign up now and get 3 months of VIP access to CatsPause.com for the price of 1!
