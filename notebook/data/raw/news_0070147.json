People are not even ready to give us labour. When the police came to our village two days ago, they then gave us these essential commodities but the boycott continued after than,\" Rathod said to reporters at the Ahmedabad district collectorate. \n\nThe dalits in Rantej have been facing a social boycott for more than six days, after they refused to remove a dead cow from the village. The dalit community had decided to not dispose of carcasses when they were made to sit and dine separately at a religious feast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:05:54.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
