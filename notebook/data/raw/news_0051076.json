The Spaniard was furious after the club failed to re-sign winger Andros Townsend in January and, unless owner Mike Ashley makes guarantees over budget and control, there is a danger the manager will quit come the summer. However, it is thought that Ashley is prepared to back Benitez should Newcastle make a swift return to the Premier League - they are two points behind of Championship leaders Brighton but have a game in hand ahead of hosting Aston Villa on Monday night - and scouting plans are already in place. Rafa Benitez looks set to stay as Newcastle manager beyond the end of this season Benitez said: ‘The scouts are analysing big things for the future, watching games and filing reports. ‘There will be future meetings to analyse the market. The difficult thing here is you don’t know if we will be in the Premier League or the Championship, but we are still looking for good players, then we will have some time to see what our targets are.’ Benitez has not spoken to Ashley since January and managing director Lee Charnley remains his point of daily contact. He added: ‘My relationship is always with Lee, he’s the one I talk to. ‘We will have some meetings in the future to talk about what we want to do. We know our squad and that we have to maybe find some balance in some positions. ‘We will start monitoring players just so we know we are ready.’ Benitez says he has a good relationship with Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley (right) RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:48:26.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
