So skipper Virat Kohli decided to have a light moment with some of the boys and what better way to do that than to take them out for breakfast. \nKohli, Hardik Pandya, Lokesh Rahul and Jayant Yadav went out for a nice morning meal in the beautiful city of Hyderabad before getting down to the serious business of playing good old Test cricket. \nIt was a nice way for the boys to relax as they soon will be back on the field. Breakfast with the boys ‚úåüèªGood sunny day in Hyderabad üëåüèªüåû Have a great day all of you üòé ‚Äî Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) February 7, 2017 \nIn that context, Team India coach Anil Kumble said that there would be no release in pressure from the hosts. \nAFP \n\"We would like to look at it as continuation from where we left against England. It's been a good home season so far. We would like to take confidence from that and build on it. We still have few more Test matches after this so, it's important that we take momentum and look at Bangladesh which has done really well against New Zealand in the recent past,\" he said at a press conference. \nHowever, make no mistake, India are not taking the Bangladeshis lightly . Ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is quick to point it out. \nAFP \n‚ÄúBangladesh are a quality side. They have played some fantastic cricket. They are coming from New Zealand. We know playing New Zealand is not easy and they put up some stellar performances against them. They are a side on the rise, so we cannot take them lightly. We have to follow our routines and do the same thing again and again in a Test match scenario because Test cricket can sort you out quickly,\" he said while speaking to bcci.tv Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:56:32.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
