Theirs came hand in hand with basic but cute music videos where there’s a lot of puppy love and dance routines with young girls (think High School Musical more than Miley Cyrus ). It works: The video for their version of Chino y Nacho's “Andas en mi cabeza,” featuring dancing on a boardwalk, has more than 225 million views, and their take on Nicky Jam ’s “Hasta el amanecer” shows them flirting with girls in the park. \nNow, the duo has transitioned to their own material, written together with Iván Troyano. Their first official single, “Tu y yo,” which will be included on the new album, already has close to 80 million views. \nAccording to Sony, Adexe & Nau generate 4.5 million daily views, with as many as 9 million views per day during weekends. Although the brothers are Spanish, they’ve already amassed an international following, with the bulk of their YouTube fans coming from Mexico, Argentina and Spain. The duo already has offers to perform in Spain, Mexico, Argentina and the U.S., plus the possibility of doing Brazil's Rock in Rio next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:28:23.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
