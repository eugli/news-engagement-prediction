And if the latest reports are true, Ainge might even be able to get a good deal.\nAccording to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical , the Celtics could wind up in a buyer’s market, given that there are multiple teams thought to be potentially selling star players. The Chicago Bulls are in the mix to trade forward Jimmy Butler, while the Indiana Pacers are rumored to be shopping forward Paul George. The competing interests could potentially drive the price down, as Wojnarowski describes:\nThere’s no urgency to make a deal for George, unless the Pacers fear the Boston Celtics could ultimately provide Indiana the best possible package of assets in a deal – and think that option could disappear if Boston makes a deal with Chicago for Jimmy Butler.\nWhile there’s just as good a chance that the Pacers decide on a more cautious approach (and keep George), the circumstances are in place for a possible blockbuster deal.", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-pacers-assessing-trade-market-for-paul-george-180740295.html", "http://www.nba.com/2017-trade-deadline"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:38:40.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
