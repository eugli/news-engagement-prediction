Nearly 60 percent of voters, including 30 percent of Democrats, also said that Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch deserves to get a confirmation vote in the Senate.\nTrump said during the press conference that no administration in history has done as much in the short period of time that he has.\n\"I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my Inauguration,\" Trump said. \"I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\"\n  Politics  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:20:02.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
