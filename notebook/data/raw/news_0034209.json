But makeup inspired by fitness? Color us intrigued by the M.A.C. Work It Out Collection, the constantly collaborating makeup brand's latest capsule line in technicolor hues that are incredibly 1980s inspired . (Are you surprised?) In the past few years, the athleisure has proven to be a huge success, acquiring a wide fanbase composed of street style stars, celebs, and normal humans. (Just like us!) Now, the beauty world is getting into getting the athleisure game, with companies like [Tarte] releasing an athleisure-inspired beauty line along with brands devoted to workout-friendly makeup, such as Sweat Cosmetics . Naturally, the trend-setting brand would get in on the trend (and make it their own, obvs), but what we love specifically about the M.A.C. Work It Out collection is how realistic it is: They're not asking you to make yourself up to get all gross in Spin class, but taking the Spin class (or maybe from the Aerobics Channel?) vibe and channeling it into a vibrant makeup collection. You could argue the high-performing color payoff is perhaps inspired by besting you burpee record or doing a few barre reps, though. You May Also Like Makeup These are the Lipsticks in Fifty Shades Darker Worn By Dakota Johnson Within the abundant collection you'll find a wide range of M.A.C. favorite products , but all in brand-new shades. Four new lipsticks include Bi-ceptual, a nude-beigey hue, Relentlessly Red, a matte, pinkish coral, Muscu-linity, a shimmering soft brown, and Testosterone, a dusty rose that could be described as \"your lips but better.\" (You know, the whole no-makeup makeup thing.) And just like a juicy-ass smoothie you'd drink after a sweat session, there are six new shades of Crystal Glaze glosses that are fresh AF, ranging in hue from coral pink to deep violet. And yes, every single product name is as good as these are. (Again, would you expect anything less from M.A.C.?) However, we'd argue the hero product—errr, products—is all of the eye makeup. It's so bright—almost like UD's Full Spectrum palette —with six bold Chromagraphic Pencils and 16 (Yes, 16!) multi-colored mascaras with appropriate names to match. TBH, guys, there are so many shades I don't even know where to start: by name or by hue. There's Muscle Tee, a highly pigmented white, No Pain No Gain, a mermaid-esque bluish green, and Hottie With A Body, interestingly the name for a lime-green hue. If you're feeling a bit scared to bust out these bold shades, go for a tried-and-true color that works on a multitude of eye colors and/or complexions. I've personally always wanted to try a cobalt-blue mascara, so I'll be swiping the Hold For 10 formula on my lashes as soon as the collection hits my desk.
