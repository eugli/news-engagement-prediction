PHOTO | DAILY NATION By MAUREEN KAKAH \nFormer Ethics and Anti-Corruption boss Prof Patrick Lumumba’s legal nightmare over plagiarism allegations have come to an end after his accuser withdrew the suit from court. \nThe turn of events came after lawyer Wachira Maina who had sued PLO for plagiarising his work , agreed to have the matter marked as withdrawn and as one settled amicably. \nApparently, the settlement was reached after PLO accepted to tender his apology to Mr Wachira as per his terms. \nRECALL PLAGIARIZED MATERIAL \nThe court was told that PLO is expected to write by himself or through his lawyer a suitable letter of correction to Mr Maina to have the Kenya School of Law immediately recall and delete the plagiarized material from the Journal titled- From Jurisprudence to Poliprudence: the Kenyan Presidential Election Petition 2013 . \nMr Wachira had sometime last year sued the renown eloquent English speaker but the matter has been settled owing to the consent recorded and presented before court on Tuesday. \n“In further consideration of Mr Wachira foregoing further claims on this matter, the parties have agreed to an amicable settlement,” read the consent.
