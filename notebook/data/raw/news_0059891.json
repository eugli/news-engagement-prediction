You would think that the reasoning behind this move would be fairly straightforward: Republican politicians generally don't prioritize LGBTQ issues; a Republican is president; thus, the White House takes action consistent with that worldview. Like much of what the Trump administration has wrought thus far, the narrative is as transparent as it is grim. \nWhen asked about the rollback during Tuesday's press briefing, though, White House Press Secretary and living embodiment of mumblecore Sean Spicer had a very different explanation prepared. \nhttps://twitter.com/TomNamako/status/834119002024718338 \nThat's an issue that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are addressing. I would tell you that—and I think that there will be further guidance from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order but the case that's in front of the Supreme Court—the president has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue, and not one for the federal government. So while there will be further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president's view has been for a long time, that this is not something the federal government should be involved in, this is a states' rights issue. \nSpicer is right (get the man a medal!) that President Trump has made this argument before—in May, he promised that he would repeal the Obama directive if elected president. He also said that he believed that the law should still \"protect everybody,\" which is a logical pretzel that presumably turned the interviewer into a real-life thinking-face emoji for a moment, but still, consistency is good, I guess. \nThe story here, though, is what underlies the esoteric-sounding \"states' rights\" rationale that the administration trotted out to justify this maneuver. States do have rights, of course—in fact, under the Tenth Amendment , they have a lot of them—and there is plenty of lively debate about the scope of these \"reserved powers.\" But in politics, the phrase is often deployed not to debate principles of constitutional law, but instead to justify truncating, on a state-by-state basis, the ability of those subject to discrimination to seek legal recourse. It has been invoked in favor curtailing abortion rights and limiting same-sex marriage , and in the not-so-distant past, the phrase served as a dog whistle for those who virulently (and violently) opposed desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement. EDITOR’S PICK Why Trump Supporters Love Calling People \"Snowflakes\" \nEnforcement of President Obama's directive has been on hold since a successful legal challenge last year, and the Trump administration's Department of Justice officially bowed out of the case earlier this month, so the real-world impact of Tuesday's announcement will be minimal. Still, it comes as a slap in the face to advocates who hoped that the President's LGBTQ-friendly leanings might mean that victories won under President Obama would survive a Republican administration. The \"states' rights\" justification neatly sanitizes the issue by transforming it from a question of substance to one of procedure, permitting those who assert it to wash their hands of their responsibility to protect minority groups from the whims of public opinion. In other words: If people want to discriminate based on race or gender or sexual orientation or anything else, well, that's just the way it goes in a democracy, folks. Politics! \nIn this context, shrugging and punting to the states is a lazy and perfunctory policy argument at best, and a disingenuous abdication of duty at worst. When states—by neglect or design—fail to get the job done, it's the federal government's role to enforce anti-discrimination laws, protect individual rights, and prevent the patchwork, invidious withholding of legal protections from discrete minority groups. If the Trump administration wants to put an end to protecting its LGBTQ constituents, it should be honest about its rationale for doing so: Because it just doesn't care about the issue. Glibly dressing up prejudice in the guise of an academic argument like this, though, is the coward's way out.
