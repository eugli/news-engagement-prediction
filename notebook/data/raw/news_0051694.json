What is contract cheating? \nT he Quality Assurance Agency, the universities regulator, is consulting with the government and is pushing for new laws. \nA spokeswoman for DfE said the Government was open to all proposals, adding that a change in the law was something that could be considered in the future. \n“It is certainly something that could be in the guidance, we are not ruling out a change in legislation down the line” she added. \nThe new guidance is due to be implemented in September, in order to coincide with the beginning of the next academic year. \nThe planned crackdown follows The Daily Telegraph’s investigation last month, revealing that more than 20,000 students were buying pre-written essays and dissertations from the internet. Essay mill websites threaten to undermine the high quality reputation of a UK degree so it is vital that the sector work together to address this in a consistent and robust way. Jo Johnson, Universities Minister \nP aying up to £6,750 for a PhD dissertation, the number of students using essay mill sites has skyrocketed over the last five years, with the Quality Assurance Agency, the university regulator, confirming that more than 100 online essay services are now in operation. \nWhilst universities already use complex anti-plagiarism software to detect the copying of academic texts, the process of contract cheating - students submitting paid-for essays as their own original work - means that examiners and markers are powerless to prevent foul play. Universities Minister Jo Johnson Credit: REX \nC ommenting on the announcement, Universities Minister Jo Johnson warned that any student caught purchasing and submitting bespoke essays risked seriously damaging their future career prospects. \n“This form of cheating is unacceptable and every university should have strong policies and sanctions in place to detect and deal with it,” he added. \n“Essay mill websites threaten to undermine the high quality reputation of a UK degree so it is vital that the sector work together to address this in a consistent and robust way.” \nThe QAA, which is consulting with the Government on the proposals, suggests that new criminal offences could be introduced to combat the practice, including an offence of “aiding or enabling for financial gain individuals to commit acts of academic dishonesty”. \nCommenting, QAA director Ian Kimber said that new guidelines would help deter the growing number of students using essay mills, adding that the industry posed a “major challenge” to British universities. \nSpeaking to The Telegraph, Lord Storey, who is leading efforts to make the practice illegal, said that the consequences of plagiarism must be made clear, adding that many “rich students” are now effectively “paying their way” to a top honours degree. \nHe pointed out that in New Zealand, where essay mills are illegal, there had been a considerable reduction in contract cheating. \n“That’s what we need to push for - so that students know that if they buy essays they will be breaking the law,” he added. Essay mills \nL eading academics are also in favour of a ban, with Professor Phil Newton and Michael Draper, leading experts on essay plagiarism, calling on the Government to tighten up the legal loopholes being exploited by professional writing services. \nIn their new paper on the industry, entitled “Are Essay Mills committing fraud?” Prof Newton and Mr Draper propose making amendments to the Fraud Act 2006 and the Trading Regulations Act 2008, in order to make it easier for universities to challenge essay mills in court. \nThe authors also recommend that a new criminal offence be created which “specifically targets the undesirable behaviours” of essay-writing services, adding that current legislation makes it “extremely difficult” to bring successful legal action against the companies. \nDame Julia Goodfellow, President of Universities UK, welcomed the announcement, adding that new guidelines would build on the efforts already taken by universities to combat contract cheating.
