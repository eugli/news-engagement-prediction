'The investigation began after cash in different currency denominations totalling some €39,000 (£35,280) was discovered in a suitcase which had been checked on an early morning flight to Seville.' The Ryanair air steward has not been named - and has been identified only by his initials M.B.A. Inquiries revealed he had allegedly used a key to the safe to take the money after accessing an office using his security code The statement added: 'When officers asked the owner of the case to justify where the money came from, he finally answered he worked for an airline and the money came from a safe belonging to his company. 'Civil Guard investigators subsequently discovered that he had turned up at the airport hours earlier in uniform and accessed the airline offices using a security code before opening the safe with a key he had access to and taking the money.' A source added: 'We believe he deliberately took the money in the early hours of the morning and picked an early morning flight to try to leave the island so he could attempt to be thousands of miles away from the Canaries on the Spanish mainland by the time the theft was discovered.'
