From North Texas February 10, 2017 10:23 PM By Andrea Lucia \nFollow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nCELINA (CBS11) – After 20 years in the U.S. Air Force, Senior Master Sgt. Edward Medina came home to Celina on Friday. \nHis neighbors were there, lining the street to welcome him. \nChildren riding their bikes and a Prosper ISD police car escorted him the last two blocks. \n“I was like, this isn’t for me. That’s really what I thought,” he said. \nIt quickly sank in as people began walking to his car window to shake his hand. \n“Thank you for your service,” they told him. \n“Thank you so much,” Medina replied, holding back a tear. \nAfter numerous deployment overseas and throughout the Middle East, Medina is retiring. \n“I wanted it to be special,” said his wife, Sherri. \nShe texted a neighbor about his homecoming. \n“Do you think the neighbors would mind if I decorated the front yard? Put up some flags?” she recalled asking. \nNeither of them expected to find a crowd. \n“My emotions were going all over the place,” he said. \nStationed in Germany for four years, Medina has only spent weeks at a time with his wife. \n“I mean, we’ve been married a year and a half. And we were waiting for this day, and it’s here,” she said. \nMedina is still grappling with the end of his military career. \n“It’s still not an easy thing to accept, but to come home to a reception like this, puts it all into perspective… that what I do is for all of them,” said Medina. \nHe doesn’t want anyone to forget those still serving or those who’ll never get their happy homecoming. \n“If we can keep them in our thoughts and prayers,” he asked. \nWith his wife due this April, he’s ready to enjoy a well-earned retirement. \n“My priority is my little baby Dakota,” he said. \nSgt. Medina will be serving as a stay at home dad. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.)
