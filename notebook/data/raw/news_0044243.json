I want to love. I want to enjoy life.” \nOf his mother’s struggles, Cassidy recalled: “In the end, the only way I knew she recognized me is with one single tear that would drop from her eye every time I walked into the room. … I feared I would end up that way.” \nCassidy has had numerous personal problems in the decades following his initial success, ranging from substance abuse to bankruptcy. He's the stepson of actress and fellow Partridge Family star Shirley Jones. \nThe interview was published just hours after alarming footage emerged of Cassidy slurring his speech and struggling to stay on his feet during a concert in California. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:12:15.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
