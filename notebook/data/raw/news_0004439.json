The government says it's coming, and soon.\n“The introduction should be within a couple of weeks and within the coming months, it will be law,” says Doucet.\nThe text of the new legislation has yet to be released, but the government says it will require motorists to allow for at least a metre of space when passing a cyclist.\nCyclists say similar laws are working well in other provinces.\n“It's important that motorists know that before they pass that cyclist, they have to give them a metre of space. Now, if a vehicle is coming the other way they may try to squeeze through there, but in the future they may hesitate and wait five or ten seconds before they pass that cyclist, that's important,” says Wayne Arrowsmith, of the Saint John Cycling Club.\nMany say accidents could also be reduced if roads were designed with built-in room for bikes.\n“If city planners could allow some space when they're building a new road for the cyclists and for pedestrians to walk on,” says Becky Consolvo, bike shop owner.\nEven though the new law will come too late for one promising cyclist, supporters say progress is finally being made.\n“I think the important thing is they're moving on it now and recognizing the importance of putting it into legislation and acting on it,” says Arrowsmith.\nAlong with the legislation, the government will roll out a public education program to convince motorists of the need to share the road with cyclists.\n  Mike Cameron \nPhotos The New Brunswick government is moving ahead with a new cycling safety law, promising to introduce legislation this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:38:33.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
