It’s going to be very significant. It’s going to be focused on middle class tax cuts and making the business tax more competitive with the rest of the world.” \nMost corporations pay a federal tax rate of 35%, highest among advanced economies. Pres. Trump has proposed reducing the rate to 15%. Mnuchin said the high rate “is some of the reason companies are leaving and cash is sitting offshore.” \nMnuchin said the administration is “working closely with leaders in the House and Senate” and is looking to have a plan passed by Congress’s August recess. He would not say when any tax cuts would take effect or whether they could be retroactive. \nWhile he said the cuts would be integral to achieving the administration’s goal of at least 3% economic growth, a level called “very achievable.” The economy has been growing about 2% a year since the recession ended in June 2009. \nBut he added, “I think it’s going to take time to get (to a 3% growth pace), more toward the end of next year.” \nFor wealthy households, Mnuchin said the tax cuts being “offset with reductions of deductions and other things.” \nThe Treasury secretary said cutting back regulations would be the other major initiative in the campaign to improve economic growth. \n“We need to cut back regulations that have prevented small and midsize businesses from being the engines of growth in this country and were also focused on banks and making sure banks can lend.” \nAsked about a proposed border adjustment tax on imports, Mnuchin said, “we are looking at it. We think there are some very interesting aspects of it. We think there are some concerns with it.” \nWhile many US manufacturers support such attacks, retailers vigorously oppose it, fearing it will raise prices for consumers and hammer their profits. \nAddressing the record market rally since Trump was elected, Mnuchin said he thinks he represents justifiable market confidence in the ministrations progrowth policies. \n“There’s a lot of confidence in the Trump administration and in the desire to be invested in the US,” he said. “This is a mark to market business and you see what the market thinks.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mbPaui NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.
