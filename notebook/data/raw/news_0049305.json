One will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to start rewriting the 2015 regulation that limits greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric utilities. It also instructs the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management to lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, the Post says. A second order will instruct the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to revamp a 2015 rule that applies to 60% of the water bodies in the country.\nAlso read: Where Trump’s early flurry of executive orders ranks .\nMcCain as Trump “critic in chief”: President Trump said at his recent news conference that his administration is operating like a “fine-tuned machine.” Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, believes otherwise. “In many respects, this administration is in disarray, and they’ve got a lot of work to do,” says McCain in a New York Times article about his criticism of the Trump White House.

David Perdue, a Georgia Republican. The proposal is facing mounting opposition from business groups and many GOP lawmakers worried that consumers will be hit with higher prices for goods. Supporters say it would boost U.S. manufacturing.\nBudget hit list: Also in the New York Times, the White House budget office has drafted a hit list of programs that Trump could eliminate to trim domestic spending, including longstanding conservative targets like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities.\nMore from MarketWatch Why the ‘next leg in the oil bull market’ is coming soon At Trump Presser, a Tale of Two Realities Who Is Trump's White House Adviser Stephen Miller?
