February 24, 2017 by Emmy Griffiths Howard's End will air on BBC, and it already being compared to the hit show Downton Abbey Leave a comment \nThe BBC has announced plans to adapt the E.M. Forster novel Howards End into a four-episode miniseries! The drama will have an all-star cast, including Agent Carter actress Hayley Atwell, who will play Margaret Schlegel, and Pride and Prejudice ' s very own Mr Darcy Matthew Mcfadyen as Henry Wilcox. \nThe show will likely draw comparisons with period drama Downton Abbey ; both focus on class divisions in England at the turn-of-the-century. Like Downton, which followed the lives of both upper and working class life in the early 19th century, Howards End follows three families; the working class Basts, the wealthy Wilcoxes and the intelligent Schlegel sisters, and explores how their lives differ as a result of their social status. The adaptation has been written by the Manchester by the Sea screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan, and a BBC executive producer spoke about having the BAFTA-award winning writer involved in the project. They said: \"Kenneth Lonergan is one of our truly great contemporary voices, and his adaptation of this adored timeless classic will surprise and delight a whole new audience with its timely and relevant themes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:14:25.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
