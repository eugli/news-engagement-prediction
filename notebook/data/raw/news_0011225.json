In 2014, responding to criticism that it was lax in protecting minors from sexual exploitation, Japan revised the law to ban possession of child pornography. \nMedia, citing a police statement, said the victims were aged 4 to 13 and more than 100,000 files of child pornography were found on the arrested men's computers. \nThe arrested men were aged 20 to 66. \nSome worked as volunteers at camps for elementary and middle school children, and some were elementary school teachers, media reported, adding that the suspects exchanged pornographic images directly, not over the internet, to avoid being detected. \nPolice said they could not immediately comment on the reports. \nThe number of victims of child pornography rose to a record 781 in the first half of last year, compared with 384 in the same period the previous year, according to police data. \n(Reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Robert Birsel) Next In World News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:12:51.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
