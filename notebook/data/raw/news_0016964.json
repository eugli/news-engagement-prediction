She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The dispatch was soon retweeted by the official @POTUS Twitter account.\nOther retailers to drop the brand include Neiman Marcus, Belk, Jet and ShopStyle, amid a widespread #GrabYourWallet campaign to boycott businesses the Trump family profits from.\nMr Trump’s tweet has sparked outrage, with many observers saying it represents a conflict of interest.\n“(It’s) unprecedented for a number of reasons,” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics spokesman Jordan Libowitz told New York Daily News .\n“It’s pretty rare for the president to use the power of the presidency to go after a company. And to do so on behalf of his family’s business interests is certainly something we’ve never seen before.\n“This is a weapon he could be wielding to benefit his family … It plays into this larger narrative where people have to wonder, when he’s making decisions in the office of the President, are they being made with the American people’s best interests in mind or with the Trump family’s bottom line in mind?”\nThis is something a father would say.

Picture: AFP/Getty/Drew Angerer Ms Trump is also said to be helping smooth her father’s fractured relationship with China, with The National Post reporting officials are skipping the state department and going straight to her to gain influence with the US president.\nHer visit to the Chinese embassy to mark New Year’s with her daughter Arabella last week helped balance her father’s “harsh posture” and the appearance “could be invigorating to the China-US relationship,” according to nationalist paper, The Global Times .\nFootage of Arabella, five, singing a Chinese New Year greeting in Mandarin has also gone viral in China. The New York Times reported that more than 60,000 people liked the song on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.\nArabella singing a song she learned for #ChineseNewYear.
