It also prevents all refugees from entering the US for 120 days. \nIndeed, the YouGov poll found that 50 per cent of British adults thought that Trump's immigration ban was a bad idea, compared to 29 per cent who said it was be a good idea.

Both petitions will now be debated in the Commons. Men are more likely to be in favour of Trump's state visit than women \nWithin the headline figure of 49 per cent there were some key splits among the population. \nMen were more in favour of Donald Trump coming to the UK than women were, with three in five men saying they thought the state visit should proceed - among women the figure was two in five. \nA ge was also a defining factor in how many people supported Trump's proposed visit, with more support for it the older the respondents were. \nAnother obvious split concerned how respondents had voted in the EU referendum last June. As many as 68 per cent of Leave voters thought Trump's state visit should go ahead, while there was half as much support among those on the Remain side. \nYouGov's survey was carried out online on January 30-31. Questions on Trump's state visit and whether Trump's executive order was a good idea covered 1,705 respondents while the question on whether a similar immigration policy should be introduced in the UK had 6,926 respondents.
