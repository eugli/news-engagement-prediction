I am really excited about this venture and I think it will be good preparation for the IPL. That is why I signed for it,\" Yusuf, who plays for KKR in the IPL, told PTI. \nTim Cutler, chief executive of Cricket Hong Hong, too thanked the BCCI for permitting him to play in the league. \n\"This is amazing news and we are very appreciative of the BCCI in granting this NOC,\" he said. \n\"This will go a long way to help the development of the sport in the region and with even more stars still to be announced this is shaping up to be a superb tournament that will be enjoyed by millions across the world,\" Cutler added. \nPathan was signed by Kowloon Cantons for the tournament's second edition. His team has also got on board the likes of Pakistan's Shahid Afridi and England pacer Tymal Mills, who was part of the recent series against India.
