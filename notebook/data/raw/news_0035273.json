Smallcap and midcap funds on an average gave 40 per cent and 35 per cent returns to investors, respectively, between February 14, 2016 and February 14, 2017, whereas largecap funds advanced about 28 per cent. \n\nSelect funds from the midcap and smallcap categories advanced up to 50 per cent during this period. For instance, the net asset value (NAV) of Tata Equity PE Fund and L&T Emerging Business Fund jumped 50 per cent in last one year. \n\nAmong others, DSPBR Micro Cap Fund surged 48.42 per cent, followed by Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund (up 48 per cent), Principal Emerging Bluechip Fund (up 47.94 per cent), Birla Sun Life Small & Midcap Fund (47.88 per cent), DSBR Small and Mid Cap Fund (up 47.71 per cent), Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund (up 46.96 per cent) and Kotak Emerging Equity Scheme (up 46.15 per cent). \n\nAmong the top grossers, Tata Equity PE Fund provides capital appreciation by investing 70 per cent of the total assets in stocks having trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios less than that of the BSE Sensex. \n\nThese funds have given highest weightage to the energy sector (25.40 per cent), followed by financials (20 per cent), technology (8.52 per cent) and services (7.53 per cent). \n\nStocks such as Power Grid , YES Bank , GAIL , Coal India , Muthoot Finance , Finolex Cables , HCL Technologies , KNR Constructions , Grasim Industries and Power Finance Corporation are some of the top stocks in this fund. \n\nL&T Emerging Business Fund has highest exposure to the construction sector (13.34 per cent), followed by financials (13.18 per cent), chemicals (13.06 per cent) and services (9.66 per cent). \n\nThe fund holds stocks like Indian Bank, Swaraj Engines , Sterlite Technologies , Aarti Industries , The Ramco Cement, Coromandel International , Carborundum Universal , Supreme Petrochem , Future Lifestyle Fashion and Dalmia Bharat. \n\n“Most midcap and small companies derive a large part of their revenues from the domestic market and have relatively lower global exposure. As a result, they are more levered to the India growth story and less impacted by the global macroeconomic slowdown,” said Pankaj Tibrewal, Fund Manager, Equity, Kotak Mutual Fund . \n\nAlso, many of these companies are well placed to benefit from the shift towards organised sector on the back of demonetisation and GST. There are a good number of stocks in our investable universe, which meet our investment philosophy of having a competitive advantage, predictable earnings and are trading at attractive valuations,” Tibrewal said. \n\nBrokerage Sharekhan is positive on funds such as DSP BlackRock Micro Cap Fund, Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund, Reliance Small Cap Fund, Kotak Emerging Equity Scheme and Franklin India Smaller Companies Fund. \n\nDomestic equity benchmark BSE Sensex gained nearly 20 per cent in the year till February 2017, whereas the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gained 34.11 per cent and 34.29 per cent, respectively, in this period.
