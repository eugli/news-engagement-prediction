Bystanders Rescue Little Boy from Drowning UP NEXT VIDEO Bystanders Rescue Little Boy from Drowning \nFootage shows the young boy frolicking in the shallows of the ocean as his grandfather watched on but what was meant to be a fun holiday swim so nearly ended in disaster. \nAs the tide made its way back out to sea, so too did the boy, sending onlookers into an immediate frenzy. \nHalf a dozen bystanders rushed to his aid as the boy was sucked out further and slammed under a wave. We might have a problem here. Source: Junkin Media I'm going to need a bit of a hand here guys. Source: Junkin Media Bystanders rushed to the boy's aid as he was sucked under crashing waves. Source: Junkin Media \nThe crashing waves sent several of his would-be rescuers under the waves before one man was able to get his hands on the boy moments before another wave threatened to swallow him. \nThose who viewed the raw footage on LiveLeak criticised the family for letting the infant swim in such dangerous waters. \n“Those aren't conditions that you allow a little kid to wade into, they're lucky he's still alive.” \n“Excellent parenting,” another wrote. While his rescuers pulled him from the fast moving tide, his grandfather (far right) had issues of his own.
