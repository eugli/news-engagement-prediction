Working with Jenner on her memoir is Vanity Fair journalist, Buzz Bissinger, who helped introduced Jenner to the world with her cover in 2015. Story continues below \nJenner, 67, is a decorated Olympic athlete and reality star. In the video, we’re introduced to the upcoming memoir with a quote from Jenner herself: “Imagine denying your core and soul. Then add to it the most impossible expectations that people have for you because you are the personification of The American Male Athlete.” This is followed by another quote, setting the tone for the memoir: “After a lifetime of secrets…and a long personal struggle…Caitlyn Jenner is finally learning to live as her true self.” \nRELATED: Caitlyn Jenner teases new memoir ‘The Secrets Of My Life,’ Announces release date \nIn the video, we see Jenner go through several different looks for the book.
