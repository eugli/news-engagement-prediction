Additionally, an ACA repeal could mean a return to the days when women paid more than men for the same insurance plan because of possible pregnancy or other conditions unique to women. \nPro-Choice demonstrators counter Pro-Life rally at Planned Parenthood in Kent, Wash on Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017. Media: MediaOS Video \nA recent article in Rewire reported that Washington is one of the most vulnerable states in the face of a Planned Parenthood slashing -- it is the sixth-most reliant state on federal money as a percentage of revenue, behind other progressive states such as California and Oregon. \nKing County Councilwoman Jeanne Kohl-Welles recalled her time in the state Senate, fighting constant threats to Planned Parenthood funding on the state level. \n\"What in the world is happening?\" she opined at Wednesday's press conference. \"Why do we have to keep fighting these fights?\" Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:20:57.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
