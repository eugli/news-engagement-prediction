A similar one was found on an electrical box in Washington, D.C.\nOne message said, \"Jackie shot JFK.\" Another mentioned the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. And one said \"blood test is a lie\" and \"get second opinion\" for leukemia, cancer and HIV .\nSgt. Anna Rose, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police, said the messages ranged from about the size of the palm of a hand to a football.\nThe incidents likely occurred between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday, officials said.\n\"We understand that there was quite a crowd here Saturday night who may have seen something,\" Sgt. Anna Rose, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police, said at the news conference.\nIn 2013, a Chinese woman, Jiamei Tian was accused of splashing green paint on several D.C. landmarks, including the Washington National Cathedral. The case was dismissed in 2015 after a judge determined that she was incompetent to stand trial.\n N.Y. commuters remove swastikas from subway car Trump denounces bigotry, anti-Semitism in African-American museum tour Vandals overturn Jewish headstones at Missouri cemetery", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/upi", "http://wtop.com/dc/2017/02/nps-3-national-monuments-d-c-vandalized/slide/1/", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.instagram.com/upi/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/udkNi-7K2FQ", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/three-dc-monuments-damaged-with-graffiti-over-holiday-weekend/2017/02/21/2f01610a-f842-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.03ec7d6aefd7"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:24:38.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
