Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images News By Tom Murse Updated November 28, 2015 . \nThere have been 18 government shutdowns in modern U.S. history. There were six shutdowns ranging from eight to 17 days in the late 1970s, but the duration of government shutdowns shrank dramatically beginning in the 1980s. \nAnd then there was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history in late 1995, lasting three weeks and sending hundreds of thousands of government workers home without paychecks. \nThere has been only one government shutdown since then. The most recent government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2013, when some members of the 113th Congress refused to support the continued funding over federal government operations unless parts of the Obamacare healthcare reform law were reversed or delayed. That shutdown last 16 days. More Recent Government Shutdowns \nThe most recent government shutdowns before 2013 came in the 1996 fiscal year, during President Bill Clinton's administration. The first government shutdown of the Clinton administration lasted five full days from Nov. 13 through Nov. 19, 1995, according to the Congressional Research Service. Some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed during that shutdown. The second government shutdown was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. It lasted 21 full days from Dec. 15, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996. Some 284,000 government workers were furloughed and another 475,000 worked without pay, according to the Congressional Research Service.
