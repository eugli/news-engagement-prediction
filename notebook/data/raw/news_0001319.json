Share Get daily   \nA cannabis-smoker dad \"could have killed\" his three-year-old son when he fell asleep while driving on a motorway and ploughed into a van. \nBrett Perry-Hunt, 26, had smoked cannabis the night before driving and kept dozing off when he set off on the return leg of a 600-mile round trip to Dorset \nHe may never walk again and might need to have a leg amputated after crashing into the rear of the Ford Transit on a slip road between Junctions 37 and 36 near Goole, Hull Crown Court heard. \nA cannabis grinder was found in his van after the crash on November 13, 2015. \nHis son, who suffered a broken arm, was strapped into a child seat, which may have saved him from more serious injury. \nPerry-Hunt was driving a hired Iveco van and had travelled from Dorset to help a friend move house in Hull. He had earlier collided with the central reservation as he dangerously overtook other vehicles. \nOne witness said it was raining, but Perry-Hunt's wipers were not on, said Hannah Walker, prosecuting.

One had got out and was knocked over, the Hull Daily Mail reported. \nThe other blacked out briefly after the impact, but both men were lucky to escape serious injury. \nPerry-Hunt, of Sturminster Newton, Dorset, was in a coma for three weeks. Police then spoke to him in hospital. \n\"From that time he has not disputed he was entirely responsible for this collision,\" said Roderick Blain, defending. \nHe said his recollection of the crash was \"nonexistent\". \nPerry-Hunt admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum sentence of five years. \nHe attended court in a wheelchair, and sobbed as he was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for two years. Hull Crown Court (Photo: Google Streetview) \nJudge Jeremy Richardson QC, told him: \"Your conduct was shocking in every dimension. \n\"The driving was appalling and the person most seriously injured, apart from yourself, by the crash that you caused was your son. \n\"He was three years old and you could have killed him. \n\"Your injuries, however, are demonstrably grievous â€“ you are sitting here in a court in a wheelchair with all manner of orthopaedic devices about your legs. \n\"I have read the medical report. Your injuries are life-changing. There is a real risk that your leg will have to be amputated. \n\"The punishment he inflicted upon himself is far greater than any punishment I can inflict upon him.\" \nPerry-Hunt was banned from driving for five years and must taken an extended test before he can drive again. \nBut the court heard his prospects of being able to drive were \"remote in the extreme\".
