Before you even consider using your hand, before you consider an act of violence, have you checked box number one? Keysar Trad said beating women as “step three” in a process of dealing with issues in relationships. Source: Supplied \n“Maybe next time you should bring her a bunch of flowers, maybe next time you should bring her a box of chocolates, maybe next time you should take her out to dinner. \nMr Trad argued that what the text was saying was that “a good person would never get to that step because the first step would eliminate the problem”. \n“When you sit down and talk about it and say I’ve become angry about something, I go to my wife and say what happens, I say I’m sorry I was wrong, I made the wrong assumption, so you never get to step three,” he said. \n“This is the psychology.” \nMr Bolt interjected: “And then beat her. If you still don’t see sense, beat her. That’s what that says. I’m reading the Koran.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:51:08.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
