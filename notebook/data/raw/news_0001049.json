As well as football and the Olympics, the proposals could also apply to teams playing cricket, hockey and rugby. The hushed plan emerged in a document drawn up by a European Parliament’s committee on culture and education, titled ‘an integrated approach to sport policy’. In a highly controversial move, eurocrats have demanded that the EU’s gold and blue flag should be given equal billing by member states at major sporting events Olympians would be forced to wear it on their Team GB shirts and it could surround the dragon on the Welsh shirt. Pictured is Jessica Ennis-Hill, left, and Gareth Bale, right The report encourages national sports bodies to ‘use the EU flag and symbol, together with individual flags and national symbols’ during sporting events in which member states are involved. It adds that major sports events ‘provide a great opportunity for organised sports to promote positive values’ and as a ‘driver for tourism and local businesses’. The report was overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament yesterday and will be passed to the EU’s executive arm to consider drawing the requirement into legislation. Under the proposals, the Union Jack on the British Olympic team’s next kit would be joined by the EU emblem Conservative MEP Emma McClarkin dismissed the plan as ‘another example of the EU wrapping bad ideas up in an attractive banner and expecting us to turn a blind eye’. Miss McClarkin said that her party colleagues would vote against the measure, which was proposed by left-wing political groups in the chamber. ‘Once again the EU is trying to impose an artificial European identity on people by straying into an area in which it simply has no role,’ she said, ‘Sports teams are part of a country’s identity and it is not just the British who see no place for the EU emblem on their footballers and athletes. ‘This daft idea first raised its head six years ago. We opposed it then and we will oppose it now.’ The EU was granted powers to make rules and recommendations in the field of sport under the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. A similar plan was floated by a European Parliament committee in 2011 and included a concession that member states should be allowed to make the final decision after an outcry. It was eventually decided however not to implement the recommendation. Official EU documents describe the flag as symbolising both the ‘European Union and, more broadly, the identity and unity of Europe’. The flag, officially adopted by the EU in 1985, is made up of 12 gold stars on a blue background that are said to stand for ‘the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe’.
