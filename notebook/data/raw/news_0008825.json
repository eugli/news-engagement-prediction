Miller - The Washington Times   \nIn response to recent provocations by Iran, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said Wednesday that the U.S. was putting the country “on notice” that its actions would not be ignored. \n“As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,” he said at the White House daily press briefing. \nHe did not specify what action the U.S. might take in retaliation, but he said that the U.S. would not allow Iran to continue to be a destabilizing influence in the Middle East or around the globe. \nMr. Flynn said that the Trump administration was changing course after what he described as “weak and ineffective” policies toward Iran, which he said had emboldened a country that is the world’s largest state-sponsor of terrorism. \nThe U.S. previously condemned a Iran missile test Tuesday as provocative and irresponsible. \nHouthi militants banked by Iran also attack a Saudi Arabian ship Monday with anti-ship missiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T21:32:53.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
