I no-longer work at POPSUGAR so I just happened to see your comment when looking at my article (originally posted as a slideshow) again. I used Sprout 6 from YOLO Colorhouse for the pink paint. There's a link to it in the article. Since it isn't available at most stores I ordered it through Amazon Prime and paid less than the stores with free shipping (I repainted the whole house so this saved me on carrying 30 gallons of paint all over the place). For the white chalkboard paint I purchased a half gallon of oops YOLO paint from an eco paint store in Berkeley that sells YOLO (so I could see colors in person). Their oops paint was cheaper, but the galloons were too expensive and would have taken longer to order than my Amazon route. The window treatments are Shabby Chic from Target, and the butterfly curtain rods are also from Target. keek81 3 years I am obsessed with this room! Can you tell me what color paint you used and where you got the window valances? Also, did you find that the twin comforter worked with the toddler bed?
