Photo: AP \n\"When you're the biggest player in town you need to recognise you need to leave something on the table for the other party.\" \nMr Trump campaigned on a promise to seek a better deal for the US in international trade and defence, taking up the nationalistic \"America First\" message in his inaugural address. \nMr Hockey compared disagreement between the two leaders over the asylum seeker resettlement deal with an occasional fight between siblings, without lasting consequences. \nHe said the group held by Australia on Manus Island and Nauru were \"economic refugees\". \nHe said Mr Trump wouldn't seek to renegotiate the Australia-US free trade agreement, signed in 2005, praising his grasp of international commerce just weeks into his first term. \nMr Trump called the Obama-era plan a \"dumb deal\" and described his call with Mr Turnbull was the worst of his early days in office . \nMr Hockey said Australia was disappointed the US had withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, but was \"cheering on the President reducing the cost of the Joint Strike Fighter\" project as Australian Defence Force personnel are currently stationed in 31 US states.
