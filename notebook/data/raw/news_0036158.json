Renganathan said they would release a statement to the media today on the donations received. \nHe said this when asked yesterday if the trustees would conduct a counting of Thaipusam donations as practised by the Penang Hindu Endowment Board (PHEB) and make public the total collection received. \nThe Chettiars have been holding the chariot procession for 163 years, initially using a wooden chariot before the silver one was introduced. \nFor the first time this year, there were two chariot processions – the silver one by the Chettiars and golden chariot by the PHEB whose chairman Dr P. Ramasamy had urged the Chettiars to make public the donations received. \nDr Ramasamy, who is also Penang Deputy Chief Minister II, said the board would announce on Monday the total donations it received from the golden chariot procession and Sri Balathandayuthpani Hilltop Murugan Temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga which it manages. \nHe was speaking yesterday after the counting of the donations in a room on Level Five of Komtar here which took more than eight hours. \nAmong the donations received were 120.85gm in gold jewellery. \nDr Ramasamy said the board was confident of topping last year’s collection of about RM200,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:13:08.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
