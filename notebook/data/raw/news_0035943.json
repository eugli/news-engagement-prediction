No more alone.\" \nSanchez's future at the Emirates remains in doubt with just over 12 months left on his current deal at the club. \nIt is believed that there is a new offer on the table, but Sanchez is holding out for club record wages of over £200,000-a-week. \nSanchez could feature for Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth round tie against Sutton United on Monday night, despite having flown to Barcelona on Thursday. \nManager Arsene Wenger has confirmed he has travelled to Catalonia for a court case over tax fraud allegations. \nIt is claimed that Sanchez failed to pay tax on £888,246 in a period between 2012 and 2013 - an allegation which the Chile international denies. \nHe is set to return to training on Saturday and could be involved in Monday's game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:18:32.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
