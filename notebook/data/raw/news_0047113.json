The pub is situated in the new Weyerhaeuser Building, overlooking Occidental Park. “We have a CSCH to the right on 1st and Cherry and to the left on 1st and King, so I knew we couldn’t just put another Cherry Street in the middle. The location was a perfect opportunity to do something new and fresh, creating a new tier to the Cherry Street brand,” said Laila Ghambari, the company’s director of coffee and daughter of co-owner Ali Ghambari. So the company went a different direction. “We are excited to be opening up this new concept and flagship in Pioneer Square where Cherry Street first started 20 years ago.” Not only is there beer and wine — this is a “public house” after all — but several of the dishes reflect the Ghambari family’s Persian roots: Persian stews, gyros, and falafel. Ghambari says to expect some of the menu, overseen by chef Noah Gough, to change throughout the year to reflect seasonal items. There’s also a weekend brunch and, starting March 3, a happy hour and slightly later operating hours. Here’s a look at the breakfast, lunch, and coffee menu: Cherry Street Public House/FB Laila Ghambari herself is a bit of a local coffee legend, having been named the 2014 United States Barista Champion. She says her world travels have influenced the offerings at the public house, “from the European bathrooms to the Australian-style food service and Italian cafe wares and the emphasis on the origins of the coffee we serve.” 210 Occidental Avenue S, (206) 387-4523, website .
