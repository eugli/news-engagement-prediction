PLUS: United are yet to offer a new deal to midfielder Ander Herrera while Wayne Rooney is set to return to action Share Comments By Aaron Flanagan 07:59, 9 FEB 2017 Sport Mourinho could commit his long-term future to United (Photo: Matthew Peters) Share Comments Get Manchester United FC Manchester United are already looking to extend Jose Mourinho's contract as manager, according to The Sun.\nThe Special One is reportedly set to sit down with United chiefs at the end of the season to discuss as 12-month contract extension to his current three-year deal.\nBosses are said to be suitably impressed with the impact that has been made by Mourinho, despite still sitting outside of the top four.\nThey believe that he is the man, given time, to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.\nReports suggest that on top of the extended year, there could be the option for a further 12 months, meaning Mourinho could be tied to the club until 2022.\nMourinho's current contract is worth £12million-per-year.\nHerrera contract talks yet to be opened Herrera (right) is yet to open talks for a new contract (Photo: Plumb Images) Manchester United are yet to enter contract talks with midfielder Ander Herrera as the Spaniard approaches the final year of the Old Trafford deal, writes Mirror Football's David Anderson.\nHerrera has been a key player during the Red Devils' 15-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and has turned out 21 times in the league this season.\nThe 27-year-old's deal with Jose Mourinho's side expires at the end of next season and he is keen to discuss new terms.\n\"Of course, if they want to talk with me, I will be very happy to do that,” he said as the Red Devils prepare to host Watford this weekend.\nRooney to return for Watford clash Rooney (left) is set to return to action after recovering from illness (Photo: John Peters) Wayne Rooney is expected to return to Manchester United's squad for Saturday's clash with Watford.\nThe United and England captain missed last weekend's win over Leicester through illness but is set to be on the bench when the Hornets visit Old Trafford.\nRooney has been back in training at Carrington this week but Jose Mourinho is sweating on the fitness of defensive duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo.\nJones missed the trip to Leicester with a bruised foot and it is understood the 24-year-old is yet to return to full training, the Manchester Evening News report.\nRojo started the game against Claudio Ranieri’s side but was substituted at half-time. It is understood the Argentinian defender is also facing a race against time to be fit for the weekend.\nInside story of Cantona's move to United Cantona became a cult figure at United (Photo: Mark Thompson/ALLSPORT) I can't believe 25 years have gone by but I'll never forget that crazy car ride.\nEric Cantona had agreed to join Leeds United and was heading to a private hospital in Leeds for his medical. I was covering Leeds in those days and Elland Road boss Howard Wilkinson suggested if I could get to the ground quickly I could join Eric and club physio Alan Sutton as they went for the tests that would clear the France international's route into English football.\nEric Cantona playing for Leeds in 1992 (Photo: Daily Mirror) It was Eric's first interview with the British media. He chatted away happily about the prospect of joining Leeds. He was disappointed that Sheffield Wednesday had asked him to spend an extra week on trial with them. With some help from an old friend in France boss Gerard Houllier, and a reference from Michel Platini, Wilko decided a trial period wasn't necessary. Leeds needed a striker. Cantona could step into the breach - immediately.\nMy problem was that my O-level French didn't really extend Eric but he was content to tell me about the challenge of coming to England and how he had been so badly misunderstood during a career that had seen him play for six French clubs in the previous eight years. Eric was a brilliantly talented maverick. A match-winner.
