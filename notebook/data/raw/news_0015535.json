There is an accurate translation for that charge: 'They present solutions, but I don't like them.” \n- Noam Chomsky, ‘Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy’. \nCOMMENT In another article, I admitted that I was one of those people who were pushing the failed state narrative after another Malaysiakini columnist Josh Hong pointed out in his own piece of the intellectual bankruptcy of promoting such an agenda. \nOf course, I felt justified in promoting such an agenda - “I have lost track of how many times I have pushed the ‘failed state’ narrative. Moreover, let me tell you it is very easy to push that narrative when we see the failing system around us. It is very easy to push that narrative when we have something as calamitous as the National Security Council Act.” \nRunning around claiming failing state status is easy in Malaysia. We are a Muslim-majority country that has managed to pull through over the decades when the world was going through radical political and social changes. The Arabisation process crept up on us because we were too busy engaging in other affairs instead of keeping a close eye on the Umno hegemon. \nThree recent contradictory statements by politicians in this country brings into focus why the opposition has been unable to gain traction with the idea that a vote for them would save Malaysia from an apocalyptical fate and why Umno still has a grip on power in Malaysia. \nThe first is by Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) point man Muhyiddin Yassin - “Through decades of government policies being initiated by Umno and BN, the country has become progressive, renowned and in the Islamic context, a model country.” \nAnd right here is the problem for the opposition because this is really is what most voters who vote Barisan National think. Through the decades, despite of all the corruption scandals, the sustained attacks against independent institutions, the slow process of dismantling our individual rights, Malaysia, in the words of John Hong, “for all its flaws, Malaysia remains a prosperous, relatively efficient and economically vibrant country.” \nMeanwhile, Muhyiddin admits that it would difficult to dislodge BN if the opposition remains in disarray and straight one-on-one fights was the most viable stratagem of replacing Umno/BN. \nNowhere does he consider that if people think that the country is functional and prosperous (and that this is something even he as a powerbroker in the opposition acknowledges), why should there be any regime change when things are running if not smoothly but better than in many other Muslim countries? \nWhich brings me to what the honourable DAP supremo Lim Kit Siang asked , “Is Najib aware that Malaysia has taken a first step to become a 'failed state' when we ascended to the 'global kleptocracy' club without any sense of contrition or compunction, whether by the cabinet or Parliament?\" \nThe problem here is that over the decades there have been numerous corruption scandals and yet the country remains standing. Furthermore, coupled with these corruption scandals, the Umno hegemon has carried out a deliberate process of racial engineering that changed the political, legal and social institutions of this country, and yet the country did not become one of those Islamic paradises that most Muslims would prefer not to go to but instead head West. \nKeep in mind the “failed state” narrative was used in the run-up to the 2004 election and former Umno president - who campaigned with a reform agenda - won by a landslide for BN. This was the same coalition that had ruled for decades and engineered the problems that are affecting Malaysia today. \nMeanwhile, Umno Grand Poohbah Najib Abdul Razak thinks that if there is no religious and racial harmony, Malaysia will turn into a failed state. The problem with this is that over the decades, the supremacy of Islam and Malay privilege has supplanted whatever grand ideas, the founding fathers - I still have no idea who these men and women were - had in mind. \nIndeed, the only reason why the Umno big cheese was raising the spectre of a failed state was because everyone else is doing it. But this idea that Malaysia is becoming a failed state ultimately is nonsensical when employed by either Umno or the opposition... \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
