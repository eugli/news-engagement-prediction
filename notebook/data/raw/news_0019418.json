Greitens misdirects the blame for budget problems 23 hrs ago ( … ) \nAnalysts are skeptical of Greitens comments on Obamacare's affect on Missouri's budget. \nIn the past two weeks on three occasions, Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has blamed the Affordable Care Act for Missouri’s budgetary woes and why he slashed $146 million in spending (\"Greitens says Obamacare hurt the state budget. How?\" Feb. 3) . He conveniently fails to mention the tax cuts passed by last year’s Republican-dominated Legislature, which caused a hefty reduction in corporate tax revenue. The state collects less as a proportion of the economy than it has for almost 35 years, according to the nonpartisan Missouri Budget Project. \nFurthermore, Republicans have stonewalled efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which would have saved the state $100 million a year. Expansion would have paid for services previously being paid by only the state. But Republicans said no to providing health insurance to 300,000 people, creating 20,000 jobs, injecting $2.3 billion into the state’s economy and saving 700 lives. \nGov. Greitens campaigned, and wants us to believe, that he’s “above politics.” Gimme a break. \nEd Shew • Lake Saint Louis Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:01:33.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
