Collectively we have a large quantity of water available for livestock, for human consumption, for agriculture and also for the cheapest form of power generation,” he said. \nMusharraf said that the region also has abundant fertile land and natural resources. \n“We also have a very strong and very large human resource potential, which also happens to be very intelligent. However, we do require better literacy and skill development,” he said. \nThe conference is the third of its kind, with the first two conferences held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2006 and 2012. \nThe former Pakistani president said South Asia needs to look at itself with introspection and clarity. \nThe challenges within and between states have had the better of all the abundant opportunities that exist in South Asia, he said at the conference whose focus was on regional connectivity and citizen empowerment. \n“We see poor leadership leading with poor governance exacerbated by corruption and nepotism. Then we see political turmoil within and between states as a result of which we are collectively failing to optimise the potential that we have in South Asia for growth,” Musharraf said. \nHe said that the politicisation of the SAARC platform is another issue. \n“We saw politicisation this year when SAARC was supposed to be held in Pakistan but it was scuttled,” he said. \nMusharraf said that Kashmir happens to be the main dispute between India and Pakistan, which needs to be resolved. \nHe also said that Afghanistan has emerged as another challenge obstructing regional cooperation. \n“Unfortunately, Afghanistan also blames Pakistan for introducing religious militancy in the region. But nothing is farther from the truth,” he said, adding that it all started with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in 1979. \nMusharraf left Pakistan for Dubai in March last year, after his name was removed from the Exit Control List. \nRaman Madhok, Managing Director & Head -- CMI Group, from India -- and Shahid Mahmud, Chairman and CEO -- Interactive Group, were the co-chairs of the two-day conference that will end tomorrow. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:40:27.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
