They might sound tough but they don’t protect people. The police should be focusing their resources on the very real crimes of trafficking and coercion rather than policing consenting adults.\n“Sex workers face enormous discrimination and are more likely to fall victim to crime and violence simply because the law criminalises them. We should target our policies and efforts at reducing harm not wasting police time and creating barriers that stop vulnerable people seeking help.”\nThe former Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner said: “That's why Liberal Democrats are proposing to take these outdated laws off the statute book. I believe it is time for an informed debate on this complex issue and I want my party to be leading that debate.”\nThe motion to be voted on at the conference in late March would “quash past convictions for anything that would be decriminalised under the new system”.\nIn pictures: Sex workers protest in Paris 8 show all In pictures: Sex workers protest in Paris 1/8 A protester (R) holds a sign reading 'Prostitutes with fists raised against the penalisation of clients!' during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris \n2/8 A protester wears a hat rimmed with red roses during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris \n3/8 Sex workers hold signs during a protest against new bill against prostitution and sex trafficking\n4/8 Transgender sex workers protest against a parliamentary vote to enforce the penalisation of solicitation, near the Assemblee Nationale (French parliament) in Paris\n\n5/8 A protester wears a mask during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris \n6/8 Protesters wear masks during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris, as French lawmakers take part in a final debate on a bill that would make it illegal to pay for sex. French lawmakers were poised on April 6 to pass a controversial law that makes it illegal to pay for sex and imposes fines of up to 3,500 euros ($3,970) on prostitutes' clients\n7/8 Protesters hold up their fists and chant slogans during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris\n8/8 Protesters hold a banner reading 'Don't liberate me, I'll take care of it myself!'\nThat would include brothel keeping, which the party believes prevents sex workers from getting together to work in a safe space, solicitation, seen as something that pushes sex workers to take risks to secure business, and also kerb-crawling.\nAs well as decriminalising sex work activity, the motion seeks to refocus laws on tackling “non-consensual activity” including trafficking, child prostitution and pimping, and would see a strengthening of measures against “coercion into sex and sex work on the grounds of fear, force, or fraud”.\nIn addition, the policy would set up additional support for people trying to leave sex work, including through housing authorities, healthcare providers and places where education and training are available.\nRead more The sex work revolution that no one is willing to talk about Students turning to sex work to cope with rising cost of living How sex work can improve your neighbourhood Amnesty formally calls for the decriminalisation of sex work The Digital Economy Bill, which continues its passage through Parliament this week, will force pornographic websites to add age-verification checks that will not let people watch videos until they sign up through a special process, that would involve giving personal details.\nBut the motions says the party believes the checks to be “illiberal, to pose a severe danger to privacy, and to be fundamentally unworkable”.\nThere have been a string of hacking attacks on internet pages, such as dating websites, which have seen people’s personal data stolen, spread across the internet and even used as means for blackmail.\nIn 2016 users of elite dating site Beautiful People had their sexual preferences and personal messages splashed across the internet after being hacked.
