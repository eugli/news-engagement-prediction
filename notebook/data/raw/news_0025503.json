Share via Twitter Barry King / Getty Images Pink gave birth to her son, Jameson, in late December and has been posting photos of her adorable family on social media ever since. Now, the famously fit singer revealed on Instagram that she’s started working out again. “Day 1 Lets do this @msjeanettejenkins,” she captioned a shot of herself with celebrity trainer Jeanette Jenkins at the gym. “(Week 6 post baby and I haven't lost ANY WEIGHT YET!!!!) Yay me I'm normal!” This isn’t the first time Pink has led by example when it comes to body positivity . In April 2015, she clapped back at people who made nasty comments about her body and a dress she wore to a cancer benefit. “While I admit that the dress didn’t photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty. In fact, I feel beautiful,” she wrote in a screen-grab posted on Twitter . So, my good and concerned peoples, please don’t worry about me. I’m not worried about me. And I’m not worried about you either…I am perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and my healthy, voluptuous, and crazy strong body is having some much-deserved time off. Thanks for your concern. Love, cheesecake.” Loading View on Instagram Pink's body positivity has apparently continued after pregnancy, a notoriously hard time for many women struggling with how they transformed physically throughout the process. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , women with a normal BMI should plan to gain between 25 to 35 pounds during their pregnancy, and up to 54 pounds if they’re carrying twins. That weight gain is necessary, and it goes toward important parts of pregnancy. Women’s health expert Jennifer Wider , M.D., tells SELF that, on average, this is where the weight comes from: Baby: 8 pounds Stored fat for delivery and breastfeeding: 5-9 pounds Larger uterus: 2-5 pounds Obviously, some of those elements—like the baby, placenta, and amniotic fluid—are lost either when a woman gives birth or shortly thereafter, but others, such as stored fat, take time to lose—and that’s normal. “Everyone loses the weight at a different pace,” Wider says. “It doesn’t usually come off immediately.” Dennis Gage, M.D., F.A.C.P., of Park Avenue Endocrinology & Nutrition , tells SELF that people who gain about 25 pounds will typically lose about 15 pounds initially. However, he says, it can take some time to lose the rest. Even without pregnancy as an added factor, weight loss can be complicated. It's different for every person, and it often comes down to so much more than eating well and exercising. Your weight is affected by plenty of other elements, like how much sleep you get, whether your hormones are acting up, and whether you have any health conditions that are outside your control. Going through pregnancy and childbirth only add to this complex weight-loss cocktail. Jessica Shepherd , M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology, and director of minimally invasive gynecology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF a woman’s body goes through a lot of physiological changes during pregnancy, including increased blood volume and fluid retention , none of which magically disappears after childbirth. “It can take up to six weeks or more for those changes to go back to normal,” she says. But that’s just fluid and doesn’t take actual excess weight into account. Gage says it’s “very common” for people not to have lost much weight by six weeks postpartum. Loading View on Instagram If a new mom is breastfeeding , that can either speed up or slow down her fitness goals, depending on how her body reacts to it. Some women lose weight while breastfeeding, while others stay the same. “In order to produce milk, you have to make milk,” Shepherd says. “That requires calories and good nutrition—a woman can’t be on a strict diet because that will take away from milk production.” If you've recently had a baby, your body also needs time to heal, which can slow the pace at which your body changes after childbirth, and it’s unlikely that you have as much time as you did pre-baby to exercise and focus on your diet. That’s why Shepherd says she likes to tell women to give themselves up to a year to get to a weight that they feel comfortable with, if that's a goal of theirs. However, she says, some women may have bodily changes from pregnancy that stick around—and that’s OK. Women may have abdominal skin that’s more lax than it was pre-pregnancy , while others may even experience a difference in their pelvic structure. Still others may have breasts that settle lower than they used to or an increase in spider veins. Body fat distribution may also change, Gage says—meaning you may suddenly discover that excess weight goes around your abs, when you used to gain it in your hips. Eating well and exercising regularly won’t necessarily affect all of these changes, but doing so can make you feel better overall, Shepherd says. “In general, women should feel empowered to work out after delivery and to view that as a time for them, ” she says. “So much time is devoted to the baby, and it’s important for women to take time for themselves after having a child.” Depending on the day, that might mean doing yoga or diving into a bowl of ice cream—or both. No judgment here. Bottom line: If you’re eating well and moving regularly and the weight isn’t coming off as fast as you’d like, Wider says it’s important to put things in perspective. “Women need to have patience when it comes to losing weight ,” she says. “With diligence and patience, most women can get back to a size they are comfortable with.” Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:06:39.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
