Frank Nall and Kristin Collins star in Marina Carr's \"By the Bog of Cats\" at the Artistic Home Theatre. (Joe Mazza photo) Kerry Reid Chicago Tribune \nThe narrative terrain in Irish playwright Marina Carr's work bursts with ghosts. But we're far away from, say, Conor McPherson's \"The Weir,\" where a newly arrived transplant from Dublin finds comfort amid the supernatural stories traded around the fire in a country pub. \n\"By the Bog of Cats,\" perhaps Carr's best-known work (Holly Hunter starred in a West End production over a dozen years ago) has its roots in Euripides' \"Medea,\" but its heart and soul is Irish. This comes through most clearly in the play's recurring themes of displacement and dispossession. A literal Irish backwater serves as its physical setting, but it carries some of the weight of the Irish diaspora on its shoulders, just as the characters struggle with the weight of rage, resentment and guilt. \nHester Swane (Kristin Collins) is the daughter of a \"tinker,\" Josie Swane, who abandoned her in a broken-down caravan at age 7 on the edge of the Bog of Cats. Now nearing 40 and mother to her own daughter, Josie (Elise Wolf), Hester is about to be cut loose again by Josie's father, Carthage Kilbride (Tim Musachio), who is ready to wed the young, lovely (and heir to land) Caroline Cassidy (Kelsey Phillips). But going away quietly isn't Hester's style. \nIf you know \"Medea,\" you can probably see where this story is heading. Thankfully, Carr isn't doing a mere palimpsest of Greek tragedy with Irish accents. This production at The Artistic Home, directed with a sure and sensitive hand by John Mossman, does tend to blow past the red zone on the vocal histrionics meter from time to time. Yet it is shot through with rich unexpected veins of humor as well as sorrow and anger. \nCarr is produced stateside far less than McPherson or Martin McDonagh, despite a long-running relationship with Dublin's celebrated Abbey Theatre, which has served as a pipeline for Irish dramatists to American stages for decades. It's anyone's guess why that is — but to my knowledge, this play hasn't been produced locally since the now-shuttered Irish Repertory of Chicago (not to be confused with the current Irish Theatre of Chicago) produced it in 2001. If nothing else, this production provides a rare opportunity for fans of contemporary Irish drama to see Carr's work onstage. \nMossman and his cast dig into the textures of Carr's script with gusto and sensitivity. Collins gives a bravura performance that manages to meld Hester's swaggering devil-may-care carapace with the gaping wounds of a woman who has never gotten over the pain of abandonment. That pain is one she shares with her rival, Caroline, whose mother died when she was young and left her to the questionable ministrations of her overbearing father, Xavier (Frank Nall). \nThe ghosts here aren't only in memories. Hester's dead half-brother, Joseph (Kieran O'Connor) shows up bearing scars of their last encounter. (A \"ghost fancier,\" played by John LaFlamboy, does feel like a bit as if Carr is gilding the mystical lily). The show opens with a potent portent — Hester dragging a dead black swan onstage. The local eccentric/seer, Catwoman, the Tiresias of the tale, offers dark prophecies in between snacking on mice and lapping up wine at the wedding banquet. (Caroline Dodge Latta's cagily comic but relatively understated performance, enhanced by Zach Wagner's inspired coat of tatty fur, is a highlight.) \nThe wedding feast for Caroline and Carthage itself provides a grotesque but often hilarious counterpart to the misty tragic world of the bog (evoked by the deliberately flat and not-quite-realistic backdrop by Anders Jacobson and Judy Radovsky, set off by Claire Sangster's chiaroscuro lighting). \nFather Willow (Michael Rogalski) falls into tangential musings while saying grace and admits that he wears earplugs in the confession box, rather than hear his troubled flock tell the same stories over and over. Meantime, Carthage's mother (Jane DeLaubenfels), who commits the ultimate faux pas of wearing a long white dress to the wedding, seems to have the same kind of unnatural attachment to her son that Xavier bears for Caroline. \nCertainly Carr is far from the first Irish writer to explore \"the past happening over and over again\" in the land of tortured poets. But she does so in a way that, with only a few lapses, avoids sentimentality and overstated metaphor and drives home the never-ending pain of never feeling loved or wanted enough. \n\"I'm the one who chooses and discards,\" Collins' Hester declares early on. But as we have known from Euripides' time to our own, fate has its way with human desires. As Monica Murray (Darrelyn Marx), Hester's sympathetic neighbor who is mourning her own lost child points out, this world doesn't \"yield easy to mortal wishes.\" Artistic Home's production ultimately offers an emotionally rich portrait of a woman who isn't easy to love — or to forget. \nKerry Reid is a freelance critic. \nReview: \"By the Bog of Cats\" (3 stars) \nWhen: Through March 26 \nWhere: The Artistic Home, 1376 W.
