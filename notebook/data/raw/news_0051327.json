Публикация от Ayaka Hasegawa (@ayk ) Фев 29 2016 в 6:43 PST \nJapan's Environment Ministry currently allows zoos to keep such crossbreeds. \n\"There are many zoos in the country which rear animals that became classified as invasive species after the law was created,\" a ministry official said, as cited by AFP. Публикация от marie_miura (@mari_sixx) Фев 21 2016 в 4:38 PST \nThe Japanese macaque is the only indigenous primate in Japan, according to the WWF. The rhesus macaque, in contrast, is native to a wide range of countries, including India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Afghanistan, Vietnam and China. Both species are considered ‘Least Concern’ in terms of threat of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \nHowever, the IUCN says that there are some local populations of snow macaques which are under threat. The group adds that one of the major threats to the population is ‘hybridization’ with rhesus macaques in the Chiba Prefecture.
