The Fox News Twitter account has 13m followers. \nKate Purchase tweeted Fox asking it to \"either retract or update the tweet to reflect the suspect's actual identity\". \n\"We need to remain focused on keeping our communities safe and united instead of trying to build walls and scapegoat communities,\" she added.
