Article continues below \nIt was a pretty comical moment that could actually see the 45-year-old punished. \nSutton were sponsored by The Sun Bets for their game against Arsenal, with the bookmakers offering odds of 8/1 for Shaw to eat a pie mid-game. Article continues below Sutton's manager reveals the 'amazing gesture' Arsenal made after their game \nAnd while he did just that, it seemed like too much of a coincidence. Even Paul Doswell, Sutton's manager, found his goalkeeper's behaviour suspicious. \nAsked after the game if Shaw's pie eating was a PR stunt, he said: \"I would assume so. I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. \n\"He's made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. The reality is I don't know, but it wouldn't surprise me. I don't think it shows us in the best light.\" \nReports claim Shaw's funny - albeit irresponsible - actions may have breached some FA gambling regulations, though that remains to be seen. \nIn the meantime, Sutton's shot-stopper has given his take on the controversy and judging by the below tweet, he really couldn't care less. \nInstead of attempting to defend his actions, Shaw brilliantly wrote: \"Great journey well done to all the management players and staff go again Saturday proud to be involved @suttonunited it was a pasty not pie.\" \nWell played. In what was a pretty wordy tweet, Shaw simply wrote, \"It was a pasty not pie\", to sarcastically correct those who have labelled it a 'pie controversy'. \nAny punishment for the veteran goalkeeper would be a black spot on an otherwise memorable occasion for Sutton, who performed admirably against Arsenal. \nWhile the Gunners dominated possession, Doswell's men were solid defensively and even managed to create the odd goalscoring opportunity. \nSkipper James Collins came close from a corner on the hour mark, while Roarie Deacon hit the woodwork with a thunderous drive from 25 yards. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
