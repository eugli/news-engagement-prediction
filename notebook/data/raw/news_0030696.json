Security Council resolutions.” He said Trump has assured him of U.S. support and that Trump's presence showed the president's determination and commitment. \nNorth Korea reportedly fired a ballistic missile early Sunday in what would be its first such test of the year and an implicit challenge to President Donald Trump's new administration. \nA spokesman for U.S. Strategic Command said in an emailed statement to Fox News that the, \"U.S. Strategic Command systems detected and tracked what we assess was a North Korean missile launch.” \nThe statement added that the missile had been tracked into the Sea of Japan and did not pose any threat to North Korea. \nThe appropriate officials “remain vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations and are fully committed to working closely with our Republic of Korea and Japanese allies to maintain security,” the spokesman said in the statement, adding that the launch was from “a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile.” \nThe missile launch reports come as Trump was hosting the Japanese leader and just days before North Korea is to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un's late father, Kim Jong Il. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
