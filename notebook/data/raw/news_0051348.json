Earlier this week, he made the rounds on the newswires at the Versus Versace show with his girlfriend Kim Turnbull , where he wore a brocade bomber jacket and black wide-leg pants. Though a red carpet, the look none of the slick veneer you might see in the wardrobes of high-profile Brits like Harry Styles and Zayn Malik. The aesthetic was cool but gritty — like something you’d see in a black comedy directed by his father, Guy Ritchie. In fact, the teen has long appeared to have taken cues from his father’s British crime movies. While sporting a blue Adidas tracksuit last May, he resembled Guy Ritchie-favorite, Jason Statham. And last summer, while wearing a cheeky bowling shirt with a gold chain, Ritchie looked like an extra from another one of his father’s films, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . Yesterday, Ritchie tapped into another vein of English style, looking like a London noughties raver in an oversized green puffer coat, baggy pants, and scuffed-up sneakers. Though the rough-and-tough style is certainly not the norm on the red carpet or stereotypically paparazzi-ready, Ritchie's look is refreshing and real.
