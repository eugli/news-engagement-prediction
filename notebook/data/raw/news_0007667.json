GRANT MATTHEW \nOn Tuesday morning police launched a search and rescue and missing persons inquiry for a German tourist on Mt Taranaki. \n\"She's believed that she's following the Ngatoro track which goes down to a carpark lower down the mountain but there are some of the DOC tracks that run off that that's she's somehow ended up following one of those and that's how she's become lost,\" Borrell said. \nThe woman was found around 11am on Wednesday by a Department of Conservation worker who was counting Blue Ducks roughly 300 metres away from North Egmont Rd and about a kilometre and a half off the main track. \nThe woman was checked over by ambulance staff at the Visitor Centre. POLICE \nThe German tramper who was missing on Mt Taranaki. \n\"She's tired and a little bit dehydrated but otherwise her spirits are high and she's walking around in pretty good sprits considering she's spent days in the bush,\" Borrell said. Ad Feedback \nA full scale search for the woman began on Tuesday with teams on foot, the Taranaki Community Rescue Helicopter in the air and six search and rescue workers travelling up from Whanganui to take part. The Air Force and searchers from Palmerston North also joined the search on Wednesday morning. \n\"She wasn't really prepared to spend any overnight time in the bush, she had a drink bottle and a packet of skittles to go for a walk,\" Borrell said. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nThe woman was last seen at the North Egmont Visitor Centre. \nShe was almost found on Tuesday when the rescue helicopter flew over her head but Borrell said she wasn't able to signal them as she was surrounded by bush. \n\"It shows we were searching in the right area,\" Borrell said. \nHe said DOC workers were aware the woman was missing and had continued on with their work on the mountain while keeping an eye out for her. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nSAR teams searched tracks on the mountain all day on Tuesday but found nothing. \nA DOC worker was also with Police and was helping to co-ordinate with them. \nHe said they had begun to fear for the woman's safety as the search began on Wednesday morning, with the weather forecast to become worse on Wednesday evening. \n\"The longer the search went on the more concerned we were getting because as I said, she wasn't prepared equipment-wise to stay overnight in the bush,\" he said, GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nSearch teams were walking tracks in and around the visitor centre. \nHe said the woman's friend, who had been waiting at the visitor centre, had described her being found as \"the best day of her life\". \nPolice had also been in contact with the woman's family to let them know she had been found. \nBorrell said the incident highlighted the need for people on the mountain to let others know where they were going and to make sure they were well equipped for any conditions. GRANT MATTHEW/FAIRFAX NZ \nA search and rescue mission involving teams on foot and the Taranaki Community Rescue Helicopter was launched on Tuesday morning and grew throughout the day. \nMore than 40 people were involved in the search, including Search and rescue teams from Taranaki, Whanganui and Palmerston North. \n\"The fact that she's gone out there is fine, the thing for us is if you go for even a short walk in the national park, you tell someone of your intentions and that's what she didn't do on this occasion,\" he said. \n\"So if she had gone up to the visitor centre and written in the intentions book where she was going to walk it would have given us a better clue of where she was when she went missing, and that's the big thing is if you're going into this national park, please tell someone where you;re going and your expected time of arrival of the walk.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:42:24.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
