The designer, who maintains his label Phlemuns from his L.A. living room, has just launched his first e-commerce shop, and with it a capsule collection of radical, recycled denim pieces. As a solo artist who makes everything himself, this is a big deal, though he’s already had a string of successes. Solange Knowles selected several looks of his for her “Don’t Touch My Hair” video, and he’s a favorite of musicians from Tinashe to Miley Cyrus . Skim through images of the Phlemuns line, above, and it’s easy to see what makes this guy a favorite of avant-garde dressers. “For this collection, I just revisited silhouettes I had done in the past two or three years that I was really drawn to, the core elements of me as a designer and things that I enjoy creating and putting out into the world,” he says. Among those shapes are slightly flared pants, lace-up tops, kilt-like wrap skirts, and one of the funkier denim jackets in recent memory. The collection is infused with a healthy dose of grooviness—it’s no surprise that he says the ’70s are a perennial reference. Another thing that makes Phlemuns stand out is its androgynous spirit. “I start with womenswear, and then I translate those pieces to how I would wear them as a male, and then I translate those back to womenswear,” Flemons says. “It’s a back and forth, which I think has aided in my whole united, androgynous vibe. I want this to work for anyone.” Recommended For You ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:11:48.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
