Its venom attacks the nervous system causing foaming at the mouth, muscle spasms and potentially death. \nThe spider was caught and taken to the Australian Reptile Park where it will be milked as part of their program to develop anti-venom. \nThe 10-year-old was “as lucky as they get”, Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner told The Telegraph. \nAustralia is home to a startling number of the world's deadliest creatures, including snakes, spiders, jellyfish and octopuses. \nThe funnel web is particularly feared but no deaths have been recorded since the anti-venom was developed in the 1980s. - AFP/mn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:25:36.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
