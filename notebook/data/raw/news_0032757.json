(Photo: Steve Mitchell, Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt's Groundhog Day all over again in Montreal. \nEven though the Canadiens sit atop the Atlantic Division, they have gone 1-5-1 in February. And apparently the prospect of Claude Julien manning the bench was too good to pass up -- again. \nThe Habs shocked the hockey world Tuesday with the announcement they fired head coach Michel Therrien and subsequently hired Julien, the coach who was fired by the Boston Bruins six days ago. \nThis is the second time Therrien was fired by the Canadiens in-season and replaced by Julien. Montreal made the same move in January 2003, when Julien was the coach of their American Hockey League affiliate. \nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. \n\"I would like to sincerely thank Michel for his relentless work with the Montreal Canadiens over his eight seasons behind the bench, including the last five seasons when we worked together,\" Canadiens general manager, Marc Bergevin said in a prepared statement. \"The decision to remove Michel from his coaching duties was a difficult one because I have lots of respect for him. I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction. \n\"Claude Julien is an experienced and well-respected coach with a good knowledge of the Montreal market. Claude has been very successful as an NHL coach and he won the Stanley Cup. Today we hired the best available coach, and one of the league's best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.\" Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
