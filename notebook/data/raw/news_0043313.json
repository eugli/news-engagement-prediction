That government will help the EC hold impartial polls,\" he said. \nDeclaring that the party will soon come up with the guideline for this government, he expected a positive response from the ruling party. \nBNP Standing Committee Member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury in a separate programme in Khulna also said his party had finalised the guideline and it will soon be presented as a proposal. \nIn her proposal to form and strengthen the EC, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia raised the demand for a 'poll-time supporting government'. \nThe party sits out of Parliament after the boycott of the Jan 5, 2014, election as its demand for a caretaker government during the polls was not met. \nKhaleda, however, had refused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's proposal for a poll-time government with all parties at that time, sticking to the ‘caretaker government’ demand. \nNow the party is not using the term ‘caretaker’and demanding a 'supporting poll-time government' instead, insisting that a fair election is not possible when a partisan government is in power. \nAwami League Presidium Member Mohammed Nasim on Friday said it depends on Hasina who she will keep in the poll-time government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:47:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
