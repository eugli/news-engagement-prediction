Color theory is such a powerful tool and when I learned of a purple-hued toothpaste for whitening, I needed it in my medicine cabinet like yesterday.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below PopWhite is the brainchild of a pro makeup artist and dental scientist, both of whom wanted to created a natural toothcare line with purple color-correcting technology to gradually whiten teeth. What sets it apart, aside from its purple hue, is its lack of peroxide, a bleaching agent you'll find in most whitening products that can be harmful in excess. A safer, gentler alternative, I was totally on board for a two week trial. After all, violet shampoo has done wonders for keeping my blonde dye jobs brass-free.\nNew Year, New Oral Care!

Two concerns I had from the get go were that I 1) wouldn't like the taste and 2) it'd turn my mouth purple as if I'd been popping grape-flavored Jolly Ranchers all day. As for the former, it wasn't as minty as my normal drugstore toothpaste, but it was 100% tolerable. The same goes for the mouthwash. And my tongue post lavender mouth cleanse? It was, in fact, purple. But only for a few minutes and then it went away.\nThese ladies are all dressed up and ready for their debut! #PrettyInPurple #POPWHITE #TheDentalCosmetic #WhiterBrighterSmiles\nA post shared by POPWHITEÂ® (@popwhitesmile) on Dec 8, 2016 at 7:05pm PST\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Results-wise, I started noticing a difference in my teeth after about a week. It was subtle, but my coffee addiction and predilection for red wine was less obvious i.e. my smile was a little whiter and brighterâ€“especially when I wore a lip color. And after two weeks, I really saw a difference, the boost it gave my go-to red, MAC's Ruby Woo , as the benchmark. It didn't make my computer-paper white per se, but I liked it that way. I was also pleased that there was no weird sensitivity either, which is something I've struggled with in other whitening treatments.\nAll in all, I have a new color-minded essential to add to my beauty routine and I'd recommend this stuff to anyone looking to give their smile some peroxide-free whitening love.\nBefore, During, and After using #POPWHITE's #PurpleToothpaste just ONE time!\nA post shared by POPWHITEÂ® (@popwhitesmile) on Jan 19, 2017 at 4:21pm PST\nPopWhite Whitening Primer + Toothpaste and Whitening Toner + Oral Rinse, $26; popwhitesmile.com .\nFrom: Marie Claire\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://popwhitesmile.com/professional/", "https://popwhitesmile.com/product/toothpaste-and-oral-rinse/", "http://bit.ly/2l20TKD", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPd0MXTjr4H/", "http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a25335/purple-toothpaste-whitening/", "http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g4390/lip-glosses-for-whiter-teeth/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPF4uyfFkTN/", "https://www.goby.co/design", "http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a15583/green-concealer-for-redness/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BNx9n70j4p_/", "http://popwhitesmile.com/product/toothpaste/", "http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a17854/how-to-whiten-eyes-naturally/"], "published": "2017-02-16T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:35:17.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
