'They're possessed by it - their marriages are not quite working out and their kids are grown up.' Last hurdles: The star (pictured at the premiere of John Wick: Chapter 2 in London last week) said, 'Bill & Ted 3 is right now stuck in show business land so creatively we're good to go but in the business sense, the rights and all of the complications and contracts that need to be made are not' 'Future comes back and says if you guys don't write this song, it's not the world but the universe - all of time is going to break apart - so they've got more pressure and hijinks.' Keanu said they are doing their best to get the story line perfect while all the business is dealt with. He said at the time: 'We're closer and we're not closer. We're trying to get the story right. We're working with this studio so we have a little bit of support, in a sense of like if the material comes through we'll try and make this picture.' Those were the days: Keanu and his co-star Alex Winter attended the premiere for Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey in 1991 Whilst Alex - who played Bill S. Preston Esq. in the original movies - told Forbes last year, they had everything ready to go. The 51-year-old also teased that there would be some old and some new faces appearing in the third film. He told the magazine: 'The short answer is yes. I can’t really go further than that other than to say some people are going to returning from the original by the fact that they’re in it. There will be new people because obviously, sadly, Rufus (George Carlin) isn’t around anymore and they will be interesting actors too.' How things have changed: This time the pair (pictured at the 1991 premiere of Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey) will not be metal loving teens time travelling but family men torn between their new lives and saving the universe Read more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:31:41.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
