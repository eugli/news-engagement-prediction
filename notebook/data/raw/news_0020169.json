He sustained severe stress and recurring migraines, spending two weeks recovering in hospital. “It was a horrible experience,” he said. Perhaps no group has felt the sting of the economic fallout more sharply than millennials. More than 40 percent of Europe’s young people are now stuck in a revolving door of low-paid, temporary work. Today, Mr. Terraz is a recruiter at a French pharmaceutical company, but only for six months. The stress over money and finding the next job remains. “You have to keep a smile and be mentally strong,” he said. In private, though, “you feel excluded from society.” “Three years ago, I had dreams, ambitions for a great career,” he added. “But right now I have nothing. It’s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression sometimes. If I was the only one this was happening to, O.K., but most of my friends are in the same position.” Feeling Expendable Treating employees like disposable labor is bad for companies, too.

Each held one-year renewable contracts, with the promise of potentially going full time after two years. It never happened. The company was hiring groups of 30 scientists at a time on temporary contracts, which management would let expire to avoid the cost of hiring people full time. Mr. Minnaar and his colleagues discovered that they were the third such group in four years. \n  It is an increasing reality across Europe. Since 2012, just 20 percent of temporary workers have made the leap to full-time work, according to Eurofound. “We were trapped in the strategy of this multinational, which was just waiting to discard us after two years of hard work,” Mr. Minnaar said. “In one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.” Morale slumped. “Productivity became really bad, and people started to become really disengaged from work, which was strange because we were doing interesting stuff,” he recalled. Employees dragged their feet on projects and openly looked for jobs. Others grew wary of colleagues, whom they viewed as competitors for any permanent jobs that might arise elsewhere at the firm. “By doing this, the company was destroying their own workers,” said Mr. Minnaar, who is 30. “The lesson was, if you treat people like this, if you don’t give them security or trust over the long term, they won’t do a good job for you.” Mr. Minnaar eventually quit. He began a start-up, Corporate Rebels , with a friend who had also struggled on a cycle of temporary contracts. They now consult with banks, retailers and the likes of Google and Patagonia on what makes employees happy and productive in the workplace. Giving In Taking any job just to survive means dealing with trade-offs.

He served as a hotel bellhop in his hometown, Barcelona, manned reception desks, and waited tables at restaurants. He is fluent in five languages and has a degree in hotel management. \n  Despite decades of experience, he never managed to land a prized full-time job. When a permanent offer did come, however, he hesitated. Mr. Meiler had been working a temporary job at a sports equipment company’s call center in Barcelona to help supplement his income from short-term contracts at hotels and cruise ships, where he welcomed and checked in guests. Accepting a full-time gig as a service representative at the sports company in Munich would mean abandoning his career path. “There’s a sense that you’ve given in, that you’ve surrendered,” said Mr. Meiler, 35, who remembers accompanying his mother, a tour guide, as a youth around Spain. “You want to stay on the path you’ve been working on for so long. “Then I thought, what if there is no better job waiting for me?” he continued. “I needed work. I needed stability. And you always have the sense that I can’t complain, because there’s millions of other people without a job.” Mr. Meiler has adapted quickly to his new role in Germany, and he feels lucky to be working in a collegial atmosphere. Still, sometimes a nagging voice whispers that he took the easy way out. If he could find a stable job in his field back in Spain, he said, “I’d be on a plane the next day.” Finding Hope A sense of relief accompanies a permanent job.

The rest of the week was devoted to sending out résumés and angling for interviews in a bid to nail an elusive permanent job. She worked at three companies, including a youth orchestra and an arts foundation, just in the past year. After struggling for nearly two years, Ms. Hickey, who studied art history, finally got lucky: Last month, she landed a full-time job at the Scottish Rugby Association as a ticket sales representative. \n  “It was an immense relief,” she said. “It was harder than I ever thought it would be to get permanent work, but now I can get settled and focus on the future, without worrying about having to find the next thing.” She now has steady hours at an office every day, a regular paycheck with overtime, and a sense that she can settle down and start forging some kind of a career path. Her passion is still the arts, but her new job may present opportunities that she had never dreamed of. And in a dicey job market, she figures it is better to start working her way up the ladder where she is rather than risk starting all over again. “I’m keeping an open mind,” she said. “But it’s definitely good to have security.” \nPalko Karasz contributed reporting from London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:34:49.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
