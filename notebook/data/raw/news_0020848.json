What are the best ways to keep cool during a heatwave — minus air-con? Here are your best tips. \nIvanhoe, which sits on the Cobb Highway in lower western NSW, hit 46.1C at 2:00pm. \nRelief manager at the Ivanhoe Hotel Motel, Sean Auld, said some customers had come from over 100 kilometres away just to have a beer and enjoy the air conditioning. \n\"We've had a few more people come through than usual,\" he told the ABC. \n\"Hot weather brings them in.\" \nMr Auld said the heat was bearable as long as you were not outside all day. \n\"It's still muggy inside … air-cons are working non-stop to keep up,\" he said. External Link: Map of Wilcannia, Ivanhoe, Emmdale Roadhouse \nNorth of Ivanhoe in the Wilcannia area, where temperatures hit 47C, is the Emmdale Roadhouse, which despite the hot weather is still seeing a lot of traffic. \n\"Today's definitely the hottest day this week,\" said Aaron Frankel, who has been working at the Roadhouse since just after Christmas. \n\"We have a large cooler where we keep all the beer, so today's a good day to clean it.\" \nMr Frankel said despite the hot weather, business at the Roadhouse had not stopped, with truck drivers and motorcyclists still driving through regularly. \n\"We had a couple of motorcyclists come through with heat exhaustion — we had to put their head in cold water and put them in front of the air conditioner,\" he said. \nMr Frankel is originally from California, and said while he felt the occasional heatwave back home, Australian heat was something different. \n\"There's something about the Australian sun that hits you way harder than the American sun,\" he said. \n\"Maybe it's the hole in the ozone layer … you will feel your skin glowing in a certain way that you wouldn't in California.\" Photo: The Emmdale Roadhouse is still seeing plenty of traffic despite the hot weather. (Facebook: Emmdale Roadhouse) \nIn other areas of Wilcannia it is a different story. \nAt the Wilcannia Golf Club it is far too hot to hit the green, and staff member Marg Strubles suspected people were staying inside in their air-conditioning. \n\"People will drift in and out, have a flutter and a bevvie, try to stay cool and then tottle off to their homes,\" she said. \nMs Strubles said the heat had been \"extreme\" for at least three weeks. \nHer tips for dealing with the heat? \n\"Stay inside and drink plenty of water, and put a wet towel around your neck,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:24:59.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
