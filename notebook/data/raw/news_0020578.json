But as it prepares to make its foray onto the public stock market, the company has been forced to make revelations that are raising eyebrows about its approach to gender parity and diversity. \nIn official documents just made public, the company revealed that Joanna Coles, chief content officer of Hearst Magazine and former editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire, was the only woman on the nine-person board. SHARE Joanna Coles has made a strong impact on the magazine and television industries for decades.

The next lowest paid directors made almost ten times that amount, receiving $1.1 million (A$1.43 million) after only being instated into their positions in October.

No individuals from minority groups have a position on the board. \nInstead, with a board of predominantly white, middle-aged entrepreneurs, Snapchat is trailing far behind its competitors, with 20 per cent female representation the average, according to Redfin . Interestingly, the app itself most popular with women, who make up 70 per cent of its users. \nAs for Coles, she isn't alone in copping a smaller package. A recent study by the University of Missouri and the University of Delaware indicated that \"diverse\" directors on boards (women and minorities) at more than 1800 US companies are paid three to nine per cent less than their \"non-diverse\" (white and male) counterparts. \nBut this white male culture is the very thing that could work against companies. Twitter received backlash in 2013 for their all-male board, and in 2015 McKinsey & Company revealed that companies with boards in the top quartile of gender diversity were 15 per cent more likely to outperform those in the bottom quartile.
