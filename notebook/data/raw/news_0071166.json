Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya, identifying them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\n\nMalaysia had been one of the more outspoken critics of the Myanmar government, accusing them of inaction.\n\nThe country had intended to deliver and distribute the donations personally to the Rohingya in Rakhine, but the Myanmar government refused that, saying the local authorities will disburse the aid fairly, ensuring that both communities of Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims receive the supplies.\n\nMalaysia has also delivered around 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian supplies to Bangladesh, where many of the Rohingya have fled to and are now seeking shelter.\n- CNA/hs\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:21:58.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
