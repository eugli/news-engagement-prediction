Credit: ABC video still \nThis comes just after showrunner Mike Fleiss teased a “historic announcement” around the franchise on Twitter. \nAt the time, spoiler king Reality Steve confirmed Nick’s casting was official — though he didn’t know if he’d be announced with the rest of the cast. Yes, he's on it. Not sure if he'll be officially announced w the rest of cast Wednesday on GMA, but he's on https://t.co/c0ndpqY28a \nSpeaking of that cast, others said to be joining are Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ’ Erika Girardi, comedian Charo, Saturday Night Live alum Chris Kattan, bull rider and model Bonner Bolton, and Glee actress Heather Morris, 30. \nStory still developing. Stay tuned to Wetpaint for more updates. \nClick through for more on Nick's DWTS journey — including what he had to say about doing the show! \nOriginal story (1/9/2017 at 11 a.m. ET): \nBachelor 2017 is Nick Viall ’s fourth time on a franchise show — and it probably won’t be the end of his reality TV career. Credit: video still \nAfter word spread the 36-year-old might be hitting the floor for Dancing With the Stars Season 24, he addresses the rumors in an interview, and doesn’t appear to deny it. \nIt’s only early January, but the show will likely start casting for the mid-March kickoff in the coming months. Credit: ABC/Rick Rowell \nSeeing as DWTS picks up right after Nick’s Season 21 love journey ends, it would definitely work with his schedule. Plus, he seems pretty enthusiastic about the possible experience. \n“I mean, I haven't given it much thought. I think it would be fun, you know?” the Wisconsin native tells ETOnline.com . \"Who wouldn't wanna do it?\" Credit: ABC/Rick Rowell \nWell, a lot of people, actually. It’s been nearly two years since the last Bachelor Nation contestant, Chris Soules , and many believe his then-relationship to winner Whitney Bischoff suffered because of it . \nThat doesn’t seem to be a concern for our current Bachelor, though. Credit: ABC on Twitter \n“If they asked — I mean, I don't think I would say my first thought wouldn't be no, but I think anyone would feel lucky to even be considered,” he admits. \nThough Nick emphasizes his focus is currently on Bachelor , don’t be surprised if you see him doing other Hollywood-related work post-show — DWTS or otherwise. \n“Before I was asked to be the Bachelor, I had been living in L.A. and I'd done some stuff in this entertainment world,” he explains.
