They’ve won just four of their 11 conference games and are 13-11 overall. \nA quick glance at Georgia’s schedules offers a glimpse at much more, though. \n  \nThe Dawgs have lost more than a handful of close games, and their Ken Pomeroy ranking of No. 52 nationally is a reflection of that. Three of their seven SEC losses have been bitterly close losses to league leaders Kentucky, Florida and South Carolina, and they pushed the Wildcats and Gators to overtime on the road. \nPut simply, Georgia has the attention of Vols coach Rick Barnes . And Barnes said his players need to give that same attention and respect to the Bulldogs during Saturday’s 4 p.m. Eastern game that will be broadcast by ESPNU. \n“I think they’ve had a much tough luck as anybody in the country,” Barnes said before Friday’s practice in Thompson-Boling. “That’s tough, as we know, ‘cause we’ve been on the short end of a lot of those close games, too, and it’s a fine line. But the fact is this is a team that was picked fourth in our preseason poll, and they’ve been competitive with everybody they’ve played, and they’ve had some nice wins. If you look at anybody in our league and talk to anybody in our league, we all know that Georgia is capable of beating any team in the country. \n“We’ve got to play well. We’re gonna have to play extremely hard and extremely well to get a win.” Georgia junior forward Yante Maten (Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports) \nBarnes said the Vols — at least the few players who were on the team last season — have seen firsthand the damage Georgia stars J.J. Frazier and Yante Maten can do. \nFrazier terrorized Tennessee last season in Athens, collecting 28 points on 10-of-14 shooting from the field and 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range. The diminutive southpaw helped turn a nine-point deficit with less than 17 minutes left into a nine-point win. \nThings haven’t gone nearly as well this season for Frazier — who’s averaging 16.0 points, 4.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game but shooting a career-low 29.8 percent from 3-point range — but Barnes said Tennessee must be aware of the 5-foot-10 senior at all times. \nMaten — a big, sturdy, reliable junior big man averaging 19.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game — also is a potential matchup problem for the Vols, who have battled their way into the NCAA Tournament conversation but can ill-afford a home loss to the Dawgs. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \n“If last year’s an indicator, Frazier was incredible — I mean, he just singlehandedly took the game over,” Barnes said. “It was really just an incredible performance. We certainly are aware of that and know that he can do that against anybody. And Maten is a guy that … man, he’s just so efficient around the basket. He catches the ball really well, knows how to get his angles, and they know how to play off those guys. \n“They’re just very solid. They’re extremely fundamental when you look at what they do. I think they pass the ball well. I think they know exactly who and how they want to play and who they want to play through. They’ve got two players in particular that I think can score a lot of points on you in a lot of different ways, and their other players do a good job of understanding their roles. \n“They really have a great idea of how they want to play and who they want to play through.” \nBarnes said the Vols need their full focus on Georgia and not on the NCAA Tournament, claiming the battle-tested Bulldogs are capable of beating Tennessee in Thompson-Boling and starting a late-season surge. \n“Georgia’s capable of winning the rest of their games,” Barnes said. “I know that Mark Fox believes that, too. I think his older players have been through it. They’ve seen themselves get on a run and get going. I think there’s some other teams in the league that are capable of doing that, too. And then you’ve got the SEC Tournament. There’s a lot of basketball left to be played, and that’s why it doesn’t do any good to get into talking about a number of wins or this, that or the other. You’ve got to win games. \n“There’s a lot of teams in the country that are capable of putting together a good run here at the end and finishing strong, and if they’ve done enough, they’re gonna be where they want to be.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
