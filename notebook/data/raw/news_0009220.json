What I've been advised is that dual citizens are not covered by the ban. So we don't see any reason why someone who is a New Zealander with dual citizenship would have any problems.\" \nAsked if he wished the policy had been handled better by the US, English responded: \"I don't think this policy has been rolled out in a way that suited anybody much. So I would hope that if there are gong to be other significant changes in their policy they would implement it in ways that people understand it.\" \nTrump signed an Executive Order at the weekend, temporarily suspending entry into the United States of foreign nationals from seven mostly-Muslim countries he claimed were terrorist havens. \nThey were Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen. \nA spokeswoman for the US Embassy in New Zealand confirmed the ban did not apply to dual nationals who held a New Zealand passport, however those also from Iraq, Syria, Sudan and Iran still required a US visa. This was the case before the executive order. \nDual nationals of Yemen, Libya, and Somalia and a Visa Waiver Programme country - such as New Zealand - may travel under the waiver programme unless they had travelled to any of the seven countries on or after March 2011. \nAny travel to those seven countries in the past five years would mean those New Zealand citizens would also have to apply for a US visa. \nThe embassy was working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to implement Trump's executive order, the spokeswoman said. \n\"Our embassies and consulates around the world will process visa applications and issue non-immigrant and immigrant visas to otherwise eligible visa applicants who apply with a passport from an unrestricted country, even if they hold dual nationality from one of the seven restricted countries. \n\"We will announce any changes affecting travellers to the United States as soon as that information is available.\" \nUS citizens (although they might also have another nationality) were required to use their US passport when entering and departing the United States. They did not receive visas or enter the US as a foreign national, so the Executive Order did not apply to them. \nNew Zealand officials appeared to have been advised of the US position on New Zealand on Wednesday morning, after seeking answers for days. \nEnglish was expected to speak to Trump by phone over coming days. Asked if he would raise the Muslim ban, English said he was \"quite happy to represent the view\" that New Zealand disagreed with the policy. \nHe did not expect that to ruffle US feathers. \n\"There's a long history of disagreement of New Zealanders with US policy, going right back to the Vietnam war in the 1950s. That doesn't change the need as a small country for a positive relationship with the US. We can do that at the same time as disagree with the US.\" \n- Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:10:10.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
