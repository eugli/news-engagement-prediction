Rabia, in her petition, has also sought liberty for the FBI to assist the SIT, as Jiah was a US national. When the matter came up for hearing on February 1, Rabia's advocate Dhairyasheel Patil had tendered the copy of reports of three private forensic science experts. He told the bench that out of the three, one expert is from a foreign country. Citing their opinions, Patil said, \"The ligature marks on Jiah's neck, especially at the back side clearly indicate that it is not suicide as in suicide cases, the marks appear only in the front-side of the neck. (sic)\" Sooraj Pancholi \nHe also told the bench that all the opinions obtained by Rabia clearly indicate that Jiah died a homicidal death. \nOn the other hand, additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh, who appeared for CBI, told the bench that the agency has left no stone unturned and that it has probed the matter from all possible angles. Meanwhile, Rabia broke down before the bench and sought justice for her daughter. She told the bench that the CBI officer, who was investigating the case, had criminal antecedents. \nWhen the order was pronounced in the case, Rabia was in London, but spoke to India Today over the phone, \"I will wait for the detailed copy of the order from HC, but I will be appealing against this rejection. I will not give up. God has bigger plans.\" \nHer lawyer Swapnil Ambure said that the lower court is yet to start the trial as it is still dealing with a few applications. Charges are yet to be framed in the case and before that \"we will surely file an appeal in Supreme Court\". \nALSO WATCH: Not possible to extricate foetus in such gory manner, says Aditya Pancholi To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
