Once a hotel, the stately listed property was built in 1797 and now offers six bedrooms, a brand new kitchen, cinema room and ballroom, and there’s 1GBPS internet available in the nearby village. \nThe vendor is 37-year-old father of two Dustin Low , who was faced with repossession after an increasing struggle to find work in the area in Melling, on the border of Lancanshire and Cumbria. \nMelling Manor.

You might have a bit of competition though, with an update suggesting they’ve received 100,000 paid entries in five days. \nAnd the house is remaining on the market in the meantime, so if someone’s willing to buy it, the winner will instead win the money raised by the raffle. Not a bad deal either. Low rates on hold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:57:34.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
