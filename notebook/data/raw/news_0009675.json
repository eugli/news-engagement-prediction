In the final third we didn't look dangerous enough. \n\"That was difficult to watch from upstairs. I'm not subdued. I'm disappointed and angry because we lost a very big game. \n\"The title's slipped further out of our hands and there's no hiding that. \nMourinho aims dig at champions of Conte style \n\"Certain players individually were not at their best and when you are very young and inexperienced and there seems to me players who are not playing at their best level, well that hurts. \n\"There were players who know Hazard well and know very well that you don't let him get up a head of speed and we were very naive.\" Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:02:18.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
