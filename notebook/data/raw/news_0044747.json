France is being heavily impacted by rising religious tensions between Christians and Muslims, especially in urban areas, the report said. \n\n\"We expect that millionaire migration away from France will accelerate over the next decade as these tensions escalate,\" it added. \n\nThe report further noted that other European countries where religious tensions are starting to emerge such as Belgium, Germany, Austria, the UK, Holland and Sweden will also be negatively affected in the near future. \n\n\"Going forward, we expect HNWI migration into the UK to continue, despite the Brexit. In particular we expect large HNWI inflows from France, China, India, the Middle East and Africa into the UK. However, on the flip side, we do expect some UK HNWIs to move to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US over the next 10 years,\" the report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:17:27.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
