You have to be aware of your own potential, and know that obstacles that seem today to be impassable mountains tomorrow will seem like tiny cracks in the pavement. You just have to hold on and keep pushing through.” \n“You’ll Be Fine” is off of Clare’s album Tail of Lions , which was released on Jan. 20 via ETC Recordings/Red Distribution.
