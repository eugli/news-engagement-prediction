Iga and Koga clan ninja were reputed to be the best. They have inspired countless novels, movies and cartoons, including the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\" Members of ninja group Ashura show their martial-art skills during a press conference held by Japan Ninja Council at Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ) in Tokyo Credit: BEHROUZ MEHRI/ AFP/Getty Images \nA ccording to the council, ninja can stare at a burning candle without blinking, frequently massage their ears to stay nimble and never gain weight above 60 kilograms (130 pounds). Their diligence and perseverance, as well as their humble acceptance of anonymity, are integral parts of Japanese culture and should become a pillar export, the council argues. \nKawakami acknowledged that real ninja training was hard to pass down today, and said that was why he is called the last real ninja. But ninja had much to offer spiritually, such as the meditative focus they muster when they clasp their hands in concentration in their trademark pose. \n\"It is also about respect to our ancestors,\" Kawakami said.
