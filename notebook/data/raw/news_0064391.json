Researchers from the UK-based MIDAS project, led by Swansea University, shot this footage as they flew over the ice shelf on their way to collect science equipment\nRECORD ICEBERGS The largest icebergs known have all calved from ice shelves.\nIn 1956, a huge iceberg of roughly 32,000 km² – bigger than Belgium – was spotted in the Ross Sea by a US Navy icebreaker.\nHowever, since there were no satellites in orbit at this point, its exact size was not verified. In 1986, a section of the Filchner ice shelf roughly the size of Wales calved – but this iceberg broke into three pieces almost immediately.\nThe largest iceberg recorded by satellites calved from the Ross ice shelf in 2001, and was roughly the size of Jamaica at 11,000 km².\n'Iceberg calving is a normal part of the glacier life cycle, and there is every chance that Larsen C will remain stable and this ice will regrow,' said Dr Paul Holland, ice and ocean modeller at British Antarctic Survey.\n'However, it is also possible that this iceberg calving will leave Larsen C in an unstable configuration.\n'If that happens, further iceberg calving could cause a retreat of Larsen C. We won't be able to tell whether Larsen C is unstable until the iceberg has calved and we are able to understand the behaviour of the remaining ice.\n'The stability of ice shelves is important because they resist the flow of the grounded ice inland.\n'After the collapse of Larsen B, its tributary glaciers accelerated, contributing to sea-level rise.'\nSatellite observations from February 2017 show the growing crack in the ice shelf which suggests that an iceberg with an area of more than 5,000 km² is likely to calve soon.\nResearchers from the UK-based MIDAS project, led by Swansea University, have reported several rapid elongations of the crack in recent years, and today revealed it is upto 1500m wide in parts.\nBAS scientists are involved in a long-running research programme to monitor ice shelves to understand the causes and implications of the rapid changes observed in the region, and shot the footage as they flew over the ice shelf on their way to collect science equipment.\nDuring the current Antarctic field season, a glaciology research team has been on Larsen C using seismic techniques to survey the seafloor beneath the ice shelf.\nBecause a break up looks likely the team did not set up camp on the ice as usual.\nInstead they made one-off trips by twin otter aircraft supported from the UK's Rothera Research Station.\nIce shelves in normal situations produce an iceberg every few decades.\nThere is not enough information to know whether the expected calving event on Larsen C is an effect of climate change or not, although there is good scientific evidence that climate change has caused thinning of the ice shelf.\nOnce the iceberg has calved, the big question is whether Larsen C will start to retreat.\nAn ice shelf is a floating extension of land-based glaciers which flow into the ocean. Because they already float in the ocean, their melting does not directly contribute to sea-level rise.\nHowever, ice shelves act as buttresses holding back glaciers flowing down to the coast.\nLarsen A and B ice shelves, which were situated further north on the Antarctic Peninsula, collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively.\nThis time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year, adding to an 11 mile advance spotted by researchers in September. The team studying the crack say it is now inevitable it will break off, leaving a massive iceberg.\nThis resulted in the dramatic acceleration of glaciers behind them, with larger volumes of ice entering the ocean and contributing to sea-level rise.\nElsewhere in the Antarctic, shocking new satellite image has revealed the march of a giant crack dubbed the 'Halloween crack'.\nTaken by the European Space Agency's Copernicus programme, which is aimed at Earth Observation, the data was instrumental in the recent decision to temporarily close down the British Halley VI research station in Antarctica.\nThe crack is located on the Brunt Ice Shelf - a floating ice sheet that moves steadily towards the ocean where it occasionally calves - when chunks of ice break off glaciers to make an iceberg.\nThe crack first appeared last October, when the Halley VI base of the British Antarctic Survey was only 17km from it.\nInformation from two satellites - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, were used to monitor the crack's development.\nA company called Enveo, which uses satellite data to monitor to study the frozen parts of the world, also helped with the observations.\nThe rift from space, showing a 900 foot crack that has emerged - and is growing at an alarming rate. In late December, the rupture had already extended by 11 miles (18km), leaving the future iceberg connected along only a small fraction of its length.\nA crack in Antarctica that is more than 100 miles (160km) long has grown by another 6 miles (9.6km) in just over two weeks. This adds to the 11 miles (17km) advance in September, creating a 17 mile (27km) total increase in less than a month\nIn November and December, the crack was growing in length by as much as 600 metres per day.\nWhile the Halley Research station had to move because of this, it was designed to be relocated if the ice becomes dangerous.\nThe station already had to relocate 23km inland during Antarctica's last summer months because of another chasm (crack) which had lain dormant for more than three decades but became active again in 2013.\nThe crack appeared last October, when the Halley VI base of the British Antarctic Survey was only 17km from the crack\nDr Hilmar Gudmundsson, the survey's lead scientist, said: 'The frequency of Sentinel-2 images and Sentinel-1 radar products allows us to follow in detail and almost in real time the development of the crack as it grows week by week.'\nThe two Sentinel satellites are being used to monitor three cracks - the Halloween crack, which is now growing at 200 metres per day, and two other ice chasms.\nThe satellites are also being used to detect any new cracks that may arise.\nImages of the Halloween crack generated by The Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites. The crack is located on the Brunt Ice Shelf - a floating ice sheet that moves steadily towards the ocean where it occasionally calves - when chunks of ice break off glaciers to make an iceberg\nThe Halley VI Research Station was forced to close its Antarctic research base amid rising fears it could fall into a huge ice chasm. Shocking new drone footage shows just how massive the growing crack in the ice is\nThe Sentinel-2 satellite has been programmed so that it takes images every time it flies over the cracks so that there's a maximum chances of photos without clouds in them.\nOther satellites, Sentinel 1-A and Sentinel 1-B, have also been recording data with two crossing tracks.\nThis allows researchers to map the growing rift and, showing how the ice shelf is deforming at the tip of the growing crack.\nDr Mark Drinkwater, head of ESA's Earth observation mission, said: 'Routine Antarctic summer observations by the combination of Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-1A and -1B are now demonstrating their value for monitoring rapid environmental change and providing information crucial to informed decisions on matters of safety and security in Antarctica.'\n'Though without direct effect on Antarctic infrastructure, similarly dramatic summer development of ice-shelf fractures is revealed around Antarctica, notably Pine Island glacier in West Antarctica and the Larsen-C and Brunt ice shelves in the Weddell Sea.'\nAntarctica will soon be facing the dark winter months, and the Sentinel-1 satellite will continue to provide images so that thes changes can be monitored.\nKILLER CHASMS The first chasm, which had lain dormant for more than three decades, became active again in 2013. Since them, the crack has lengthened at a rate of 1.7 km per year.\nOn October 2016, a second crack appeared some 17 km to the north of the research station.\nResearchers conclude that they are unable to predict with certainty what will happen to the ice shelf during the forthcoming Antarctic winter and beyond.\nThe Halley VI Research Station was relocated 14 miles across the Brunt Ice Shelf, amid fears in could slide into an encroaching fissure in the ice shelf.
