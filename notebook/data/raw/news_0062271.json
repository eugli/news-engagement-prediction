One option, called proton-pump inhibitors, or PPIs, is especially effective. \nBut over the last few years, PPIs have also been linked to an alarming number of health risks, affecting everything from your heart to your brain. \nIt sounds scary, but do you really need to shelve your meds and find another way to extinguish the burn? Read on to find out. What Are Proton-Pump Inhibitors? \nProton pump inhibitors are a class of medicines that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. \nThat helps reduce your heartburn, since too much stomach acid—especially when it flows up into your throat—can irritate and inflame your esophagus, according to the NIH. \nPPIs can be either prescription by your doctor or sold over the counter. OTC options include Prilosec, Prevacid, and Nexium. \nThe FDA has approved non-prescription PPIs for once-a-day use up to 14 days, but a physician may recommend a different regimen, such as putting you on PPIs for a month and then gradually reducing the dosage over a series of weeks. What Are the Health Risk Associated with PPI Heartburn Drugs? \nOver the past few years, researchers have linked PPI use to a number of serious health problems. \nMost recently, researchers from Denmark associated with stroke : After analyzing the records of about 245,000 Danish people who had stomach pain and indigestion, researchers noted that their overall stroke risk increased by 21 percent when they were taking a PPI. \nPPIs may alter an enzyme in your body that reduces your production of nitric oxide, which is vital for the health of your blood vessels, says lead researcher Thomas Sehested, M.D. \nWhen blood isn’t flowing well through the blood vessels, it can result in blockages, and when that happens with blood flow to the brain, stroke can happen. \nThat increased risk of blockages may be why PPIs have been linked to heart attack, too. \nIn fact, in 2015, researchers from Stanford discovered that people who took PPIs were 16 to 19 percent more likely to have a heart attack than those who didn’t take the meds. \nAnd the risk was even more pronounced in people under 55—they were up to 40 percent more likely to experience a heart attack. (Find out what it really feels like to have a heart attack .) \nWhat’s more, a 2016 study in JAMA Neurology found that older people taking regular PPI medication were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those not on PPIs. (Here’s how doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease .) So Should You Take PPIs For Heartburn? \nIt’s important to note that the studies mentioned above don’t prove causation. All they show is that people who took those meds were more likely to experience those conditions—not necessarily that PPIs caused those conditions. \nStill, it’s enough of a connection that frequent users should take a better look at the quantity and frequency of their PPI popping, Dr. Sehested believes. \n“We think people should reconsider their use of PPIs in consultation with a physician,” he says. \nYou can consider other tactics first to relieve your heartburn, says Men’s Health family medicine advisor Ted Epperly, M.D. \n“PPIs should be your 4th line of defense,” he says. How to Treat Heartburn \nYour move, then? When you feel symptoms of heartburn crop up, try drinking milk or eating a piece of bread first—basically any food that can coat the esophageal lining. \nThis will eliminate or reduce the stomach acid that’s coming back up, Dr. Epperly says. \nIf that doesn’t work after about an hour, give a coating agent like Pepto Bismol a go. Much like the milk or bread, this is designed to coat the esophageal lining, and its thicker consistency may help more than milk. \nStill breathing fire after that? Try OTC hearburn meds called H2 blockers, like Pepcid, Tagamet, or Zantac. \nThese meds weren’t shown to be linked to heart attack or stroke in the studies. \nFinally, go for the PPIs if all those previous efforts have failed. \n“Turning to PPIs first is like trying to use a chainsaw to cut your fingernails,” says Epperly. “It’ll work, but it’s way more than you need to do.” \nAnd make sure you’re following the directions if you’re going the OTC route, he emphasizes: Stick to that 14-day guideline, and pay attention to the usage directions on the box. \nTaking more than directed in a day, or stretching past that two weeks, can increase risk of side effects like stomach pain, constipation , diarrhea, and nausea — as well as the larger risks noted by the recent studies. \nIf you’ve been taking PPIs to fight heartburn at least three times a week for more than a few weeks, check in with your doctor. \nThose symptoms may actually signal something more serious going on, like cardiac issues or a stomach ulcer.
