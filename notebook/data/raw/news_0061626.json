Do you really, really like it? Would you go to a special cafe to take in all the mayo you want? If you said yes to the previous few questions, you might live in Japan. That’s where mayonnaise is taken super seriously. So seriously, in fact, that there are special, limited-edition mayonnaise cafes opening in both Tokyo and Nagoya this year, as they did last year as well, according to Kotaku . \nWe’re talking Kewpie Mayonnaise, which it’s important to remember is actually a different kind of mayo than you might be familiar with when it comes to the American variety. The Kewpie brand, or Japanese mayo, typically uses egg yolks, apple or rice vinegar, while the American variety uses whole eggs, distilled vinegar, salt, and sugar to dress it up. They’re pretty different tastes if you can imagine it. If you can’t, just know one is a lot less “full” than the other. via twitter.com/VingleJapanese \nThe Kewpie bottles of mayonnaise will likely adorn the cafes as they did in the previous setups from the prior years, along with healthier foods in a bid to get visitors to eat more vegetables and healthy foods if mayonnaise is attached to it. I know, that doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, either, but whatever works. \nThe cafe will feature olive, basil, tomato and regular mayonnaise on tap for people to nosh on, and they’ll be open from March 1 through March 31 in Tokyo and April 3 through April 30 in Nagoya. But if you’re not in the area and don’t plan on being there anytime soon, you might consider instead visiting the mayonnaise museum in Japan as an alternative. You know, in case, you can’t reconcile your love for all things mayo with all the other things you could possibly love that much you’d want to visit a museum over.
