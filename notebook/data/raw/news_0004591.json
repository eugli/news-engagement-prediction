Several of our students made the poor choice of displaying inappropriate gestures during this time. Unfortunately, many of these images have been shared on social media. This is extremely disappointing as this is not an accurate representation of our student body,” Mr. Bob Hull wrote in letter published online by Houston’s KPRC Channel 2. \n“We are currently conducting an investigation and those implicated will be punished according to the Student Code of Conduct,” he added. “We ask that you talk to your students regarding the posting and sharing of negative social media as this perpetuates a false image of Cy Ranch HS.” \nAs many as 70 students gave a supposed Nazi salute while shouting “Heil Hitler” and “Heil Trump” during Tuesday’s photoshoot, according to an unidentified student who spoke via email to KPRC. \n“Most people may think it was just kids joking around but in the current political climate and the fact these kids are seniors in high school, it’s beyond unacceptable,” the student said. \n“It was pretty terrifying,” the student added. \nAccording to its website, more than 3,700 students attend grades 9-12 at the school, located roughly 30 miles northwest of downtown Houston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:54:52.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
