Interestingly, it’s a darker sound than appeared on Coloring Book but the flow is unmistakably Chance. He also tags DJ Esco in one of the clips, so it’s possible the production comes courtesy of the regular Future collaborator. \nJudging by the accompanying captions on Instagram, the track is going to be called “My Peak.” \nAfter years of dropping EPs and mixtapes, Chance The Rapper revealed in 2016 that he’s started working on his first full-length album , although there’s no telling yet whether this cut will make the tracklist. \nCheck the clips below.
