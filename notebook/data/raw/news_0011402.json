(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)  23 AM \nPatriots tight end Martellus Bennett is sticking to his word. \nOn Monday, the former New York Giant said it would be “unlikely” he’d celebrate with the team at the White House if New England won Super Bowl LI,. \nIn a postgame press conference following the Patriots’ unbelievable overtime win against the Falcons, he confirmed that his decision was final. \n“I’m not going to go,” he said . “People know how I feel about it.” \nBennett added that he’s “not really worried” about upsetting team owner Robert Kraft be skipping the visit to Washington D.C. \nMaking the situation more peculiar is that President Trump does not hide his love of the Patriots, Kraft, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. \nSome of Bennett’s teammates, such as Brady, admire Trump back. \nThe tight end said that in the locker room, though, politics never come up. \n“You just don't bring that to work,” Bennett said. “We all have our beliefs. We accept people for who they are.” \nBennett has been outspoken regarding the Trump presidency, specifically on his Twitter page. \n“America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness,” he tweeted after Trump signed the controversial Muslim ban executive order.
