Dave J Hogan 4 Stacey and Joe have been dating since late 2015 \nSpeaking to Star magazine, she said: “You worry about, ‘If the father of my next child lives with me, do the other kids then feel bad about being left out?’ It’s a difficult dynamic.” \nStacey, who won I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2010, is less concerned with how she is viewed, but worried about how her children will be affected. \nShe has two sons by different dads, eight-year-old Zachary with childhood sweetheart Dean Cox and Leighton, a four-year-old, who she had with ex-fiancé Aaron Barnham. \nStacey told the mag: “A lot of people make you feel bad about having different children to different people. It doesn’t seem that bad, but it’s hard for people to digest and they think it’s unfair on the kids.” Getty Images Joe and Stacey play happy families at the premiere of Finding Dory in July last year WENN The couple made an official announcement about their relationship in January 2016 \nIt doesn’t bode well for any potential baby plans Joe Swash may have had. \nThe couple have been officially dating since January 2016, after getting to know each other for a couple of months before Stacey made the announcement. \nIt may be too early for a baby chat, but Stacey revealed the couple have already spoken about the possibility of children and how that might affect the kids they already have. \nShe added: “We talk about it. But briefly. Joe’s got his boy and I’ve got mine. The boys love Joe. It’s just doing what’s right for the children rather than what we selfishly want.” BBC 4 Stacey with her sons in 2013 \nOnly two weeks ago Stacey appeared on Loose Women, where she spoke frankly about her sex life and revealed that she and Joe are very careful not to get pregnant . \nShe said: “I always feel really selfish saying this, and I feel bad because I know that loads of people find it really hard to conceive, including my sister who really struggled. \n“But I have to work hard for the opposite…I have to be really careful not to get pregnant because I feel like I look at a man and it can happen. \n“At the moment we have to be really, really careful and choose our days and our methods and use as many as possible.” \nStacey has already opened up about her fears of having children with boyfriend Joe because her two boys have different dads. \nLast year she told new! magazine: “I don’t know how many children I can have with different people. It’s complicated with our own children.” \nGot a story? email or call us direct on 02077824220", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:18:43.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
