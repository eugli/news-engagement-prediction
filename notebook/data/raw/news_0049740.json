Until very recently, the biggest foreign intervention in an American election happened in 1940, when the United States was riven over whether to enter World War II. Both sides in the war got involved. Nazi officials funneled money to delegates at the Democratic convention to get them to vote against Franklin Roosevelt’s nomination and also backed efforts to get Republicans to adopt an antiwar platform. British agents, as Politico has detailed , covertly paid for biased polls showing that Americans favored intervention and also worked to defeat a prominent isolationist member of Congress. It’s possible that Britain’s efforts helped swing the Republican nomination to Wendell Willkie, an underdog who was far less isolationist than his rivals.
