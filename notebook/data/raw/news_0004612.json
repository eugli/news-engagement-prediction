Article continues below \nThe 26-year-old may have been off-sorts somewhat against Liverpool on Tuesday, however, many other Premier League defenders will testify that he has tormented them on a regular basis for the majority of the campaign to date. \nAnd ahead of the Chelsea's latest clash with London rivals Arsenal on Saturday, Hazard has been speaking about the art of beating his opposite number to someone else who knew a thing or two about terrorising a back line. Article continues below \nAs well as being Hazard's coach for Belgium, Thierry Henry is still regularly spotted as a pundit for Sky Sports and the pair held an insightful interview at Chelsea's training ground this week. \nIn it, Henry revealed that he particularly likes the way Hazard dribbles with the ball. \nAs someone who started out as a winger himself, Henry discussed exactly what would go through his mind when he had the ball on the wing and how Hazard does the complete opposite. \n\"One thing that I like a lot about you - and I think everybody does - is the way you dribble. It is, for me, an art,\" Henry said. \n\"I used to do it in a different way. I used to put my shoulder down and see the reaction of the defender. \n\"When he reacted and was flat-footed that's when I used to push the ball and pass him. I wanted him out the picture and the first defender that might stop the cross to come and meet me so my striker was alone. \n\"That was always my thing, but when I see you most of the time you like to go on the inside. Why?\" \nAs you can see in the video below, the Chelsea star's response was simple. It's all about instinct. \nHazard replied: \"For me it's easier to play with my right foot. It's simple. If I go right, I see Diego and have different solutions. \n\"I go alone or pass to Diego or the midfield can join in. If I go the other way, the cross with my left foot is not good.\" \nThe former Lille ace will be hoping to end a run of five Premier League games without a goal on Saturday. \nSo far this campaign he has found the back of the net nine times but could have probably asked for some extra assistance from Henry to break his drought against the Gunners. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
