More than 1000 others were turned away at the gates, disappointed to learn that they’d missed their chance to see Collingwood take on Carlton in this historic match.\nEmma Grant of Collingwood is tackled by Katie Loynes of Carlton as she kicks the ball during the round 1 AFLW match between the Carlton Blues and the Collingwood Magpies at Ikon Park in Melbourne. Picture: Joe Castro Source: AAP \nAmong those who missed out was Collingwood Football Club President Eddie McGuire. Not because he arrived after the lock out. Not because he misplaced his corporate box tickets. Not because of family commitments, but because he was in Adelaide watching a boxing match. Male boxing. Obviously.\nMcGuire is an extremely busy person. He hosts Millionaire Hot Seat on Channel 9, the Hot Breakfast on Triple M. He commentates for the AFL’s men’s competition and a host of other sports, he writes columns for the Herald Sun , is a board director and a father of two boys.\nDuring the inaugural women’s game McGuire wasn’t just sitting back enjoying a bevy at the Green-Mundine fight. His defenders have been quick to point out that he was co-anchoring Fox News’ coverage at the time. McGuire is, after all, one of the foremost personalities in Australian sports administration and journalism. He works incredibly hard. And of course he can’t be everywhere - or at everything - at once.\nAs a man in high demand, there were undoubtedly other competing claims on his time that night that we don’t know about. Like all of us with busy lives, McGuire had to decide where his attention was most needed. He had to make a choice about how to spend his time.\nAnd he absolutely made the wrong one.\nYes, McGuire’s supportive public comments about the Collingwood women’s team have been commendable, but talk is cheap and talk is also easy. The true measure of a leader’s commitment is their willingness to give up their time. If you’ve ever had a boss who threw an amazing Christmas Party for their staff but wouldn’t bother showing up to spend social time with their employees, you’ll know that to be true.\nTime is the one thing you never get back.\nGiving it to someone is the ultimate mark of respect.\nCarlton players celebrate after their round 1 AFLW match. Picture: Joe Castro Source: AAP \nBy failing to show up at the game, McGuire missed out on so much. He missed the happy buzz of anticipation among fans as they poured into the crowded ground. He missed seeing his team running through that black and white banner as a professional outfit for the first time. He missed the cheers of the Collingwood fans when one of theirs — forward Jasmine Garner — earned her place in the history books by booting the first goal.\nHe missed seeing little kids — boys and girls — perched on their parent’s shoulders, straining to catch a glimpse of their new heroes at work. He missed AFL chief executive Gill McLachlan personally apologising to the fans that couldn’t get in the gate. He missed overhearing blokes from the men’s league excitedly imagining their daughters’ future professional footy careers.\nHe missed the chance to share that with his sons, who sit beside him at every Collingwood match during the men’s season. He missed the chance to show them that women can play their beloved game too and are worthy of their admiration. He missed the candid, giddy, humble interviews with the players after the match, players who were just so grateful that the fans had come out to support them.\nDaniella Hardiman of Carlton kicks the ball ahead of Moana Hope of Collingwood during the round 1 AFLW match between the Carlton Blues and the Collingwood Magpies. Picture: Joe Castro Source: AAP \nFriday evening heralded a new era in the game Eddie McGuire loves so much. By choosing to be elsewhere while women wore the black and white stipes for the first time, he relinquished an incredible opportunity. The opportunity to lend the weight of his position — and also his considerable personal influence — to the women’s competition.\nThere is some good news though. The best thing about footy is that there’s always another chance, another opportunity to get it right. There is another quarter to play, a new match next week, a better season to train for and a flag to be won the following year.\nCollingwood take the field again next Saturday night. Let’s hope Eddie McGuire is watching. You can bet the rest of Australia will be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:49:44.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
