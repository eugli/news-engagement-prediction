Two of the first records that I had in my possession were The Breaks by Kurtis Blow and Super Rhymes . Those were so influential in developing my love for hip hop. When I started going to York University, I actually studied there to become a teacher. I taught piano for 16 years, classically trained with the Royal Conservatory of Music. I thought that was my calling, but then I started volunteering at CHRY 105.5, which it was at the time. I basically learned how to DJ and do a radio show on the air. \nDJ MelBoogie is among 150 black women from the GTA featured in a digital photo series called HERstory in Black.
