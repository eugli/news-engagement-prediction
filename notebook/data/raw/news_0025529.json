Rob Earnshaw believes his family's bill could have been avoided if a care package had been developed and put into use earlier.\nCouple in happier times His mother Barbara has dementia and the family pay £2,986.98 a month for her residential care. As her husband Tom's mobility decreased, Rob says he considered paying privately for physiotherapy for his dad who, while trying to improve his movement, fell down the stairs and broke his neck.\nTom joined Barbara in the same home and now the Sheffield family face shelling out £5,973.96 a month for their care.\nTom and Barbara on their wedding day Because we are living in this age of no money, suddenly the feeling of care for people seems to have gone out of the window and I feel very much that mum and dad have just been pushed to one side and said, 'Listen, you're old people.' It's almost like we don't care about you and just pay for it yourself and go away.\n– Rob Earnshaw Figures obtained by ITV News reveal that in Sheffield at the end of last year the longest someone was waiting for a social care package to be put in place was 227 days.\nThis month Sheffield Council has, like many other authorities, increased it's council tax charges by a further three percent. This follows Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to allow them to increase bills to pay for social care. However, the money will not go to creating new initiatives but towards paying the council's £3.2 million National Minimum Wage bill.\nAnd Coun Cate MacDonald, of Sheffield City Council, warns unless more funding for care is given, by 2021 it will have a £79 million deficit - and it is just not the South Yorkshire city struggling to manage its purse strings: \"A council somewhere is going to find it very difficult to make ends meet with all the pressures its facing.\"\nFor Rob it is little comfort: I am absolutely and the whole family is convinced if Dad had been properly looked after early on that would have made a big difference. It's actually cost them more money in the long run.'\nMartin Fisher has been looking at the Earnshaw's plight.\nPlay video Last updated Mon 13 Feb 2017 Health Sheffield", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:14:57.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
