It's getting eaten in another country and they need to be educated about our practices here in Australia,\" he said. \n\"The [Western Australian Fishing and Industry Council] would be a good one to start talking to the people over there.\" Shark fin sales 'slowly' improving \nShark fins are commonly used in Asia for shark fin soup. \nIn 2015, more than 3,000 kilograms of shark fins were exported to Hong Kong, while just over 300kg were exported to Singapore from Australia. \nThis compared to just 220kg exported in 2012, and none in 2013. \nThe figures for 2016 are due out later this year. \nThe Australia-wide sale numbers have been reflected on a local level. \nMr Soumelidis said before 2012, he could sell shark fin as soon as it came into stock. \n\"But now I have to actually store it,\" he said. \n\"It got as bad as we had a lot of stock of fins in our freezer which we couldn't sell to anybody. \n\"Now we're just slowly, slowly starting to filter in through into the market.\" \nMr Soumelidis attributed the gradual increase to a better understanding of Australian fishing regulations. \n\"Our practices aren't like the rest of the world. We don't fin the sharks and throw them back in,\" he said. \n\"Our practices are the whole fish comes in and it gets used. \n\"And it's not the big sharks as well, it's only the smaller ones which we can consume the meat and keep the fins off that.\" Industry continues to lobby \nThe West Australian Fishing and Industry Council (WAFIC) agreed Australia needed to make clear to importers that Australian shark fishing regulations were different, in order to keep up sales.

(ABC) \nChief executive John Harrison said the council was working with the WA State Government to get third party certification on the sustainability of fisheries. \n\"In the meantime, the fisheries management regime is very conscious of being conservative in the taking of fish and very closely monitored and managed,\" he said. \n\"We are spreading that message as far and as wide as we can, and the fact that we're challenged on the global front of messages being pushed to stop shark fishing doesn't mean it's not a sustainable fishery here in Australia.\" \nIn Australian fisheries it is illegal to have shark fins on board a commercial fishing vessel without having the trunk of the shark on the vessel, according to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \nWhile some species of shark, such as the great white and the grey nurse, are protected under government legislation, species like gummy shark can be commercially caught within sustainable catch limits. \nManagement measures are in place to minimise the bycatch of shark species, and AFMA is continuously working to reduce the incidental catch of sharks. Environmental groups keep pressure on \nThe Australian Marine Conservation Society is one of the environmental groups involved in campaigning for the complete ban of imports and exports of shark fin in and out of Australia. \nCampaigner Josh Coates said despite WAFIC's view that Australia was different, his group would be sticking to its campaign. \n\"I'm not aware of any figures that show there actually is an increase in the amount of shark fin being exported from Australia, but if that is the case then it's certainly not something that we'd like to be seeing happening,\" he said. \n\"I think we have a role as an advanced country, as one of the western countries, to actually set an example in this case and show the world what should be done. \n\"And that is to move away from the unsustainable harvest of shark fin.\" \nMr Coates did not believe Australian shark fishing practices were different to other countries. \n\"There is a range of different fisheries that either target or inadvertently bycatch, take and keep sharks within Australia and there's quite a bit of variability in terms of the sustainability of those,\" he said. \n\"So to say that things are entirely different here in Australia is not entirely true.\" \nHe said despite some cases of fisheries only fishing smaller sharks with sustainable populations, the society would continue to lobby for exports out of Australia to be banned, as well as imports. \n\"We don't think this is extreme at all. This is a phased process,\" he said. \n\"Those shark fins could, for the time being, still be sold within Australia, but we'd like to see even that trade in the shark fin trade phased out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:32:50.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
