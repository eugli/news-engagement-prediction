This princess dominates one.’ \nSounds right up our street. \nUsing that *incredible* fan art, posters came up with some crazy ideas about what the film should be about. Someone posted this fake Disney poster online but now we all want to watch it (Picture: Reddit/teagone) \n\nFilm fans seemed to know exactly what Punched would be about if it were to be Disney-fied (apart from boxing, obviously). \nOne user wrote: ‘Spoiler alert: she’s undefeated, she gets beat, training montage, and then she wins her title back. End of movie.’ \nTo which another replied: ‘Cmon this is Disney here. She’s undefeated, gets beat, training montage. ALMOST wins the title back, then realises the life around her is more important.’ \nToo true.
