According to Jose Felix Diaz in Marca , Atleti and Bayern Munich have also long been interested in the 20-year-old winger, while Los Blancos view him as a potential replacement for Isco or James Rodriguez. Diaz added Bayer sports director Rudi Voller has previously stated Brandt will not be sold until summer 2018 at the earliest—his current contract runs until 2019—while Bayern have twice already tried to sign him and will not give up easily. Liverpool have also long been reported to be interested in the Germany international, and he will be one of manager Jurgen Klopp's primary targets in the summer, according to James Pearce in the Liverpool Echo . Despite his youth Brandt is already a relative veteran of the Bundesliga—he has made 87 appearances in the German top flight, netting 17 goals and providing 13 assists, per WhoScored.com . His pace is a huge asset, as are his intricate close-ball control and distribution. See below for a look at what he can do: Per Diaz, Brandt has \" the skill set that [Real are] looking for.\" Predominantly a left-sided player, he can also operate on the right flank or through the middle. Real manager Zinedine Zidane has mainly relied on Cristiano Ronaldo to fill the left-sided role in his attack, and it would be difficult to find any player better in the position than the Portuguese. However, Ronaldo is now 32 and Brandt could be a worthy successor to him at Real should he make good on his potential. A front three of Gareth Bale , Alvaro Morata and Brandt could potentially be the future of Real's attack. However, if Los Blancos decide that Brandt is their man they will face serious competition for his signature.
