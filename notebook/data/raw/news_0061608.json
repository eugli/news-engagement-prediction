Experiments are supposed to be replicable. \nThe authors should have done it themselves before publication, and all you have to do is read the methods section in the paper and follow the instructions. \nSadly nothing, it seems, could be further from the truth. \nAfter meticulous research involving painstaking attention to detail over several years (the project was launched in 2011), the team was able to confirm only two of the original studies' findings. \nTwo more proved inconclusive and in the fifth, the team completely failed to replicate the result. \n\"It's worrying because replication is supposed to be a hallmark of scientific integrity,\" says Dr Errington. \nConcern over the reliability of the results published in scientific literature has been growing for some time. \nAccording to a survey published in the journal Nature last summer, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments. \nMarcus Munafo is one of them. Now professor of biological psychology at Bristol University, he almost gave up on a career in science when, as a PhD student, he failed to reproduce a textbook study on anxiety. \n\"I had a crisis of confidence. I thought maybe it's me, maybe I didn't run my study well, maybe I'm not cut out to be a scientist.\" \nThe problem, it turned out, was not with Marcus Munafo's science, but with the way the scientific literature had been \"tidied up\" to present a much clearer, more robust outcome. \n\"What we see in the published literature is a highly curated version of what's actually happened,\" he says. \n\"The trouble is that gives you a rose-tinted view of the evidence because the results that get published tend to be the most interesting, the most exciting, novel, eye-catching, unexpected results. \n\"What I think of as high-risk, high-return results.\" \nThe reproducibility difficulties are not about fraud, according to Dame Ottoline Leyser, director of the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. \nThat would be relatively easy to stamp out. Instead, she says: \"It's about a culture that promotes impact over substance, flashy findings over the dull, confirmatory work that most of science is about.\" \nShe says it's about the funding bodies that want to secure the biggest bang for their bucks, the peer review journals that vie to publish the most exciting breakthroughs, the institutes and universities that measure success in grants won and papers published and the ambition of the researchers themselves. \n\"Everyone has to take a share of the blame,\" she argues. \"The way the system is set up encourages less than optimal outcomes.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientific journals can play a role in helping improve the reliability of reporting \nFor its part, the journal Nature is taking steps to address the problem. \nIt's introduced a reproducibility checklist for submitting authors, designed to improve reliability and rigour. \n\"Replication is something scientists should be thinking about before they write the paper,\" says Ritu Dhand, the editorial director at Nature. \n\"It is a big problem, but it's something the journals can't tackle on their own. It's going to take a multi-pronged approach involving funders, the institutes, the journals and the researchers.\" \nBut we need to be bolder, according to the Edinburgh neuroscientist Prof Malcolm Macleod. \n\"The issue of replication goes to the heart of the scientific process.\" \nWriting in the latest edition of Nature, he outlines a new approach to animal studies that calls for independent, statistically rigorous confirmation of a paper's central hypothesis before publication. \n\"Without efforts to reproduce the findings of others, we don't know if the facts out there actually represent what's happening in biology or not.\" \nWithout knowing whether the published scientific literature is built on solid foundations or sand, he argues, we're wasting both time and money. \n\"It could be that we would be much further forward in terms of developing new cures and treatments. It's a regrettable situation, but I'm afraid that's the situation we find ourselves in.\" \nYou can listen to Tom Feilden's report and the further discussion on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
