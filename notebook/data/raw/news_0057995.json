She said he was 'persistent and intimidating.' He persuaded Susan to download software to allow him to log-on and control her computer remotely.\nHOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE PRINTER SCAM National Trading Standards is advising people take the following steps:\n- When seeking technical support for your printer, make sure you use the contact details provided by the printer manufacturer. These can be found by visiting the manufacturer's official website, listed on its product packaging and literature.\n- Be suspicious of helplines asking to take remote control of your computer to fix printer problems.\n- Make sure that your anti-virus and online security software is kept up-to-date, to reduce the risk of unwanted pop-ups on-screen that may advertise fraudulent services\nDeals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 1.1% easy access rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £7+ in monthly rewards Blue Rewards", "external_links": ["http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/beatthescammers/index.html", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&index=2&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&index=3&count=106&selectedProductId=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.nationwide.co.uk/", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/shop/third-party-promotion-click/?product_sku=SAV_RCIBANK_48F18975BBD543A59694F181F61CBE1C&source=TM1&channel_id=116"], "published": "2017-02-22T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:24:27.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
