Behind her are seven female colleagues, including one who is in the late stages of a pregnancy. Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045. For a safer and better future. pic.twitter.com/OqOO2y8BU6 — Isabella Lövin (@IsabellaLovin) February 3, 2017 \nAs Swedish tabloid Expressen put it, the photograph appeared to be a \"cheeky nod\" to a recent image of US President Donald Trump. \nIn particular, Lovin's image may be a reference to a number of widely shared photographs from last week that showed Trump signing a controversial executive order that blocked US foreign aid to organisations that discuss abortion services. \nIn these photos, Trump is completely surrounded by men — a detail lost on few observers . Advertisement — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 24, 2017 \nOn social media, Swedes praised Lovin for her message. \"Wonderful Picture! Hope you sent it to the man on the other side of the ocean,\" wrote one Facebook user. \nThe Swedish embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment. However, Lovin herself hinted the photograph had a clear message in a statement to Sweden's English-language news website The Local . \n\"We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo. Ultimately it is up to the observer to interpret the photo,\" Lovin said. \nSince Prime Minister Stefan Lofven formed a coalition government between his own Social Democrat party and Lovin's Green Party in 2014, Sweden has claimed to be the world's first \"feminist government\". A statement on the government's website explains that this means \"gender equality is central to the Government's priorities — in decisionmaking and resource allocation\". \nThe new law sets a goal of phasing out greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Notably, it will be legally binding for future governments as well. \nSeven of eight parties in Sweden's parliament - all but the far-right Sweden Democrats - agreed to pass a law in the coming months to oblige governments to set tougher goals to cut fossil fuel use every four years towards the 2045 cut-off. \nLovin expected the law to enter into force in 2018. \nAmong EU nations, she said, Britain, Denmark and Finland have also passed climate laws meant to make long-term policies less easily overturned and to give more certainty to investors. \nBy contrast, Trump has sometimes called climate change a hoax and wants to bolster the domestic coal and fossil fuel industries. He has threatened to pull out of a 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change but also said he has an \"open mind\". \n\"We see that the advantages of a climate-smart society are so huge, both when it comes to health, job creation and also security,\" Lovin said. \"Being dependent on fossil fuels and gas from Russia is not what we need now.\" \nThe Swedish position may be at odds with the new US administration. Trump has repeatedly expressed scepticism in climate change science, even going as far as to label it a hoax perpetrated by China. There is widespread speculation he may try to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement or simply fail to participate in the key climate deal. \nAfter signing the deal on Thursday, Lofven told reporters that the position from Trump was \"worrying\". Lovin said it was time for European nations to take the lead on climate policy, as \"the US is not there anymore to lead\". \nWashington Post, Reuters Advertisement Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:05:54.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
