Palisades lineman Syr Riley Ryan Gorcey 2:42 PM Cal extends an offer to Western League Lineman of the Year Syr Riley out of Pacific Palisades (Calif.) Palisades. \nPacific Palisades (Calif.) Palisades head coach Tim Hyde knew that California wanted to offer emergent two-way lineman Syr Riley (pronounced \"sire\") on Wednesday, and on Thursday, told the 6-foot-4, 315-pounder to give the Bears staff a call. \nhttp://www.scout.com/college/california/story/1757669-montibon-could-arr... \"I guess my coach kept it a secret from me for a day, so I called coach [Justin] Wilcox [on Thursday], after my lift, and we were talking, and he told me he'd like to give me a scholarship, that the program loved what I did, and that they'd love to have me,\" Riley said. \nDuring the call, Riley also spoke with offensive line coach Steve Greatwood , indicating that, though he plays both nose tackle and offensive line, his future most likely lies on the offensive side of the ball. \n\"I haven't asked about position, yet,\" Riley said. \"To be honest, my head coach tells me that I'll probably be a guard, just because of my height, a zone blocking guard. He thinks that's where I'd fit best ... [Cal] said they love what I do on the field, love how I finish blocks. I'm a hard worker in the classroom, and I give it all that I've got. I've been working at it for a long time, and to get this offer means a lot.\" \nPalisades runs a lot of run-pass option plays, and this season, the Dolphins plowed the way for running back Innocent Okoh to rush for 1,965 yards and 21 touchdowns. On the season, Riley and his line blocked for a run game that tore off 3,496 yards on the ground. \n\"We love to run,\" Riley said. \"I like to run, personally. I love finishing blocks. I love run blocking.\" \nUpon Riley's announcement of the offer, he got a hearty congratulations from current Cal linebacker Ray Davison . \nhttp://www.scout.com/college/california/story/1757463-busy-week-for-cal-... \"We know each other from church family,\" Riley said. \"My godfather is really good friends with him, and throughout the course of the season, I'd DM him questions I had about the game, tell him how I was doing. I kept him updated with my accomplishments. When I got all-league, I DM'd him. When I got Lineman of the Year for our league, I DM'd him. When I made all-city, I DM'd him. He's been a really good support system, through this whole process, and that led me up to here. I'm grateful to have him as a great motivation.\" \nRiley is still getting to know the staff, and the program, as he's only been speaking to the coaches for the past few days, but intends to take an unofficial visit some time this spring. \n\"I want to meet the coaches face-to-face, meet the players, and just learn what the program is all about,\" Riley said. \"My coach told me that coach Greatwood is an amazing coach. He did great things at Oregon, and he was like, 'You're very blessed to have contact with such a great coach.'\" \nAcademically, Riley has a 2.7 GPA, but, he said, \"By the end of this semester, it will most definitely be a 3.0\" \nNevada told Riley that he's on their \"wait and watch\" list, and he has visited Fresno State as part of the Bulldogs' Junior Day.
