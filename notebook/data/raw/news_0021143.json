The very conversation Trump mentions in his post as being ignored is at the very top of the story. \nWhat may have caught the president’s attention is this paragraph — the third one in the article — with the Nov. 14 mention: \n“The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. Mr. Xi, stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan in December and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the One China policy, had not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected.” \nThat was just a reference to the prior time they talked before the evening of Feb. 9. \nTweet No. 2: “LAWFARE: ‘Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute.’ A disgraceful decision!” 7:15 a.m. Eastern Time \nBackstory No. 2: Trump is still smarting over the unanimous decision of the three-judge federal panel. The judges paid him an underhanded compliment, by the way: when Trump said during the campaign the U.S. needed a Muslim ban – well, they believed him. \nON TAP FRIDAY: Trump meets with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and in the afternoon. The two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:06:58.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
