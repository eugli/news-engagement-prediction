We can make a big fuss over Scotland or Northern Ireland.” GETTY In September 2016 Verhofstadt was appointed lead Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament \nMalta’s Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, said: “We want a fair deal for the UK, but that deal needs to be inferior to membership… Thinking it can be otherwise indicates a detachment from reality.”When article 50 is triggered and the two-year negotiating period begins, European politicians believe the pressure will be on British negotiators. They add that the UK will leave without a free trade deal if they continue with the current approach. \nGuy Verhofstadt, the Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament and the leader of the liberal ALDE group said: “Any attempts by UK ministers to divide EU countries will only slow down and complicate negotiations. The EU will negotiate as a united bloc.”In addition, the European Parliament’s legal affairs committee have released a report claiming it will be “difficult, if not impossible” to get an agreement from all the EU countries. GETTY Davis has a tough task as he tries to meet with EU officials \nGianni Pittella, leader of the socialist bloc in the parliament, said: “The UK’s apparent attempt to split Europe was certainly not the best way to kick off very complicated negotiations. This inappropriate attitude could undermine the outcome.”He also hinted that Britain could be forced to become a low tax state in order to survive after Brexit: “I was surprised because I don’t think it is in the interests of the UK to open this phase in an aggressive way. We reject this blackmail.\"It is not fair, it is not elegant, it is not useful.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:16:12.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
