Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki \nIt will be recalled that Governor Obaseki had, after his inauguration, said that he would not be lavishing state funds to celebrate his first 100 days in office, as he believed that the people of the state will judge for themselves what will be achieved in his first 100 days and what will be achieved in one year. \nHowever, the APC youth leader, Asuen, said: “Governor Obaseki is a silent achiever. From what we have seen in his first 1000 days, it is obvious that Edo is in safe hands. Going round GRA today, the roads are being rehabilitated while new ones are being constructed in other parts of the state.” Nwafor Polycarp ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:30:38.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
