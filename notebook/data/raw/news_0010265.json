The controversial plans, set to be enacted within four years, have been confirmed at seven English hospitals – and another 17 are in the balance. A&E units are set to close in east London, West Bromwich and Birmingham – and comprehensive emergency departments elsewhere will be replaced with ‘urgent care centres’. Health bosses are planning to close or downgrade 24 A&E units as part of a huge NHS shake-up. Changes have been confirmed at seven units and another 17 are in the balance The plans are part of a scheme to streamline the NHS in a bid to improve efficiency and save millions of pounds. Every hospital trust in England was ordered last year to identify departments which could be closed or merged with other institutions. Bosses at NHS England have divided the country into 44 regions, with each told to draw up a ‘sustainability and transformation plan’ to share resources between hospitals. In most areas, this will involve sharing specialist units such as rheumatology, dermatology or urology. A&E units are set to close in east London, West Bromwich and Birmingham – and comprehensive emergency departments elsewhere will be replaced with ‘urgent care centres’ But research by the Health Service Journal has revealed 24 hospitals where A&E units are also at risk. This means 14 per cent of England’s ‘type one’ emergency units – consultant-led, comprehensive 24-hour services – might be lost. Closing A&E units has always been considered politically toxic.
