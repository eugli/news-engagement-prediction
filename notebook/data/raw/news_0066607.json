FAIRFAX NZ \nA plan on how to manage Lake Rotoroa and the domain around it attracted just under 200 submissions. Water quality was a common issue. \nOn the same day, the Government announced a bid to have 90 per cent of Kiwi lakes and rivers swimmable by 2040. \nâ€‹READ MORE: \nCouncil's plan for the lake shouldn't focus on new assets and ignore the centrepiece, submitter Felicity Beadle said. TOM LEE/FAIRFAX NZ \nMany Hamilton residents remember when they didn't think twice about taking a dip in Hamilton Lake. \nShe didn't want people scurrying around with their backs to the lake, hoping they didn't get water on their bodies. \nBeadle and Karen O'Meeghan presented on behalf of 110 lake residents whose signatures were collected in a door-knocking exercise. \nResidents' kids have gone kayaking on the lake and come out with a rash, Beadle said, yet older people could remember the days of swimming in the lake and even when there was a waterslide, Beadle said. KELLY HODEL/FAIRFAX NZ \nDucks and their poo are a big problem when it comes to water quality, council heard. \n\"Now we're just faced with toxic warning signs.\" Ad Feedback \nResidents wanted council to give specifics on water standards and timeframes, O'Meeghan said. \nWater quality was one of the top issues in just under 200 submissions to council on its Draft Lake Domain Management Plan. PETER DRURY/FAIRFAX NZ \nHarmful bacteria, such as E coli, is the lake's most pressing problem, multidisciplinary group Restore said. \nIn response, council staffers suggested a wording change to state that the water would be safe for swimming and recreation, instead of just recreation. \nAnd councillors, except Garry Mallett, voted to recommend that and other suggested changes be approved when they go before council's Community and Services Committee. \nMaking the lake swimmable isn't an extra commitment, a council report said. GEORGE HEARD FAIRFAX NZ \nKayaking on Lake Rotoroa has left local kids with a rash, say residents who submitted to Hamilton City Council. \nThat's because the Ministry for the Environment guidelines require the same level of water quality for both swimming and recreation. \nSubmitter David Menkes said Hamilton needs evidence of what's behind the levels of E coli in the lake. \n\"Then we can nail the ducks being public enemy number one in this regard,\" he said in his individual submission. \nHe'd like to see an artificial pond near the rose garden to shift the ducks from the children's playground, and a wetland that could filter out their poo. \nWetlands are also favoured by multidisciplinary group Restore (Restorative Ecological Strategies to Optimise Rotoroa's Environment), which Menkes is part of. \n\"The encouraging thing is we're not far off a swimmable standard [in the lake],\" he said, as part of the group's submission. \nRestore sees three main problems. \nThe main one is pathogenic bacteria - bad bugs that make us sick - and ducks are likely the main culprit. \nHowever, the group had data to show E coli levels vary at different times of the year and in different parts of the lake. \n\"You remove the ducks and in a year or two you're probably going to obtain those E coli levels that are acceptable,\" presenter David Hamilton said. \nThe two other problems are excess nutrients that lead to algae and toxic heavy metals. \nWetlands could help in all three problem areas and filter stormwater coming in, the presenters said. \nThey also suggested the reintroduction of native mussels and koura to help clean up the lake. \nAfter deliberations, councillors resolved to support the plan proposed by staffers, but it still has to go to another committee for a vote. \nThose in favour were Councillors Angela O'Leary, Martin Gallagher, Philip Yeung, Paula Southgate, Siggi Henry and Leo Tooman, and Waikato Tainui repesentative Maree Pene. \nCouncillor Garry Mallett voted against the motion, having earlier unsuccessfully proposed wording changes. \nCouncillors also wanted to work with Waikato District Health Board to determine whether it is safe to eat fish from the lake, and how to improve access to the lake from the hospital. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:27:35.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
