The win came in his 100th start as a professional on the PGA Tour. Winning 9 percent of the time is outrageous when the best players in the world only win around 5 percent, but it gets even better for young Spieth. \nHe became just the second golfer since World War II to win nine times at the age of 23 or younger, according to Justin Ray of Golf Channel . The other guy is someone you may have heard of, Tiger Woods. \nSpieth also joins Woods and Rory McIlroy as golfers who have won nine times in their first 100 events as a pro on the PGA Tour. Here is a sampling of current golfers along with which tournament they got win No. 9. Golfer 177 Match Play Championship \nOf course the Tiger comparisons are not completely fair as Woods got win No. 28 (!) by the time he played his 100th event, but this is still impressive company for Spieth. It is maybe fitting that he is closest to Phil Mickelson, the man whose career I think he is most likely to emulate. \nMickelson has 42 wins all time in just over 550 events with five majors. He's an ambassador for the next generation. \nThis is the path for Spieth, and it's clear he's walking right on down. Woods should not be compared to anyone. McIlroy plays a lot on the European Tour and chooses his events more sparingly than Spieth. But Mickelson is the perfect comparison for Spieth, and a hell of a comparison it is. Youngest players to win 9 times on #PGATour since WWII: @TigerWoods 23 Yr-5 Mo @JordanSpieth 23 Yr-6 Mo @jacknicklaus 24 Yr-19 days — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) February 12, 2017 \nSpieth often talks about how his 2015 year should not be the standard going forward because, if he repeated that, he would have 50 majors and 125 wins to his name at the end of his career. That's true, but the career trajectory he's on is fair. \nA career that could end with 8-10 majors and over 40 wins is doable for Spieth, and he's right on pace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:50:19.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
