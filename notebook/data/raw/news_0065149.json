Movies that he’s up for making another Matrix movie, on the condition that the Wachowskis—who originally created and shepherded the successful sci-fi/action franchise—were still at the helm. And while I’m not convinced The Matrix needs a fourth movie or Keanu Reeves (more on that later) it does raise a question: Why has it been so long since a new installment in the Matrix franchise? \nThe influence of The Matrix and its sequels is still keenly felt. Last month saw the releases of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter and Underworld: Blood Wars —the latest installment in two long-running franchises that drew clear and considerable inspiration from The Matrix . Next month sees the release of Ghost in the Shell , which is adapted from the manga-turned-anime that served as one of the primary inspirations for The Matrix in the first place. \nSo how would you go about bringing The Matrix back? I have a few ideas. Don’t start with a movie. \nThe Matrix , The Matrix Reloaded , and The Matrix Revolutions turned out to be one of the last gasps of the movie trilogy—a once-entrenched Hollywood structural principle that feels almost restrained in our modern world of sprawling and deliberately endless \"cinematic universes.\" The three Matrix movies tell a definitively self-contained story, chronicling the rise and fall of Neo in the midst of a war between humans and machines. By the end of the final movie, Neo is dead, and the war is over. It does not, on its face, leave particularly fertile ground for a fourth movie. EDITOR’S PICK How the Die Hard Franchise Can Get Back on Track \nBut the universe established by The Matrix is also dense and versatile enough to sustain any number of stories. So why rush right back into the fray with another massive blockbuster? You can look at any number of mediums, but I’d lean toward reintroducing audiences to The Matrix via a TV show—ideally at a creator-driven home like Netflix, where the Wachowskis have already launched a successful TV series . Imagine something like the Matrix equivalent of Netflix’s Jessica Jones , which tells a smaller, more self-contained story within the broader context of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or even something like Black Mirror —an anthology series telling a plurality of standalone stories that add up to a unified whole (in this case, not just a cohesive theme but a cohesive setting). Either way, a limited series would reestablish the rules of The Matrix in a whole new medium, generating enthusiasm and paving the way for whatever would come next. Take the \"cinematic universe\" to the next level. \nSo what would come next? Matrix fans could justly argue that the franchise already did everything I just suggested more than a decade ago, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was even a glimmer in Kevin Feige’s eye. After the success of The Matrix , the Wachowskis didn’t just make two blockbuster sequels. They oversaw a grand, interconnected universe that spanned comics, video games, and The Animatrix , a terrific direct-to-DVD spinoff featuring nine short animated movies set within the Matrix universe. \nCrucially, the Wachowskis ensured that all these disparate Matrix stories fit together into a unified and canonical narrative. One segment in The Animatrix sets the stage for the video game Enter the Matrix , which chronicled the adventures of Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Ghost (Anthony Wong) during the events of The Matrix Reloaded . Years after the release of The Matrix Revolutions , Morpheus was killed off in an massively-multiplayer online game set in the aftermath of the film trilogy, which also hinted that Neo might be alive after all. \nBut just as crucially, the Wachowskis also ensured that none of these side stories were essential to understanding the core narrative of the Matrix trilogy. Sure, it might have been a little weird when The Matrix Reloaded cut away from Niobe just as she went off to storm into a power plant—a story that continues, more or less seamlessly, in the Enter the Matrix video game—but if you didn’t care enough to explore every corner of the Matrix universe, you could get the complete stories of Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, and the villainous Agent Smith just by watching the movies. Everything else was an opt-in proposition, designed to enhance your enjoyment without compromising the broader appeal. \nAt the time, it was groundbreaking—but now that audiences have been conditioned to follow these kinds of stories over multiple mediums, The Matrix can do even more within an interconnected universe, leaping nimbly from film to TV to novels to comics to video games to tell stories of every conceivable shape and size. And while the Wachowskis would obviously serve as the keepers and architects of the Matrix franchise, they could also delegate stories to other talented creators who wanted to leave their stamp on the material—much like The Animatrix , which boasted compelling shorts from Aeon Flux creator Peter Chung, Ninja Scroll creator Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Cowboy Bebop director Shinichirō Watanabe. Keep the mythology loose. \nAnd here’s where we move from the principles behind the two Matrix sequels and start discussing their actual quality—which, I’m sorry to say, is not particularly high. Back in 1999, The Matrix earned its reputation as the thinking person’s action flick by incorporating a slew of philosophical and cultural references into the narrative—everything from Plato to Immanuel Kant to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland . But the sequels took this frisson of pop-intellectualism and made it the main course—a bizarre stew of confused and confusing references all jumbled together. Matrix diehards delighted in deciphering every byzantine reference, and the franchise spawned a cottage industry of books reinterpreting The Matrix through the lens of philosophy or religion or whatever—but these flourishes eventually overwhelmed the core narrative, resulting in the overcomplicated Matrix Reloaded and the straight-up bad Matrix Revolutions . \nBack in 1999, The Matrix earned its reputation as the thinking person’s action flick. But the sequels took its frisson of pop-intellectualism and made it the main course. \nSo if we’re bringing The Matrix back, let’s take it back to basics without rebooting the existing trilogy and starting from scratch. Humans created machines. Machines turned on humans, and eventually conquered them, immersing them in a computerized simulation for harvesting purposes. A small contingent of humans managed to break free and mount a rebellion. Morpheus, their leader, believed in Neo, a mythological \"Chosen One\" who was fated to end the war. And hooray, he did! So what’s next? Keep Neo out of it. \nWith apologies to Keanu Reeves— seriously, go see John Wick: Chapter 2 —there’s no reason a new Matrix should follow Neo, and plenty of reasons why it shouldn’t. His story is over. And even if Neo hadn’t been killed off, the aftermath of The Matrix Revolutions poses a more interesting question: What happens when the war is over? If you take the ramifications of this story to their logical conclusion, this is essentially the reconstruction era of The Matrix , as the humans and machines adjust to what looked like a very tentative peace. That feels like a story with exploring—particularly in the absence of a galvanizing figure like Neo, who would probably be written off as a morale-boosting myth by anyone who didn’t actually witness how he ended the war. A new Matrix story could easily center on a brand-new \"red pill\" character, newly awakened to reality, learning about the history of the Matrix (and filling the audience in on everything that has happened in the 15 years that have passed since the war ended in The Matrix Revolutions ). \nReeves is great, and Neo was more or less explicitly painted as a Christ figure, so The Matrix could eventually find an excuse to bring him back—but there’s too much potentially compelling story about Neo’s absence to begin with his return. But this principle doesn’t apply to any of The Matrix ’s other extant characters—so by all means, bring back Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, whose role as the unofficial guide to the Matrix would be a logical way to tie the new franchise back to the old one. Don’t mess with bullet time. \nIn 1999, The Matrix made also-ran action movies like The World is Not Enough and Wild Wild West look positively retrograde with its groundbreaking special effects. Of course, these innovative sequences were immediately copied and parodied until they had totally lost that initial wow factor. When your signature technique has been repurposed by everything from Scary Movie to Shrek to Kung Pow! Enter the Fist , it’s time to put it on the shelf for a while. \nIn the years since The Matrix ’s release, slow-motion action scenes have since become the norm. (Hell, Zack Snyder has basically made a career out of them.) But in the long run, the spate of lazy Matrix parodies may have done the franchise a favor, because it stopped other action directors from unironically copying them outright. Enough time has passed that the hallmarks of The Matrix ’s classic action sequences—the bullets freezing in mid-air, the camera rotating around a character in the middle of a kick—look pretty cool and novel again. So why mess with a winning formula? Use cutting-edge modern technology for the same kind of action, and audiences will remember why they loved it so much in the first place. Get weird. \nIn 2005—long after most people had stopped paying attention to The Matrix—the Wachowskis oversaw the release of the video game The Matrix: The Path of Neo, which allowed gamers to step into Neo’s sunglasses and trench coat for many of the most memorable moments in the Matrix trilogy. And how did this particular game end? Well: \nYES. That is the kind of crazy shit I want to see in another Matrix . The Wachowskis’ idiosyncratic approach has led to films both good ( Speed Racer ) and bad ( Jupiter Ascending ), but it is unmistakably theirs. In an era where Hollywood blockbusters could hardly be more cut-and-paste, a weird, ambitious, and obsessively groundbreaking franchise like The Matrix is exactly what we need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:43:13.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
