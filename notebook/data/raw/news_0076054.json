February 27, 2017 2:34 AM PST Andrew Hoyle/CNET \nBusiness in the US has been tough for GoPro, so now the company looks to be targeting China. \nOn Sunday at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, GoPro announced it will integrate an upgraded version of Quik, its photo editing app, into Huawei's new babies, the P10 and the P10 Plus phones, reports Bloomberg . \nMeanwhile, GoPro has struggled in the last year , fighting weak sales and ratcheting back expectations. The company late last year laid off 15 percent of its workforce , and in a separate issue had to recall thousands of its Karma drones , some of which were found to lose power during flight. \nHuawei's dual-camera equipped P10 and P10 Plus are all about the camera.

Users are also able to quickly customize the video and share it on social media.
