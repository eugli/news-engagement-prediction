Please, Louise, judge — here they come, here they come,\" Trump said, unleashing a torrent of scathing sarcasm over social media. \nGorsuch, a federal appellate judge for the Tenth Circuit, was not, and has never been, \"of the United States Supreme Court.\" He will have to be confirmed by the Senate before he could potentially fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death last February. \n\"I dunno, you figure it out,\" one Twitter user wrote , reacting to Trump's confusing introduction. President Trump flubbed his words a bit while announcing his Supreme Court nominee Tuesday evening.

He's a rockstar,\" Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told the Daily News . \"He's a judge's judge. Every American should be proud.\" Trump picking Judge Neil Gorsuch (l.) was met by both praise and condemnations. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) \nBut the Denver-based judge's record on issues such as women's rights and campaign finance reform alarmed many Democrats, and the sting from the GOP blocking President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for 11 months still lingered. \n\"This is the first time in American history that one party has blockaded a nominee for almost a year in order to deliver a seat to a President of their own party,\" Democratic Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the Court.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:13:52.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
