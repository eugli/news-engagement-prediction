Just prepare your wallet, because OLED isn't cheap. \nBut that's just one of the rumors we're hearing. Check out all the latest scuttlebutt surrounding Apple's next iPhone. There WILL be an S model of the iPhone 7. Apple \nA Barclay's report obtained by MacRumors said Apple would skip the S model this year, which has historically followed each new phone version. The report claimed Apple would instead jump directly from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 — possibly called the iPhone 10 — in 2017. \nNow, however, it appears we could expect S models of the iPhone 7 next year with updates to the processor and a new red color option, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and the Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara, which are both highly reliable sources. The iPhone 7 \"S\" models could have bigger screens. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nAnother Barclays report from November claimed that Apple is cooking up two iPhones with bigger screens than the usual 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens on the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. \nSpecifically, the analysts say the new screens will measure 5 inches and 5.8 inches. \nThat said, the report doesn't specify that the new screen sizes are for S models of the iPhone 7 line. However, considering the rumor contains details on two new screen sizes, and the premium iPhone 8 is rumored to only be sold in one size, we could deduce that the Barclays report is referring to two S models. In addition to the new S models, Apple will sell a third \"high-end\" iPhone with a medium-sized screen and a wraparound design. A custom iPhone 5S made to look even more premium than the original models. Gold genie \nA report from Kuo predicted that Apple would release a \"high-end\" iPhone with a larger 5.8-inch screen compared with the iPhone 7 Plus's 5.5-inch screen. \nYet more recent reports and rumors claim the premium iPhone 8 will have a smaller 5.1- or 5.2-inch screen that will wrap around the edges of the device. It sounds like a similar design concept as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. \nSince 2017 marks the iPhone's 10th anniversary, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple does something special to mark the anniversary of its most important product. The front surface of the ultra-premium iPhone will be all display, with no borders or bezels. YouTube/ConceptsiPhone \nRumors that the iPhone 8 would have an all-display front surface emerged from John Gruber, the plugged-in Apple blogger and podcaster from Daring Fireball . \nGruber says he has heard insider scuttlebutt that the iPhone 8's front won't have any bezels or borders, and that it'll be one large display. The iPhone 8 will mostly be made of glass, with an aluminum frame. Tyler/Flickr \nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims the iPhone 8's body will be made of glass . If so, it could have a similar aesthetic as the iPhone 4 and 4S, both of which had a glass back. \nA report from the Japanese news site Nikkei says Apple is indeed ditching the metal back design for an all-glass back and metal frame. The home button will be invisible. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider \nIn January 2017, the KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed Apple would use optical sensors for the Touch ID home button. According to Kuo, optical sensors will allow the Touch ID button to be hidden, as they can read fingerprints through thicker OLED panels than the current iPhone's capacitive Touch ID sensor , which needs to be exposed. \nPrevious rumors that support Kuo's prediction include John Gruber's claims. He says the home button, which also houses the fingerprint sensor, will be embedded into the front glass panel , making it invisible. \nGruber's claims line up nicely with rumors posted by the tech site I4U that a future iPhone will have an embedded home button. \nRecently, the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi released new phones with the same technology that Apple described in a patent for alternative home buttons, which could give us an idea of how a future home button on the iPhone 8 could work. The iPhone 8 will have an incredible screen. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nThis could be one of the most popular rumors about the \"special 10th anniversary edition\" of the iPhone. \nIn February, GSMArena reported that Apple struck a huge deal to buy 60 million OLED displays from Samsung. One month prior, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed Apple would reportedly use a different technology for its Touch ID fingerprint reader, which is linked to the rumors that Apple's next iPhone will have an OLED display. \nPreviously, rumors from The Korea Herald suggested the high-end iPhone would have an AMOLED display, even though the other iPhones released in 2017 are expected to have LCD displays, like past iPhone models. \nOLED displays are superior to LCD displays, which are currently used on the iPhone 7, in almost every way. They're more power efficient, produce better colors, better contrast, and better brightness. \nThe iPhone 8 will support wireless charging. SCAVidsHD/YouTube \nA Barclay's report summarized by MacRumors said the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging. In general, we know that Apple is looking into the technology because of a patent filed on September 9. \nIn addition, Sharp president Tai Jeng-Wu apparently mentioned to university students that the next iPhone will include wireless charging . \nIn February 2017, an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider that the company recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, an industry group that develops a widely-used wireless charging standard. It's not a direct admission that that Apple will add wireless charging to its upcoming iPhones, but it's a pretty good hint that Apple is very interested in expanding its wireless power technology beyond the Apple Watch. It won't have a headphone jack. AP \nThis one is easy. Since the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack, we can expect future iPhones won't feature a headphone jack either. The premium iPhone 8 will likely cost over $1,000. \nFast Company's Mark Sullivan expects the upcoming \"special 10th-anniversary edition\" of the iPhone to cost more than $1,000, which lines up with many of the rumors coming out of Apple's Asian supply chain. The smaller iPhone models will not get the dual-lens camera from the iPhone 7 Plus. Andri Koolme/Flickr \nKuo believes the dual-lens camera will remain an exclusive feature for the larger iPhone models from 2017 onward. \nThere might have been a glimmer of hope that the dual-lens camera would make its way to the smaller iPhone model, as the optical image stabilization that was exclusive to the iPhone 6S Plus trickled its way down to the regular iPhone 7. But if Kuo's predictions are true, this will not be the case. So, don't expect a dual-lens camera in the smaller iPhone 7S; expect it in the larger iPhone 7S Plus, and in the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 could have facial recognition powered by \"new laser sensors.\" Ian Waldie/Getty Images \nApple's next iPhone could include \"some form of facial/gesture recognition\" powered a \"new laser sensor\" and infrared sensor on the front surface of the phone, according to a research note distributed to clients by Cowen and Company. We're not sure about the validity of this rumor, but it would make sense to see some new technologies if the iPhone 8 really does cost over $1,000.
