Esther Lin, MMA Fighting Ovince Saint Preux is getting back in the cage quickly, but at least he wonâ€™t have far to travel. The former UFC light heavyweight contender will take on Marcos Rogerio de Lima at UFC Fight Night: Swanson vs. Lobov on April 22 in Nashville, the UFC announced Friday. Saint Preux lives and trains in Knoxville, Tenn., the same place he attended college, playing football at the University of Tennessee. Saint Preux (19-10) is coming off a very close decision loss to Volkan Oezdemir earlier this month at UFC Fight Night 104 in Texas. He has now lost three in a row, though one of those came against pound-for-pound king Jon Jones last year in an interim title fight. Saint Preux, 33, had only two losses in the UFC before this current stretch. In his last fight, De Lima (15-4-1) beat Jeremy Kimball by first-round TKO at UFC on FOX 23 in January. The Brazilian slugger has alternated wins and losses in his last four fights. De Lima, 31, is an alum of The Ultimate Fighter Brazil 3. In the main event of UFC Fight Night 108, Cub Swanson takes on Artem Lobov in a featherweight matchup. No co-main event has been made official yet.
