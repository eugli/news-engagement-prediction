Other forms mean patients have abnormally high levels of cholesterol, increasingly their risk of dying from a heart attack by 100-fold. Last April, England cricketer James Taylor was forced to retire at the age of 26 due to a rare form of arrhythmia. Miles Frost (pictured), eldest son of broadcaster Sir David Frost, collapsed and died aged 31 in 2015 And Miles Frost, eldest son of broadcaster Sir David Frost, collapsed and died aged 31 in 2015. It was discovered he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but had not been told that his father, who had died from a heart attack two years previously aged 74, had the condition. Children have a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the faulty gene from a parent who has it. The British Heart Foundation is calling for systematic screening across a patient's family tree as soon as they are diagnosed. Some parts of the country – such as the health service in Oxford – will track down family members and offer them testing. But most areas of the UK are not nearly as thorough. Such defects can affect people of any age, with most cases of sudden cardiac death occurring before 35. Yet if they are spotted, effective treatments are available, such aa a pacemaker to control an abnormal heartbeat or an implantable defibrillator to restart the heart. Drugs such as statins can also be used. Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'If someone in your family has been diagnosed with or has died from what is suspected to be an inherited heart condition, you should speak to your GP or call our genetic information service for more information and support. I INHERITED DEFECT THAT KILLED MY DAD Emma Jayne Chamberlain, 32, (pictured) from Leicester, was four when her father died When Emma Jayne Chamberlain was four, her father Andy died of a severe heart condition. 'He was 29 years old and he passed away in the night in my mother's arms,' she says. Miss Chamberlain's father had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic condition in which the muscle wall of the heart becomes thickened, altering the heartbeat. Miss Chamberlain's father (pictured) had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy At 16, she was diagnosed with the same rare condition. Initially her doctors simply monitored her, with annual checks. But when she was 30 she blacked out at the Leicester florist where she worked. Tests showed she had irregular heartbeats. 'There were a couple of moments where my heartbeats were so irregular, that they say my heart could have stopped,' says Miss Chamberlain, now 32. Doctors implanted a cardioverter-defibrillator, a tiny machine which will restart her heart if it stops. 'The whole experience has made me realise how precious life is, and how easily it could be taken away,' she says. 'My sister Amy carries the gene, but it has not affected her heart. We are waiting to see if her two-year-old son Oakley will have it or not. I am single and have no children, but I'm undecided about whether I want to have any, because of the fear of passing the gene on.' 'The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of people across the UK who are unaware that they could be at risk of sudden death. 'If undetected and untreated, inherited heart conditions can be deadly and they continue to devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning. We urgently need to fund more research to better understand these heart conditions, make more discoveries, develop new treatments and save more lives.'
