It comes with a large manor house, and is for sale for $2.59m. \nHere's a chance to be king or queen of your own castle. \nWell, actually if you do buy this beautiful, 12th-century Norman castle and the title that comes with it, you would be Lord of Wilton Castle. \nWilton castle in Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, UK is a scheduled ancient monument that has come on the market for £1.5 million (NZ$2.59m). When you compare that price with Auckland houses, it seems a steal. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nThe next owner of the Castle can also buy the title to become Lord of Wilton Castle. \nAnd look what you get. Along with the Norman features, there are architectural elements from Tudor, Elizabethan, Georgian and Victorian eras. \nREAD MORE PETE SADLER IMAGES \nCreepers cover much of the ruins, which form a stunning backdrop to the beautifully landscaped gardens. \nThe beautifully restored manor house on the property, which was built from the castle bricks, has five bedrooms and numerous reception areas, which makes it an ideal wedding venue. And the beautifully landscaped grounds would make Capability Brown proud. \nOf course you also get the history. The castle was originally built from wood as a motte-and-bailey castle on the Wye River, where it was used to defend England's border with Wales. Over time it was rebuilt in brick, and it even boasted a moat filled with water. \nHome to a garrison for more than 300 years, the castle was bought by Guys Hospital in 1731 so the surrounding land could be farmed. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nThree of the five original towers remain, with the Grand Tower able to be converted into guest premises. \nThe moat is still there, minus the water. Three of the original five towers also remain, and there is potential to restore the Great Tower into guest accommodation. A drawbridge, perhaps? \nYou also get existing residents – a family of eagles nesting in the ruins, and there's bound to be a few bats. \nThe castle, which sits on more than 8000 square metres, has been listed by Jackson-Stops & Staff. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nArched windows frame slices of the view. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nThe interior of the restored five-bedroom manor house retains the traditional character. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nThe property comes with resident baby eagles. PETE SADLER IMAGES \nThe Wye River runs along the bottom of the garden. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:25:36.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
