It’s not clear how long the repairs will take.\nThe water ban is necessary to make sure stored water meets demand for firefighting, drinking and cooking, officials said.\nIn addition, truck fills will be closed until further notice.\nRelated Links Strathcona County - Water ban", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:43:33.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
