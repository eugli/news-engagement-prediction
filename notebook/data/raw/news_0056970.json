Heller case excluded coverage of assault weapons.\nThe United States has among the most permissive gun rights in the world. Because the U.S. Congress has long been a graveyard for gun control legislation, some states and localities have enacted their own measures.\nIn total, seven states and the District of Columbia have laws that ban semiautomatic rifles, several of which that have faced various court challenges as there is a longstanding legal debate over the scope of Second Amendment rights.\nFour appeal courts have rejected Second Amendment challenges to bans on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, King wrote.\nIn 2015, U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake upheld Maryland's law that bans the AR-15 and other military-style rifles and shotguns and limits magazine capacity to 10 rounds, but a smaller panel of circuit court judges reversed her ruling in 2016. The case could be eventually be heard by the Supreme Court.\nThe majority \"has gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms,\" Judge William Traxler wrote in the dissent of the ruling released on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:03:39.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
