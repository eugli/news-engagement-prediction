No, this isn’t the start to a great fashion joke; these are locations of some of Alexander Wang ’s recent fashion shows. The designer has made a habit of staging his Spring shows at Manhattan’s Pier 94, an enormous warehouse space that is often subdivided into a runway and a party area, transformed by a big reveal, the most memorable of which involved some precariously perched pole dancers. But for Fall shows, Wang brings the fashion set around New York City, finding places far and wide that are in line with his bad-boy ethos. For this season’s Fall 2017 show, the invite only reads 146th St. and Broadway. No address. No further details. So I did what any aspiring Wang Gang member would do, took the 1 train uptown, and handicapped the likeliness of the four corners—and center—of Broadway and 146th Street as the site of Wang’s next runway. Abandoned RKO Hamilton Theater A beautiful ruin that’s become a graffiti hangout, you say? Yes, the abandoned RKO Hamilton Theater ticks all the boxes for an Alexander Wang show space. It’s a classic New York landmark, has a rough-and-tumble spirit, and looks like a place that the Wang Gang might hang out after hours for one of its riotous parties. It opened in 1913 and had several lives as a performance space, movie theater, boxing hot spot, and disco until its theater was closed permanently in the aughts. Part of the lobby has been for rent for some time, and though it’s currently owned by a real estate developer, it has yet to transform into anything but a beautiful ruin. Key Food The chance of Alexander Wang’s show taking place at Key Food is less likely than the abandoned theater, but wouldn't it be amazing? Wang has a well-publicized love of grocery and convenience stores—some of his campaigns have been shot in them and his Spring 2017 after-party featured a mobile 7/Eleven. The thought of Binx, Lexi, et al. strutting through the chips section snacking on Cheetos is an image that makes the subway ride up there feel well and truly worth it. Working against this Key Food's chances is the fact that there are several more easily accessible Key Food stores downtown. Subway, Fruits and Vegetables grocery, Sprint store On the southwestern corner of the intersection is a strip of restaurants, grocery stores, and a Sprint store, that, while providing a singular runway experience, seem unlikely for logistical reasons alone. Can’t have models walking outside between stores in the cold of February. . . Apollo Pharmacy The Apollo Pharmacy on the Northeastern corner is a staple for supplements, all natural remedies, and general pharmaceutical stuff. If you need a B-12 vitamin, it’s surely the place to go, but it’s too small to handle the crowds of a Wangfest. Broadway Traffic Divider The odds are slim, but you never know: The Alexander Wang show might just stop traffic on Broadway with a runway right down the middle of the street. We’ll let you know if that happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:36:15.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
