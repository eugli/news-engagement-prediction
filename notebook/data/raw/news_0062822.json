Joseph Hassan Farrokh, a 29-year-old from Woodbridge, would travel overseas first and Elhassan, 26, would follow at a later date, according to a news release from the Justice Department.\nThe two men attempted to plan their trip to join the Islamic State by using a computer app they thought law enforcement did not monitor, prosecutors said. In mid-2015, they began exchanging digital messages about the two trips. They also tried to find someone from within the group that could help them with logistical issues in leaving the U.S. and joining the terrorists.\nOn Jan. 15, 2016, Elhassan drove Farrokh from his home in Woodbridge to an area in Richmond that was about a mile from the airport, prosecutors said. Farrokh then cabbed the rest of the distance to Richmond International Airport, but special agents of the FBI nabbed him after passing through security.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\n  the Daily on Defense newsletter.   issue soon! Later in the day, other agents approached Elhassan and asked him about Farrokh's whereabouts, the Justice Department release said.

He also told falsehoods, the prosecutors said, by claiming Farrokh would return in two weeks and denying their support for the Islamic State.\nFarrokh was sentenced last year to 102 months (eight and a half years) in prison.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:24:34.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
