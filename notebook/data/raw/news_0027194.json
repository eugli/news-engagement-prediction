Dedicating the nine-Grammy-nominated magnum opus to her mother, Tina Lawson, Beyoncé dug deep into Lawson’s rich Southern roots not only for creative references but also as a way to undergird their indelible bond. And that connection has never been better displayed than on tonight’s Grammy Awards stage, which the two women shared. In their rousing display of queenly style, Beyoncé and Lawson were clearly cut from the same cloth. Beyoncé’s showstopping performance that evoked the divine began when Lawson introduced her daughter in a scintillating, figure-flattering black gown. A diamond pendant glimmered around her neck as she beamed with pride. Moments later, a moving image of Beyoncé emerged against a black backdrop, the expecting pop star outfitted in a gold chain-linked bra while a harness belt hung below her growing stomach. With a gilded sun goddess headdress adhered to her head and a lemonade yellow swath blowing behind her, Beyoncé seemed to be tapping into her cosmic powers. As she moved into a heartfelt performance of “Love Drought,” another image appeared on-screen of Bey joined by her mother and her daughter, Blue Ivy. Lawson poised regally beside Beyoncé in a trailing goddess gown in that now-iconic shade of yellow, while Blue sat alongside her mother in a pint-size caped frock. The moving family portrait was a testament not only to the ties between the Knowles women but also to the strength of the female bond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:31:07.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
