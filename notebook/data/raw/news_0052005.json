The news was floating around that the actress was raped by her former driver and his friends while she was heading for Kochi from her home in Thrissur. It was said that the abductors also shot videos and took pictures of her while abusing her. Now it turns out that the actress wasn’t raped. However, she was abducted and harassed. Director Priyadarshan said that he talked to the actress who herself confirmed it to him that she wasn’t raped. \ncinemalive.in “First of all, she was NOT raped,” he said. “How can something so grave and evil be trivialized by wrong reportage? I spoke to her after the awful incident and she very clearly told me she was NOT raped. Yes, she was abducted apparently by her former driver and his friends, who has already been arrested thanks to the swift intervention and action of the cop in-charge. They forced themselves into her car, stripped her and took pictures apparently with the intention of demeaning and blackmailing her,” Bollywood Hungama quoted him as saying. Furthermore, the filmmaker said that it was shocking that the incident took place in Kochi as it is a “tightly knit community” and that everyone knows everyone else. “So, no one does anything that would bring shame to the person and community.” \nytimg.com \nThe director affirmed that she isn’t a helpless victim. He said that she is already engaged and is planning to get married next month. “She is engaged to marry a film producer. Her husband-to-be is standing by ‘B’ in her hour of trauma like a rock-solid partner. They are getting married next month. This incident, in no way, changes their plans.” he added. \nMore strength to the actress!
