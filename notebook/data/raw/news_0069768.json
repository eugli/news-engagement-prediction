The Associated Press Published Tuesday, February 21, 2017 8:51AM EST Last Updated Tuesday, February 21, 2017 9:01AM EST \nNEW YORK -- Restaurant Brands International says it's buying Popeyes for US$1.8 billion, bringing the chicken chain under the same corporate umbrella as Burger King and Tim Hortons. \nThe move fits with Restaurant Brands' approach of taking over well-known fast-food chains it sees as having the potential for significant expansion. The deal gives Popeyes shareholders $79 per share, representing a 27 per cent premium from its average price on Feb. 10. \nRestaurant Brands was created after Burger King, controlled by Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, bought Tim Hortons in 2014. Since then, the company has been striking deals with local operators to open additional locations around the world. \nRestaurant Brands has more than 20,000 locations globally. Popeyes has more than 2,600. Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:05:57.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
