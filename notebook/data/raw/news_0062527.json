Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images One of the pleasures of watching a Donald Trump campaign speech is the glaringly obvious contrast between his written remarks and his frequent, rambling riffs. Trump reading from the text is stilted and halting, often mispronouncing unfamiliar words (“seq-wes-chure?” he sputtered, trying to pronounce sequester ), while the free-form Trump is the familiar authentic narcissist.\nWhat made his speech to CPAC especially entertaining was the fact that the tonal contrast between his written and extemporaneous remarks mirrored a substantive contrast. The formal text was designed to position the president as an outsider-populist. But Trump kept interrupting his own speech with anecdotes that destroyed his own premise. “The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker,” he vowed, articulating one of the speech’s primary intended themes. “We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests.”\nTrump interspersed this bold promise with stories about him answering to donors, lobbyists, and special interests.\nHere is Trump in this same speech boasting about his meeting with a bunch of large companies:\nIn fact, I think I did more than any other pre-president, they say president-elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford, Chrysler, with General Motors, I just wanted to save a little time. Because Ford and Fiat, Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many little others… Here is Trump, again in the same speech, boasting about meeting with an even larger group of executives, where they “came to a lot of very good conclusions”:\nYesterday I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office, Caterpillar, Campbell’s soup, we had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell’s Soup. We had everybody. And we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of folks in the room will be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs and building them in this country, not in some other country. And here is Trump recounting his meeting with a corporate executive who hired lobbyists to win pipeline approval. The point of Trump’s story is that Trump gave the executive the exact policy outcome he had hired lobbyists to engineer:\nCan you imagine, I told this story the other day. Can you imagine the gentleman never met him, don’t know the name of his company, I sort of know it, I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big powerful company. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same with Dakota, difference place, got approval and everything in the case of Dakota and they couldn’t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. With the Keystone, they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with block sucker consultants sucking the blood out of the company. Don’t worry, I used them all my life, don’t worry, we will get it approved, I’m connected, I’m a lobbyist, don’t worry. Bottom line, Obama didn’t sign it. Could be 42,000 jobs somewhere around there, a lot of jobs. Didn’t sign it. Can you imagine, he gave up. It was dead. Now he’s doing nothing, calling his wife, hello, darling, I’m bored, that pipeline, that has killed us, killed our company. Knock, knock, mr. So-and-so, the Keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere has just been approved. Now can you imagine the expression and you know the sad part, the same blood-sucking consultants that hit him for all the money that failed will go back to him and say, didn’t we do a great job, we want more money. Right? That is the way the system works, a little bit off, but that is the way the system works. “That is the way the system works.” That sentence perfectly captures the authentic Trump view of the world — the view of the man who has donated to politicians of both parties, treated all policy as transactional, and disregarded any moral currency other than power or wealth. Trump can read populist denunciations of the system, but he doesn’t actually believe them. Not only does he see nothing wrong with a system in which wealthy, powerful people meet with him and he delivers them policy favors, his central role in the process strikes him as evidence of his own power and success. He is boasting about it because he cannot imagine it would reflect anything other than his own greatness. Trump is not a sophisticated enough thinker to grasp the contradiction between the character he is supposed to be performing in public and the actual role he keeps confessing.\nTags: top story the national interest politics donald trump cpac Trump Can’t Stop Undermining Claim to Represent Workers Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Most Viewed Stories This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Customs Agents Check Passengers’ IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak Connie Britton Leaves Nashville Fans With the Cold Comfort of a Heartfelt Coda After That Momentous Episode Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Video Games Are Better Than Real Life 15 Stars Reminisce About the Actors Who Used to Beat Them Out for Roles Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Counterterrorism Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 6:19 p.m. New York City Recorded Its Lowest Number of Traffic Fatalities in 2016 A small dip from 2015, but the third-straight yearly decline under Vision Zero.\n6:13 p.m. Democrats Make a Risky Pick for Response to Trump’s Big Speech to Congress Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear is an out-of-work centrist representing a party that’s energized on the left.\n6:04 p.m. Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress A leaked document shows House Republicans mulling controversial ideas like ending Medicaid as we know it and a new tax on employer-provided insurance.\n5:42 p.m. Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trump’s Argument for His Travel Ban It says citizenship in the Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is an “unlikely indicator” of a terrorism threat.\n4:50 p.m. GOP Tax Cut Waiting for Trump to Decide on Policy He Clearly Doesn’t Understand Don’t feel bad for Paul Ryan, he’ll end up getting a big tax cut for the rich in the end.\n4:31 p.m. A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record It’s been a hot month, with nearly 4,500 record highs set, compared to 29 record lows.\n3:51 p.m. Kansas Suspect Allegedly Said ‘Get Out of My Country,’ Then Shot 2 Indian Men The White House denied any links to President Trump’s rhetoric.\n3:39 p.m. White House Bars New York Times , CNN, and Politico From Press Briefing Earlier in the day, Trump explained that the media isn’t the “enemy of the people” — but the fake news media is .\n2:40 p.m. Trump Expected to Pick Man Known For Bad Economic Advice As Top Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett once co-authored a book imploring investors to enter the stock market — just before the dot-com bubble burst.\n2:37 p.m. Trump Offers Conservatives the World — in Exchange for Their Principles Is the mainstream right ready to replace its traditional values with pure nationalism?\n1:04 p.m. Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning It looked like Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s warm-up act in loosening protections for all minorities.\n12:57 p.m. Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests The president told CPAC the media “shouldn’t be allowed” to cite anonymous sources, and suggested people shouldn’t protest after an election.\n12:23 p.m. Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party “We will not answer to donors, lobbyists, or special interests … now here’s another story about me answering to special interests.”\n11:56 a.m. Trump’s Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups This may be the lowlight of a week that also saw him make an unhinged phone call to a critic that got recorded and published.\n11:51 a.m. Trump: U.S. Has ‘Fallen Behind’ on Nukes, Vows to Return to ‘Top of the Pack’ This isn’t the first time the president has appeared to advocate for nuclear proliferation.\n9:44 a.m. Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak The White House asked the FBI to leak exculpating details about Trump’s ties with Russia.
