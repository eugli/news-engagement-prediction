All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below and in: The r/lgbt FAQ Rules \nRule 1: No homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, racism, serophobia, ableism, or misogyny of any kind. If you are unclear about what may constitute any of the above, please see the LGBT FAQ . If you are using triggering language in an educational or demonstrative capacity, we ask that you please wrap it in a trigger warning, e.g. [](/tw \"problematic text\") . If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: \"[TW] Title of Post\" \nRule 2: Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space . Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just \"shouldn't be so sensitive.\" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow . /r/ainbow does not moderate discussion, but the community will expect that you treat them with respect. For more information, see /r/ainbow's FAQ . \nRule 3: Meta discussion will be directed to /r/LGBTOpenModmail . The mods check it frequently and will take suggestions into consideration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:46:08.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
