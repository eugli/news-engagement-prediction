The special edition merely offers a cosmetic change and a special accessory package. Underthe hood, it is the same Redmi Note 4 , we are already familiar with. \nWith that out of the way, the Redmi Note 4X Hatsune Miku Special Edition is nothing short of a fan's ultimate dream. A fan of what, you might ask? Well, Hatsune Miku is a singing synthesizer application that has been enjoying quite a bit of popularity in Japan. In essence, it is an app for Windows or macOS that sings and completes the experience with an avatar of what is said to be a 16-year old girl with signature turquoise hair. \nThe little digital singer, apparently has such a fan following that she fills up concert halls, performing as a holographic avatar. Frankly, if you are that into Hatsune Miku, chances are you are going to enjoy a Redmi Note 4 in one of the two new unique colors - Hatsune Green and Cherry Pink, complete with a signature on the back. You also get a stylized package, a printed protective case and limited edition Mi Power bank. \nAs already mentioned, the internals are exactly the same as on the international Redmi Note 4, which does make us wonder why Xiaomi felt the need for an \"X\" branding, along with the special edition description. This also brings about some additional confusion, since a higher-end Redmi Note 4X has been passing by the rumor mill as well. \nWe are not exactly sure if this excludes the announcement of a more powerful Redmi Note 4X version in the future, but this special edition come with a 5.5-inch, FullHD panel, Snapdragon 625 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. You also get a 13MP, plus 5MP camera setup, fingerprint reader and a 4100 mAh battery. \nThe special edition phone is expected to hit stores on February 14 for Valentine's Day. There is no word on pricing yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:42:54.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
