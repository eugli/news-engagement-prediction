Speaking with Empire , director Christopher McQuarrie opened up about the upcoming Mission: Impossible 6 , revealing the film starts production on April 10 in Paris. \n“It starts in a very unconventional way,” he told the outlet. “It does not start with action. That was the hardest pitch of this movie.” \nWhen asked about figuring out a way to top Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation ‘s plane stunt, McQuarrie replied: \n“I may have found something today. I came to Tom with a picture of something and Tom looked at it and said, ‘That’s awesome! I want to fall off of that!’ It’s like, OK, I can see it on a poster, and I can see Tom falling off of it.” \nThe director later spoke about the film looking to Ethan Hunt as more of a character than the previous entries in the series as well. \n“I’ve seen five of these movies and I don’t know who Ethan Hunt is. One movie sort of dealt with his personal life; the other movies are about people speculating what’s really going on in Ethan’s head. I want to know who Ethan is in this movie, I want an emotional journey for this character, and Tom really embraced it.” \nFinally, McQuarrie teased the return of old faces to the franchise, joining returning stars Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson, ”including people you would not expect to be back.” \nThe upcoming Mission: Impossible 6 is set to debut in theaters July 27, 2018. McQuarrie’s return to the franchise marks the first time a director has helmed more than one Mission: Impossible film. Brian De Palma directed the original adaptation, which was followed by sequels directed by John Woo, J.J, Abrams and Brad Bird.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:08:31.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
