U.S. President-elect Donald Trump talks to reporters as he and his wife Melania Trump arrive for a New Year's Eve celebration with members and guests at the Mar-a-lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, Credit: JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS \nA review of membership lists by the New York Times shows that club’s nearly 500 paying members include dozens of real estate developers, Wall Street financiers, energy executives and others whose businesses could be affected by the president's policies. \nThe newspaper reports that at least three club members are under consideration for an ambassadorship. \nGeorge Norcross, an insurance executive whose friendship with Mr Trump dates to the president’s Atlantic City years, when Mr Norcross reportedly held insurance contracts with Mr Trump’s casinos. \nJanet Weiner, another member cited by the New York Times is part owner and chief financial officer of the Rockstar energy drink company, which is said to have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying federal officials to avoid tighter regulations on its products. \nMost of the some members predate Mr Trump's rise to the president, with the club limited new memberships to only a few dozen a year. \nThe White House has denied that the Mar-a-Lago trips represent a conflict of interest, but has said that Mr Trump will not be discussing policy with club members. \nClub members have in the past had ample opportunity to influence the president's thinking. \nLast year The Telegraph was invited to lunch at Mar-a-Lago with Guido Lombardi, an Italian count, long time member of the club and a friend of Mr Trump's going back some thirty years. \nFormerly a member of Italy's populist, anti-immigrant Northern League party, Mr Lombardi moved to America in part to escape what sees as the Muslim take-over Europe (he gave this newspaper DVD of a documentary he funded called ‘Europe’s Last Stand: America’s Final Warning’). \nMr Lombardi said at the time that he had spent time discussing his views with Mr Trump, and has acted in recent months as an informal fixer helping build connection between Mr Trump's administration and right-wing populist parties in Europe. \nHe has for example, twice hosted Marine Le Pen of France's National Front party at his apartment in Trump tower, and is said to have been instrumental in bringing about her, much publicised, meetings with advisers of the then president-elect. \nA recording of a speech given by Mr Trump to Mar-a-Lago members in November, and leaked to Politico, showed the president inviting members to \"come around\" to the club on the day that he would interviewing in search of members of his cabinet. \n\"We’re going to be interviewing everybody — Treasury, we’re going to be interviewing Secretary of State,” he is recorded as saying. \n“We have everybody coming in — if you want to come around, it’s going to be unbelievable….so you might want to come along.” \nHope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, told the New York Times that Mar-a-Lago \"is one of the most successful private clubs in the world,” and it “was intended to be the Southern White House, and the president looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property.” \nBut critics note that in this luxury environment the rules are not the same: there is no official visitor log for example. And less scrutiny from the press. \nMr Trump made his displeasure at being followed by a press pool - a tradition in American politics - known last week by housing the journalists in a club room with blacked out windows whilst he and Mr Abe went outside to play golf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:32:32.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
