In December last year Arnold said he would have released the video - which is said to include Trump calling his son a r - before the election but did not have approval of producers who made it and gave it to him. The former star of True Lies and ex-husband of comedian Roseanne Barr is said to be getting paid $40,000 for every week he spends in the South African jungle, where the show is filmed.
