(Photo: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports) \nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank praised President Donald Trump on Tuesday, calling him a \"real asset\" to the nation .\nStephen Curry, in turn, used those comments into a burn of Trump. In an interview with the Mercury News , Curry was asked about Plank's comments, and he snapped back at Trump.\n\n\"I agree with that description,\" Curry said, \"if you remove the 'et'\" from asset.\nCurry endorsed Hillary Clinton during the election, and his head coach Steve Kerr has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump. As the face of Under Armour basketball, Curry's happiness is essential to that endorsement relationship. He's under contract with the brand through 2024, but Curry still said he was surprised to hear Plank's support for Trump.\nHe told the Mercury News that he spoke with staffers at Under Armour and Plank himself after hearing the comments. Curry took his first direct stand against Trump in the interview, publicly putting Under Armour on notice.\n\n\"If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don't have my best intentions, they don't have the right attitude about taking care of people.

So that's a decision I will make every single day when I wake up.
