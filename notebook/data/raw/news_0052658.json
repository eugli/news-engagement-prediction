Even in 1993, when the Simpsons episode “Homer’s Barbershop Quartet” aired, a Grammy award was not a particularly valuable pop-culture artifact. \nBut on May 27, Homer will receive another accolade, perhaps more valuable since it wasn’t voted on by sportswriters. The Baseball Hall of Fame announced Tuesday that it will “induct” the portly 39-year-old into its hallowed museum in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the “Homer at the Bat” episode. \n“Homer at the Bat” aired on Fox on Feb. 20, 1992, the 52nd episode of the show that is now in its 28th season. It was an instant classic because it featured nine Major League Baseball stars in cameos as ringers brought into the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team by a meddling Mr. Burns. \nWith most of the major leaguers unable to play because of various mishaps, Homer wins the league softball final when Mr. Burns plays the righty-lefty matchup and uses him to pinch-hit for eight-time MLB all-star Darryl Strawberry. Homer, in inimitably hapless fashion, drives in the winning run with a bases-loaded hit-by-pitch to his noggin. \n“In Cooperstown, we salute baseball’s greatest contributors, preserve its vast history and salute the cultural side of the sport. We are honoured to pay tribute to the 25th anniversary of ‘Homer at the Bat,’” Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson said in a news release. \n“The Simpsons has left an impressive imprint on our culture as the longest-running American sitcom, and ‘Homer at the Bat’ remains as popular today as when the episode aired in 1992. Baseball is recognized as our national pastime due to its wide intersection with American culture over the last two centuries, evident in literature, theatre, language, art, music, film and television. The Simpsons is a perfect example of that connection to Americana.” \nIn addition to Homer’s induction, a Simpsons exhibit will be unveiled at the museum. \nTwo of the nine players featured in the episode, Ozzie Smith and Wade Boggs, will be in Cooperstown for a free roundtable discussion of the episode in Cooper Park adjacent to the Hall of Fame. Joining the players will be Al Jean and Mike Reiss, the longtime executive producers of the series, plus episode director Jim Reardon, executive story editor Jeff Martin and casting director Bonnie Pietila. \nThe baseball stars’ parts were recorded over a span of six months when they visited Los Angeles to play the Dodgers or Angels. Martin directed Boggs and Roger Clemens, both members of the Boston Red Sox at the time, during their sessions. Reiss guided the rest of the players. Martin also wrote the new words to Terry Cashman’s “Talkin’ Baseball” song, which became “Talkin’ Softball.” \n“When I struck out in T-ball, I never dreamed I’d make it to the Hall of Fame,” Jean said in the release. “It shows what not following your dreams can do.” \nThe day at the Hall of Fame is anchored by the annual Hall of Fame Classic contested by Hall of Famers and other recently retired players representing every MLB team. \nFor more information on the May 27 festivities, visit the Hall of Fame website .
