The storm stretched far out into the ocean and was at its strongest late on Friday afternoon. It is expected to last until Saturday afternoon. \nOne man was found dead in a submerged vehicle in the desert town of Victorville after several cars were washed down a flooded street, San Bernardino county fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said. \nA second man was electrocuted in the Sherman Oaks area of LA when a tree falling in heavy rain downed power lines that hit a car. \nLater in the same neighbourhood, a sinkhole swallowed two cars, the second on live TV as viewers watched it teeter on the edge before plunging in. Firefighters rescued one person from the first car, and the driver escaped from the second vehicle before it fell into the hole. \nInland at the Cajon Pass, the shoulder of a road crumbled and sent a parked fire truck spilling over the side, but no one was injured. \nIn LA’s Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a road and 15 people had to be rescued. About 150,000 households in the LA area were without electricity, and 180 homes were evacuated in the city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. \nAmtrak cancelled services for much of California’s southern and central coast, and several stretches of road were closed by flooding. \nThere were several traffic deaths on wet and flooded roads, but it was difficult to determine which were a direct result of the storm. \n“The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit south-west California this season,” the National Weather Service said. “It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995.” \nMeteorologists call this kind of storm a “weather bomb”, defined as “a rapidly deepening extratropical cyclonic low-pressure area”. \nBy evening, Ventura county and northern Los Angeles county had recorded 24-hour rain totals of up to 7.5 inches (19cm), with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara county receiving nearly 8.5 inches. \nRyan Maue, a meteorologist for WeatherBell Analytics, told the LA Times 10 trillion gallons of rain would fall on California in the next week, enough to fill 15 million Olympic-sized swimming pools or to power Niagara Falls for 154 days.

The wind is just going nuts.” \nThe storm also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco, but it was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend. \nIt is part of a series of storms to have hit California recently, after the state suffered from five years of drought.
