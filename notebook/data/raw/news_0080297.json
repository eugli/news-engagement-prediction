Two words: think again. \nMonday, February 20 \nDear Diary, \nHello. It's me, your owner, Sean Spicer. I know I have been neglecting you lately, but things have been busy. But it's because of that, with work stress, etc. that I am going to make an effort to write in you every day this week. Maybe then I can access my feelings, or at least find out if I have feelings. I haven't been to a doctor in thirteen years, but I imagine if I did, he would approve. \nToday began like any other day, with me waking up on the floor screaming because of the nightmares. Sometimes I wake up holding a sandwich that I made in my sleep. This morning it was turkey with peanut butter, which I know sounds disgusting, but I actually found delicious, and later made again for lunch. (Don't knock it till you try it! Haha.) When I told my wife this, she shook her head like she always does, in a way that seems like it's 50 percent disbelief and 50 percent acknowledgment that I am never going to change. \n* This is literally fake news. \nI was determined to get this week off on the right foot, and I think I did a pretty good job. I only tripped over 40 percent of my words during my briefing instead of every single one. At least today, the President did not belittle me. Last week he called me an imbecile and threatened to move my office to \"inside a stair.\" I know you are an inanimate object, but you should understand that is a very dire threat from the President. Today was much better; he just stared right through me as if I didn't exist and then asked Paul Ryan to bring him a warm diet ginger ale. According to some aides, Ryan warmed a cold one between this thighs and that's what took so long for him to come back. In any case, I just know that one of these days the President will tell me good job, or address me by name instead of just calling me \"John.\" I tell him over and over again that it's Sean. One time he read it off a paper and pronounced it \"Siam,\" like what Thailand used to be called. I would have corrected him, except that I am absolutely terrified of saying anything remotely negative in his presence. \nThe rest of the day was just work, work, work, but I was happy to have my favorite dinner: undercooked pasta with a burger patty on top. The missus sure knows how to make a man feel special. Well, it's off to bed for me. Thanks for being there for me, Diary. See you tomorrow. \nSincerely, \nTuesday, February 21 \nHello Journal, \nI have decided to change your name from Diary to Journal. One of the aides saw you in my Jansport earlier, and asked what you were. When I said \"My diary,\" I got quite a bit of grief. Apparently only girls have diaries. I wanted to ask a girl if this is true, but I couldn't find any in the White House. I guess Kellyanne was still taking whatever drug cocktail she needs to get her through the day. \nToday I decided to start my briefing off with a little joke. I have been thinking about making a joke for some time now, and would you believe it? It just sort of came out. Between four and nine people laughed. I tried to get an aide to count for me, but he told me to \"get bent, Fucko.\" \nI also got to announce that General H.R. McMaster is going to be the new National Security Advisor, and there was no thunderous applause. The President had repeatedly stressed that the very mention of McMaster's name would be met with raucous, violent applause, so I was a little disappointed when that wasn't the case. I did my best to build him up, and I think I did a good job. Steve Bannon threatened to skin me alive if I continue to disappoint the President, and I can't lie: that's definitely in the back of my mind when I do these briefings. Last night he even slipped a pocket knife under my office door with a Post-It attached that said, \"I will use this to skin you alive. This is Steve, by the way. Steve Bannon.\" So I know he's out to get me. \nI don't mind telling you, in the privacy of my own diary JOURNAL that sometimes I really don't like my job, or my other job. When it comes to being Press Secretary, sometimes it feels like my job is just being able to answer questions correctly. What a bad job. Writing about this is making me pretty depressed, so I'm gonna go dip a corn dog in mayo. That'll be good. \nSincerely, \nWednesday, February 22 \nDear Journal, \nBoy, was today a mess! I should have known today was going to be bad when I woke up eating dog food. My sleep-stress-eating is really getting out of control. This morning it was my turn to drop the kids off at school, which is something I always enjoy because looking at my kids reminds me that I'm more than an annoying blip on the President's radar—I'm the inspiration to two kids who don't even make a face when their dad spills some wet dog food on his khakis. \nAnyway, I was running around all over the place today, which was a mess because my body is a disaster and extremely bad at moving. I really should be in a job where I'm just sitting in a desk chair all day, but that's not what God had in mind for me, I guess. The briefing went alright today. In front of the press, I've still yet to strike that perfect balance, like macaroni and applesauce. (Yum!!) \nThings I need to get better at for my job: breathing, reading, and talking. I keep running out of breath during my sentences no matter how many giant gulps of air I take before talking. I have to get better though, otherwise I will be a skinless man with an office inside a stair. \nI want to confess a small paranoia, which is that Steve and the President are deliberately making policy decisions that will be difficult for me to understand or defend. I know that's crazier than a liberal, but sometimes it feels that way! The good news is that I know I am in good company and that many of us in the White House are very stressed out. Yesterday I walked in on Stephen Miller on the floor of his office, ripping raw meat apart with his teeth like a dog that had been caged. I looked him straight in the eye, and he dropped the meat and walked out of the room like nothing happened. I can't tell you how much I look up to him. \nKellyanne is feeling the stress, too. I keep seeing her clumps of blonde hair around the White House. Rumor is that it's from anxiety. If I ever see a doctor again, I'll have to ask if that's possible. The worst part of that is that Steve seems to be collecting the tufts of hair and putting them in plastic baggies. I'm not sure what he's going to do with it, but these days I'll believe anything. \nI actually have to go back to work on this whole Title IX mess, but you know what that means—ol' Spicey is getting a second dinner! I'll have to see what we have in the house, but I think there's some oatmeal I can probably put some ketchup in. \nSincerely, \nThursday, February 23 \nJournal, \nI've heard it takes several weeks to make a habit but after just a few days of writing in you every night, I'm hooked! I've never tried any alcohol except light beer before, but I imagine this is what happens when you get \"lit.\" \nWhen I went into work this morning, there seemed to be a lot of mixed messages around. Some people were feeling like last night's rollout was successful, and others were threatening me with a gun (Steve.) Did you know that Steve is allowed to have a gun in the White House and that he has also forbidden any Secret Service from carrying weapons? I'd ask the President what he thinks of all this, but this morning I was informed that I'm no longer allowed to speak to him directly, but instead must use an aide to translate. I write down what I want to say on a piece of paper with a Sharpie, which I hand to an aide, who then reads it aloud to the President, who does not listen and ignores it. I don't think it's a good system, but I'm willing to give it more time and see if it improves. \nI started off today's briefing with another joke, this time about Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. I practiced in front of the mirror a few times before I went out there, and was able to get through Steve's name without an eye twitch. I rode the high of that joke for a while, and for the first time in about a month, actually felt like I knew what I was talking about. It got dodgy at the end with some specific questions, and people looked upset with me. All those questions about transgender students were making my head spin. Why do people care so much? Are they doing this just to mess with me? When I got back to the President, he felt I had been made a fool. That's nothing new, but I'll tell you something—it's no fun. I'm going to find a way to make tomorrow the best press briefing yet. \nAnd I think that's about it for today, except that I finally got around to reading a newspaper and it's hard work! There are so many articles in there, and some of them finish up in whole other sections so you have to go digging for them. I remember seeing some interview with an actor when I was a kid who said that it's not a good idea to read reviews, and I've been generally abiding by that, but looking at what was happening in there made me realize maybe I should crack one of those open once in a while—especially if I want to be put to sleep. Hey, would you look at that? I made another joke! I'll try to remember that one and have an aide tell it to the President tomorrow. \nSincerely, \nFriday, February 24 \nHi Journal, \nTGIF! So happy to have finally made it through Friday. At the White House, Friday is really considered more a weekend day, and so things are very relaxed. Everyone even dresses a little more casually, except for Steve who wears the same summer-businessman-in-Vegas ensemble every day. I wish I had that kind of suave self-confidence. \nBut speaking of self-confidence, I finally found some way to make my briefing better! I banned CNN, the New York Times, Politico, the Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed from coming. Those are the guys who make me look bad, so I figured why the heck not? I did a gaggle instead of a briefing because I just found out you can make sure it doesn't get filmed, and I'm sick of seeing my neck on national television. I thought to myself, \"This is Friday, buddy! Take it easy and do things for you!\" Unfortunately, even without a bunch of the \"problem publications,\" it still didn't go great. \nAfter that, I spent a long time in the bathroom just sort of looking at myself in the mirror and reflecting. I often find that I do some of my best thinking in the bathroom. I had the idea to propose to my wife in an airport bathroom, and now every time I'm in one I think of her. \nAll in all, I think that this was a pretty good week for the Administration. No one had to resign, I got a couple hours of sleep every night, and Steve didn't follow through on his promises to kill me. I plan to reward myself with some good family time, a few episodes of Yuri on Ice , and some tasty food this weekend. Maybe if the weather is nice, I'll break out the grill and make some burritos and ask the wife to make her famous \"dessert chili.\" I do pity the man whose wife doesn't cook! \nHere's to the good things in life—family, a President who might one day become a friend, and an agenda that strips the rights of millions of Americans. And thanks to you, Journal... I think I'll be seeing a lot more of you. \nSincerely ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:44:52.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
