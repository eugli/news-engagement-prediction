The event is an all expenses paid trip to Cubs' spring training camp in Mesa, Ariz. \nThe trip was made possible through a partnership with Advocate Children's Hospital, the Cubs organization and American Airlines, which covered the air fare for each child and two others in their family. \nThe children were nominated and selected by child life specialists at Advocate, who were seeking kids who had \"been through a lot\" and were, of course, Cubs fans, said Cristina Enea, Advocate's marketing coordinator. \n\"We have nine kids — all have different personalities, all have different ailments, but the one thing they have in common is that they are all Cubs fans,\" she said. \nAdvocate Health does events with the Cubs organization throughout the year, including trips to Wrigley Field, but this year, they were able to step up their game, she said. \n\"We try to go above and beyond,\" she said of this first time trip to spring training. \"It's really cool to give these kids an opportunity they would not normally get.\" \nSome are going through treatment but still able to travel, she said.

The Kirk family had been to Cubs' games, but never to spring training. \n\"It's truly unbelievable,\" said Peyton's brother Zach, 18, who accompanied his sister and mother on the trip. \"It's really humbling for everyone who gets to go.\" \nPeyton was \"excited\" to be selected, and kept asking, \"is this real life?\" her mother said.
