Instead, Syracuse slapped back from a 12-point deficit and wound up killing Clemson on a game-ending 3-pointer from freshman wing Tyus Battle. \nHere's a kaboom, and Cuse has won five straight. That hasn't happened in three years. Cuse 82, Clemson 81.

This team looked like it would have to box bottom feeders in order to qualify for the NIT. Now the Orange have an amazing overtime road win against NC State to pair with this come-from-behind victory at Clemson. Mixed in: home victories over Wake Forest , Florida State and Virginia , the latter two being teams fighting to win the ACC. SU is now 16-9 with an 8-4 league mark. \nAnd let's check another angle on that winner. Look at Jim Boeheim! Arms up, sprinting to newfound freedom! Jim Boeheim's reaction after Tyus Battle hits the game-winning three is priceless! pic.twitter.com/5zZPfCVNx5 ‚Äî Michael Tricarico (@TrickyCNS7) February 8, 2017 \nAfter shocking the world with a run to last year's Final Four, Syracuse has once again managed to bottle something here. Wouldn't it be something if this team found a way to make another deep March push? After what we've seen transpire in the past two weeks, you can't put it past them. Next up: at Pitt on Saturday. The Panthers have lost eight straight ACC games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:04:31.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
