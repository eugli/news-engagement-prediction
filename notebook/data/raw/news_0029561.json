Beyoncé & Jay Z] \nPerhaps in premature celebration, DJ Khaled released “Shining,” a star-studded collaboration with Beyoncé , and Jay Z , shortly after the end of the 59th Grammy Awards. Adele’s Album of the Year victory over Beyoncé might’ve spoiled some of the evening’s mood, but the trio of proud parents singing “All this winning” feels unfazed by award politics . The first song between the married couple since the Magna Carta Holy Grail deep cut “Part II (On The Run),” recalls the jovial sophistication and explosiveness of their 2000s hits “ Crazy In Love ” and “ Déjà Vu .” \n“Shining” hues closer to those moments of ecstasy than the the adult contemporary rap of Jay Z’s post- Watch the Throne career. “Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes/The European trucks for the twin babies/Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool/Send him to school in all my jewels” Jay Z raps with an endearing mix of self-deprecation and premature paternal pride. Beyoncé, on the other hand, operates with full-on swagger, singing triumphantly about “winning” for the last “20 years,” and flashing a smile to even the most dogged haters. Her half-rap cadence mimics the one she used on last year’s “ Formation ,” bearing all the marks of effortless skill and confidence And as is usual, Khaled is the hype man for his own song, his usual ecstatic adlibs sprinkled throughout. Last year rumors swirled that Jay Z and Beyoncé may release a joint album, but until then “Shining” makes one hope that such talk is more than gossip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:35:45.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
