Source: News Corp Australia \n“The market itself could easily sustain 400 Little Caesar franchises,” Mr Koury told news.com.au.\n“But it’s important to get it right. This is not a contest of speed, and about how many stores I can build as soon as I arrive.”\nMr Koury, said his slow rollout is part of the plan to “develop the exact product required for the Australian consumer”.\n“If I came to Australia and opened 20 stores at once, then realised we needed to change the format of our business to cater for local requirements — that would be much harder to do,” he said.\n“That’s why we opened a single store, provided a product, and observed how it suited the marketplace.\n“When you begin any venture like this, you need to make sure you have a core offering that you can watch, manage control and develop.”\nLittle Caesars Pizza currently has four stores in Australia, with the goal of reaching at least 400. Source: News Corp Australia \nMr Koury says after Sydney, he hopes to open five more stores in Australia by the end of this year. And while he isn’t definitive on location, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and regional Queensland are all in his sights.\nAs the third largest pizza franchise in the US, Mr Koury says his ‘Hot-N-Ready’ offering — which allows consumers to purchase and collect a pizza within 30 seconds — is an industry gamechanger.\n“There’s lots of meal time choices out there, but it’s how we service our customers — by eliminating the planning and ordering ahead — that can’t be beaten,” he said.\n“You can walk in, and within 30 seconds you can have a pepperoni or cheese pizza available straight away.\n“Pizza is traditionally a longer term sale process with a lot of planning involved. But with our drive-through service, it actually takes longer to receive your change than to get a pizza.\n“It’s something you can’t get anywhere else in the country.”\nAustralian’s love their pizza, with Dominos and Pizza Hut gobbling up majority of the fast food pizza market.

Their franchise accounts for almost half of the sector, with Pizza Hut coming in second.\nLast year, Pizza Hut brought out a significant portion of the troubled Eagle Boys pizza chain after they went into administration, and begun converting some of their stores with Pizza Hut’s own branding, boosting their overall store count to more than 320.\nResearch by IBISWorld predicts revenue growth of 2.3% in the pizza industry from $3.5 billion in 2013-14 to $3.9 billion in 2018-2019.\nIn the US, Little Caesars comes in as the third biggest pizza chain — after their first store was opened in Michigan almost 60 years ago.\nThe company has over 4000 stores in the US alone, and according to Nation’s Restaurant News , was recording annual sales of US$3.4 billion ($4.5 billion) in the US in 2015.\nIn Australia, the franchise has around 120 employees across NSW in its four stores.\n“My father was the first franchisee to start Little Caesars in the western states of the US, starting off in Arizona” Mr Koury told news.com.au.\nDomino's Pizza currently has more than 600 stores across Australia.

It’s also expanded to outlets in Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Oregon.\nAnd while the chain has no intention on moving permanently to our shores, they have ‘popped-up’ in several establishments across Sydney over the years — causing burger-mania in its wake.\nJust last month, the chain set up shop in Surry Hills, where obsessive burger lovers lined up hours ahead to get their hands on a burger. \nIn 'n' Out Burger Pop Ups in Surry Hills have been a hit, but the chain has no intention on making permanent move to Australia.

It should be a fun food, and a treat.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:00:38.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
