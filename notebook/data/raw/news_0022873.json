A Dhaka court has summoned the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) officer investigating the 2012 murder of journalist couple Sagar Sarwar and Meherun Runi. \nThe officer has failed to submit the probe report even after the extension of the deadline 46 times. \nOn Wednesday, the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Majharul Hakim pulled up Assistant Superintendent Mahiuddin Ahmed and ordered him to appear before the court to render an explanation. \nIt has also fixed Mar 21 for submitting the investigation report. On the morning of Feb 12, 2012, Maasranga Television News Editor Sagar and ATN Bangla Senior Reporter Runi were found stabbed to death in the bedroom of their apartment in Dhaka's Razabazar.\nThe couple's only child Mahir Sarwar Megh was found in the apartment. The autopsy report said the couple died of wounds inflicted by sharp weapons possibly by amateurs. \n\nAfter the gruesome killings, which shook the nation, Runi’s brother started a murder case with the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police. \nThen home minister Shahara Khatun had promised to catch the culprits within 48 hours. \nThe Detective Branch was given the job to investigate the murder, but the court transferred it to RAB after the detectives failed to find any lead in two months. \nNine months after Khatun’s assurance, erstwhile home minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir claimed major breakthrough at a press conference when a few arrests were made. \nBut five years on, RAB is still fumbling in the dark over the killings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:38:16.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
