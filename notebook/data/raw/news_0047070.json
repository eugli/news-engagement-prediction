The gravel, sandy landscape is a remnant of the eastern glacier. Photo: This ridge is one of two potential runway sites near Davis Station in Antarctica.

It becomes quite treacherous for aircraft landing on it.\" \nThe Wilkins Runway is open in November, December and February — a short transport window. \n\"The reason that we are looking for year-round aviation is not only the support to our expeditioners but it allows us to branch out into different science experiments that we haven't been able to in the past,\" Mr Harris said.
