The main character, Paterson (Adam Driver), and his sweetheart, Laura (Golshifteh Farahani), share a modest but full life together. \nThe pace of the movie draws attention to and allows you to join many moments of fleeting workaday magic. Jim Jarmusch's poet character isn't an anguished or misunderstood genius writer, but a guy from the neighborhood who drives a bus and keeps a small notebook. \nWhat is there actually to see out the window of a lumbering New Jersey Transit bus in Paterson, a city that at many intersections resembles Philadelphia? \nWe know we are looking at the world through the poet's lens, and so as the camera lingers and frames the world, we look at the world a little more carefully. Jarmusch reminds us that there is always something worth looking at: the signage and the multiple reflections (chrome and glass) and the way old brick walls look so good in good light, the sunlight on faces of people who are waiting for a bus, or nothing at all. \nOne morning that could be almost any morning, eating his bowl of cereal, Paterson notices a box of matches. In his poem Paterson, Williams writes, \"Say it, no ideas but in things,\" so here is a matchstick from a matchbox. Between that moment and Paterson's life, where something starts to open. The scene is not overdone, but we witness a turn if not a spark. Paterson writes a few lines in his notebook - it's almost nothing - and a poem begins to take shape: \nWe have plenty of matches in our house. \nWe keep them on hand always. \nCurrently our favorite brand is Ohio Blue tip . . . \nThe simple beauty of the movie is voiced in poems the protagonist is writing: in the voice of the words on the page, but also in the soft glow of Driver's voice-overs that we hear as Paterson writes them word by single word. \nThe actual poem is by the poet Ron Padgett, whom Jarmusch asked to write for the movie. Seven Padgett poems are featured: four he wrote imagining the life of the protagonist, and three poems he selected from his earlier books. \nThe Ohio Blue Tip poem above is called \"Love Poem\" (from Triangles in the Afternoon , 1979) and it continues: \nThey are excellently packaged, sturdy \nlittle boxes with dark and light blue and white labels \nwith words lettered in the shape of a megaphone, \nas if to say even louder to the world, \n\"Here is the most beautiful match in the world, \nits one-and-a-half-inch soft pine stem capped \nby a grainy dark purple head, so sober and furious \nand stubbornly ready to burst into flame, \nlighting, perhaps, the cigarette of the woman you love, \nfor the first time, and it was never really the same \nafter that. All this will we give you.\" \nThat is what you gave me, I \nbecome the cigarette and you the match, or I \nthe match and you the cigarette, blazing \nwith kisses that smoulder toward heaven. \nThe low-key beauty and textures of real life in the poem reinforce the movie's central tone. \nOne morning, half asleep, Laura shares a dream with Paterson about twins. They recur. The rhymes and rhythms of the world: like twins, the pleasure of seeing twins pass by (double take). \nIt would be wrong to say that this is \"a love movie,\" but in many subtle ways it is a series of love letters framed by the days of one workweek. Another poem starts to take shape: \nWhen I wake up earlier than you and you \nare turned to face me, face \non the pillow and hair spread around, \nI take a chance and stare at you, \namazed in love and afraid \nthat you might open your eyes and have \nthe daylights scared out of you. \nBut maybe with the daylights gone \nyou'd see how much my chest and head \nimplode for you, their voices trapped \ninside you like unborn children fearing \nthey will never see the light of day. \nThe opening in the wall now dimly glows \nits rainy blue and gray. I tie my shoes \nand go downstairs to put the coffee on. \nThe poem is Padgett's \"Glow\" (from You Never Know, 2001), and as it turns out, that is exactly what it is: a glow. The understated utterances of Driver's reading of the poem reveal how many one-syllable words there are in it: wake , up , face , me , take , a , chance , wall , go , will . Those one-syllable words help us catch the lift and music of the two- and three-syllable words, such as, earlier , pillow , afraid , amazed , and downstairs . \nLaura has a knack for designs that are playful and striking; she decorates every surface in the house. She says, \"I have a strong visual style.\" And she sure does. Her character rounds out the movie's warming glow. \nThey have a modest life, and one with visible limitations, but what of it? What is poetry, anyway? How is it done? Theirs is a life lit by their own inner lights: the imaginative qualities they see in their living room, the pleasures of simple weeknight supper (and it's not about the food), walking their dog in the neighborhood, or half-awake in bed telling of a dream from the night before.
