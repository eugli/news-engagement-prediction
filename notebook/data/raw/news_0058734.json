(Pictures: Reuters) SoftBank-backed Snapdeal , will reportedly lay off around 600 employees from the company, which raises a pertinent question of what is wrong with Indian startups? There is something innately troubled in the way Indian startups, especially e-commerce websites function, and that is reflected not only in the revenue but also in the way they have been treating their employees. Reports suggested that Snapdeal will cut almost 600 jobs across Snapdeal, Vulcan in logistics and FreeCharge in the digital payments business. Snapdeal defended the decisions saying that in order to become India’s first profitable e-commerce website it needs to take steps to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, the company has been struggling to raise fresh funds due to the intense rivalry with Amazon and Flipkart .\nWhile there have been reports that it has been a good fiscal year for Snapdeal, one cannot deny the fact that e-commerce in India is full of contradictions. From varying market data to contentious media reports, the companies have used them only to confuse the people about numbers and data.

The shares have been dropping by around 35-40 percent since the devaluation. Similarly, as if in a domino effect, Ola followed the devaluation suit. Snapdeal has been looking at raising funds at a lower valuation. But is ‘valuation’ the only criteria? It is determined by the firm’s market share, risks taken, trends, growth rate, among many different factors. But is the face value the only way to decide the fortune of a startup?\nYou may also like to watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:18:54.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
