One is Haldiram Snacks and Ethnic Foods caters to the northern region. Two, Nagpur-based Haldiram Foods International serves the western and southern regions and a much smaller Haldiram Bhujiawal caters to the eastern markets. \nThe now famous brand which started with a small shop in Bikaner in 1937, is owned by the Agarwal family. It has survived many a disputes and break-ups but is still standing strong and tall. \nIt is the second largest Indian food brand after Parle. \nKamal Agarwal, fourth-generation member of the founding family said, “We have increased our reach and developed products in-house that ensure quality control. We also understand Indian palate well and that comes handy while launching new products,” \nThe packaged products business that now contributes over 80 percent of the revenues for the company, initially started off with restaurants and casual dining. \nThe famous western snack giants like Pepsi Frito Lays and ITC Foods is now slowly entering into Haldiram’s turf like Pepsico’s Kurkure which now has 16 variants of Indian Namkeen and Paper Boat is soon to enter this category.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:22:17.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
