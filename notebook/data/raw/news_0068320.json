Aramco had decided to suspend its partnership with Petronas in the refining and petrochemical complex in the southeast of the country, according to sources last month. The signing is expected to take place on Monday, said one of the sources with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman to Malaysia.
