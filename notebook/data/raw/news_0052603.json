REUTERS \nDan Carter faces testing times as the reality of his drink-driving charge hits home. \nCarter confirmed the development on his Facebook page on Tuesday, saying: \"Over the last few days my management and I have had to front up to my sponsors. Not surprisingly, Land Rover, who for good reason have zero tolerance towards drink driving, have ended their relationship with me. I understand this completely and am disappointed I put them in this position.\" \nREAD MORE: * Dan Carter returns to NZ \nCarter, who is battling a leg injury that has made him unavailable for French club Paris Racing, has returned to New Zealand. \nTo his credit, Carter hasn't dodged the controversy. \nHe used his Facebook page last week to confirm his driving indiscretion and also apologise for his actions, admitting he'd made \"a massive error of judgment\". Ad Feedback \nBritish manufacturer Land Rover has a high profile in rugby, being a major sponsor at the last two World Cups, in New Zealand and England. Carter, 34, was part of the All Blacks teams that won both of those tournaments. \nHis efforts in helping New Zealand to their third title in 2015 earned him World Rugby's player of the year award.
