Launch Gallery \n“I don’t think Donald Trump hated me,” she said, “I think he was in love with my boyfriend.” \nShe then added, “But Donald if you didn’t like me then you’re probably really not going to like me now because I’m hosting SNL and I’m, like, so gay, dude.” VIDEOS SNL Casts Melissa McCarthy as Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer — Video \nBut Stewart saved her best zinger for last. At the end of her monologue, the over-enthusiastic actress (oh, the irony!) dropped an F-bomb while introducing musical guest Alessia Cara. \n“We’ve got a great show, and I totally care that I’m here because it’s the coolest f—ing thing ever,” she said, before immediately covering her mouth and exclaiming, “Oops! Oh my god, and I’m sorry…. And Alessia Cara is also here and I’ll never come back.” \nWatch video of her little slip-up below… And here’s Kristen Stewart dropping an f-bomb during the SNL monologue.
