Milo has exposed their liberal thuggery and we think free speech includes hearing Milo’s important perspective.” \nBut many people are very concerned, after hearing Yiannopoulos say that people are getting hung up on labels when it comes to adults having sex with children. \n“In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men — the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship — those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents.” \nBut on the video, the other person says that it all sounds like molestation. \n“It sounds like molestation to me. It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me.” \nBut Yiannopoulos defends it, saying that he personally learned a lot from sex with priests. \n“But you know what? I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.” \nYiannopoulos confirms that he had a sexual relationship with a priest when he was 14. \n— (((Mathew Helman))) (@MatHelman) February 20, 2017 \nBut many conservatives are saying that they do not want Milo Yiannopoulos as a speaker for CPAC , says the Daily Caller. But Yiannopoulos says that people are misunderstanding what he said on the video. Milo says having been molested as a teenager, he uses gallows humor to speak about pedophilia. \n“The videos do not show what people say they show. I did joke about giving better head as a result of clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen. If I choose to deal in an edgy way on an internet livestream with a crime I was the victim of that’s my prerogative. It’s no different to gallows humor from AIDS sufferers.” \nYiannopoulos said that he misspoke when he used the term “boy” when saying it was okay for men to have sex with boys. \n“I did say that there are relationships between younger men and older men that can help a young gay man escape from a lack of support or understanding at home. That’s perfectly true and every gay man knows it. But I was not talking about anything illegal and I was not referring to pre-pubescent boys,” Milo said. “I shouldn’t have used the word ‘boy’ when I talked about those relationships between older men and younger gay men.” \nDo you think that Milo Yiannopoulos used speech that advocated pedophilia, and sex between priests and children?
