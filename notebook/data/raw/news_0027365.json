The woman's attorney said she became ill and couldn't work, losing her business, home and vehicles. \n“For about a year and a half she wasn’t able to do much of anything,” her lawyer said to the Express News. \nGoode's lawyer said she had photographs of the screwworms in the Popeyes container. \nNew World screwworms are fly larvae or maggots that are typically found in Florida and generally infest livestock or other animals, according to a Department of Food and Agriculture report . Human infestations are rare, but not unheard of, according to the report. \nKopowski said Popeyes is working with Goode to address her concerns, according to the report, but declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. \nThe New Orleans-born chicken company faced another lawsuit months ago, after a Mississippi man sued the restaurant chain after choking on a piece of chicken because he wasn't given the proper utensils. In the lawsuit, he said he was given a spork, but he needed a knife. Related \nGULFPORT, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi attorney has dropped his lawsuit against Popeyes Louisi… \nThe man later dropped the lawsuit, citing \"extreme comments\" directed toward his family. \nTrouble seeing the video above?
