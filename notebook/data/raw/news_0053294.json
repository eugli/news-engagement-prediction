The attack left portions of her face mutilated and missing. \nDog with half a face takes first steps towards normal life in N.J. \nAfter an examination three weeks ago, Teresa returned to NorthStar VETS on Tuesday for her first -- and hopefully last -- surgery. During Tuesday's procedure Dr. John Lewis extracted five teeth and repaired her damaged tongue. \n\"The first couple days after oral surgery are the most difficult,\" said Lewis. \"But after that they bounce back quickly.\" \nTeresa now has only 30 of her 42 teeth. Seven were missing when she arrived in the United States. \n\"I think she has a very good chance to do well long term,\" said Lewis. \nAfter an overnight stay at the facility, Teresa will return to her forever home with Quigley in Washington Township, Gloucester County. \n\"At home, Teresa is a normal dog,\" said Quigley, who believes the dog is adjusting well to her new American life. \nShe loves to run in the yard and roll on her back, and curls up next to Quigley on the couch while watching television at night. \n\"I believe she loves her life, she is truly a happy dog and wags her tail all the time.\" \nTim Hawk may be reached at .
