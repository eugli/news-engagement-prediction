Peru: Odebrecht corruption scandal suspects arrested \nThe order calls on Toledo to be placed under \"preventative custody\" for 18 months, while demanding for his \"immediate location, capture and confinement.\" \nToledo, who is believed to be in the French capital, Paris, has denied any wrongdoing. \n\"Say when, how and where and in what bank they've given me $20m,\" Toledo said in an interview with a local radio station over the weekend. Multi-national scandal \nOdebrecht, once Latin America's biggest construction company, has admitted to paying almost $800m in bribes to governments across the region as part of a December plea agreement with the US justice department. \nIn Peru, the company acknowledged paying $29m for projects built during the government of Toledo and two successors. \nToledo, a former World Bank economist, served as Peru's president from 2001 to 2006. \nIn 2010 he sought the presidency anew but failed to make it to the second round of voting. \nThe scandal also threatens to implicate Toledo's successors: Alan Garcia and Ollanta Humala. \nGarcia has denied any wrongdoing in recent weeks as authorities have arrested several accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht during his 2006-2011 government. \nAside from Peru, several countries in Latin America, including Panama, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay, are carrying out investigations into bribes paid by Odebrecht. \nIn Panama, a former personal adviser to President Juan Carlos Varela on Thursday said on his former boss had accepted campaign donations from Odebrecht.
