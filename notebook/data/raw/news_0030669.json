But non-roster invitees Ryan Hanigan and Bryan Holaday will make things interesting because of their experience. Manager Pete Mackanin has said a few times he would like a veteran backup catcher. Rupp nabs Lagares stealing NYM@PHI: Rupp catches Lagares stealing second Cameron Rupp delivers a strong throw to second base, catching Juan Lagares stealing in the top of the 4th inning \nFirst base (1): Tommy Joseph . It's his job now that Ryan Howard is gone. \nSecond base (1): Cesar Hernandez . Can Hernandez replicate the success he had this past season, when he ranked 22nd in baseball with a .371 on-base percentage? \nThird base (1): Maikel Franco . It's time for Franco to shine. He has All-Star potential, and he needs to show it. Franco to star for Philly Zolecki looks ahead to Franco's season with Phillies MLB.com Phillies reporter Todd Zolecki looks ahead to Maikel Franco's 2017 season and says how he can star for the club \nShortstop (1): Freddy Galvis . His 20 homers were nice, but his .274 on-base percentage ranked last in baseball. If that does not improve and J.P. Crawford plays well early in Triple-A, Galvis' job will be in jeopardy. \nUtility infielders (2): Andres Blanco is a no-brainer, but the final bench job is tough to figure out. Brock Stassi , who is a non-roster invitee, is the early choice because he is a stellar defensive first baseman, hits left-handed, knows how to get on base and has some pop. He could be a bench player in the mold of Greg Dobbs and Ross Gload. \nOutfielders (5): Odubel Herrera , Howie Kendrick and Michael Saunders are the Opening Day outfielders. Aaron Altherr is a safe bet to be the fourth outfielder, because he can play all three positions and, quite honestly, there is no place for him in Triple-A. Chris Coghlan gets the edge over Daniel Nava for the final spot, but that can change in Spring Training. \nRotation (5): Right-handers Clay Buchholz , Jerad Eickhoff , Jeremy Hellickson , Aaron Nola and Vince Velasquez . If everybody is healthy, there are no surprises here. Klentak on Buchholz's role Klentak discusses Buchholz, Phillies' rotation Phillies vice president and general manager Matt Klentak discusses the trade for Clay Buchholz and how it will affect the team's rotation \nBullpen (7): Left-hander Sean Burnett and right-handers Joaquin Benoit , Jeanmar Gomez , Hector Neris , Pat Neshek , Edubray Ramos and Joely Rodriguez . The first five right-handers are safe bets, if healthy. Rodriguez will have to earn his job. Burnett has had two Tommy John surgeries, but if he shows enough promise in spring, he makes a lot of sense for a team without many left-handed options. Mackanin knows him and likes him. But left-hander Adam Morgan could earn the final spot in the bullpen over Rodriguez, because he would be another lefty -- and he could be the long man. Mackanin said in January that Morgan could move to the bullpen. has covered the Phillies since 2003, and for MLB.com since 2009. Follow him on Twitter and listen to his podcast .
