Flyers decrying 'anti-white propaganda' found in Hamilton \nHamilton police spokesperson Const. Steve Welton confirmed that police are investigating the incident. \n\"We recognize the impact this has on people and the community,\" Welton said in an email. \"Hamilton Police continues to encourage everyone to report these types of incidents so they can be investigated.\" \nGallagher sent in a photo of the graffiti after reading a story CBC News posted on Wednesday, about chalk swastikas that were found scrawled on a street in Hamilton's Kirkendall neighbourhood. By Wednesday evening, the graffiti had been covered over. (Kelly Bennett/CBC) \n\"Hatred and bigotry are rearing their ugly heads — first in the form of swastikas on the sidewalks, discovered in chalk on Family Day and now in painted graffiti on the Rail Trail depicting both swastikas and a call to action to \"gas the Jews,\" said Barb Babij, the CEO of the Hamilton Jewish Federation. \"Both incidents occurred in Hamilton. Both are despicable expressions of anti-Semitism and hatred. The second goes beyond the use of a symbol that in itself evokes the horror and memory of one of history's most heinous periods. \n\"It is no longer freedom of speech, it is hate speech and crosses the line and may be a criminal act which police will have to determine during their investigation. In a country that prides itself on multi-culturalism, diversity and inclusion, and in a city whose vision is 'to be the best place to raise a child and age successfully,' we must denounce these acts as a community and reject their message wholeheartedly wherever and against whom they surface.\" A symbol of 'horror, destruction and evil' \nSpeaking about the swastikas found on the sidewalk in Kirkendall, Rabbi Jordan Cohen from Temple Anshe Sholom told CBC Hamilton Wednesday the symbol \"represents horror, destruction and evil.\" \n\"Every Jew is going to have a deep reaction to that — one of fear,\" he said. \nCohen pointed to incidents of racism in both the U.S. and in Canada as evidence of a surge of \"anti-Semitism, prejudice and hate. \n\"The extreme right and the extremists seem to feel that this is their time,\" he said. \nMcMaster University spokesperson Gord Arbeau confirmed that a swastika was also found inside a McMaster University bathroom on Feb. 13. \n\"It was removed and we contacted Hamilton police,\" Arbeau said. \"There is no room on campus for these hateful symbols.\" Hate across Canada \nSimilar incidents have sprung up across Canada in recent months. Someone carved a swastika in the snow on the football field at Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B. in January, while a teen who spray-painted racial slurs and swastikas at six different locations in Ottawa last November pleaded guilty last week. \nIn Toronto, police say they are now investigating anti-Semitic notes found on doors inside a North York condo on Sunday as a possible hate crime. \nSeveral residents found notes with pictures of swastikas stuck to their doors. At least one of the notes also said \"No Jews.\" \nBy Wednesday evening, the graffiti on the rail trail had been covered over, with black spots on the ground where the hate speech used to be. \nRepresentatives from the city could not immediately be reached for comment.
