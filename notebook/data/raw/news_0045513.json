(AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, February 21, 2017, 7:39 AM \nThe Whittier, Calif. police officer who was gunned down by a gang member Monday was considering retirement after 27 years on the force, his boss said. \n“He was the best of the best,” Whittier Police Chief Jeff Piper said through tears in a press conference about the death of veteran cop Keith Boyer. \n“This is an unbelievably senseless tragedy.” \nHundreds of mourners gathered outside the police headquarters in a candlelight vigil at night honoring Boyer, 53, who was killed in a gun battle that broke out as he investigated a traffic accident. \nGang member tells cops he was shot outside Manhattan hotel \nPolice said Boyer and another officer, Patrick Hazel, arrived at the scene of a minor car crash and an alleged gunman — a known gang member who was involved in the killing of another man the day before — opened fire with a semiautomatic pistol. The officers returned fire. Anaheim firefighters form a line and salute as the escort for Boyer drives by. (Sam Gangwer/AP) \nBoyer was shot and killed. Hazel and the gang member, who has not been identified, were both wounded but are expected to survive. \nNo charges have been announced for the suspect, who police said also killed the driver of the stolen car he crashed. Piper said the alleged gunman had been in police custody at some earlier point but was released early under new California laws aimed at reducing incarcerations. Authorities on the scene of the shooting. (Katie Falkenberg/AP) \nBoyer joined the department as a jailer and dispatcher in 1989 before becoming an officer one year later, according to the Los Angeles Times. He split up with a fiancée who lived in Temecula, about two hours south of Whittier, but he still traveled to that city for a second life as a drummer in Mrs. Jones’ Revenge, a classic rock tribute band that performed at events. \nHe is survived by two adult sons.
