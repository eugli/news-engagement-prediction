His comment prompted a large response on social media.

Source: Seven News Trump false terror claim \nThe president's initial remarks bewildered Swedes — and gave rise to ridicule and a barrage of comment on social media — because no high-profile crimes or tragedies had taken place on Friday night. \nThe president might have been referring to a segment aired Friday night on the Fox News show \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" \nIt reported that Sweden had accepted more than 160,000 asylum-seekers last year, but that only 500 of the migrants had found jobs. \nDuring the riot one officer was slightly injured when a rock hit his arm and one person was arrested for throwing rocks, police spokesman Lars Bystrom said Tuesday.
