CHENNAI: AIADMK founding leader PH Pandian dropped a bombshell on Tuesday, raising suspicions over former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's death, hinting it did not occur under natural circumstances. He also questioned the elevation of Sasikala as the party general secretary and the legislature party leader.
