Best Rap Performance \"No Problem\"—Chance The Rapper Featuring Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz \"Panda\"—Desiigner \"Pop Style\"—Drake Featuring The Throne \"All The Way Up\"—Fat Joe & Remy Ma Featuring French Montana & Infared \"That Part\"—ScHoolboy Q Featuring Kanye West Will win: \"Panda\" Should win: \"Panda\" In conclusion: Newcomer Desiigner rocketed to fame from the success of his chart-topping trap anthem \"Panda,\" and broke streaming records for it, too. Best Rap Song Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \"All The Way Up\"—Joseph Cartagena, Edward Davadi, Shandel Green, Karim Kharbouch, Andre Christopher Lyon, Reminisce Mackie & Marcello Valenzano, songwriters (Fat Joe & Remy Ma Featuring French Montana & Infared) \"Famous\"—Chancelor Bennett, Ross Birchard, Ernest Brown, Andrew Dawson, Kasseem Dean, Mike Dean, Noah Goldstein, Kejuan Muchita, Patrick Reynolds, Kanye West & Cydel Young, songwriters (Kanye West Featuring Rihanna) \"Hotline Bling\"—Aubrey Graham & Paul Jefferies, songwriters (Drake) \"No Problem\"—Chancelor Bennett, Dwayne Carter & Tauheed Epps, songwriters (Chance The Rapper Featuring Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz) \"Ultralight Beam\"—Chancelor Bennett, Kasseem Dean, Mike Dean, Kirk Franklin, Noah Goldstein, Samuel Griesemer, Terius Nash, Jerome Potter, Kelly Price, Nico \"Donnie Trumpet\"—Segal, Derek Watkins, Kanye West & Cydel Young, songwriters (Kanye West Featuring Chance The Rapper, Kelly Price, Kirk Franklin & The-Dream) Will win: \"Ultralight Beam\" Should win: \"No Problem\" In conclusion: Don't get me wrong. \"Ultralight Beam\" is a Kanye epic, from the evangelical choir to the fantastic Chance the Rapper verse. But this was truly Chance the Rapper's year and I'm secretly hoping he gets to take home the award for his own song (huh huh). Best Rap Album Coloring Book —Chance The Rapper And the Anonymous Nobody —De La Soul Major Key —DJ Khaled Blank Face LP —ScHoolboy Q The Life of Pablo —Kanye West Will win: Views Should win: The Life of Pablo In conclusion: Though TLOP and Coloring Book are strong contenders (and definitely less controversial than Drake's sampling habits), Drake will likely take home the award for its record-breaking (and instantly viral) hits. Best Country Album Big Day In A Small Town —Brandy Clark Full Circle —Loretta Lynn A Sailor's Guide To Earth —Sturgill Simpson Ripcord —Keith Urban Will win: A Sailor's Guide to Earth Should win: A Sailor's Guide to Earth In conclusion: Sturgill Simpson's A Sailor's Guide to Earth was the only country album nominated for \"Album of the Year,\" and if he doesn't strike gold there, we're thinking progressive country artist will take home the big prize here. His eclectic and refreshingly modern take on the genre sounds unique to anything I've heard from country in a while.
