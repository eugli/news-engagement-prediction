Article continues below \nSpeaking to The Sun , Haye said he is looking for a fight that would be a defining moment in his career, and he feels a bout between the two would be the biggest in their respective careers. \n“You want the biggest possible fight — me and Joshua is the biggest for us both. We could sell out Wembley Stadium twice over.

He learned later in life but he has a lot of things in his favour, he’s on a roll. \n“There’s no doubt I think the defining fight of my career is still to come — and a good start would be Joshua.” \nHowever, for now, Haye's full focus should be on Bellew, the Liverpudlian who he faces next weekend. \nBarbs have been thrown from both camps with Haye doubting Bellew's fighting credentials saying that the WBC cruiserweight champion has got to this point of his career \"the easy way\" compared to his own boxing journey. \nHaye says it is much easier for him to be motivated for a fight by having a clear dislike for his opponent, which he says it not hard to find when it comes to Bellew who hails from Merseyside. \nHaye said: \"If you think your opponent is lovely and you are going to hang out and go to the movies together, then you are not going to push yourself to smash him to bits. \n\"But I don't even have to try and hate this guy. He has got the most unlikeable personality of any current British fighter.\" \nThose comments certainly light the fuse for what should be an explosive fight at the 02 Arena in London next Saturday night. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
