Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Mexican officials later Thursday, including Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray, with whom Tillerson is expected to deliver a joint statement.\nStory Continued Below\nBut Tillerson’s trip to Mexico City comes as tensions between both nations have been further inflamed by newly released guidance empowering U.S. officials to detain and deport immigrants.\n“Right now, Rex, who, as you know, he’s in Mexico. I said, ‘That’s gonna be a tough trip,’ because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico,” Trump said Thursday, ahead of a listening session with manufacturing executives at the White House. “That's gonna be a tough trip.”\nThe Homeland Security Department this week released sweeping guidelines on deportations and the president’s long-promised border wall, a potentially ill-timed decision adding to the new administration’s diplomatic flare-ups with its southern neighbor.\nDHS Secretary John Kelly will join Tillerson for a working lunch with Videgaray and other officials before an afternoon meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who last month canceled a White House visit after Trump challenged him to accept that Mexico will fund the border wall. \nTrump hailed his “great team” as a roster of “all-stars” that he said his administration has “really been given credit for.”\n“But he’s over there with Gen. Kelly, who’s been unbelievable at the border,” Trump said of Tillerson, adding that “for the first time,” the U.S. is getting gang members and drug members out of the country. \n“We’re getting really bad dudes out of this country — and at a rate that nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump continued. “And they’re the bad ones. And it’s a military operation, because what has been allowed to come into our country — when you see gang violence that you’ve read about like never before and all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally. And they’re rough and tough, but they’re not as tough like our people. So we’re getting them out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:35:52.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
