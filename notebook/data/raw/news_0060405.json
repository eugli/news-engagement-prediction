Mark was a much loved and important member of our family in the Philippines, and our thoughts and prayers are with him, his family, and friends at this very difficult time.” \nMark Dehesa had been working as a brand strategist in the PR division of the agency’s Manila office for less than a year after holding accounts roles at area JWT, Publicis and BBDO operations. \nAccording to a source identified as a former colleague of Dehesa’s, he worked until 4 AM on Thursday night/Friday morning preparing for an early meeting. This party tells us that he then stayed at the office until 9 that night before asking to be driven to the hospital while visibly shaking. He died two days later. \nThe agency declined to elaborate on the circumstances that preceded Dehesa’s death. \nThe very day he passed, this post from Ogilvy copywriter Jeff Stelton got a lot of attention from agency employees in the area. Stelton, who had worked with Dehesa in some capacity, later added the edit to clarify that he was not attributing the tragedy to overwork. \nMany others also said their goodbyes on social media. This news comes less than two months after Dentsu global CEO Tadashi Ishii resigned in the face of potential charges related to the 2015 suicide of an account manager who jumped to her death from the company dormitory. She had previously posted about abusive bosses on social media and claimed to have worked more than 100 hours of overtime in a single month. \nOther recent deaths of young agency employees have been attributed to overwork—including those of Li Yuan of Ogilvy Beijing and Y&R Indonesia copywriter Mita Diran , who fell into a coma soon after sending this tweet. 30 hours of working and still going strooong. \n— Mita Diran (@mitdoq) December 14, 2013 \nBoth passed in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:07:32.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
