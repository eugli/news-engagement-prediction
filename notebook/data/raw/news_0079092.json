He slipped on his f***ing a**e. He gave it to Demba Ba. Steve Gerrard, Gerrard,’ they sang with glee while one supporter held the sign triumphantly aloft. \nThe song relates to Gerrard’s infamous slip against Chelsea which cost his side the Premier League title in 2014. \nWatch a clip of the song, captured by James Daly , below: To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nAs a hapless steward came forward to retrieve the sign, the United fans changed tack. \n‘You Scouse b d, you Scouse b d,’ they chanted. \nLiverpool had been Premier League leaders that season three years ago. \nBrendan Rodgers had found a seemingly winning formula built around the attacking threat of Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Luis Suarez. \nBut it wasn’t to be. Gerrard’s stumble at Anfield in late April allowed Ba through for a crucial goal just before half-time and Liverpool never recovered.
