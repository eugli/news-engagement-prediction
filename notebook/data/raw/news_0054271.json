Study after study shows that the millennial generation — as the largest and most diverse generation ever — places a great deal of value on experiences. It isn't enough to buy something, doing so has to be a fabulous experience. At Bonobos, a shopper makes an appointment to see a salesperson or, in Bonobos parlance, a guide. The salesperson provides the shopper with one-on-one attention — after greeting him with a choice of beverage: pop, water or local beer.

Ginormous stores that try to be everything to all people aren't doing so well these days — look at Macy's which is shuttering stores all over the country, including stores at Eastland in Harper Woods and in Westland. Meanwhile, Bonobos is on an expansion jag. Bonobos knows what it is: a small store that sells millennials (or men with a millennial mindset) nicely made, hip, close-fitting clothing in a variety -- most in tailored, slim, straight or athletic cuts -- and sizes. While the emphasis is on fit, you'll be out of luck if you're a big guy.. (Waist sizes start at 28 and run to 40. Suits start at $500, jeans at $108, dress shirts at $90 and chinos at $88.) \n\"That's what's interesting about this type of model, it really is the anti-department store model,'' said Stephen Barr, consumer markets leader for the consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"It’s a concept that’s going to continue to challenge the large department stores, and I also think it’s a concept that’s going to challenge the online offerings as well.\" \nFrom 2016: Cash has lost cachet for new Detroit shop Kit and Ace \n• It's investing in brick-and-mortar. Walmart, which started as a brick-and-mortar retailer, is investing intensely in its online business. But at Bonobos, things are different. Bonobos started selling chinos in 2007 as an online-only retailer. It opened a pop-up shop inside its corporate headquarters in New York because of shopper demand. Since then it has established 30 stores across the country — the Detroit store will make 31. Like eyeglass purveyor Warby Parker, which made the move from being a Web-only retailer to including brick-and-mortar stores in its lineup — there's one just up Woodward from Bonobos — and Amazon, which is opening bookstores, Bonobos realizes that some shoppers prefer the old-school brick-and-mortar experience. They want to touch the merchandise and talk face to face with a salesperson. In that way Bonobos is like vinyl — a hip throwback. \n\"I believe the retail store is alive and well, it’s only the retail store of the past that is dead.'' said Barr. \"For those retailers that can be agile and engage with the consumer in a meaningful, relevant way for today’s boundary-less retail environment, I think there's tremendous upsides for long-term success.\" \nOne of those upsides, And that upside, said Ken Nisch, president of JGA, a Southfield-based retail design and branding firm, is \"the stability of a physical place to interact with your customers\" which results in \"relationship building.\" \nAlso, shoppers at brick-and-mortar stores tend to spend more money than shoppers who shop at online stores. \n• It's a showroom. Just as there's a trend toward tiny houses — watch HGTV — there's also a trend toward small stores with limited on-site inventory. Bonobos, at 1,700 square feet, stocks one of everything it sells for shoppers to try on. Sales people place online orders for shoppers. And the clothing arrives at the shopper's house in one or two business days. \"If you think about the more traditional retail environment, often times you come in, you might get ignored, it might be tough to dig through the piles of clothing,\" says Erin Ersenkal, chief revenue officer for Bonobos. \"We've shifted a lot of focus ... to the customer.\" Buy Photo \nBonobos, a menswear store that consults, fits and then mails your purchases is photographed Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017 in downtown Detroit.

Bonobos has smartly decorated its space with Detroit-centric posters. Presenting shoppers with that sort of local feel isn't really possible online, said Nisch, because \"online isn't a physical space.\" Buy Photo \nBonobos, a menswear store that consults, fits and then mails your purchases is photographed Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017 in downtown Detroit.
