The storied franchise, which is halfway through yet another losing season, has decided to bring in an advisor to team president Jeanie Buss. Hall of Famer Magic Johnson has agreed to return to the team in an advisory capacity, according to Lakers.com : \nThe Los Angeles Lakers today announced that Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson will return to the Lakers to assist Jeanie Buss in all areas of basketball and business as an advisor. \nAlong with advising Buss, Johnson will also take on a mentor role with the team. Magic will help mentor the likes of the team's young players like D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, and Julius Randle and will also collaborate with Luke Walton and his staff, via Lakers.com: \nJohnson's duties will include, but not be limited to, advising ownership on all business and basketball matters, collaborating with coaches, evaluating and mentoring players, assessing future franchise needs, and helping ownership to determine the best path for growth and success. Johnson will spend time at Lakers offices in El Segundo and will report directly to Jeanie Buss. \nWith the team on the verge of missing the playoffs for a fourth straight season, it comes as no surprise a drastic move was made to help get the franchise back on the right track. Johnson, who has always maintained a close relationship with Buss, recently sat down with the team's president before a game a few weeks ago. Details of the new arrangement were likely being hashed out to pave the way for his return to the team. \nNow that Magic is back in the fold, the fate of Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak remains uncertain. Jim, who famously made a self-imposed deadline for when he'd step down in the instance the team continued to struggle, has seemingly run out of time with his deadline expiring after this season. \nAs Buss' future hangs in the balance, Walton will continue to try to steer his struggling squad in the right direction and finish his first season as head coach on a high note. Walton, despite only leading the team to 17 wins thus far, has done an admirable job in his first year and will likely remain in the team's long-term plans.
