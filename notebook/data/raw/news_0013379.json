(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Related Stories \nAbout 200 Canadian people have been unable to use their Nexus cards to cross the American border since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a temporary halt to immigration from certain countries, the federal public safety minister said Monday. \n\"None of them are Canadian citizens,\" Ralph Goodale said during question period Monday. \n\"We are working with our American counterparts to make sure that all Canadians are treated fairly.\" U.S. revokes Nexus cards from permanent residents with citizenship in restricted countries: CBSA \nThe Nexus program allows citizens and permanent residents in both Canada and the U.S. to be pre-screened for clearance in a bid to speed up border crossings. \nCBC Toronto reported last week that a number of Canadian-born and dual citizens have reported having their Nexus memberships revoked in the wake of a U.S. executive order barring entry to passport holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nToronto-based lawyer Cyndee Todgham Cherniak told CBC News she has been contacted by at least two Canadian-born citizens with Muslim-sounding names who received notices. \nIn the days since a sweeping ban on immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries was instituted by Trump, the Liberal government has repeatedly insisted no one travelling on a Canadian passport should have trouble at the U.S. border. \nBut how permanent residents who hold passports from any of the seven countries in question will be treated has been less clear, highlighted by the recent furor over the revocation of Nexus cards. \n\"This order is just over a week old. It is now subject to extensive court proceedings. There is a good deal of uncertainty around this whole situation,\" Goodale told reporters ahead of question period Monday. \n\"We are doing our very best to obtain clarity and to obtain fairness for Canadians in their encounters at the border.\" Stand up for permanent residents: Rempel \nOpposition immigration critic Michelle Rempel said that should include standing up for permanent residents. \n\"The Nexus vetting process is very strict, it is very stringent, there are agreements which govern how those approvals are both given and revoked. Why isn't the government standing up for Canadian interests on this?\" she said. \nImmigration Minister Ahmed Hussen has said Canada will issue temporary residency to anyone stuck in Canada because of Trump's ban, but his department has yet to release statistics on how many have applied for that relief. \nThe seven countries targeted by Trump's travel ban are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Canada Border Services Agency confirmed to CBC News last week that Nexus memberships have been revoked from all Canadian permanent residents with citizenship in any one of the seven majority-Muslim countries affected by the U.S. travel ban. with files from CBC News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:33:35.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
