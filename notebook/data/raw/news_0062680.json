But the good news is, the worst of the storm is likely to pass by mid afternoon, with showers becoming lighter and dying out by about 3pm. \nWind speeds, which have caused problems for pilots at Manchester Airport, will also gradually begin to die down. Gusts of 50mph are expected across lunchtime but will drop into the high 20s by evening. \nThe bad news is, more weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office with icy conditions and snowfall forecast for Friday.

Beyond Storm Doris it will be quite cold after and there will be clear skies. \n“It will be cold later, leading to chilly surfaces tonight.” Read More Storm Doris stops Coronation Street filming because of heavy winds and rain \nThe weather warning states: “As the more persistent rain, sleet and snow clears on Thursday afternoon and evening, temperatures will fall quickly and untreated surfaces will freeze, with ice forming, especially in areas with snow cover. \n“Further showers spreading from the west could cause salt wash-off and give further accumulations of snow in places, chiefly on high ground over Scotland.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:20:50.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
