This will result in the reduction of 20,000 MW load, energy savings of 105 billion KWh and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions savings of 80 million tonnes every year.The annual saving in electricity bills will be Rs 40,000 crore, considering an average tariff of Rs 4 per kWh.Modi also talked about solar power generation capacity crossing the 9GW mark from 2,700 MW.India has set an ambitious target of having 100 GW of solar power generation capacity by 2022.
