Finalize your guest list first \nSticking to a realistic budget is a key factor in preventing wedding-related stress. \nAccording to Brownridge, the best way to set your budget is to first figure out your guest list. \nAccording to the BBB, Canadians spend an average of nearly $30,000 on their wedding. Meet all of your vendors in person \nBe sure to meet with caterers, DJs, photographers and other vendors in person to discuss your wishes in detail. \n“If they are asking for full payment up front, that could be a red flag,” Brownridge said. “It’s a really risky investment and you want to make sure you’re not going to get caught paying for something when you don’t receive the service.” \nYou can check out reviews and complaints of potential vendors at bbb.org before doing business with them. Use a credit card to pay for everything \n“We advise people to pay with a credit card wherever possible,” Brownridge said. \n“If something goes wrong, you have should have some recourse through your credit card provider to dispute some charges if you don’t receive the service you’ve paid for.” \nIn addition, the BBB warns against mailing a cheque or sending an email money transfer to someone you haven’t met. Don’t just ask for references, call them \nIt’s not enough to simply ask potential vendors for references, you have to follow through and call them. \n“Make sure they’re not fake references or even good friends of the service provider,” Brownridge said. \nShe advises asking if they were satisfied with the products or services. Don’t give in to high-pressure sales \nDon’t let high-pressure wedding planners or sales people push you around. \nThe BBB advises asking for written contracts that include timelines, prices and cancellation policies. \nIn addition, they suggest accounting for some delays in the process. It is better to schedule extra time than have something be delivered too late. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
