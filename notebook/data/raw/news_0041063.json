Senate Bill 107 , introduced by Sen. Karl Rhoads , was referred to the Senate Ways and Means Committee after passing the Committee on Judiciary and Labor on Tuesday. Enlarge A bill moving through the Hawaii Legislature proposes increasing the minimum wage to $15… more The bill proposes increasing the minimum wage to $12.25 per hour in 2018 and $15 per hour in 2019. It also would repeal language allowing the hourly wage of a tipped employee to be increased on account of tips. Another one of the bill’s measures would require the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations to annually calculate the adjusted minimum wage rate to the nearest five cents using the Honolulu region consumer price index. The bill will go before the Senate Ways and Means Committee next. Meanwhile, House Bill 5 , which calls for a minimum wage of $15 by 2021, was deferred by the House Committee on Labor and Public Employment on Tuesday.
