They add that the changes 'will see a number of departments and roles within the organisation consolidated, leading to a reduction of the club's workforce'. No numbers have been officially confirmed. A source told Sportsmail : 'This is absolutely terrible news. We are talking about a lot of people who have worked here for years and years. People who love the club. People who can't even think about working elsewhere. This has been an awful place to be today and everyone is worried sick.' Sunderland travelled across the pond for a four-day bonding trip in New York City The redundancies will not be the first of the season. In November, Sportsmail revealed a number of administration workers, based at the stadium, departed. The group involved long-serving members of staff while the moves raised concerns the club were preparing for relegation from the Premier League with the season less than three months old. Last week, Moyes took his first team on a trip to New York. And the timing has been questioned by one member of staff, who did not wish to be named. Sunderland stars (l-r) Papy Djilobodji, Wahbi Khazri, Lamine Kone, Mika, and Javier Manquillo pose for a picture in New York during their winter training camp ‘By all accounts they hardly kicked a ball,’ they said. ‘It was gym work at the hotel and then out sightseeing and watching basketball matches. I can’t imagine the hotel would have been cheap and then we get this news today. It’s hard to take, to say the least.’ Sunderland say the players trained while on the trip and that the bonding exercise was also aimed at bringing the players together ahead of a late bid to remain in the top flight. Sunderland chief executive, Martin Bain said: 'In recent months we have undertaken a detailed review of the club's entire operation. It is clear that the business had lost its focus and we now have to ensure that we are better equipped to be able to concentrate on the areas that are key to taking Sunderland AFC forward. 'Our infrastructure provides a tremendous platform and it is important that we capitalise on this by channeling our efforts into those areas that will have an impact. We want to ensure that the football club is in the best possible position to grow stronger, both on and off the field. David Moyes's side are bottom of the Premier League and edging towards relegation 'The decisions have not been taken lightly. The internal process required in order to undertake the changes has already commenced and club staff have been advised of the procedures and timescales involved.' The Black Cats have denied that owner Ellis Short is actively trying to sell the club despite the fact he had a brochure created last year to advertise the benefits of buying David Moyes's bottom-placed side. He is thought to be open to a sale should he believe it to be in Sunderland's best interests. The club are thought to have losses of around £140m. In 2015 they recorded a £25m loss and revenues at the Stadium of Light have shown little signs of growth. One source said that the club are at a disadvantage as they have to pay a premium to entice players to the city.
