According to a story published in the Guardian , Gaiman is already three chapters into the book, which will be called The Seven Sisters (after a historic and legend-filled area in north London). While he's a faster writer than, say, George R.R. Martin , who is now more than five years into The Winds of Winter , fans will have to put a pin in their excitement for at least a little while. I'm not releasing it. I'm writing it. (One word at a time.) Two very, very different things. https://t.co/0smcbzV6BR — Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) February 17, 2017 According to the Guardian , Gaiman gave the audience the following insight into the project. Neverwhere for me was this glorious vehicle where I could talk about huge serious things and have a ridiculous amount of fun on the way. The giant wheel has turned over the last few years and looking around the work I have been doing for UNHCR for refugees, the kind of shape … London is in now, the kind of ways [it] is different to how it was 20 years ago, meant that I decided that it actually was time to do something.“Now I had things I was angry about. I cared about things I wanted to put in and I’m now a solid three chapters in to a book called The Seven Sisters.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:42:23.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
