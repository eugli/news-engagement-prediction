Madlib © Maria Jose Govea/Red Bull Content Pool By Chris Parkin on 7 February 2017 \nKeeping up with Madlib is a little like chasing after an ice cream van in your dreams – you'll never quite catch up. The Californian beat master has released the bulk of his sprawling back catalogue on his long-time friend Peanut Butter Wolf 's Stones Throw imprint, including countless records under his own name but also as squeaky rapper Quasimoto , Madvillian (with MF Doom ) and Jaylib (with J Dilla ). He's also brought his looping samples, rare beats and love of jazz to records by Kanye , Talib Kweli , Freddie Gibbs and many more. His 2015 album Bad Neighbour , with MED and Blu , is still a big hit among hip-hop heads. \nWe can expect more major action from Madlib in 2017. But until those new sounds arrive, here are a few things we learned about him from his chat at RBMA Festival New York 2016 . Madlib's dad was a soul singer \nOtis Jackson might have been a cult name but tracks like Beggin' For A Broken Heart , from 1974, remain highly collectable. Not only that, but Madlib's mum – a pianist – wrote all of his dad's music. \"My pops had me at the studio since I was born. That's why I got into music. He always let me go up on the controls and just mess with stuff. Engineers get mad. 'Let the brother do it!' Mess with stuff. That's how I learned.\" Madlib created his MC alter-ego Quasimoto because he doesn't like his own voice \nOne of Stones Throw's biggest sellers, Madlib's (now-probably-retired) rapping alter-ego Quasimoto has released three albums – The Unseen (2000), The Further Adventures Of Lord Quas (2005) and 2013's brilliant Yessir Whatever . But Madlib came up with Quas, and his pitched-up style, to hide his own voice. “They said I sound like Barry White. So I had to do something to make it sound where I like it. I don't like my regular voice so I just had to zone out in many ways. I don't advise this but I took some shrooms and just bugged out and tried to think of something different and that s**t came about. But I never intended to put it out, I just did it for me to just listen to.\" The quest for beats is like meditation for Madlib \nSearching for new beats and samples is a daunting task. First the never-ending crate-digging, then hours of deep, deep listening. But for Madlib, it's how he relaxes. \"Yeah. I shut off from the world. It's just something you can't try to do. It's just something that happens. That's my life. It's a blessing and a curse because my time is spent doing that, but I also have a family and things.” Madlib on the decks © Desiré van den Berg/Red Bull Content Pool Life could've been different without music \nViolent crime was all around Madlib when he was growing up Oxnard, Southern California. But with his headphones on and mountains of records to get through, Madlib barely even noticed. “From where I'm from, dudes was shooting and gang-banging so… I was looking weird with a clock on my s**t and a bobcat hat, all that type of s**t. I was following Public Enemy , all that type of stuff.\" His Madvillain duo with MF Doom wasn't really work \nThe duo's Madvillainy record, from 2004, is one of Stones Throw 's best-known releases. But for an album that carries so much weight, the making of it was no big deal at all. \"We just hung out, went to clubs, got drunk. I’ll hand him a beats CD, I go to sleep, he’ll work on some music, he’ll go to sleep, I’ll wake up, I’ll make some more beats, listen to what he did. We might take some shrooms together if we awake at the same time, and then listen to the music when it’s done.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:17:24.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
