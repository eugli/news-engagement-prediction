(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Monique Garcia and Haley BeMiller changed shape yet again Tuesday, with lawmakers floating the idea of applying a higher state sales tax to food and drugs.\nThe change allows backers to shelve a proposed \"opportunity tax\" that would charge companies for the \"privilege\" of doing business in the state. That ran into opposition from business groups. But the broad nature of the sales tax expansion is likely to spawn arguments that it hits hardest those least able to afford the increase. \nSome background: the state sales tax on most goods is 6.25 percent. The rate, however, is just 1 percent for many food, drugs and medical supplies — think stuff bought at the grocery store. It's higher in places where local governments can impose their own taxes. In Cook County, for example, shoppers pay an additional 1.25 percent tax to the Regional Transportation Authority for a 2.25 percent total rate. \nHere's how the Senate plan would work: the overall sales tax rate of 6.25 percent would drop to 5.75 percent, but it would be applied to a broader range of goods including food, drugs and medical supplies. Cutting the overall sales tax by half a percentage point would drop the total sales tax in Chicago to 9.75 percent. In addition, services would be taxed at 5.75 percent, including car repairs, landscaping, laundry and cable and satellite. \nThe complicated sales tax changes illustrate the Senate's struggle to craft a plan that strikes enough of a balance between raising taxes and cutting costs on businesses to win votes. The Senate effort comes as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic lawmakers are in the throes of unprecedented gridlock that's left state government without a comprehensive spending plan since July 2015. \nSenate leaders, who have held out the prospect that their massive plan would be voted on several times already, say they're pushing for a vote this week. They acknowledge it's unlikely to end up as law even if it escapes the Senate, but they hope it will prove that bipartisan compromise is possible down the road. Rick Pearson, Kim Geiger and Monique Garcia \nRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner said Wednesday that he will offer state lawmakers this month a budget proposal in the same format that the Democratic-led General Assembly rejected last year — either work with him on crafting a balanced spending plan or give him more power to make cuts on his own. ... \nRepublican Gov.

(Rick Pearson, Kim Geiger and Monique Garcia) \nThe sales tax hike combined with a measure to raise the raise the personal income tax rate from 3.75 percent to 4.99 percent would bring in an estimated $6.5 billion a year for state coffers. Facing a bill backlog expected to soon hit $15 billion, it's money the state could use to bring its books closer to balance, but politicians on both sides of the aisle are wary of raising taxes. \nMeanwhile, Republicans have argued that provisions of the budget proposal aimed at propping up businesses don't go far enough to make their votes for a tax increase worth it. They've taken particular issue with a measure to scale back costs of the state's workers' compensation program, saying it contains only minor nips and tucks. Some also have pushed for major cuts in government spending, saying Illinois has a bad habit of relying on tax increases instead of spending reductions. \nSupporters say it's past the time for lawmakers to make some hard decisions, noting that universities, social service programs, prisons and veterans homes are scraping by now without any funding from the state.
