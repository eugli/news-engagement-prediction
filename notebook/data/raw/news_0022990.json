Oakley has had a contentious relationship with Knicks owner James Dolan, and Dolan was in the vicinity of Oakley's outburst. Oakley has claimed he wasn't saying anything disruptive, but sources at the scene told ESPN otherwise , so there's some dispute about it. \nThe Knicks issued a statement Wednesday night putting all blame on Oakley and finishing by saying they \"hope he gets help.\" After Oakley claimed he did nothing wrong, the team doubled down on their view of the situation on Thursday: — NY_KnicksPR (@NY_KnicksPR) February 9, 2017 \nOakley took to ESPN Radio on Thursday and apologized for being a \"troublemaker.\" Oakley on ESPN-NY Radio said, \"I want to say I'm sorry to all the fans of the Garden. I never want to be a troublemaker in life.\" — Al Iannazzone (@Al_Iannazzone) February 9, 2017 \nThen Oakley said the most Oakley thing ever: Oakley on ESPN-NY Radio on confrontations: \"One guy, try your luck. Eight, 9 guys, I have to brace myself and be ready for the challenge.\" — Al Iannazzone (@Al_Iannazzone) February 9, 2017 \nHe's not lying. \nBut Oakley's still upset with the team, especially after their original statement: \"Another smack in the face\" is what Oakley called the end of Knicks' statement... \"we hope he gets some help soon.\" — Al Iannazzone (@Al_Iannazzone) February 9, 2017 \nThe drama continues for New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:26:08.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
