Ted Cruz on Thursday predicted that there will be another Supreme Court vacancy “this summer,” on top of the current opening on the high court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \n“This summer, I think we’ll have another Supreme Court vacancy,” he told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference, prompting applause and then some murmurs from the crowd. \nSupreme Court justices receive lifetime appointments, and their tenure only ends when they retire or die. \nHe said the left would go even crazier at that point than they are now as the U.S. Senate weighs President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia. \n“Because the next vacancy is where we have the ability to get back and restore basic constitutional protections,” he said. \nMr. Cruz is a former clerk for past Chief Justice William Rehnquist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:09:57.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
