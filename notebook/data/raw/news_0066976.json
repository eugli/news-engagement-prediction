Scroll down for video A limestone column may hold the key to the location of a cave where a Galilean sage hid from Roman soldiers, roughly two millennia ago THE SETTLEMENT OF PEQI'IN Peqi'in is known as a place where, for hundreds of years, Jews and Druze lived together peacefully. The city has an important place in Jewish tradition, famous for its cave which housed Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and his son, Rabbi Elazar ben Shimon, after they escaped the Romans following the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132 CE. Peqi'in also plays an important role in Jewish continuity in the Holy Land. From the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, until only a few years ago, there had been a continuous Jewish presence in the city. Over time, the Jews adopted the dress and language of their Arab neighbors, in order to blend in, though keeping their own religion. But life became increasingly difficult for the Jews of Peqi'in in the early part of the 20th century. Arab riots in 1936 caused most Jewish families to flee and only a few returned. Key Jewish texts tell of the Galilean sages that lived in Peqi'in, including Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who is said to have hidden from the Romans. Some scholars disagree with the identification of the village as the correct location for the cave. But the team behind the column's discovery believes it will add important information to their understanding of the Jewish settlement present in the area during the Roman and Byzantine periods. The discovery was made at the site of an existing synagogue, built upon the location of an older ancient synagogue which was destroyed during an earthquake in the nineteenth century. The stone was found upside down in the courtyard of the current synagogue at Peqi'i. The inscriptions carved upon the stone slab were analysed by archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) soon after the find, who came to the conclusion that they are dedicated to donors of the earlier building. Yoav Lerer, the IAA inspector in the Western Galilee, said: 'The Talmudic and Midrashic sources tell of the Galilean sages that lived in Peqi'in, including Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who hid from the Romans in a cave. 'However, there are those who disagree with the identification of the location of Peqi'in.
