I need time’ and I take more time, because before, I didn’t even have any questions. He said, ‘We do this. We go on tour. This is what we do. This TV show, not this one.’ He was on top of it…he was my husband and my manager. Today it’s like, ‘Let me pause on that, and I’ll come back to you.’”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:46:32.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
