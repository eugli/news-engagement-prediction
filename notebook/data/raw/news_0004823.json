What is the government trying to do? \nThe leftist government, led by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, of the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD), says it needs to ease overcrowding in prisons. Image copyright AFP Image caption The decree adopted by the government of PM Grindeanu (R) could immediately benefit the leader of his party, Liviu Dragnea (L) \nIn its emergency decree, passed late on Tuesday, it decriminalises several offences and makes abuse of power punishable by incarceration only if it results in a monetary loss of more than €44,000 (£38,000; $48,000). \nOne immediate beneficiary would be the PSD leader, Liviu Dragnea, who faces charges of defrauding the state of €24,000. Why are Romanians so angry? \nThe anger on the streets is because the decree seems tailor-made to get dozens of public figures serving prison sentences out, reports the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Bucharest. \nIt would blunt the spear of the powerful National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) in future cases, he says. \nThe DNA has launched 1,170 prosecutions in the past three years, in cases which cost the state more than €1bn. Its chief prosecutor, Laura Kovesi, estimates that the decree could affect one in three of these. \nMs Kovesi has earned praise from the international community for her efforts to fight corruption, but told AP news agency that this latest legislation would \"render the anti-corruption fight irrelevant\". \nRomania virtual gallery turns corruption into art What now? \nThe issue has set the new government at loggerheads with both the judiciary and the president - less than a month after taking office. \nNow Romania's supreme council of magistrates has unanimously agreed to take the emergency decree to the Constitutional Court. That is probably the last legal obstacle in the government's path, our correspondent says. \nA separate amnesty law freeing inmates serving sentences of up to five years for non-violent crimes will now be debated by parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:17:38.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
