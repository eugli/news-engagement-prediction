Institutional investors should raise those questions. They have a duty...institutional investors should raise questions on governance because it concerns the company’s reputation,” Pai told PTI in an interview. \nAnother former CFO, V Balakrishnan, said an interim chairman should be appointed at the earliest to “effectively” engage with its co-founders. \nDemanding that chairman Ramaswami Seshasayee step down, Balakrishnan said he should take responsibility for the “lapses” in corporate governance at the Bengaluru-based company.
