(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Southeastern Conference continued flexing — and growing — its financial muscle, showing revenue of $639 million during its 2016 fiscal year, according to its new federal tax return. \nThe return, provided to USA TODAY Sports by the conference on Thursday, showed that the distributions to its 14 members schools ranged from $41.9 million for the University of Georgia to $39.1 million for Alabama and Mississippi. \nThe SEC is the first conference to release its tax records for the 2016 fiscal year, but its revenue distributions —– helped by the burgeoning SEC Network — may swamp those of even other Power Five conferences. In fiscal 2015, the Big Ten distributed about $32.4 million to each of its 11 longest-standing members. The other three power conferences distributed millions less per school. \nFor another point of comparison, consider that the SEC's 2016 revenue was roughly two-thirds of the $952 million that the NCAA reported on its most recently available tax returm, which covered a period ending Aug. 31, 2015. \nFormer commissioner Mike Slive, who concluded a 13-year run in the job in the middle of 2015, was paid more than $4.3 million in total compensation during the 2015 calendar year, the new return showed. SEC spokesman Herb Vincent said the total included Silve's salary as commissioner through July 31; what Vincent termed \"one-time departure compensation,\" plus the 2015 portion of consulting pay that the return said was $250,000 over the conference's fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, 2016. \nVincent declined to provide the amount of the one-time payment, which was not detailed in the new return. \nCollege athletics conferences are set up as non-profit organizations. Because of IRS rules about how non-profits must report compensation of their most highly paid employees, those pay figures must cover the most recently completed calendar year. Other expenses and revenues are reported based on the organization's fiscal year. \nSlive’s successor, Greg Sankey, had total compensation of nearly $1.25 million during the 2015 calendar year. But Sankey served as commissioner for only seven months of that year; he served as the conference’s chief operating officer prior to his promotion. \nAmong power conferences other than the Big Ten in fiscal 2015: \n►Among the ACC’s 14 schools other than Notre Dame, which remains an independent in football, the conference distributions ranged from $27.6 million for Florida State to just under $24 million for Syracuse. Notre Dame received $6.2 million. \n►The Pac-12’s per-school shares were about $25.1 million. \n►The Big 12’s were around $23.4 million, except for West Virginia and TCU, which each got a little more than $20 million. \nFor a fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2015, the SEC reported $527.4 million in total revenue — so the new figure represents a one-year increase of more than 21%, or nearly $112 million. As recently as 2011, the Pac-12's total annual revenue was slightly less than $112 million. \nMost of the SEC's new increase came in the amount conference reported as coming from TV and radio rights fees. On the new return, the SEC listed $420 million in such revenue. In fiscal 2015 — the first year in which amounts from the SEC Network were included — the figure was $311.8 million. That’s a one-year increase of nearly 35%. \nThe figure is double the $210.4 million the TV and radio revenue conference reported for its 2014 fiscal year. \nThe SEC’s revenue in 2016 from what its return describes as postseason events — which includes its share of money from the College Football Playoff — grew to $180.6 million, up from $162.8 million in 2015 and $98.6 million in 2014. 33 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
