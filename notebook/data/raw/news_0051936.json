But as a coach, Rivers does not want to make major changes to the Clippers' lineup. Doc Rivers (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:32 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:32 a.m. ET \nThere is something to be said for the separation of powers in an NBA front office. \nBack when Doc Rivers was still toiling for the Celtics, working under team president Danny Ainge, Rivers would sometimes chafe at the transactions Ainge would try to make. So when Rivers left the Celtics to take over the Clippers in 2013, he made sure that he was given control over personnel as well as the Xs and Os. \nBut that gets tricky at a time like this. Actually, it’s been tricky for the better part of a year, as Doc the Personnel Man does battle with Doc the Coach over the future of the Clippers franchise. \nAt issue has been Blake Griffin, a franchise cornerstone for the Clippers, a guy who is putting up 21.9 points, 8.8 rebounds and 5.0 assists. But Griffin has had trouble staying healthy, had a well-publicized scuffle with a team employee last season and has been part of a Clippers core that has been disappointing in the postseason. \nMORE: The latest NBA trade rumors \nAs a personnel man, Rivers understands that it’s in the best interest of the franchise to investigate Griffin’s value around the league. He did it last summer, including in talks with Ainge about Griffin. But the problem is that Rivers the Coach does not want to entertain the notion of trading Griffin, despite the instincts of Rivers the Personnel Man. \n“(Rivers) does this little dance with himself,” one source familiar with the Clippers’ approach to trades said. “He can get himself close to making something happen, to making a change, but then the coach side of him comes in and does not want to change too much. He’s a coach, he wants to have talent. He does not want to do deals where he is giving up the best player in the trade. No coach does.” \nRivers has arrived back at that juncture here in the days ahead of the trade deadline. He’s got Griffin, who will be a free agent this summer, and has the opportunity to cash him in — just as he did last summer during talks with the Celtics. The Clippers could get back young assets, or, as rumored, could get back Chris Paul’s pal Carmelo Anthony in a three-team trade involving Boston and New York. That deal wouldn’t really make the Clippers all that much better, but given their recent playoff flops, shaking up the lineup might not be a bad idea. \nBut Rivers the Coach has a hard time getting on board with a deal like that, no matter how much Rivers the Personnel Man is tugged toward a change. \nMORE: Big Baby takes a shot at Doc Rivers \nAs a coach, Rivers looks at his talent and sees the possibilities that his team has when fully healthy, with Griffin on board. He does not focus on the Clippers’ past disappointments. Instead, he sees what the Clippers can be if they keep the roster exactly as it is. And they can be pretty good. That makes trading Griffin a difficult proposition. \nRivers will continue to investigate the market, though. As team president, he is required to do so. But as a coach, Rivers does not want to make major changes to the lineup. Rivers would occasionally butt heads with Ainge on moves with the Celtics. Now, as coach and team president, he is butting heads with himself.
