How does Memphis compare to these old Trafford flops? \nHis first couple of performances were relatively non descript, before he was awarded a dismal 2/10 for his showing in a 2-0 defeat to St. Etienne. \nHowever, one high point of his embryonic spell with Lyon was the scoring of his first goal , against Nancy. Memphis Depay just scored his first goal for Lyon! #TeamOL #Depay #OLASNL pic.twitter.com/WuLjX5RDO8 - Morad (@moradfutbol) February 8, 2017 \nAnd today Memphis registered his first assist for the Ligue Un giants, laying on Corentin Lorisso during 'Les Gones'' 4-2 victory over Dijon. \nHowever, that moment was somewhat overshadowed by the sitter the former PSV Eindhoven winger missed during the first half, with the score level at 1-1. - Pocho (@pocho692) February 19, 2017 \nDepay's overall stats from today's game were pretty impressive though, proving that perhaps the Netherlands international has been written off too early by some (we've been guilty of giving him a fair amount of grief in the past, admittedly). Memphis Depay with 7 chances created, 1 assist, 80% pass succession in the final third and 3/7 takeons. Criticised too early??- Chaka Simbeye (@chaka_simbeye) February 19, 2017 \nIf these chances begin to hit the back of the net rather than the advertising hoardings on a more regular basis, the £17m Lyon paid for the 23-year-old could prove to be a steal.
