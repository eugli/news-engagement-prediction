They were the overwhelming favourites and yet Australia brushed India aside with ease. \nHere's why it happened: 1. Failing to click in all departments \nAFP \nThe 19 Tests that India did not lose before this saw them being bailed out with either bowling or batting and sometimes fielding. On occasions all three departments fired and that proved to be a strong factor. But in Pune, their batting failed, the bowling did not do as well and the fielding was poor with some easy chances going down. 2. Fatigue coming in to play \nAFP \nNot that a crowded season should be used as an excuse, but at one point fatigue was bound to catch up with the Indians. They had played 14 Tests in the last 8 months or so and the pressure of too many games was bound to get to them sooner or later. 3. Rank turner backfiring on the hosts \nAFP \nThe Pune pitch was expected to help the spinners but who said that only the Indians would benefit? Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon proved to be unplayable on the track and the Indians were found wanting against quality spin bowling. For the first time, the best players of spin looked all at sea as the ball turned and bounced all over the place. 4. Aussies did their homework \nAFP \nThe visitors studied their opponents well and also took adequate preparation before coming to India. They seemed to know exactly what was required for which player and by the time the match got underway, it was a determined unit taking on the No. 1 Test team in the world.
