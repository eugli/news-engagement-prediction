(Photo: Getty Images) \n114 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A third-grade teacher at a private Scottsdale school resigned Monday after administrators became aware of the teacher's offensive social-media posts calling for the killing of undocumented residents and denouncing Muslims.\nBonnie Godin Verne, a third-grade teacher at the Pardes Jewish Day School since 2005, made recent posts on her personal Twitter account that insulted Muslims and those in the country illegally, calling for them to be shot in the head or murdered, according to several tweets.\nHead of School Jill Kessler called the tweets \"inappropriate, offensive and unbefitting of a Pardes teacher,\" in a letter to families and other members of the school community announcing the teacher's resignation. The school provided a copy of the letter to The Arizona Republic. \n\"She believes, and the school concurs, that the best course of action, both for her and Pardes, is for her to resign immediately,\" the letter said.\nAttempts to reach Verne were unsuccessful.\nA storm on social media Verne's series of tweets caused outrage on social media, with some people calling her character and political views into question.\nTwo critics of Verne's posts made screen grabs to share. One of the women, Michelle Pittiglio Castle, said she shared the Twitter screen grabs with school officials. Castle, a Michigan resident, and Lael Youngblood, who lives in Idaho, also shared them with The Republic. \n\"We can speak out, we can demand that people treat each other with kindness, dignity, respect, and equity. And when we find someone who doesn't display those values, we can demand that they pay the price for their hatred,'' Youngblood posted on Facebook in response to what she saw.\nFrom Saturday through Monday, nearly 20 comments expressing outrage were posted on the school's Facebook page. Some of the tweets were widely viewed because they were replies to tweets from Ann Coulter, a conservative national commentator, and to National Public Radio. Verne's Twitter account appeared to be shut down by Sunday.\nSchool: 'Hateful comments' have no place The school said it planned to hire a replacement teacher for the third-grade students Verne leaves behind.\n\"The leadership at our school deeply respects the rights of all citizens, including those associated with the school, to express their views, regardless of their political perspectives,'' Kessler wrote in the letter. \"However, with that right comes individual responsibility not to make hateful comments, which have no place in our school. \"\nKessler added, \"We are certain that her political views never, in any way, found their way into her classroom.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:33:32.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
