Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA toddler battling a rare form of kidney cancer hopes to raise cash for the hospital ward where she has received her treatment. \nThree-year-old Talya Toubkin is one of just a handful of people diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, which affects around 80 children in the UK every year. \nThe tot, from Withington , is being supported by family friend Lisa Headley who plans to chop her long hair and donate it to the Princess Trust in Talya’s name. \nShe also hopes to raise money for the Ward 84 at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital where Talya has received her treatment. \nLisa, who has been growing her hair so it can be used for a long wig, said she was inspired to help her friends after hearing about their struggle.

It was the morning of September 2 and I will never forget it. I went to the GP and we were sent straight to A&E where she was given a scan and started treatment. \n“When you hear your child has cancer you feel like your whole world has fallen apart.” \nTalya underwent a course of radiotherapy at The Christie just before Christmas. \nShe must now have a weekly chemotherapy session every Monday for the next four months.

It was horrific..” \nNicola, who first met Lisa when both women were pregnant, said she is very grateful to her friend for supporting the family. She said: “Lisa was thinking about donating her hair so when she found out about Talya she thought she could also help to raise money for the ward where she has been treated. It’s so kind. It’s an incredible ward. They’re like a family, everyone is so kind.” \nTo support Talya and Lisa visit: www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Lisa-Headley1 Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:44:22.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
