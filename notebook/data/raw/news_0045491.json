A spokesman for Liquor and Gaming NSW said this was \"due to legal advice\". \nIn Victoria, gambling statistics for individual venues are published by the state's regulator twice a year. \nMr Field's bill would require monthly publication of the data in NSW. \n\"The Greens are calling on NSW Racing Minister Paul Toole to end the secrecy and publish venue-by-venue data online for free on a monthly basis so the community can readily understand the true impact of this industry,\" Mr Field said. \n\"He should stand up for families and communities rather than with the vested interests of big gambling who want their damage kept secret.\" \nHowever, Mr Toole said: \"The Greens' disdain for pub and club patrons is well known. They're really just inner-city snobs who look down their nose at everyone else. \n\"I'm interested in real help for people who have a problem with gambling, not joining the Greens in their crusade to shut down local pubs and clubs,\" he said. \nClubs NSW declined to comment.
