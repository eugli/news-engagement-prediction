Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nThat run means Londoners have now beaten more Premier League sides in 2017 than the likes of giants Liverpool (1), champions Leicester City (1) and local rivals Crystal Palace (1). \nThey have even won the same number of games against top flight opposition as Premier League leaders Chelsea. Sides who have won fewer games against Premier League opposition than Millwall in 2017 \nLiverpool: 1 (games won) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:37:28.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
