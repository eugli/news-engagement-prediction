REUTERS/Ringo Chiu \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Intense rain, heavy snow and strong winds lashed California and southern Oregon on Friday, prompting the evacuation of more than a hundred homes threatened by mudslides near Los Angeles, officials said. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said within four hours on Friday afternoon it responded to 150 reports of downed wires, one of which led to a fatality. Los Angeles area utilities said power was out for more than 100,000 customers in the region. \nThe severe storm could bring California's heaviest rainfall in six years, after months of wet weather that has dramatically eased California's years-long drought. The heavy rain and melting snowpack threatened to undermine a spillway at one of the largest dams in the country, which prompted the evacuation of 188,000 residents earlier this week. \nThe city of Duarte, about 20 miles (32 km) east of Los Angeles, said it ordered residents of 180 homes to evacuate given the potential for mudslides. \nPeople with umbrellas walk across a street in Los Angeles, California, U.S. February 17, 2017. REUTERS/Ringo Chiu \nA forest fire charred an area above their homes last year, prompting concerns that heavy rain could trigger mudslides where there is no vegetation. \nAlberto Moreno, 34, piled sandbags outside his home on Friday after refusing to leave the area. \n\"The neighbors are here so we're all basically going to help out each other if it comes down to it,\" Moreno said. \nHeather Malone, 44, another Duarte resident, said she was prepared to escape by car if she saw \"half the mountain coming down\" near her home. \nA woman holds her umbrella in the wind and rain in Los Angeles, February 17, 2017. REUTERS/Ringo Chiu \nThe downpours in other heavily populated areas of Southern California, including parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties also recently hit by wildfires, could create the risk of mud and debris flows there too, the weather service said. \nAuthorities have warned residents of an area west of Santa Barbara, where another wildfire ravaged vegetation last year, to prepare to leave their homes quickly if ordered to evacuate. \nRain also battered parts of Northern California and southern Oregon and the weather service had flood warnings in effect in both regions on Friday afternoon. \nIn higher areas of eastern California and western Nevada, as much as 2 feet (60 cm) of snow could cause whiteouts, forecasters said. \nSouthwest Airlines said it had canceled more than 250 flights in California, as the storm caused disruptions. \nAirports in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other parts of California had dozens of canceled or delayed flights, according to tracking website FlightAware.com. \n(Additional reporting Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Mary Milliken) Read the original article on Reuters .
