He also blamed the outcome of the June 2016 referendum on his own Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. \nSpeaking in the City of London for Open Britain on Friday morning, the former Labour prime minister said his “mission” is to urge Remain voters to “rise up” against the referendum outcome, as he claimed people voted “without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit.” Sorry to keep banging on about this, but @YouGov just sent this over - literally every segment of the population dislikes Tony Blair pic.twitter.com/HWcF3dUqqm — Robert Colvile (@rcolvile) 17 February 2017 \n“Our challenge is to expose, relentlessly, what that cost is. \n“To show how this decision was based on imperfect knowledge, which will now become informed knowledge.

The policy is now 'Brexit at any cost,’ ” he said. \nThe former PM’s comments have put him at odds with serving Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who last week told his MPs to back the government’s bill to trigger Article 50, paving the way for Brexit negotiations. \nThe Labour Party is split on the issue, after Corbyn imposed a three-line whip on fellow MPs to assure the bill’s smooth process.

It’s complete nonsense,” Duncan Smith said. \n“I suppose he learnt this disregard for democracy over the last few years from the friends he was advising in Kazakhstan.” \nMay has criticized those trying to deny the “will of the people.” \nShe is also striving to reassure France that the UK will not cherry-pick the best elements of EU membership. \nThe French senate said the UK should not be better off outside the EU once the Brexit deal is finalized. \nThe senate’s 51-page document claims UK industries should be denied special access to the single market and that national parliaments in the EU should be given the chance to vote on a final deal for Britain’s divorce from the bloc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:26:04.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
