The government has involved multiple agencies with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) playing a key role. \n\nA senior CBDT official said the I-T department has gathered information on shell companies which made huge deposits in the twomonth period post-demonetisation when companies and individuals were allowed to deposit scrapped notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 in banks. \n\nThe I-T department also gathered a wealth of information on these “dormant“ companies. These firms had managed to remain under the radar till now by not filing annual returns with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). \n\nThe government has involved all major revenue intelligence agencies in the exercise, besides the Security and Exchange Board of India, the RBI, the Intelligence Bureau and the corporate affairs ministry , the official said. \n\nThe CBDT is believed to have impressed upon the government that once these 6-7 lakh dormant firms are de registered, it could bring an end to “institutional money laundering“ in the country .Shell companies have no actual business operation or assets. They are merely used by “entry operators“ to launder money on behalf of clients. \n\nThe CBDT has prepared an integrated databank of suspected shell companies and entry operators and is in the process of matching recent banking transactions with other suspect “dormant“ companies. \n\nThe data also includes information gathered from property registration, suspicious transaction reports shared by the Financial Intelligence Unit and foreign bank accounts. This data was further identified against PAN and registered address of suspected entities.
