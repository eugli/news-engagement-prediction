Magic Johnson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2:22 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 2:22 p.m. ET \nIn a shocking move Tuesday, the Lakers named Magic Johnson president of basketball operations. \nThe new job title means Johnson will play a large role in the Lakers' moves in future years. The question now becomes: Will he do a good job? \nMORE: Lakers name Magic Johnson president, fire GM Mitch Kupchak; Jim Buss out, too \nThere's no question Johnson has the passion for the position. He loves the Lakers with all his heart, sometimes to a fault . But passion doesn't equate to success, so let's take a look at some of Johnson's past opinions on players. The Bulls trio I'm impressed w/ the Chicago Bulls starting Rondo, Butler, Wade & MCW off the bench they have the 3rd best group of guards in the league... — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 31, 2016 \nHeading into this season, Johnson tweeted about how impressed he was with the Bulls' guards, giving them a pretty high grade. Now that we're halfway through the season, it's safe to say that Chicago doesn't have the third-best group of guards in the league. \nHe also has a history of praising Rondo, which would have been accurate five years ago but doesn't work as well today. The Dallas Mavericks' trade for Rajon Rondo puts them in position to be a contender in the Western Conference. — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) December 19, 2014 NBA Draft thoughts — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 27, 2011 \nKnight did come out, and ended up going eighth overall when he was selected by Detroit. He's since been traded twice, and is now averaging 11 points per game for the Suns coming off the bench. \nHe's not a bad player, but considering Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson and Kawhi Leonard came out of that draft, it's safe to say Knight wouldn't have been worth the first selection. For all of you out there questioning Jimmer Fredette of BYU, he is the real deal. #MenCare — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 20, 2011 \nThis prediction didn't exactly come to fruition either. Jimmer left the NBA after averaging 6.0 points per game. Michael Carter-Williams hype — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) February 20, 2015 \nJohnson is extremely high on Carter-Williams, as evidenced by the Bulls tweet earlier. If Carter-Williams is the next Jason Kidd, then he's sure taking his time. Kidd is likely going to be a Hall of Fame player, while MCW probably will never be a starter in this league. Coaching decisions To the @Lakers Nation: I had dinner w/Coach Mike Brown last night, he's great & very smart. You all are going to love him! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 1, 2011 Great move by Phil Jackson, James Dolan & Steve Mills, hiring Derek Fisher as the new head coach for the New York Knicks! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 10, 2014 \nLakers fans most definitely did not love Mike Brown, who was fired five games into the 2012–13 season and only 71 games into his tenure in L.A. Also, Derek Fisher's tenure with the Knicks was not a \"great move.\" He had a .294 winning percentage and eventually was fired by the franchise.
