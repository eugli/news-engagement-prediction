Trump has acknowledged that Mattis did not agree with him about the usefulness of torture as an interrogation tactic but said he would defer the matter to his defense secretary. \nMattis has also taken a dimmer view of Russia and President Vladimir Putin than Trump, saying Moscow sought to break the NATO alliance. On Sunday, Mattis distanced himself from Trump's labeling of the media as \"the enemy of the American people, \" saying he had no problems with the press. \nHis comments may provide some reassurance to the Iraqis. But the tensions come at a critical point in the war against ISIS, with two key battles in the works: the fight to take control of west Mosul, and the start of a campaign in Syria to oust ISIS from Raqqa, the capital of its self-declared caliphate. \nAl-Abadi has taken a measured approach, but the issues can roil already difficult internal politics. \nUnder the president's deadline, Mattis has just a week to send Trump a strategy to accelerate the fight and defeat ISIS. And any plan is likely to depend on U.S. and coalition troops working with and through the local forces in both countries. \n\"We're going to make certain that we've got good situational awareness of what we face as we work together and fight alongside each other,\" said Mattis, a retired Marine general wary of Iranian influence in Iraq. \nHis key goal during the visit is to speak about the military operations with political leaders and commanders on the ground, including his top commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend. \nAsked about the tensions, Mattis said he has been assured that the travel ban — it has been stalled by a legal challenge — would not affect Iraqis who have fought alongside U.S. forces. \nThe oil issue, however, may be more difficult. Trump brought it up during the campaign, and he mentioned it again late last month during a visit to the CIA.
