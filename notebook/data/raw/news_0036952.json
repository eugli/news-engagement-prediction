It has since become one of the most high-profile murders to have occurred in Malaysia. \nThe women – Indonesian Siti Aisyah and another holding a Vietnamese passport under the name of Doan Thi Huong – led a police team to the airport at about 1am yesterday to re-enact Monday’s attack on Jong-nam. \nIt is learnt that the two suspects led the police team to Level 3 of the departure hall and told police what happened. \nBoth women described their actions of wiping a type of liquid on the face a man who they claimed they did not know. \n“They claimed they left the area once it was done,” said sources, adding that the women then went to a nearby restroom to wash off the liquid. \nIt was unclear whether the women wore gloves or even used a piece of cloth to carry out the attack. \nSiti Aisyah also told police that she was offered US$100 (RM445) by a man to carry out the act, which she believed to be a prank on a man. \nThe man who paid her and three others – all foreign men – were seen on CCTV footage at the airport with Siti Aisyah and Thi Huong. \nIt is learnt that the hunt for the four men, believed to be the “brains” behind the attack on Jong-nam, is still ongoing. \nIn another development, there was nothing but blank stares from staff who worked in a hotel where Siti Aisyah was allegedly based. \nChecks by The Star showed staff there did not recognise her. \n“I can’t recognise any Siti Aisyah here, more so from Indonesia,” said a restaurant waitress who wished to remain anonymous. \nShe said there was no lounge at the hotel save for the small pool lounge, debunking a report that stated Siti Aisyah had worked at the hotel lounge there. \nStaff working at the hotel spa were also in the dark over who Siti Aisyah is. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:26:39.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
