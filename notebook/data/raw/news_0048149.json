Urban Outfitters is selling a $45 AOL T-shirt by Aaron Smith @AaronSmithCNN February 21, 2017: 2:44 PM ET Urban Outfitters is selling this America Online T-shirt for $45. That would have bought a lot of Zima. Maybe they'll sell a Zima shirt next. \nUrban Outfitters is tapping into '90s nostalgia by introducing a T-shirt with the old AOL logo -- and selling it for $45 . \nSure, AOL is still a company. But it's been a long time since anyone's seen that old triangle logo, with the full name \"America Online\" spelled out. \nThe shirt is produced for Urban Outfitters ( URBN ) by a slacker-wear company called Altru Apparel, which has a tongue-in-cheek commercial that celebrates AOL's archaic dial-up process. \nAltru specializes in companies that refuse to die. It has clothes featuring the logo of the Polaroid camera company -- which also still exists , by the way. \nThe AOL T-shirt might seem like a strange choice for millennials who were barely alive in the dial-up days. But it's less controversial than some of Urban Outfitters' past offerings , which included a Kent State sweatshirt with faux blood spatters and a drunk Jesus T-shirt honoring St. Patrick's Day.
