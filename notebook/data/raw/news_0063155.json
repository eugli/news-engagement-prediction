Within seconds he was sliding into the ring to clothesline Andrade \"Cien\" Almas, coming to the defense of Shinsuke Nakamura. The WWE Instragram account captured the exciting return: A photo posted by WWE (@wwe) The Demon suffered the original injury during his match against Seth Rollins for the Universal Championship at SummerSlam. Balor dislocated his shoulder when he was powerbombed into the barricade; however, he finished the bout and won the title. The Irish Superstar was forced to forfeit the championship the next night on Raw, and he underwent surgery soon after. Per WWE.com , Dr. Chris Robinson diagnosed Balor with a shoulder dislocation and possible labrum tear and set his recovery timetable at four to six months. During Balor's time off television, Kevin Owens became the second WWE universal champion when Triple H helped him win a Fatal 4-Way match that also involved Rollins, Roman Reigns and Big Cass. While Balor was out of sight and out of mind to some degree, he made it clear that he intended to return and make a significant impact in 2017: A photo posted by Finn Bálor (@finnbalor) Formerly known as Prince Devitt during his successful stint in Japan, Balor took WWE by storm when he signed and joined NXT in 2014. Before long, Balor was the unquestioned face of the brand and defeated Owens for the NXT Championship. Among the biggest reasons for Balor's rapid rise in popularity was his Demon character, which featured him painting his body prior to big matches and taking on a more aggressive personality than he normally would. Balor had big-time Superstar written all over him, and he finally got his chance to shine on the main roster when he was selected by Raw as part of the brand-split draft over the summer. The veteran was immediately pushed to the top of the card and even scored a rare, clean victory over Roman Reigns on Raw in order to establish himself as Rollins' opponent for the Universal Championship at SummerSlam. Although the injury derailed the considerable momentum he had built up, Balor is a can't-miss star who is now in line to become a focal point of WWE programming once again. The 35-year-old stands to make WWE a ton of money due to his marketability and merchandising possibilities, and that means he is never likely to stray far from the main-event scene. Now is an ideal time to get a talent of Balor's caliber back in the fold, and it should generate even more excitement among the WWE Universe with WrestleMania 33 approaching.
