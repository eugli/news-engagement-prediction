Kelly's son Prince Albert purchased the house at 3901 Henry Avenue in October of 2016, and says that he hopes to open the landmark next year. \"To give ourselves enough room, I'm saying a year but it could be less than that,\" Prince Albert told People . \"To give you an answer, 2018, possibly earlier.\"\n The Kelly family sold their townhouse in 1974, and in the years since, it fell into disrepair. \"I hadn't seen the house in a good many summers and some of it is in relatively good shape,\" Prince Albert said . \"The previous owner hadn't touched some parts in 40 years. Other parts need great work... I can still see the living room carpet. It's not there anymore but I remember the pattern. And the kitchen where we all had breakfast every morning. \"\nGetty", "external_links": ["http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/03/480x720/hbz-best-oscars-dresses-1955-grace-kelly.jpg", "http://people.com/royals/grace-kellys-philadelphia-home-to-reopen-to-public/", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/03/1600x2400/hbz-best-oscars-dresses-1955-grace-kelly.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/03/640x960/hbz-best-oscars-dresses-1955-grace-kelly.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/03/768x1152/hbz-best-oscars-dresses-1955-grace-kelly.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/05/980x490/1485983253-1485888816-1467148360-1467044775-landscape-1466546237-grace-kelly-home.jpg", "http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/a8374/prince-albert-grace-kelly-home/"], "published": "2017-02-02T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:45:35.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
