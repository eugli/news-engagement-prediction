Getty Images By Susana Morris Updated February 07, 2016 . \n“The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.” \nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie \n\nNigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has risen to prominence with her award-winning writing and her captivating speeches. Her works, such as Purple Hibiscus , Half of a Yellow Sun , and Americanah , have garnered critical acclaim and an enthusiastic following. \nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born in 1977, in Nigeria, the fifth of six children to Igbo parents. Adichie grew up in the college town of Nsukka as her parents, Grace Ifeoma and James Nwoye Adichie, worked at the University of Nigeria as a registrar and a statistics professor, respectively. After secondary school, Adichie left Nigeria for the United States, graduating from Eastern Connecticut State University in 2001 with her bachelor’s degree, and then getting an MFA from Johns Hopkins in 2003 and masters in African studies from Yale in 2008. \nAdichie published her first novel, Purple Hibiscus in 2003, to large critical acclaim. Her subsequent works, Half of a Yellow Sun (which was adapted as a feature film in 2014), The Thing Around Your Neck , and Americanah have received similar fanfare. \nBesides her acclaimed fiction, Adichie is becoming as well known for her speeches, which address subjects from the art of writing, to the politics of race, gender, and feminism, and more. Part of this interest in Adichie is undoubtedly connected to pop superstar Beyoncé’s sampling of Adichie’s speech “We Should All Be Feminists” for her hit single “***Flawless” in 2013. In addition to quoting Adichie’s definiton of “feminism,” “***Flawless” includes Adichie’s challenge to sexism: \n“We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, you can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you would threaten the man. Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important. Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support, but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men. We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.” \nWhile this quote succinctly captures the insidiousness of gender stereotypes, it is far from Adichie’s only brilliant turn of phrase. Check out her other thoughts on a range of issues— \n\nOn sexism and patriarchy: \n“I often use ‘emasculation’ in quotes in my writing, to imply that I am questioning the word itself. The correct word to use is dehumanization. But a man is not even dehumanized solely because a woman does something better than he does, unless he views his humanity as the conglomeration of patriarchal norms, not a real humanity of complexity and nuance. That’s the issue. Any patriarchal norm deviated from is viewed as a threat to their existence versus them realizing that the real threat to their existence is making it predicated upon a list of limiting and rigid norms. When men state that women can’t do X, they often are also stating that they must do X. They imprison themselves via patriarchy as well. The only reason why it impacts women much worse is because men still have male privilege, can enforce misogyny with greater power and sexism benefits them.” \n\nAdiche on cultural stereotypes : \n“I recently spoke at a university where a student told me it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had recently read a novel called American Psycho, and that it was a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.” \n\nOn stereotypes of Africa : \n“If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.” — \n\nOn the “ universality ” of writing: \n\"Have you wondered why reviewers and blurb-writers are quick to reassure readers that a book about Africa (usually one written by a Black African about Black Africans) is NOT JUST AN AFRICAN BOOK BUT IS UNIVERSAL, as well? As if 'African' and 'Universal' are mutually exclusive. Nobody ever informs the reader that a great English or American novel is universal because the assumption, of course, is that it is.\" \n\nDo yourself a favor and pick up one of Adichie’s beautiful books and listen to her brilliant talks.
