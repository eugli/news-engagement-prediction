With the right tools, collaboration makes life much easier for you and your team to keep assignments and timelines organized so nothing falls through the cracks. \nIn this post, I'll outline three tools that can help your social media team produce their best work in the most efficient way. 1. Manage Your Postings with CoSchedule \n​When it comes to social media, timing is everything. CoSchedule is a perfect tool for social and content marketing teams to make sure that all material is being created and released on time. \nThe interface of the platform is calendar-based and sends alerts to notify you about upcoming deadlines and content that needs to be posted, as and when you’ve scheduled them. It enables you to create actionable boards with outlined campaigns, including pinpointed deadlines down to the hour. \nYou can also assign tasks to team members with status bars to keep an eye on how much progress your team is making. \nOn the calendar, you can simply click, drag, and drop tasks from one day to the next. \nWhen changing the date of the task, the calendar will automatically update the publish date for your content to ensure your posts are released as scheduled. You can also change release dates manually as needed. \nOne of CoSchedule’s best features is the Social Queue . Primarily designed for users to stay consistent with their blogging and social posts, this function makes it simple to promote multiple pieces of content across various social media platforms, resulting in a steady drip of traffic to your website. \nThis interface lets you set up a social timeline for your messages so that you can visualize which ones will be sent at a pre-determined frequency to the audience beyond when it is originally published. \nThese messages can be integrated with all of your social networks to make sure your campaigns are consistent. \nEven more, you can use the 'Best Times' scheduling feature to ensure your posts go live at optimal times. \nCoSchedule is the perfect tool to keep your social media team in tune, and to help distribute your content across all major social media channels. 2. Organize Team Workflow with WorkZone \nAs your company and departments begin to grow, it'll become more and more of a necessity to have a well-equipped project management process. Social media managers who know their stuff will tell you that a social post scheduling tool is not enough to manage workflows or campaigns – you need an out and out task scheduling and document sharing system for that. \nEnter WorkZone . \nWorkZone has been around for over 15 years, and is more function-rich than your Basecamp or Trello. It's used by universities and telco enterprises to overcome internal roadblocks. \nWorkZone knows that collaborating with teams involves a shared vision, as well as an in-depth understanding of everyone’s role in a certain project. This interface is made up of a features that bridge the gap between effective problem solving and simplicity. \nIt all starts at the projects dashboard. \nOn this platform, you can create tasks and have a clear-defined overview of every project and where they stand across departments. \nNext, you can get more in-depth and create actionable to-do lists that clearly lay out each team member’s work day. As tasks get completed, the project plans are updated automatically. \nPerhaps one of the best functions that WorkZone offers is the precise workload reports. The platform adds up the planned amount of work hours per project and divides them by person or group within a specified time frame. From here, you can easily identify how resources need to be properly allocated in order to balance the workload appropriately. \nOnce the reports are finalized, they can be saved as a PDF or excel sheet. 3. Measure Your ROI with Hootsuite \nNo social media campaign can function properly if the team's not equipped with an intuitive tool that tracks analytics. \nHootsuite is the go-to resource for a complete overview of the social media metrics that matter most to your brand. \nThe interface prides itself on being easy to understand for the everyday user, with visual explanations that convey the most pertinent information. \nUsing Hootsuite, you can design custom boards capable of capturing an unlimited amount of real-time reports on all of your social media activity.
