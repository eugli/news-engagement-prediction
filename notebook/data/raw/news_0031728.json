And Bannon had this to say about the press’ treatment of the White House and vice versa: \n“The opposition party is completely focused on trying to destroy Trump and his administration,” Bannon told me. “It’s not going to happen.” \nWhen asked if he had any interest in repairing the relationship, Bannon replied: “I could care less.” \nHe added that the press was “ashamed and humiliated” after the election and praised Spicer for going out every day to take questions from “hostile” reporters. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:09:35.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
