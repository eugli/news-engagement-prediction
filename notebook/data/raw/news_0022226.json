(AAP: Dave Hunt) \n\"First and foremost it's just pure disappointment,\" Cowan said of being axed. \n\"I think for some guys it can be a relief because the spotlight of international cricket is very bright and very harsh and if you're not playing well then sometimes you're actually relieved that you can be taken back from that. \n\"Then it's a question of time healing the wound and really wanting deep inside to get better and reclaim that place. \n\"That whole process doesn't happen overnight. It can take a season, four weeks, sometimes two seasons.\" \nCowan said the hard-hitting Maddinson was in \"good spirits\" and backed the left-hander to reclaim his place in the Test side. \n\"He'll come back stronger when he chooses to really flick that switch of desire wanting to play and we'll support him through that,\" he said. \n\"He's 25 years old. His best years are well and truly ahead of him. ... [He's a] prodigious talent and that time will come.\" \nAustralia play India in a four-Test series starting February 23. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:42:50.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
