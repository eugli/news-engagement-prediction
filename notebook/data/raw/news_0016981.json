Jeremy Wilkinson \nRepairs make up a lot of the day-to-day business at E-fish'n-c. \n\"I approached a few naval architects and they just kept giving me designs for the same old hulls. \n\"You can sail any boat on flat seas, I wanted something that will perform when it's horrible out there.\" \nIt wasn't until he saw a design on Trademe for a plumb bowed - racing styled - boat that he struck gold. Jeremy Wilkinson \nAl Noblet welds a corroded outboard engine. \n\"It's all to do with the plumb bow, which gives the boat a smoother entry, and you get 40 per cent less lift out of it,\" he said. Ad Feedback \n\"Instead of punching over a wave you kind of part it slightly. It basically slices through the water.\" \nThe pilot model - which Northcott uses as his personal vessel - lives at his workshop on Port View Rd in New Plymouth, but he uses it as a showboat for potential customers. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nGarry Northcott shows off the pride and joy of his fleet E-fish'n-c (left). \n\"It's worked pretty well, any skeptical buyers I'll just take them out on a rough day and let them feel how smooth it is,\" he said. \n\"As soon as they get out there in the chop and realise they're not lurching about they come and snap them up. \nHis sales strategy seems to be working with E-fish'n-c Boats building five of the plumb-bowed designs since 2015 with another two on the way. Innovision Boats/Facebook \nE-Fish'n-C was taken through its trials in New Plymouth at the weekend. \nBut at $180,000 to $200,000 for a custom build it's not everyone's cup of tea and it can be hard competing with the big names in boat-building. \n\"They've got the branding and they've got Matt Watson driving them around,\" Northcott said. \n\"But at the end of the day it's a different product for a slightly different market. \n\"Though it is still just recreational fishermen who are buying them.\" \nIt's not just building boats from the ground up Northcott specialises in, he said repairs have become a backbone for his business. \n\"It's a lot of modifications as well, fitting live tanks, bait boards and winches, that sort of thing,\" he said. \nBut it's a design Northcott invented for his own boat that he's installing more than anything else. \n\"It's my pride and joy really, it's a bait board that has water flowing over it. When you're filleting your fish it stays clean. \n\"I get a lot of requests for those because the in-built ones are usually crap.\" \nAlthough business is starting to pick up and Northcott is getting busier he still finds time to fish at least once a week. \nHowever, he's got only goal for the near future: \"Build more boats\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:34:42.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
