It will be held at Gulshan at 8pm on Tuesday. The secretary general will give the official reaction to the new EC after the meeting.\" \nThe BNP took part in the president's talks on forming the new EC and proposed names to the search committee later. \nIt has one of its choices - former additional commissioner writer Mahbub Talukder - in the new EC. \nAnother of the names it proposed – Prof Tofail Ahmed – was on the search committee’s shortlist of 10 but the president struck him off. \nNew CEC Huda, a Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JaSoD) pick, was kept an officer on special duty (OSD) for a long time during the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami tenure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:30:30.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
