Currently, the Samsung Galaxy S7 , Galaxy S7 Edge, and the LG V20 are all reduced down to just $360 full price, or $15 a month if you prefer to add them to your current T-Mobile bill. \nIf you don’t currently have a T-Mobile plan a T-Mobile starter SIM will be added to your bill at checkout so the grand total will come to $380. I don’t think there’s any way to order the phone without a SIM unless you’re already a T-Mobile customer, so that’s kind of a bummer for those looking to pick up a phone on the cheap without a SIM. \nStill, this is one of the best deals we’ve seen on these handsets as new devices are slated to be revealed next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:52.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
