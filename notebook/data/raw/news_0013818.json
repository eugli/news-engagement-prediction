(Photo: Getty images) More People of all ages get very emotional about the American Girl line of dolls. Very emotional. Just look at the screaming kids and parents in the hundreds of thousands of unboxing and haul videos on YouTube. The dolls portray a variety of eight- to eleven-year-old girls and are sold with accompanying books told from the viewpoint of the girls. What’s not to like about that? Apparently, the answer is sewn on underpants. The line has made a change to some of their dolls, specifically the BeForever characters Julie, Melody, and Maryellen and all of the Truly Me doll series. And that change is that their underwear can no longer be removed. Fans of the line have taken their complaints to the American Girl Facebook page, deluging the brand’s posts with some very heated comments. American Girl has responded with a Facebook post of their own, addressing the controversial underwear update, writing, “We take our customer comments very seriously, as well as any changes to our dolls. We would never change our dolls without careful consideration, and we want to address feedback received about the new underwear design.” The post also included a side-by-side comparison of the old underwear, the new underwear, and a doll wearing a bathing suit over her underwear, presumably an attempt to assuage fears that having underwear under a bathing suit would create a bulky look. And the majority of the doll’s fans seemed to appreciate the response, and are staying loyal to American Girl, sewn on underwear or not. We’ve reached out to the doll manufacturer for comment and will update this story when we hear back.
