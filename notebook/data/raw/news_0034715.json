The only blip in the franchise’s diversity record has been with American-born Venezuelan Juan Pablo Galavis. \nThere were other moments when it seemed as if the calls for change had been heard. Former ABC Entertainment chief Paul Lee, who had made improving diversity a priority during his years at the network, had suggested the franchise was in for a shift last year. But that change never arrived. \nNew ABC entertainment President Channing Dungey, the first African American woman to run a broadcast entertainment division, told reporters over the summer at the Television Critics Assn. press tour that the problem was finding more diverse candidates at the onset, given that leads are often picked from the previous cycle of “The Bachelor” or “The Bachelorette.” \n“We need to increase the pool of diverse candidates in the beginning,” Dungey said. “That is something we really want to put some effort and energy toward.” \nTo date, Viall’s season, which premiered last month, features the most diverse roundup of contestants — with 22 white and eight nonwhite female contestants at the start of the cycle. It’s an improvement compared to the previous season of “The Bachelor,” with Ben Higgins, which had five nonwhite contestants. Meanwhile, 2015’s “Bachelor” season featured just one nonwhite contestant.
