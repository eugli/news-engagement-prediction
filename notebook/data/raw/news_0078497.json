If you swallow your tongue you start to choke, the flow of air into the brain stops, so you have to act as fast as possible,\" said Bohemians spokesman Tomas Mutinsky.\n\"If Martin is in a stable condition today, it is largely thanks to Francis,\" he told AFP.\n- 'Endless seconds' -\n\"I would like to thank Francis Kone for his prompt help that saved my life. Once again, THANK YOU,\" Berkovec wrote on Facebook.\nThe keeper is set to meet his saviour soon.\n\"He has invited me for dinner,\" said Kone.\nOne Bohemians fan tweeted his thanks to Kone after the goalless draw: \"He taught me something today, and not only me.\"\nAnother fan who was in the stands on Saturday told Bohemians' club website how Kone's quick thinking had impacted on the club's hard core fans.\n\"Two guys were sitting next to me. Racists. Their language was...(racist), monkey stuff,\" he said.\n\"And then comes the shock. Endless seconds. Martin falls and doesn't move. Kone is the first to arrive. He pulls the keeper's tongue out. A rival. A black guy.\"\n\"The entire stadium is silent, including the two guys. I don't give a damn about the score. Martin will be OK, Francis Kone helped him. A rival? A black? A man!\"\nBorn in Bondoukou in the northeast of Ivory Coast, Kone has taken advantage of his mother's nationality to play for Togo since 2013.\nAt 26, he has had a varied career, having played for several clubs in Thailand (Muangthong United FC, PTT Rayong), Oman (Al-Musannah), Portugal (Olhanense) and Hungary (Honved Budapest) before joining Slovacko in 2015.\n\"This is the fourth time it has happened to me -- (I've experienced this) once in Thailand and twice in Africa,\" said Kone.\n\"No, I don't have medical education,\" he chuckles.\n\"In this type of situation, I always make sure whether the player has not swallowed his tongue.\"", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fROkIuVFEg1OuondvWLCEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAwO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/fdc68fd6ad707cdf6a6ad8616344d4502a14fd40.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-28T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:55:42.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
