Kansas basketball: Why these Jayhawks are different, and how it will affect their season Joe Boozell | NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nKansas stormed back to defeat West Virginia in one of the most entertaining games of the season Monday night, and it did so playing how it has all year: small. Smaller, in fact, than the Jayhawks ever have in the Bill Self era. MARCH MADNESS ON SOCIAL MEDIA JOIN THE TEAM. Follow @marchmadness Several teams around the country are downsizing by choice. Plodding, back-to-the-basket power forwards are on the verge of extinction. A bigger wing there with some defensive versatility immediately becomes harder to guard.\nVillanova cut down the nets playing an extremely modern style last year; a stretch-four who attempts seven 3s a game, Kris Jenkins, sunk the buzzer-beating game-winner. North Carolina, that Jenkins miss away from the 2016 title, plays big, dominating foes on the offensive glass. \nOn a scale of Villanova to North Carolina, Kansas has been about as close to the latter as you can get during Self’s tenure. When you recruit like the Jayhawks do, you can prioritize size and find outside shooting. Kansas has used two traditional bigs for years, yet it still generally has length on the wings. The formula has worked wonders. The Jayhawks are aiming for their 13th straight Big 12 championship. \nRELATED: Morning Madness daily brief \nThe Jayhawks have turned to small-ball this season by necessity. Freshman center Udoka Azubuike, who showed promise early, is out for the year with a wrist injury. Carlton Bragg, who was supposed to fill the Perry Ellis void, has been ineffective. Landen Lucas has been solid, but he’s just one guy. The Jayhawks’ other big men are mostly untested. So Self did what any great coach does. He adapts. \nThat means Josh Jackson, Kansas’ 6-foot-8 uber-athletic freshman, becomes a pseudo power forward. \nOutside of his explosiveness, Jackson’s top attribute is his court vision. He could wind up being a point forward at the next level. The situation in Lawrence, though, calls for the opposite. The Jayhawks need Jackson to play bigger and rebound. He has collected 10 or more rebounds in five of his last six games, excelling in exploiting mismatches against bigger foes. \nJackson showcased his versatility against Kentucky's Derek Willis a few weeks ago. Willis is a stretchy power forward in his own right, but he isn’t in Jackson’s athletic stratosphere. Against a spread-out offense, Kentucky had no answer for Jackson’s straight-line drives. Jackson put up 20 and 10 against the Wildcats. \nCoaches are getting smarter about hiding their weakest defender on Kansas’ other starting forward, Svi Mykhailiuk . But he’s no offensive slouch either. \nAgain, all of this is new for Kansas. During the Self era, these are the primary frontcourts he’s trotted out, almost all of them traditional in size and style of play: Kansas front lines ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:26:54.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
