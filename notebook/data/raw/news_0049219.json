(Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  21 AM \nWASHINGTON — President Trump visited the National   & Culture Tuesday morning, touring the new Smithsonian museum for the first time after a few rough moments with black politicians in recent weeks. \nTrump was joined by Ben Carson, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing & Urban Development, who is featured in an exhibit in the museum. Also in the group were Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the Senate's only black Republican, as well as White House staffer and former \"Apprentice\" contestant Omarosa Manigault, and Trump's daughter Ivanka. The group was led on a tour by museum director Lonnie Bunch. \nThe visit comes as Black History Month nears its completion — and just days after Trump caused a kerfuffle when, during a press conference, he claimed a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus had canceled a meeting on him without any evidence and asked a black reporter, April Ryan, to set up the meeting. That congressman, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), later forcefully denied that he'd canceled the meeting and said that he'd been trying unsuccessfully to set one up with the Trump White House. \nTrump also addressed another sensitive topic he's sidestepped in recent weeks, denouncing anti-Semitism in brief remarks. \n  \n\"Antisemitism is horrible. And, it's gonna stop and it has to stop,\" he said, promising to visit the Holocaust Museum soon. \n\"Today and every day of my presidency I pledge to do everything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and every American. So important. This tour was a very meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\" he said later during prepared remarks. Donald Trump in the White House \nTrump had so far refused to denounce the rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes since his election, while pushing back at the idea by pointing out that he has Jewish family members including his daughter. \nNotably, Trump didn't invite any leaders from prominent African American advocacy groups like the NAACP, the second time he hasn't included leaders of major black organizations who have been critical of him during events focused on African American issues. Attendees to Trump's Feb. 1 event marking Black History Month at the White House were mostly friendly pastors and the White House's black staff members. \nTrump was criticized at that meeting for a seeming lack of familiarity with black history, with his comments that \"Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more\" drawing widespread ridicule. \nAsked about the museum during the tour, Trump said it was \"fantastic\" — and that he was excited to see Carson's exhibit.
