Could   \nWhen a footballer retires they don't automatically surrender all their talent, skill and natural ability - as the above video shows. \nThe clip is a compilation of nine retired stars who played the game at the very highest level, and well, apparently still can! \nThe video includes the likes of Mauricio Pochettino hitting a crossbar, just because he wants to, and Ryan Giggs showcasing his vision during a game of futsal. \nAlso included is Rivaldo scoring free-kicks for fun, and not to be outdone, Diego Maradona whips in a few set-pieces too. Enjoy! Paul Scholes Paul Scholes dominates a charity football match (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nRepresenting Chadderton Park Legends in a fund-raising match against a Greater Manchester Police XI, Scholes pulls all the strings from the middle of the park. \nPicking passes and controlling the tempo, he barely gets out of second gear and of course, finishes one particular move in style. \nAfter rounding the keeper with ease, he sends a defender sprawling to the ground with a single look, and finds the back of the net through a sea of legs. Diego Maradona Diego Maradona has not lost it (Photo: Reuters) \nA man who needs no introduction whatsoever recently went to visit the Deportivo Riestra players, in Argentina's third tier, on the training ground. \nIn the above video, he wastes absolutely no time showing the first team how to take the perfect free-kick - and we mean, perfect. \nHe later takes it one step further - we know, it's already too much - and proves he is still more than capable of putting his money where his mouth is by bending one in. Mauricio Pochettino Mauricio Pochettino can hit a crossbar on command (Photo: Ian Walton / Getty) \nThe talented Tottenham boss, who is enjoying a brilliant season in the Premier League, hasn't lost any of his own technical ability since making the move to management. \nYou want proof? Well in the above video Pochettino stands in front of goal alongside some of his Tottenham team and does a few kick-ups. \nHe then put his foot through the ball and smashes the crossbar with it... what challenge? Rivaldo How to take the perfect free-kick with Rivaldo (Photo: FC Barcelona/Youtube) \nAgain, another footballing legend who needs no introduction. \nThe Barcelona hero returned to his former club recently to speak to the B team and show them how to take the ultimate free-kick. \nDespite being 44, Rivaldo sets a ball up behind a wall and bends it over the top of it, just because he can. \nHe later does it again to prove it certainly wasn't a fluke, as the keeper collects yet another ball from the back of his net. Ryan Giggs An Old Trafford master (Photo: Srdjan Stevanovic) \nGiggs proved he was the same old Giggs when he took part in an Indian Futsal League competition recently. \nThe five-a-side tournament featured Scholes, Ronaldinho, Hernan Crespo and a host of other superstars, so was always going to be good, but Giggs' backheel assist takes the biscuit. \nThe audacious piece of skill is magical, and exactly what you'd expect from the Old Trafford legend, despite the fact he was 42 years old at the time. Gheorghe Hagi Gheorghe Hagi shows Viitorul how it's done (Photo: Allsport) \nThe Romanian football legend helped his nation reach the quarter finals of the World Cup back in 1994. \nHe is now at the helm of Liga I club Viitorul, where he apparently blows his team away in training on a regular basis, as the above clip shows. \nTaking part in a recent session, Hagi - at the age of 51 - hits a cross on the volley and simply embarrasses his keeper with a stunning goal. Zinedine Zidane Zinedine Zidane proves you never lose your touch (Photo: AFP) \nThe current Real Madrid boss and perpetual Real Madrid legend. \nThe Galactico was on the Ciudad training ground with his squad not too long ago when he decided to lump the ball into the sky. \nHe then followed its path to the ground and brought it under control with the most delicate little touch you will ever see in your life. \nThe best bit about it is he doesn't appear to be aware of a camera being on him. Ronaldinho Ronaldinho makes football look easy \nArguably there has never been anyone on the planet with better footwork than the Brazilian. \nSo it should come as no surprise that he hasn't lost his touch, even if he is 36 years old. \nThat said, seeing him score five goals in an Indian Futsal League competition - chipping the keeper with one of them - is pretty ridiculous. Ronaldo Ronaldo bags himself a hat-trick (Photo: Valerio Pennicino / Getty) \nLast but by no means least, the original Ronaldo. \nAnother Galactico on the list, the Brazilian rolled back the years to fire a hat-trick in the 12th annual Match Against Poverty in Saint-Etienne, which you can see in the above video. \nDespite being the age of 38 - at the time - and playing on a full-size pitch, Ronaldo appeared every bit as impressive as he did when he was playing for Los Blancos in his hey day.
