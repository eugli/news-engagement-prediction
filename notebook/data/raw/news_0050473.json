And it was only yesterday, Presidents' Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing. When President Trump responds to Antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that's when we'll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment.\" \nIn a tweet, the center wrote: \".@POTUS @realDonaldTrump do not make us Jews settle for crumbs of condescension. What are you going to do about #Antsemitism in @WhiteHouse.\" \nTrump's comments came after Jewish community centers across the country were hit with bomb threats, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The organization said in a news release that this was the fourth \"series of such threats\" this year. They also followed the news that more than 170 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in Missouri had been found toppled. \nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Tuesday reported that the vandalism occurred over the weekend and was under investigation. \nThe Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect has its headquarters in New York and an office in Los Angeles, according its website. It has previously been critical of Trump. \nThe Trump administration in January was criticized for not mentioning Jews in a statement issued on International Holocaust Remembrance Day . Trump remembered \"the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust\" but did not specifically mention Jewish people in the brief statement. \n\"I don't regret the words,\" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, when he was asked to defend the statement during a \"Meet the Press\" appearance. \nPriebus added: \"Everyone's suffering [in] the Holocaust including obviously all of the Jewish people affected and miserable genocide that occurs - it's something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad.\" \nTrump on Feb. 15 was asked about what he was going to do to about the increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. since his campaign and Election Day victory. He responded by talking about his electoral college win. And at a news conference Thursday, he was asked about the increase in anti-Semitism. \n\"Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life,\" Trump said. \"Number two, racism, the least racist person.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:30:02.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
