SHARE A Q&A audience member Fred Thorpe takes on George Brandis. Photo: ABC \nThe format is too predictable to the point of being banal. Instead of including guests discussing matters they are interested in and have unique perspectives on, the composition of the panel begins with at least two political representatives. They are clearly charged with a solemn duty – to uphold, at all costs and in the face of any evidence to the contrary, their party line. \nOther panellists are chosen to provide the maximum amount of heat and the minimum amount of light. On Monday night, Julian Burnside and Piers Akerman could hardly be expected to have an illuminating discussion. Nor Jacqui Lambie and Yassmin Abdel-Magied. SHARE Attorney-General George Brandis on the ABC's Q&A on Monday night. Photo: ABC \nAnd week after week Q&A falls into the trap of setting up a person (invariably a right-wing politician, conservative columnist or shock jock) to be ridiculed for their opinions. It's little more than a Punch and Judy show (for Millennials, I mean it's like Itchy and Scratchy). \nSo on Monday night Brandis faced a question from audience member Fred Thorpe, a victim of Centrelink's debt recovery regime that has quite rightly been exposed as being in many cases both heartless and hopelessly wrong. Advertisement \nCue derisive laughter from the audience as Brandis starts to squirm uncomfortably in his chair and suggest she call her local Centrelink office to sort out the problem. But it's a completely confected but ultimately meaningless and highly unsatisfying moment of television. \nAfter all, it's not an issue that falls under Brandis' portfolio. And even if he were the Minister for Social Security how could he be expected to be responsible for the day-to-day minutiae of how government policies are implemented? \nOn face value there could be nothing more democratic than a voter confronting our elected representatives face-to-face and putting a human face on the decisions made in the cabinet room or ministerial office. \nBut Q&A doesn't give us that. What it gives us week after week is \"gotcha\" moments designed to merely extract a conservative politician's embarrassment and little more. And so what appears like a free-wheeling town hall-style confrontation is, in fact, highly scripted. \nIt's easy for Q&A to poke fun at conservative panel members week after week, but they are doing it merely for the smug satisfaction and mild amusement of the ABC audience. What would be much harder is finding long-term solutions to the difficult problems that face Australia today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:43:47.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
