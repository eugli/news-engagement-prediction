Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenage yob has been spared jail but banned from the Metrolink network after a US Army veteran was racially abused on a tram in Manchester city centre. \nAaron Cauchi, 19, is the last of three young louts to be sentenced after university lecturer Juan Jasso was told to ‘get back to Africa’ just days after the Brexit vote in June last year. \nJuan Jasso, who has lived in this country for 18 years, became an unlikely internet sensation when video footage of him standing up to their shameful abuse emerged. \nEarlier this month Robert Molloy, 20, was jailed for 24 weeks after admitting a racially aggravated assault on Jasso.

The teenager admitted two public order offences and assault. He pleaded guilty on a basis that he said only ‘get off the tram’ to Mr Jasso, approached Mr Lambert in an ‘aggressive manner’ and ran towards Mr Guest.

He said he said nothing to either Mr Lambert or Mr Guest. Mr Smith said Cauchi, who has just become a father, was not responsible for flicking the lighter at Mr Lambert or spitting at Mr Guest. \nHe was jailed for 16 weeks, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 300 hours of community service. Cauchi must also pay court costs of £400 and compensation to the victims. \nChairman of the bench, Michael Evans, called the three incidents on June 28 an ‘alcohol-fuelled rampage across the city of Manchester causing fear and distress to others, including children.” \nCauchi also received a criminal behaviour order for two years, which bans him from travelling on Metrolink services across Greater Manchester and associating with the other two defendants. Juan Jasso, who has lived in this country for 18 years, became an unlikely internet sensation when video footage of him standing up to their shameful abuse emerged.
