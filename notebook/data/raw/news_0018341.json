My best judgment, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years, is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend.” While it remains unclear whether the uptick is just a blip or the start of an enduring trend, several criminal law specialists said there was a need for greater federal efforts in several areas and suggested that the directives might foreshadow more substantial policy changes. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, pointed to a line in the “purpose” section of the cartel order that states that trafficking by cartels “has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse.” He pointed to rising drug overdose death rates — especially from heroin, much of which is smuggled across the Mexican border. “A focus on drug trafficking is important and could make a difference,” Mr. Wexler said. Regarding whether anything else in the three orders struck him as significant, he said, “To be honest with you, nothing jumped out at me.” Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at Columbia University, was less impressed by Mr. Trump’s cartel order, noting that “the targeting of international criminal organizations has always been a high priority, and I supposed he is suggesting that priority will continue.” \n  Still, he said, the signal sent by Mr. Trump’s order on reducing crime, which talks in vague terms about providing support to state and local law enforcement, could be “a little more serious” given the crime increases in several cities. During the Obama administration, he said, the United States attorney in Maryland, Rod Rosenstein, whom Mr. Trump has now nominated to be deputy attorney general, embedded federal agents in homicide units in Baltimore. It is possible that practice could be expanded by the Trump administration to cities like Chicago, he said, although the order itself “doesn’t say anything about that.” At the White House press briefing later on Thursday, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the orders showed that the Trump administration supported the police and was focused on public safety. “Over the last eight years, we’ve experienced declining focus on law and order,” Mr. Spicer said. “Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for this White House.” \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter . \nFollow Charlie Savage on Twitter @charlie_savage .
