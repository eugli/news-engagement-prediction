Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA new 'smart bracelet' has been developed which allows men to experience the sensation of a baby kicking. \nThey might never know what it is like to be pregnant - but it's claimed they will at least now feel their unborn baby move. \nThe bracelet transmits a baby's womb movements through the wearer's wrist - while the mother wears a kick monitor patch which connects to it wirelessly. \nIt then uses rotating small beads inside it to mimic the child's movement - with a signal sent in 'real time' so when the mother is feeling something the father feels it too. \nThe makers say the idea is that men do not feel 'left out' during pregnancy.

The bracelet could help men share the experience of pregnancy (stock image) (Photo: Getty Images) \nA spokeswoman for First Bond wearables said: \"While the mother gets the first-hand feeling of the little one growing in her belly, the dad can feel a bit left out. \n\"The mama is wearing a kick monitor patch-a technology produced by another startup-which detects the baby's actions.\" \nShe added that when the baby moves it sends a signal to the bracelet, which is slim and metallic. \nIf the child moves to the right the rotating beads do the same. Similarly, if the child moves downwards the beads go to the base of the wristband. \nShe added: \"The sharing happens instantly so the person wearing the wristband will feel the movement in real-time. \n\"We're focusing on shared experiences and the shared economy. \n\"By making Fibo, a device the parents rent during the pregnancy, an up-to-date technology and high-quality product can be guaranteed.\" Read More 'Mystic Mandy' who lost her arms to thalidomide claims she can talk to dead relatives with her FEET \nFirst Bond Wearables showed off their products at the Polar Bear Pitching competition in Oulu, Finland, Newsweek reported. \nNo launch date has currently been set but it is hoped a market-ready device will be ready at some point next year. The bracelet could be released this year (stock image) (Photo: Getty) \nThe bracelet comes after the emergence of a number of other gadgets designed to make men understand what it is like to go through a pregnancy. \nThey include the Moonbump, a fake pregnancy belly that straps onto your front and mimics the 33lbs of weight that heavily pregnant women carry around. \nNappy maker Huggies developed a similar technology to the bracelet in 2013 with a pregnancy belt that allows fathers to feel their baby's movements as they happen, however it was never brought to market.
