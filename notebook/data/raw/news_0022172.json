We must protect our citizens,” said Musa. \nHe said the directive to bar Selva Kumar will be enforced by the state Immigration Department with immediate effect. \nBoth Sabah and Sarawak have immigration powers that allow them to prevent any person from entering. \nSelva Kumar was found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women in the late 1980s and early 1990s while posing as a modelling agent, movie producer or professional dancer. \nSome Malaysians took to cyberspace to express their fear and disgust of him. \nFacebook user Angeline Dominic commented that despite being 57 years old, Selva Kumar could still pose a risk to the public. \n“(After) 24 years ... don’t know what he (would) imagine and plan. \n“You can never know what is in one man’s mind until he reacts,” she said, adding that taking precautions would be better than regretting later. \nNancy Tang agreed that the public has the right to know his location so that they would be able to take precautions. \nJenifer Ng took the authorities to task: “We can’t and won’t leave him alone because our safety is at stake. \n“You are being reactive not proactive. You are waiting for something bad to happen before reacting.” \nUma David also expressed her concerns, saying that “there is no protection given nor preemptive measures taken against paedophiles, rapists and the such. \n“There are numerous groups set up via Facebook, Telegram for and by these sickos! It is downright scary”. \nUma urged the authorities to set up a sexual offenders registry that was accessible by the public. \nAldri Fariz wrote on Facebook that it would be better for Selva Kumar to wear an electronic anklet or something similar so that his movements could be monitored. \nAlthough some Facebook users said Selva Kumar deserves to live a normal life after serving 24 years in prison, netizen Alexander Wong felt otherwise. \n“What I believe is that he committed his crimes repeatedly, things average you and I would not do. \n“Second chance? Justice served? The damage to his victims are for life!” he said. \nDeputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Noor Rashid Ibrahim had said that police could not make Selva Kumar wear a tracking device and that he was now entitled to live as a free man after serving his sentence. \nA close family friend was quoted by local portal FMT as saying that Selva Kumar has repented. \nSpeaking anonymously, the source said: “According to his family, he has repented and promised not to commit such crimes again.” \nThe friend also described the reports about the 57-year-old having victimised as many as 1,000 women in Canada as “illogical”. \nThe source said Selva, a former student of Penang Free School, came from a rich family and was sent to study in Canada about 30 years ago because his family found him to be “a handful”. \nSelva Kumar went there as a student in 1980 and his visa was extended after he was sponsored by a spouse. He reportedly married a Canadian woman but it ended in divorce. \nRelated story: \nConvicted serial rapist gives newsmen the slip at KLIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:05:04.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
