Only one with a humble upbringing would be able to pull off the MB’s bold action. \nThe Malaysian Consumers Movement (MCM) believes that leaders must occasionally move away from their own cosy operating environment and include themselves in such activities which will not only help bring them closer to the people, but also improve their own understanding on the daily challenges of a common man. Experiences gained will help them develop people responsive policies. \nIt is indeed sad that many, including seasoned politicians, chose to mock the MB, branding his noble act as a cheap publicity stunt. It is easy to laugh at the expense of an individual who was daring enough to helm the role of a council worker, understanding and appreciating the hard work of those who keep our cities clean. Great leadership demands ingenuity in actions and thoughts, going beyond the conventional practices to make a real difference. \nLet’s quit taking things for granted or laughing at those, especially in leadership positions, who are seeing matters from a long-term perspective. In a nutshell, in the MB’s case, it is more than just being a city council worker. \nFor those who have mocked the MB, here is an urging for you to come out and do the same. \nDARSHAN SINGH DHILLON is president, Malaysia Consumers Movement (MCM). \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:54:26.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
