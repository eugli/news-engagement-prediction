Beyoncé was scheduled to perform at this year’s annual Coachella music festival alongside fellow headliners Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar, but owing to her pregnancy (with twins!) that was colorfully announced on Instagram earlier this month, she will be unable to perform as planned. In a statement to the Associated Press, Beyoncé’s Parkwood Entertainment and festival producer Goldenvoice said the singer had to pull out of the festival “following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months.” To make up for her withdrawal, she will headline Coachella’s 2018 festival instead; her headliner replacement, though, has yet to be announced.
