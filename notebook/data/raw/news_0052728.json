Holy crap people are stupid. 'Walking Dead’ Shirt Pulled From Stores After Complaint of Racism https://t.co/cpeIqcxTwJ \n— Jeffrey Dean Morgan (@JDMorgan) February 22, 2017 \nSo much so that he took to Twitter to make his feelings known – telling his followers: ‘Holy crap people are stupid’ complete with a news article about the ban from The Wrap. \nWe can safely say he’s not a fan of that decision then – while his fans have also shown their support for his comments, retweeting the statement almost 5,000 times. \nThe offending T-shirt shows a pic of Lucille alongside the words ‘Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe’– the line used by Negan before killing Glen and Abraham at the start of season seven, to decide who his first victim should be. The offending shirt was pulled from shelves in the wake of a customer complaint (Picture: Ross Parry) \nThe shirt attracted complaints from Sheffield couple Ian and Gwen Lucraft after Mr Lucraft, a Methodist minister, pointed out that one version of the rhyme went on to say ‘catch a n***er’ by his toe’ (although the phrase ‘catch a tiger by his toe’ was used in the show). \n‘We were shocked when we came face to face with a new T’shirt with a racially explicit graphic and text,’ he said. \n‘It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:12:21.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
