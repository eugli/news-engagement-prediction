Best moment of the @Anthony_Mundine @dannygreenboxer weigh-in. Watch your hat Tony! #MundineGreen2 pic.twitter.com/UfF4qaqkpE — Jai Bednall (@jaibednall) February 2, 2017 \nThe Green Machine (35-5) scraped in on weight at 82.9kg before running his own applause-o-metre with the crowd. \nMundine (47-7), looking lean but strong, checked in at 79.6kg. Despite his rivalry with Green, Mundine said his legacy wasn’t on the line tomorrow. \n“Definitely not. My legacy is unsurpassable at the moment. I’ve done what I’ve done in the sport. I’ve broken records. I’ve done stuff in boxing that’s never been done,” Mundine said. \n“And I’m going to try to do that again, with what I’m attempting with Danny, jumping up in weight. I feel good, I feel strong and I’m ready.” \nThe fighters then engaged in a far longer-than-usual face-off, jawing at each other as the crowd lapped it up. You can see the staredown from 8:35 in the video below. \nToday’s results, while valid, were for show, with the pair to officially weigh at 5pm. The bout itself will be anything but, with both boxers having plenty to prove. \nMundine — the former WBC Silver super-welterweight titleholder — defeated Green in 2006 by unanimous points decision. \nBut the 41-year-old hasn’t stepped inside the ring since losing to American fighter Charles Hatley in late 2015. \nGreen, on the other hand, has form. The Perth-based brawler, 43, beat Kane Watts by decision in August. \nThe undercard starts at 6.30pm tomorrow, with the main event expect to start between 9.30pm and 10pm. \n— with The Advertiser’s Ben Harvy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:35:23.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
