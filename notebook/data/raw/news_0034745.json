U.S. Press Secretary Sean Spicer mixed up our PM’s name today–we hear what Canadians are saying about the flub, tonight at 6. pic.twitter.com/CQCosioY9o — CTV Vancouver (@CTVVancouver) February 15, 2017 \nSpicer’s stumble occurred right before questions erupted regarding the resignation of Michael Flynn , Trump’s national security adviser, who confessed to withholding details of meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak from Vice President Mike Pence , “and others.” \nPeople took to Twitter to entertain the flub. I remember Joe Trudeau. We were in grade school together.
