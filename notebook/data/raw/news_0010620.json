He is being treated at the Jindal Naturecure Institute on Tumkur road, off Peenya in north-west Bengaluru. \n\nDr Babina Nandakumar, chief medical officer said a few blood tests will be done on Wednesday. \"I think he had a hectic schedule during the election campaign due to which he could not practise Yoga and other exercises. This led to high levels of sugar in blood in the past few days. He will be given hydropathy and mud therapy . He will be treated for 15 days here,\" she said. \n\nKejriwal had first visited the naturopathy centre in Bengaluru in 2015 after the Delhi elections, complaining of diabetes and chronic cough. He was given a 10-day treatment mainly detoxification of the body through mud pack, eye pack, enema, steam, some massages and acupuncture. He visited the hospital in January 2016 as well for a health check. \n\nAAP convener in Bengaluru, Prithvi Reddy, who accompanied the Delhi CM on Tuesday from airport to the institute said, \"After his throat surgery in Narayana Hrudalaya in September last year, he was advised rest. But he could not take rest and work pressure and electioneering had a huge impact on his health. He is here for treatment and rest.\" \n\nDoctors at Jindal Naturecure are expected to give out a health bulletin of Arvind Kejriwal starting Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:41:53.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
