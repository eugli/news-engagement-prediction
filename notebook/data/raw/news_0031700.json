Photo: Andrew Meares \nIt adds up to what the lawyers claim is a crime against humanity – a \"widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population in furtherance of a state policy designed to deter immigration to Australia\". \nThe submission alleges physical and sexual abuse, including rape, is rife at the camps, with \"inadequate, overcrowded, unsanitary and dangerous\" conditions – allegations consistently denied by the Australian officials and the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \nLawyers have also taken aim at private contractors that run the camps on behalf of the Australian government, stating: \"Companies contracted to operate these centres, namely Ferrovial, Wilson Security, and [International Health and Medical Services], are aware that their conditions are punitive and harsh – they are this way by design.\" \nThe submission also alleges a failing by Australia's courts in upholding legislation, \"justifying the harsh and unlawful detention of refugees and asylum seekers\". Determining a lack of local legal remedy is crucial for the international court to have jurisdiction. \nThe submission was being promoted in Australia by the activist group GetUp. \nFairfax Media asked the government if there had been any communication with the international court relating to the submissions, only for the office of Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to respond: \"We are not going to comment on a publicity stunt, but let this be a warning to people donating to GetUp that you are being ripped off by these wacky causes.\" \nThe international court has been under strain in recent months, facing threats of withdrawal by Russia, South Africa and the Philippines, and criticism over slow proceedings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:10:50.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
