The power comes from the two working together,” he said. “Dyson is focusing on developing intelligent technology and making products which know and anticipate what you want before you do. Machine learning gives our products the intelligence to understand and react to the environment.\" \nSpeaking at the launch, Trade and Industry (Industry) Minister S Iswaran said Singapore will continue to work with industry partners to support innovation and internationalisation. \n\"These efforts will better position our enterprises to seize opportunities in growth sectors such as advanced manufacturing and the digital economy, as well as create good job opportunities for our people,” said Mr Iswaran. \nDyson, which currently employs 1,100 people in Singapore, said it plans to grow its Singapore-based engineering team by 50 per cent. It is seeking talent across a broad range of engineering disciplines, including connectivity, motors, sensors, robotics and software. The new centre will create an additional 190 jobs over the next five years. - CNA/xk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:28:07.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
