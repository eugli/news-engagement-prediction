His citizenship came to light last week. \nThiel, worth a reported NZ$3.7b, did not meet the usual requirements to become a citizen as had not lived in New Zealand and did not plan to. DAVID UNWIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nIain Lees-Galloway says Thiel has not delivered on his promises to help NZ. \nHowever, the Minister of Internal Affairs at the time Nathan Guy granted his citizenship using an \"exceptional circumstances\" public interest clause in the law, based on advice from his officials that cited Thiel's investments in New Zealand and philanthropic activities. \nREAD MORE: Peter Thiel Release 1 February 2017 by stuffnewsroom on Scribd \nThiel indicated to the government that he would set up a tech incubator in Auckland and a landing pad for Kiwi tech companies in San Francisco. It is yet to be seen whether these projects eventuated. \n\"I am yet to see any evidence that New Zealand has gained from this arrangement. It's very clear what Mr Thiel has gained as a citizen - he's been able to purchase a very large piece of South Island real estate,\" Lees-Galloway said. \n\"What did New Zealand get out of this? Nothing as far as I can tell.\" \nThiel's citizenship came to light after an NZME journalist queried whether the Overseas Investment Office had scrutinised his purchase of a $13.5m lifestyle block in Wanaka. This would be a requirement for foreign residents, but the office said they had not - as Thiel was a citizen. \nQuestions to Peter Thiel about his citizenship have been passed on by his lawyers but he is yet to comment publicly. \n\"It seems he has set himself up an insurance policy should things become unstable in America.\" \nGuy could not be reached for comment but earlier this week said New Zealanders should be proud to have someone like Thiel as a citizen. \n\"Mr Thiel is a fantastic ambassador and salesperson for New Zealand, he's well connected in America and regardless of whether he's a supporter of the Trump administration or not he has done a lot for New Zealand.\" \nHe was backed by Prime Minister Bill English, who said \"a little bit of flexibility\" is useful when it comes to citizenship laws. \nAsked whether a Labour government would have granted Thiel citizenship if their officials had recommended it, Lees-Galloway said he did not want to get into hypotheticals, but the whole process was flawed. \n\"I think the decision making process we have is flawed and needs to be rectifed,\" he said. \n\"Where there is money involved this becomes very dangerous.\" - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:04:24.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
