The NGO slammed Trump’s “poisonous” election campaign and called the US vote one of the seismic political events of the past year. \n“ Donald Trump’s poisonous campaign rhetoric exemplifies a global trend towards angrier and more divisive politics ,” the annual report on human rights from Amnesty International said .

One of his first pieces of legislation was the controversial ‘Muslim ban’ which temporarily suspended the entry of travelers from seven mainly-Muslim nations. The ban prompted mass protests in America and worldwide, and was eventually blocked by US courts. \nHowever, despite demonstrations, a recent Harvard-Harris poll, exclusive to the Hill, found strong support for overhauling immigration laws, with 77 percent backing comprehensive immigration reform against 23 percent who oppose reform. Now Trump wants to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively and speed up deportations. Rise of populism \nIn general, the world in 2016 became “a darker and more unstable place” partially due to “the rise of hate speech across large parts of Europe and the USA,” Amnesty writes.

But the reality is that we begin 2017 in a deeply unstable world full of trepidation and uncertainty about the future.” \nConcerns over the rise of populism have been increasingly loud in the West, and especially in Europe, where previously marginal parties have been gaining popularity amid economic problems and the migrant crisis. \nSome countries in Europe, such as the UK and Hungary, have built fences to protect their borders from the large influx of asylum seekers.Ahead of France’s presidential elections in April and May, numerous polls suggest that right-wing National Front party leader Marine Le Pen is among the favorites. Refugees \nAmnesty also highlighted the global refugee crisis which “assumed still greater magnitude and urgency” during 2016. Last year 36 countries sent refugees back to dangerous countries. It’s time to stand together against fear & hate. https://t.co/bsEl7zZ48Z pic.twitter.com/KWzI8zLKAG — AmnestyInternational (@amnesty) February 22, 2017 \nThe report says that while world leaders “failed to rise to the challenge,” 75,000 refugees remained trapped between Syria and Jordan. \n“The lack of solidarity with refugees and fellow EU member states was typical of the migration policies of most EU countries, which united in their plans to restrict entry and expedite return. This became apparent in the failure of the EU’s flagship relocation scheme.” State of the World: politics of demonization and lack of global human rights leadership. https://t.co/375ut9xsYg pic.twitter.com/fPe1UEalUl ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:57:51.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
