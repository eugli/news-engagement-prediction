Dr. Foldvary sites everything from a comfortable room temperature to the right mattress and pillow as being important to meaningful rest. “You may have to deal with anything that could be disrupting your sleep, like a spouse who snores or a pet that like to climb into bed,” she says. So fiddle with the thermostat or close the door on your pooch. It might be the answer. \nHead The Stress Off Early \nDr. Foldvary also indicated some preliminary measures you could take to achieve better sleep. For one, you might take steps to deal with the stressful issue early in the day, before you even begin your nighttime routine. Talk things out with your significant other over dinner, call up a friend or family member, or, as some of Dr. Foldvary’s patients do, keep a worry journal to vent in. “This helps put away your anxieties before bed,” she says. \nIf You Keep Waking Up, Don’t Stay In Bed \nThat isn’t to say you should head out to the living room and keep up your latest Netflix binge. Dr. Foldvary recommends if you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep, find something boring to do. “Don’t turn on the TV. Don’t read a book that will be a page-turner. Maybe read a slow section of the newspaper, or iron some clothes. When you start to feel sleepy again, go back to bed,” she says.
