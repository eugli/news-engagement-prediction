Doctors can make recommendations, too.\nThe company also offers many brands of the Pill, two emergency contraception options, NuvaRing, and the Xulane patch, as well as PrEP for preventing AIDS in men and women. Currently, it is only available in New York, California, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, and D.C.\nCustomers can order their drugs with or insurance— but either way, through February 28, new subscribers can access the credit.\nScore! For the entire month of February, the promo code AlterativeFacts will get users $45 in credits that can be put toward non-insurance-covered costs\nWho likes free pregnancy prevention? A press release announced the promotion and the company's opposition to Trump's planned dismantling of the Affordable Care Act\n'Women should not have to jump through unnecessary hoops just to access birth control,' Nurx's Medical Director, Dr. Jessica Knox, said in a press release.\nThe company aims to make birth control more accessible, and its promotion also protests of Donald Trump's promise to make it less so by rolling back the Affordable Care Act, which requires health plans to cover at least one form of the 18 FDA-approved contraceptives.\nMany Americans agree with this provision of Obamacare, with a study by the Journal of American Medical Association putting the approval number at 69 per cent. About 55 million women now get their contraception for free because of the law, according to the National Women’s Law Center.\nPresident Trump, however, signed an executive order for the 'prompt repeal' of Obamacare.\nOptions: They carry a variety of brands of The Pill as well as the morning after pill, NuvaRing, and the patch\n'Donald Trump's first executive order reaffirmed that he is intent on repealing the Affordable Care Act. We hope that in doing so he ensures that women would retain access to free birth control and other preventative services. Anything less would be reckless,' said Nurx co-founder and CEO Hans Gangeskar.\nThe promo code, of course, takes its name from the phrase coined by Kellyanne Conway to explain Sean Spicer's incorrect claims about the size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration.\nThe phrase has been widely lampooned as a euphemism for 'lies'. An ad for Nurx also plays on this, calling the sentence 'Babies come from storks' and alternative fact to drive home the importance of using birth control.", "external_links": ["https://app.nurx.co/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-04T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:42:47.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
