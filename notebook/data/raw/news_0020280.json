The livestream's most disturbing moments were punctuated by late night visits from people in masks and white supremacists relaying neo-Nazi slogans via the livestream. One heated encounter with a man who said \"Hitler did nothing wrong\" led to LaBeouf's arrest , and quickly made him a target for harassment online in secret neo-Nazi forums . \nLaBeouf launched the project in collaboration with artists Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner on Inauguration Day, with plans to continue the livestream throughout President Trump's time in office. \nAs of this morning, the livestream has been turned off. The HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US website has been updated to read: On February 10, 2017, the Museum of the Moving Image abandoned the project. The artists, however, have not.
