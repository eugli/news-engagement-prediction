Gigi La Moore \nHow is that disgusting? No different from when I used to bring my kid to work to help out. whodunit? \nThat’s awesome. Love how shs very much different from.the normal Hollywood star. Keep doing you. Ignore the haters. Mike Gallett \nNow I know why they divorced..Brad wouldn’t eat no bugs..he’s all about them steaks… lurker \nBut your lame ass is here,so much for being irritated lurker \nLove you but I don’t think I can do bugs loff \nLOL Where is your loyalty, don’t let a bug get in the way Multipass \nBeautiful kids, Vivienne is such a mini-Brad. loff \nYet you were teh first one to post on her thread , stay pressed. busted \nIf things continue to go the way they are; we are all going to be eating bugs. I don’t know if I could; depends on how they are cooked. But I have been trying a lot of new things and trying to open my mind. busted \nI love seeing the kids.. and them doing well. And finally hearing their voices.. but at the same time; I think we maybe seeing too much of them. I hope we don’t see too much of them after this. It will be good to see them with their Dad at some point. Maybe they will during Spring Break in a month or so. But goodness how cute. I guess Viv is not afraid of bugs. I wouldn’t have thought she would’nt be the one to pick it up. Shiloh as we suspected is fearless. Wonder how Zee feels about Bugs. Passing Through \nWRONG! Brad was once asked what’s the strangest thing he’d eaten – and he said he and Angie eat bugs when their in Cambodia. busted \nYeah he eats them too. I actually think he is even more diverse in his taste than she is. We have seen him on more eating events than her. toastie postie \nLoved the video. But no bugs for me. Yuck!!! But if I was starving or my kids, who knows what I would do when I saw a bug running by. They are going to outlast us on this world anyway. William Bradley & The Jolie \nI think once this is over they will go underground again. \nAnd I think they both know that the paps are on the hunt for those first shots of Brad with any of the kids. So, they will be extra careful. Dawne \nOne, two, three………..Hohandler………”Now we know she’s a snake cause she eats tarantulas.” Wait for it. loff \nThe kids are so into their bug eating element , even princess Vivian is bugging it out. Dawne \nMany,. many cultures eat insects……..especially Asian. It is all what you get used to as a kid. busted \nShe said they had crickets a lot. Not sure about Knox/Viv. Angie took the older 4 for a Cambodian trip once and the twins stayed with Brad. ali7 \nLol in a few months when they go underground we will all say we miss the kids. http://www.amazon.com/Aubrey-Anderson/e/B01BHC8VMI/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1466893529&sr=8-1 Lady Valeria \nHow sad is it that you write better jokes than Handler on the fly? loff \nI just love how easily adaptable these JP kids are, looks like nothing fazes them. loff \nI just love how easily adaptable these JP kids are, looks like nothing fazes them. loff \nI just love how easily adaptable these JP kids are, looks like nothing fazes them. busted \nNo.. I was glad to not see them. No sighting no news. plez \nI thought there was a story or interview in which the older kids already attempted to try bugs. ali7 \nBREAKING: The British Parliament just rejected a state visit by Trump! Russia’s officially the only place in the world where he’s welcome! Observer2 \nIf they voted on it, does that mean the ass kisser, May, has to abide by it? Let’s hope so. toastie postie \nPlease tell me that the Queen doesn’t have to meet him. ali7 \nUnfortunately this was a debate not an actual vote they haven’t rejected officially. toastie postie \nI just don’t want the Queen to have to touch his little hands, not knowing where they have been, besides he is slime. \nBut then if he tries that Alpha handshake, maybe they will arrest him for assault. Hmm. Observer2 \nIs she the one that has to do that then? And will she even listen to Parliament? toastie postie \nDon’t know this actor/director – but I like his sentiment and words. Mark Duplass Urges Oscar Win For Barry Jenkinsâ âMoonlightâ http://deadline.com/2017/02/mark-duplass-urges-academy-to-vote-moonlight-best-picture-1201916502/ Dawne \nNo one can stop the “State visit which is the major roll out but they can prevent him from being invited to address Parliament. Observer2 \nThanks. I hope that they stop that. Dawne \nShe is not supposed to be approached by unwashed predators. Besides the stench of his New money will likely cause her to have a sudden case of the vapours. ali7 \nThe Queen can’t do anything abt this because the Primer Minister has the privilege to invite any president s/he wants to impress it is political/economic kind of things, this year UK need America more than ever after they voted brixit ali7 \nUnfortunately she has to unless she lies and say she is not feeling well that day. plez \nExactly. My grandparents ate chitterlings in their youth. They still eat them on New Years Day. Chitterlings have the worst smell ever. But it’s what was cheap back in the day. So I never question what people eat when their hungry. busted \nwell since the date hasn’t been made; the Queen could get a cold or head out of the Country. busted \nHoney’ I’m in the south..and my mom cooks them all the time. I don’t like them; never did.. but people here will kill you for some if they are cooked well. My Mom does them well I guess because people beg for them. busted \nWe are infested with HUMAN or SUBHUMAN BUGS TODAY.. toastie postie \nWhere’s the RAID? I got my handy broom. busted \nWe know what to do..so let’s just do it and keep moving on. The fans here are not new to this game. toastie postie \nYes, someone look out for the Queen.
