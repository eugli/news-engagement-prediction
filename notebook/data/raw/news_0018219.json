What will be Panneerselvam’s next step following Sasikala’s action \nIn the latest development in the Tamil Nadu politics, MLAs who are supporting Sasikala have been taken to an undisclosed location. \n\nPost Panneerselvam’s revolt against Sasikala and her desire to be the chief minister, the AIADMK party chief Sasikala’s supporters (130 MLAs) have been taken to an undisclosed location in a bid to stop them from taking Panneerselvam’s side. \n\nEarlier, Panneerselvam too had claimed that he can prove majority and will meet the governor soon. However, when his support base started getting stronger, Sasikala has initiated the step to literally ‘take’ her supporters to a ‘safe’ place, which cannot be reached by Panneerselvam or his supporters. With this development Tamil Nadu politics has taken an interesting twist. \n\nWatch: \n\nIt can be noted that the trend of taking supporters to a safe place started with Karnataka BJP leader (ex-CM) Yeddyurappa’s Operation Kamala in 2008, when many MLAs from Congress and JD(S) were taken to an undisclosed location (to a resort) and were not allowed to use their cell phones till the tension subsided in the state. \n\nYeddyurappa is known as the leader who can use cunning ways to get the work done. He is the first chief minister in India to spend time in jail. Now, by following Yeddyurappa’s path, is Sasikala trying to say by hook or crook she will be in power. With the dagger of disproportionate assets case hanging on her head, there are chances that even she might meet Yeddyurappa’s plight. \n\nNow, as Sasikala has made her intentions clear, what will be the next step of Panneerselvam? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:47:05.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
