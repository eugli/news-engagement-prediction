By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 20, 2017 4:30 PM “In 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri had asked countrymen to leave food for country, after him, only I had the courage to ask people for leaving a subsidy,” Modi said. (PTI) \nAddressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Phoolpur, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said that Allahabad High Court is tells actual work. “Akhilesh Ji, had your work spoken anything, then Allahabad High Court wouldn’t had to say anything, now the high court tells what has happened in Uttar Pradesh,” PM said. He further said that SP- Congress , Bahujan Samaj Party, and Congress’ language has changed since the time of voting. He added that alliance between SP and Congress is an outcome of “fear from defeat.” Modi further said that after Lal Bahadur Shastri, he is the only PM, who had the courage to ask countrymen to abandon a subsidy. “In 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri had asked countrymen to leave food for country, after him, only I had the courage to ask people for leaving a subsidy,” Modi said. \n“Even after 70 years of independence, our mothers and sisters had to go for defecation in open,” Modi said. “No one once thought of this big menace, only I noticed it,” he added. Urging people’s support, Modi said that BJP will succeed on every parameter within 5 years. “Give BJP an opportunity to serve Uttar Pradesh for 5 years. I promise you we will succeed in every parameter,” PM Modi said. “Modi said that BSP, SP and Congress are fighting for their existance, while BJP is fighting to change Uttar Pradesh,” Modi said. \nHailing his government’s initiatives, Modi said: “2014 ke pehle sun rahe thay Scam India, 2014 ke baad sun rahe hain Skill India.” \nWatch Complete Rally Here: \nEarlier in the day, PM Modi addressed a rally in water scarce Bundelkhand. Modi blamed SP, BSP and Congress for backwardness of the region and promised to transform it “like Kutch in Gujarat.” Mineral-rich Bundelkhand, he said, can change the “fate” of Uttar Pradesh and satellites can help keep a check on illegal mining. “SP and BSP have ignored Bundelkhand over the years and these elections are crucial for Bundelkhand…it has to decide whether it has to get rid of SP-BSP,” Modi said at an election rally in Orai region of Jalaun in Bundelkhand region. “In five years, we will transform Bundelkhand, which has not seen any development in the last 70 years…mineral-rich Bundelkhand can change the fate of Uttar Pradesh, illegal mining has to be stopped and the satellite launched by India can be used to check the clandestine activities,” Modi said. \nWatch: SP Will Form Govt In Alliance With Congress: CM Akhilesh Yadav \nThe prime minisiter promised that an autonomous development board will be set up for the region and its working will be monitored on a weekly basis. Explaining his vision for the region, Modi cited the example of Kutch district of Gujarat. “Some believe nothing can be done in Bundelkhand…it can be made No.1 in the state…there is Kutch district in Gujarat …20 years ago if any government staff was posted there, it was considered ‘kala pani’ (Andaman’s Cellular Jail),” he said.
