Her offering has five models: the Dane, Tommy, Dallas, O’Hara (named for her fiancé), and Malcolm (named for her father). “My dad had a hat he always wore when hunting. It was falling apart, but we mimicked the natural aging in the Malcolm. It has a kind of patina about it.” And as for the Everglades-invoking alligator trim on the O’Hara design? Burris laughs: “Florida is my childhood home, and the swampy rugged spirit was something that felt natural. My fiancé is also from Florida—he helped me source the skins.” Photo: Courtesy of Gigi Burris Each model will be available (in June) in five different colors (black, deep navy, putty, gray, and off-white), and each can be accented with not only gator, but also grosgrain ribbon or braided suede with turkey-feather plumage. “That part was inspired by the curled duck-tail feathers that my grandfather would tuck into his own hats as hunting trophies.” So why now, Gigi? “So many of the men in my life were asking for hats, so we felt obliged—I’ve been thinking about this for a while.” The capsule is snazzy-smart and wearable with a throwback touch, and clearly close to home for the designer. Proof, then, that she can wear plenty of hats at once.
