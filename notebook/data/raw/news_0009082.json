Before they took on real victims, the youngsters practised on ‘dummy’ targets by snatching ice-creams. By the time they landed in police net on January 30, the three accused had snatched or robbed between 250 and 300 people within an 18-month period. \nRahul, Habib and their juvenile accomplice were nabbed from Shahdara district earlier this week based on a tip-off. Police was on their trail after they had targeted a class 10 student in East Delhi’s Geeta Colony a few days ago. \nRead | Delhi snatchers also stunt bikers, made meticulous plans \nTheir earlier victims include Sharmila Rai, a 39-year-old beautician who received several injuries to her brain and has temporarily lost her power of speech while resisting their attempt to snatch her bag at Moolchand flyover on December 27, and Jairam Sahu, a geologist at ONGC who lost important data to their snatching at ITO. The bikers recently bought a high-end motorcycle.

They recently bought a high-end motorbike. \nTheir interrogation has revealed that the gang’s chief planner was the 17-year-old juvenile even though Rahul and Habib are in their mid-20s.
