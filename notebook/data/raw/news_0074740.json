He's still listed as day-to-day.\nThe Leafs could also be without Tyler Bozak against the Canadiens. The 30-year-old did not practise Friday and did not skate again on Saturday morning (undisclosed) and will be a game-time decision, according to Babcock.\nHis void would be filled by veteran centre Ben Smith, a healthy scratch the previous two games.\nThe Leafs are 2-1-1 without Marner, who was second on the team with 48 points entering play Saturday night. He suffered the injury when he fell awkwardly into the boards in a Feb. 15 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nToronto has lost 13 straight games to Montreal. After Saturday night's game, the Leafs will head to California for a three-game road trip.\n​\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-25T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:14:17.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
