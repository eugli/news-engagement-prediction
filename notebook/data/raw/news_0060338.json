Close Aussie tricksters make incredible 120m putt UP NEXT VIDEO Aussie tricksters make incredible 120m putt. Soure: Sunrise Aussie tricksters make incredible 120m putt \nThe group from Internet sensation, How Ridiculous, broke the Guinness World Record for the longest putt ever, with an astonishing effort that dropped into the cup from a staggering 120-metres away. \nWhile there's no way of really knowing for sure how long it took to achieve, two of the group's members, Brett Stanford and Derek Herron told Channel 7 it was all in a morning's work. \n\"We set out not really knowing how long it could take, but probably a couple of hours,\" Stanford said. That record-breaking feeling. Pic: Twitter \n\"There were a few that rimmed out, which was just devastating, but we’re obviously just super stoked to get one in.\" \nThe Aussie group has risen to Internet fame posting a series of videos of them making outlandish trick-shots at random locations. \nOne of their most famous successes set another Guinness World Record when they dropped a basketball from the top of a Swiss Dam into a basketball hoop 180-metres below. \nBut this latest effort has never been seen before on a golf course and quite frankly, there's probably few who would have imagined it possible. A look at the distance that confronted Stanford on the putt. Pic: Twitter \nStanding on a fairway at the Point Walter course in Perth, holding the putter like a driver above his head, Stanford sunk the unthinkable putt. \nWith just the right amount of power and accuracy, his buddies watched as it scooted all the way across the fairway, up onto the green and into the hole. \nHerron said as far as their previous challenges are concerned, this latest one may just have been the most difficult to execute. \n\"This one was definitely up there with the hardest, definitely a challenge,\" Herron said. \n\"I mean I was even good enough to have a go, I didn’t have the consistency so we left it up to Brett and he was all over it.\" \nStanford confirmed that the most difficult part of making the putt was getting the amount of power required, spot on. The lads about to drop basketballs off a dam. Pic: Twitter \n\"I think the really hard part about this when you compare it to basketball is you’ve got to hit it with just the right amount of pace,\" Stanford said. \n\"Even if it’s on the right line, if it’s not going slow enough it won’t go in and we actually had that where it was just going a little bit too fast, hit the very middle of the cup but rimmed out.\" \nWhile it might seem like a career in golf beckons for the record-setting Aussie, Stanford played down any such suggestions. \n\"I have never considered it mainly because I can’t do this on demand. If I could, I would for sure. I’d be whipping the putter out every chance I could.\" Close One-armed kid schools pro golfers UP NEXT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:55:48.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
