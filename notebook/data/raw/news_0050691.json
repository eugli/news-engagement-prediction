I do not think that either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody. Their crime was the most hideous and evil in modern times Margaret Thatcher \nT he intervention came after it was suggested during her premiership that Myra Hindley might be put up for release in 1995 and Brady in 2005. \nThe comments are contained in a note from Mrs Thatcher scrawled in blue ink which has been uncovered by Government officials. \nThe document – stamped with the Home Office’s seal – has not yet been made public but has been seen by this newspaper.

Profile | Ian Brady \nM r Brittan wrote on 25 February 1985 suggesting that that Hindley could be put up for release in 1995 and Brady in 2005. \nHowever Mrs Thatcher wrote in response: “I think the sentences you are proposed are too short. I do not think that either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody. Their crime was the most hideous and evil in modern times.” \nMrs Thatcher is understood to also comment on the proposed transfer of Brady from Gartree prison to Park Lane Hospital, a high security psychiatric hospital. \n“I hope that extra security will be put on to make doubly sure that this maniac cannot escape,” she writes. \nThe notes are understood to have been uncovered by Whitehall officials looking into a request for documents linked to the Brady case. \nReference to Mrs Thatcher’s comments is believed to have been made in emails between civil servants at a later date. \nM rs Thatcher's intervention came at a time when a debate was raging in British politics about the leniency of sentences. \nHer government was under pressure from Tory backbenchers to bring back the death penalty for murder. \nMotions bringing about the change had been debated in Parliament in 1979, 1982 and 1983 but failed to win a majority. \nPolls at the time showed that a majority of the public favored capital punishment for at least some offenses. \nIn response, Mr Brittain proposed toughen up sentencing in Britain by giving people the power to appeal if the ruling was felt to be too lenient.
