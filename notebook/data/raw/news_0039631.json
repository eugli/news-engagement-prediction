Facebook videos will play with sound automatically \nEach pregnant smoker can pocket up to £260 if they can quit smoking for their pregnancy and a further 12 weeks. \nThe vouchers, currently offered by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, are paid in instalments for every two weeks a mother-to-be goes smoke free. \nIf they complete the course, their partner or a friend will also receive £40 of the Love2Shop vouchers for offering their support. The council is offering the scheme for women in the area (Picture: Getty) \nThe scheme is part of a range of measures to attempt to cut the number of smoking-related child deaths in the city. \nSmoking has also been linked to a number of costly, complicated deliveries at nearby hospitals. \nThe women will be carbon monoxide tested to make sure they have not been smoking. Petition to have Donald Trump impeached has nearly 1,000,000 signatures \nCouncillor Ann James, cabinet member for health and social care, said: ‘This scheme – Healthier Futures Supporting a Smokefree Pregnancy – is a pilot intended to encourage pregnant women to agree a quit date and sustain it for at least 12 weeks after they have given birth. \n‘People who take part receive shopping vouchers for every week they go smoke-free, as an incentive to carry on. \n‘Studies on Voucher Based Reinforcement Therapy offer compelling evidence that positive reinforcement with shopping vouchers creates positive changes in behaviour, and we want to see if this approach can improve child health in Stoke-on-Trent.’ \nLatest figures show an estimated 55,000 adults in the city smoke, nearly one third of the population. \nWhile 19% of pregnant women smoke, compared to a national average of 12%. The pregnant woman’s partner is also offered a reward for support (Picture: Getty) \nIn a 2015 study, 306 pregnant women were given retail vouchers to encourage them to give up smoking. \nThe trial proved to be ‘highly-cost effective’. \nLinda Bauld, the study’s author, said: ‘There have been very extremely successful voucher schemes in other areas. \n‘I know incentives raise controversies, but they do provide an extra motivation.’ \nClair Brennan, a 36-year-old mother of three, said: ‘When I was pregnant it was very much ‘old school’. I was told to go with exactly what my body was telling me. \n‘Sometimes I went for weeks without smoking, but I never thought “I have to quit”. It’s very subjective – I had to stop drinking tea during one pregnancy. \n‘I don’t think this scheme is a waste of money because it’s always a great idea to educate people, especially younger parents, about the issues.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:45:48.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
