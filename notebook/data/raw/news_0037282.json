Lead singer Chad is an extremely nasal “Marlboro Man” type vocalist who sounds constipated on a permenant basis. Guitar consists mostly of easy-to-play power chords that give the band a “tough” sound to the untrained ear, but a closer look reveals a band that has nothing to offer creatively. They were recently exposed recycling their music in their two hit singles, “How You Remind Me” and “Someday”, which sound nearly identical when played simultaneously. \nOn January 7th, 2007 a video was uploaded to YouTube of Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger getting hit with an object while on stage during a show in Portugal.

Gerrymandering.” [23] \nNickelback responded to the tweet [24] with a gibe about Batman and Robin , a generally reviled film where Schwarzenegger played the notoriously pun-filled character, Mr. Freeze.
