It features clips of professional basketball players looking less-than-professional, such as shooting an air ball, making a silly turnover, or committing a costly foul. \nJaVale McGee, a center for the Golden State Warriors who is averaging 6.1 points and three rebounds this season, has made frequent appearances on the segment. This has upset McGee, who feels as though he is being unfairly targeted by Shaq. \nOn Thursday's broadcast, Shaq promised that he would refrain from picking on McGee for the foreseeable future, but later on in the show, he released a Doctor Strange parody video that included a lowlight reel of McGee's game. Brutal! \nAfter watching the segment, or hearing about it from his teammates, McGee posted a series of nasty messages directed at Shaq in the wee hours of Friday morning. Never backing down from a fight, Shaq fired back his own messages. \nYou can view their heated Twitter exchange by clicking on \"Start Slideshow.\" \nMORE: Shaq Backing Out Of His Wrestlemania Match With Big Show? / This Is What Olympian Simone Biles Standing Next To Shaq Looks Like / Shaquille O'Neal , Charles Barkley And Ernie Johnson Meet The Justice League \nFrom Marvel comes DOCTOR STRANGE, the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands.
