It'll be doable in 2018. \nLuxury line Regent has announced plans for an epic, 89-night voyage from New York to Russia and back that will include stops in the far-north Russian cities of Murmansk and Archangel. \nThe Grand Arctic Splendors voyage, as it's being called, will take place on Regent's recently renovated Seven Seas Navigator — one of the world's most luxurious cruise ships. \nThe trip will kick off June 21, 2018 with a transit up the East Coast to Canada. From there, Navigator will sail northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean to Greenland and Iceland before making nearly a dozen stops in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales. Stops in Belgium and The Netherlands also are on the schedule before the vessel enters the Baltic Sea for visits to Sweden, Finland and its first port in Russia, St. Petersburg. First look: The mind-blowing suites on Regent's new cruise ship \nAfter St. Petersburg, Navigator will make several more stops in the Baltic region before heading northward along the coast of Norway to the Arctic Circle and the White Sea. It'll then stop at Murmansk and Archangel — two of Russia's northernmost cities and destinations rarely visited by cruise ships from major lines. \nNavigator will return to New York via a more southerly route across the Atlantic that includes stops at Portugal's Madeira Island, the Azores and Bermuda. It'll arrive back in the Big Apple on Sept. 18, 2018. \nFares for the voyage start at $39,999 per person. \nIn sailing from New York to Murmansk and Archangel, Navigator will be following in the wake of the U.S.-led Arctic convoys of World War II, which delivered much-needed supplies to the Soviet Union. More than 1,000 merchant ships escorted by U.S., British and Canadian naval ships took part in the convoys. The convoys put the two ports on the map in the West. \nRegent also has revealed that Navigator will sail an epic, 131-night world cruise in early 2019 that features calls at 62 unique ports. The trip will include stops in the Hawaii Islands, French Polynesia, Australia, Asia and the Mediterranean. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
