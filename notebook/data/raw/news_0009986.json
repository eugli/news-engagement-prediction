The Bears had a chance to pull even in the conference standings with the Jayhawks, who were stunned at home on Saturday by Iowa State. \nBaylor can right the ship this week with games at Oklahoma State on Wednesday and at home vs. TCU on Saturday. \nThe Wildcats improved their record to 16-7, 5-5 in the Big 12.
