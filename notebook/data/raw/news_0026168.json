And these stunning photographs give a remarkable insight into the lives of those living in the Byker area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne between 1969 and 1981, before and during the process of the estate's demolition. Nineteenth-century terraced houses are seen in a semi-deserted and derelict state, but the people still living in the area show a resilience that was captured on camera by Finnish-born Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen. The photographer arrived in the area when it was already destined for demolition, and lived there until her own house came down. She even set up a studio in a disused hairdressing salon, offering free portraits to residents. Her engagement with the local community helped gain their trust, and Ms Konttinen has previously said: 'Being a foreigner gave me one advantage: I could be nosey, and be forgiven. 'Many doors were opened for me that would have remained closed to another photographer, and invitations extended to the kind of hospitality and intimacy that would normally be reserved for family only.' The area is known for the popular BBC children's drama Byker Grove, airing between 1989 and 2006, which was set in a youth club in the area - although filmed elsewhere - and helped to launch the career of Ant and Dec. A series of Ms Konttinen's photographs are on display at the Tate Modern in London, at Level 4 - Switch House in the 'Living Cities' section. They have been curated by Ann Coxon and Shoair Mavlian. 'Dogs Hairdressing, Shields Road': A woman wears a tabard while pouring hot water into a bucket in a stark room, next to a wet, long-haired dog, standing in a puddle of soap suds. A brush leans against the wall, ready to be used to groom the dog 'Kids with Collected Junk Near Byker Bridge': Young children pose amid discarded household furniture, TV sets and prams. This grassy setting is both a dumping ground and a makeshift play area, and in the background a railway viaduct is seen 'Kendal Street': A stretch of a street lined by terrace houses, as seen from the top of a hill. The image surveys the working class housing, with its regularity of architecture. This is broken only by the cars parked on the street and the dark figures 'Mrs Potter in Mason Street' (left): A woman stands at the corner of a street at the bend of the pavement, her hand resting on the bricks of a building // 'Jimmy Dodds, Albion Row Allotments' (right): A man presents a pigeon in his cupped hands, with his arms extended towards the camera. His head is thrown back and light is reflecting off the lenses of his glasses 'Ragman's Horse and Cart by Union Road': A stretch of wasteland where buildings have been demolished but roads remain. The horse and its cart belonged to a ragman, who would collect scraps and leftovers as well as salvage for materials RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:53:23.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
