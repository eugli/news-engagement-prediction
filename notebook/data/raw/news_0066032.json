Credit: PAUL GROVER \nI nsects that observed the success of other bees were better at learning the task than those given the \"ghost\" demonstration. \nProject leader Professor Lars Chittka, from Queen Mary, University of London's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: \"Our study puts the final nail in the coffin of the idea that small brains constrain insects to have limited behavioural flexibility and only simple learning abilities.\" \nThe bees did not simply copy exactly what they saw, but figured out their own way to get the ball to the right destination. \n\"This shows an impressive amount of cognitive flexibility, especially for an insect,\" said Dr Olli Loukola, another member of the Queen Mary team. \nDuring the tests, the bees had to roll a ball from the edge of the platform to the centre. \nInitially, \"demonstrator\" bees were trained by watching a plastic bee pushing the ball to the goal. \nThey then moved the ball in front of other bees undergoing training, who quickly learned the same trick. \nBut in later trials \"observer\" bees faced with a choice of three balls made a beeline for the one closest to the goal, rather than the one at the platform edge. \nIn yet another test they had to move a differently coloured ball to earn the reward. \nDr Loukola said: \"It may be that bumblebees, along with many other animals, have the cognitive capabilities to solve such complex tasks, but will only do so if environmental pressures are applied to necessitate such behaviours.\" \nThe research is described in the latest issue of the journal Science.
