These are the trips where I return home with armfuls of bottles and jars, mostly red. \nI just needed, almost craved, the smell of oyster sauce to warm up a kitchen turned ice-cold by a dodgy thermostat. Leafy greens, bok choy and mustard greens are regularly steamed and tossed with thick, glossy oyster sauce at home, but meat and fish rather less so. \nI tossed fat, free-range chicken thighs with crushed garlic, honey, chilli and oyster sauce and baked them on a freezing night when only something blisteringly, eye-wateringly hot would hit the spot. It wasn’t something that could bask under the label of authenticity – it was just what I needed at that moment. The chicken emerged shiny, lightly crisp and very hot. It sizzled as we ate, making our lips tingle. We put the fire out with a sour citrus salad. \nThere was a big pudding, too, the sort of baked butterscotch sponge affair, with cream, butter and sugar, that only ever comes out in the very depths of winter. Emergency cooking for the cold and hungry. Oyster sauce chicken with citrus mint salad \nCheck the chicken regularly, covering it with foil if it is browning too much. \nServes 3 \nlight soy sauce 4 tbsp honey 3 tbsp \ncoriander leaves a large handful chilli 1, medium-sized pink grapefruit 1 cashews 2 handfuls, roasted and salted \nTo make the marinade peel the garlic then crush the cloves to a paste using a pestle and mortar and a pinch of salt. Put the paste into a large mixing bowl. Peel the onion, cut it in half and chop it very finely. Combine with the garlic. \nPut the oyster and soy sauces, the honey and the chilli sauce into the mixing bowl and stir thoroughly. Push the chicken pieces into the marinade, turn them over and leave in a cool place for an hour or two. \nSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Place the chicken pieces into a nonstick roasting tin, spoon over half the marinade and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 45 minutes, basting once or twice with the remaining marinade, and regularly checking their progress. Cover the roasting tin with foil if necessary. \nTo make the salad, combine the fish sauce, caster sugar and lime juice in a small bowl. Roughly chop or tear the mint leaves and add to the bowl, together with the coriander leaves. Finely chop the chilli and add to the dressing. \nSlice the ends from the grapefruit, place it flat on the chopping board then slice away the peel and white pith a sharp kitchen knife. Remove the segments of flesh from the skin. Put the grapefruit into the dressing and leave for 10 minutes before adding the cashew nuts and serving.

And, despite the butterscotch sauce, I’d be tempted to offer cream, too. \nYou will also need a deep baking dish or pudding bowl measuring roughly 18cm x 15cm. \nServes 4-6 cranberries 50g, fresh or frozen boiling water 200ml ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:03:51.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
