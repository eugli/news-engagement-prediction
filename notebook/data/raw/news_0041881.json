It was originally run by the Torquay Tramway company which, of course, is now extinct, and then it was taken over by the local council who ran it until the late ninety nineties when it broke down.\nThen it was refurbished and handed over to the Friends of the Cliff Railway, who then became the Babbacombe Cliff Railway Community Interest Company.\"\n– Judith Ayres, Volunteer Last year the Railway carried around 120,000 passengers. Not a bad way to celebrate its 90th anniversary.\nThe reopening is on schedule and Babbacombe Cliff Railway will soon be back to doing what it does best.\nMaking life a lot easier for those on the way up.\nLast updated Sat 18 Feb 2017 Babbacombe Cliff Railway Devon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:01:07.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
