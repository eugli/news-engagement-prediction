Some of the popular names in the film business have headed out of the city just a few days before the polls in Mumbai. Piya Hingorani | Posted by Charu Thakur A + A - Bollywood \nWith the excuse of professionalism, a handful of Bollywood's A listers are missing the BMC election on Feb 21. It came as a shock when we found out that some of the popular names in the film business have headed out of the city just a few days before the polls in Mumbai. \nA host of Bollywood biggies are giving the Municipal elections on Tuesday a miss! Aamir Khan , who campaigned for voter awareness during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and has taken up various political and civic issues on his talk show Satyamev Jayate, including water conservation in Maharashtra, is not in India to cast his vote. The 51-year-old actor is abroad, prepping for his upcoming film, Thugs of Hindostan. \nBMC ELECTION 2017: Voting underway, Shiv Sena, BJP go solo for polls \nRemember back in 2015, actor Rishi Kapoor had led an agitation called by Pali Hill residents against the BMC's proposal of marking the lane outside his residence as a hawking zone! Rishi kapoor along with other fellow residents of Bandra held several silent morchas. However, when the time has come to be the catalyst for change, Rishi Kapoor is missing in action. Kapoor senior is reportedly in Hong Kong with wife Neetu Kapoor, and will return to Mumbai on Feb 22, a day after the municipal elections. A post shared by neetu Kapoor. Fightingfyt (@neetu54) on Feb 18, 2017 at 4:58pm PST \nAnupam Kher, who is vocal about anything related to politics, isn't voting this time either. The 61-year-old actor who gave the general elections in 2014 a miss, because of the his professional commitments to IIFA Awards in Florida, strangely is in Cape Town at the moment, and will not vote. \nPriyanka Chopra has often taken up civic issues. Back in 2014, PC took it upon herself to clean up a garbage-laden neighborhood in Mumbai as part of her efforts towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Clean India campaign. But as we know Chopra is in NYC shooting for the second season of her TV show Quantico, and will not vote this year. \nActor Arjun Kapoor was in the eye of storm last month when the municipal corporation demolished the unauthorised makeshift gym constructed on his building terrace in Juhu. The 31-year-old actor is currently in London and has chosen to skip the elections. \nShabana Azmi and husband Javed Akhtar are in Bangalore for an event, as confirmed to India Today by their manager, and reportedly won't return to Mumbai till Feb 24. \nSanjay Dutt , as we all know, hails from a political family. His father, legendary actor-turned-politician Sunil Dutt, was a part of Congress, and his sister Priya Dutt took on the baton from him. However, despite all the political connections, Dutt will not cast his vote, since he is shooting for his comeback film, Bhoomi in Agra. \nMeanwhile Emraan Hashmi, Ajay Devgn are currently in Jodhpur shooting for Milan Luthria's Badshaho. Actor Irrfan Khan is in Rishikesh and Hrithik Roshan has jetted out to a health spa in an undisclosed location abroad and will not be present to exercise his right to vote. \nInterestingly, the celebrities who cannot vote are Alia Bhatt who holds a British passport and Akshay Kumar who is a Canadian national. Since, India doesn't allow dual citizenship, Imran Khan, a US citizen, Katrina Kaif , and Sunny Leone , are not permitted to vote either. Last September, Kapil Sharma locked horns with the BMC after he lashed out at the civic body for being corrupt. While we could not find his name in the voter's list, Sharma's staff confirmed to India Today, that the comedian will be in Punjab during the elections. \nIn December 2016, Salman Khan had been appointed the brand ambassador of BMC's drive against open defecation in Mumbai. Earlier, Salman had shown his support to the Clean India Drive, so it'll be interesting to see if the actor does make the effort to cast his vote or not.
