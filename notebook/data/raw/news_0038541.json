We’re not there yet, but it could happen in a couple of years.” \nWatch all our videos from Express Technology \nEssentially the team would be working towards an animal where the characteristics of a Mammoth will programmed into an Asian elephant. The team is relying gene-editing, and the project began in 2015. According to the report, “mammoth DNA has been spliced into the elephant genome from 15 to 45,” and this is being done via a gene-editing tool called Crispr. \nThe animal is being referred to as the “mammophant”, and while the hybrid embryo might be ready in the next two years, an actual living creature that has traits of both Mammoths and elephants will take many years. \nAccording to the report, mammophant will feature smaller years, shaggy hair which is typical of a Mammoth, and “cold-adapted blood.” Mammoths roamed the earth during the Pleistocene epoch, which started from nearly 1.8 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago. \nThe reason scientists have chosen to splice the Mammoth gene with the Asian elephant is because the latter is the closest relative of the extinct mammal. However, the gene-splicing project has also raised some ethical concerns, with other scientists questioning about whether the hybrid will in fact be accepted by other elephants, if one is successfully created. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:32:37.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
