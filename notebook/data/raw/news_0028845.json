On Saturday night, the former couple shared a sweet embrace when they attended the pre-2017 BAFTAs Nespresso Nominees' Party in London. While the La La Land star's face is hidden in the picture, the Hacksaw Ridge actor just couldn't hide his big smile as he leaned in for a hug. Of course, this isn't the first time the two have made us swoon this award season . They also had a cute interaction when they attended the annual AFI Awards luncheon . Seeing that they're up for best actor and best actress , we really hope we'll get another reunion at the Oscars.
