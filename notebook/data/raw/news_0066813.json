By the time Eirianna leaves, she'll have been there for over 140 days. She can now feed via bottle and looks just like any other healthy newborn. 'Oh, it's great. I mean, she looks so good. She looks like she never was a little tiny preemie,' Beckie Deir, a nurse in the NICU, told WLS. While pregnant, Entitan had developed pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage in other organs, often the kidneys, so she knew she would have to deliver early An average stay in the NICU at Mount Sinai is 21 days. By the time Eirianna leaves, she'll have been there for over 140 days As Entitan prepares to take her daughter home, she said she looked back on her daughter's survival after such an early delivery as 'a gift'. 'It feels like a miracle, like a blessing,' she said. 'I'm just grateful that we're both here. It's been a long haul.' New data recently revealed that fewer premature babies are dying in the US. A study of 4,500 babies between 2000 and 2011 showed a small, but significant, drop in fatalities for babies born between 23 and 37 weeks gestation. Entitan said of her daughter's survival after early delivery: 'It feels like a miracle, like a blessing. I'm just grateful that we're both here. It's been a long haul' There was also a decrease in the number of premature infants with neurodevelopmental problems later on in life. Researchers credit more widespread prescriptions of steroids to women during risky pregnancies to help the fetus grow faster. A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born before 37 weeks are considered preterm. The real improvements were seen in children born at 23 weeks and 24 weeks. The impairment-free rates went from seven percent to 13 percent in the 23-week group and from 28 percent to 32 percent in the 24-week group.
