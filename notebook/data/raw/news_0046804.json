On another was a sneak preview of \"Fist Fight\" starring Ice Cube and Charlie Day and directed by Highland Park High School alum Richie Keen, Class of '92. \n\"Fist Fight\" opened on Feb. 17 and made more than $12 million during its opening weekend, according to industry figures. \n\"When you run into someone from Highland Park, you smile,\" Keen recently said in a phone interview. \"You have a shared history. It's a very unique place. A lot of people tell me, 'I grew up in a place like Highland Park,' and my answer is, 'No, you didn't.'\" \nWhat makes the town unique, he said, is the community's commitment to the arts. The high school play was just as important as the football game, Keen said. \n\"Programs like Focus on the Arts and (the student-created production) Stunts, are unique opportunities,\" Keen said. \"I so wish there were more public schools like that.\" \nThe school where \"Fist Fight\" is set is the opposite of Highland Park High School. It is bedeviled by decimated budgets and teacher cut-backs. At the fictional school, two still-committed teachers are the focus of Keen's latest movie. The mild-mannered Mr. Campbell is played by Charlie Day and the volcanic-tempered Mr. Strickland is Ice Cube. \nOn the last day of school already troubled by job reviews and senior pranks, Campbell runs afoul of Strickland, who challenges him to the eponymous brouhaha to be held in the school parking lot. \n\"Fist Fight\" is just the latest major project for Keen, a prolific television director best known for his work on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" which co-stars Day. Since moving to Los Angeles in 1996, Keen has been a stand-up comedian, an actor (in what he calls a graveyard of dimly-remembered sitcoms) and a successful acting coach.

(Warner Brothers photo) \nBut it was at Highland Park High School, he said, that he received encouragement that he needed to pursue a career in the arts. Theatre department icons Scott Shallenbarger and Tim Conway were important to him, Keen said. \n\"They were wonderful people who have affected more lives than they will ever really know,\" Keen said. \"Scott was the first person to tell me he thought I could be a professional actor. Conway (who passed away in 2015) said he could see me being a producer. It never occurred to me to be on the other side of camera.\" \nKeen was the head writer of Stunts in his junior and senior years. \n\"That was transformative for me,\" he said. \"It changed the course of my life having the opportunity to create something from start to finish and to act in those productions.\" \nKeen also remarked on the importance of Focus on the Arts. \n\"(It) showed a lot of us that the arts was something you do for a living, whether it be as an actor, director, novelist, or ice sculptor,\" he said. \nKeen describes his first day on the \"Fist Fight\" set directing his first feature film as a moment of destiny. \n\"It was something I had been dreaming about (and working toward) and there I was with Ice Cube and Charlie Day and all these amazing talents,\" he said. \"Then I had this sense of calm, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do and it was up to me to just go do it.\" \nKeen describes \"Fist Fight\" as part R-rated John Hughes comedy, part \"Animal House\" and part \"Three O'clock High.\" But at its heart, he said, is an appreciation for teachers that was instilled by his parents and by his favorite teachers at the high school. His mother, Gerry, was Highland Park High School's Theatre Arts prop director for 20 years. \n\"I have a deep affection for the public school system and the teachers I grew up with,\" he said. \"It was important to me when I got the job that I made sure Charlie's and Ice Cube's characters were teachers who cared.\" \nKeen has several projects in the works, including a show in development about a marijuana dispensary that will star Kathy Bates and a film with Mark Wahlberg at New Line Cinema. \n\"You never know if you're making something unless you're on the set and saying, 'Action,\" he joked. \nWork commitments will keep him from attending this year's Focus on the Arts, but he still feels his roots in Highland Park. \n\"I always feel like I'm home,\" he said. \"I try to come back once a season. I miss the seasons (in California).\" \nDonald Liebenson is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:44:40.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
