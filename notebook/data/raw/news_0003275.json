As one owner reportedly put it, \"We need more bodies on the table.\"\nTo get those bodies, the Dallas doctor-owned hospital allegedly paid doctors and others kickbacks in the form of millions of dollars as well as Mavericks tickets, custom-made cowboy boots, cuff links and custom Bobbleheads made in their image.\nProsecutors revealed those details in court paperwork for two more defendants who have admitted their role in the alleged conspiracy. Three of the 21 charged have now agreed to plead guilty in exchange for probation, giving prosecutors a growing list of probable witnesses for the upcoming trial.\nOne of the indicted physicians, meanwhile, was allowed out of jail on a $15 million bond and other conditions despite earlier fleeing to Panama after learning about his looming arrest.\nForest Park Medical's former owners are accused of paying about $40 million in bribes and kickbacks to physicians and others in exchange for patient referrals. The bribes were made in the form of marketing fees as well as advertising costs, court records show. Some of the physicians agreed to perform their surgeries at the now-bankrupt hospital in return for advertising for their medical practices that Forest Park Medical paid for, documents say.\nAndrea Kay Smith, 37, of Rockwall, agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to one count of concealing a felony in exchange for five years' probation and a $27,855 fine, court records show.\nSmith admitted to owning a shell company that was used to funnel bribe and kickback payments to surgeons. She also tracked patient referrals to Forest Park Medical.\n'Bodies on the table' Her involvement in kickback schemes predated Forest Park Medical, prosecutors said.\nSmith met Alan Beauchamp, a co-defendant and one of Forest Park Medical's founders, in mid-2006 when she was a referral coordinator for Vista Hospital, an aging former psychiatric hospital in Garland. Beauchamp ran a company that managed the hospital and handled payments to surgeons, according to plea documents.\nMost surgeons brought their patients to Vista in exchange for \"marketing\" payments, the documents said. Smith saw a correlation between marketing payments to surgeons and the money they earned for the hospital with their patients, records show.\nVista Hospital closed a few years ago.\nSome of the surgeons who received kickback payments from Vista would later become involved in a similar scheme at Forest Park Medical, according to prosecutors.\nSmith was involved in Forest Park Medical's bribery plot when the Dallas hospital was being formed, her plea documents said. Marketing payments to doctors were \"based on the number of surgeries the surgeon could steer to or perform at\" Forest Park Medical, records say.\nIsrael Ortiz, 49, of Dallas, agreed on Jan. 26 to plead guilty to conspiracy to pay and receive health care bribes and kickbacks. He owned a business that received more than $1 million in bribes and kickbacks for referring about 2,300 patients to Forest Park Medical, according to his plea documents. Ortiz's company handled paperwork to preauthorize workers' compensation patients for surgery.\nAlan Beauchamp Ortiz admitted in his plea that Beauchamp gave him a list of surgeons to whom he could refer patients. If they needed surgery, the patients would be sent to Forest Park Medical. Ortiz was paid $60,000 each month to refer as many patients as possible to Forest Park Medical surgeons, records show.\n\"It was clear to Ortiz that Beauchamp cared only about the number of patients that he referred to FPMC,\" the plea documents said.\nIf Ortiz didn't make enough referrals, Beauchamp would yell at him, saying he needed more \"bodies on the table,\" records show.\nBeauchamp has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer could not be reached for comment.\nOrtiz's and Smith's guilty pleas do not become official until a federal judge approves them.\nKelly Wade Loter, 48, of Dallas, pleaded guilty on Jan. 26 to one count of concealing a felony in exchange for five years' probation. Loter admitting to owning an advertising company that helped arrange the bribes.\nFleeing arrest One of the physicians indicted in the case, Dr. Gerald Foox, is free on bail despite an escape attempt.\nFoox was the only defendant who was being detained. He received about half a million dollars in bribes in the form of rent payments, prosecutors say. It was made to look like Foox was being paid to rent out his orthopedic clinic to other doctors so they could see patients there. But the government says he was actually paid to refer his workers' compensation patients to Forest Park Medical.\nSurgeons would go to Tyler to see patients in Foox's office and then bring them to Forest Park Medical for surgery, court records show. Foox referred at least 440 patients to the Dallas hospital, according to the government.\nA doctor performs surgery at Forest Park Medical Center in 2014. (David Woo/The Dallas Morning News) When Foox was told in 2012 that he'd no longer receive payments, he sent an email to a Forest Park Medical representative saying, \"I'm sure the courts will find the information very interesting given the facts of the matter,\" the indictment said.\nFoox, 70, of Tyler, was vacationing in Canada with his wife when he was indicted on charges that could land him in prison for 15 years.\nHe agreed to self-surrender at the Canadian border on Dec. 2 but rescheduled a planned flight to Panama with his wife, prosecutors said.\nUpon landing in Panama, Foox was elusive about his U.S. citizenship, the government says. He used his South African passport and hid his U.S. passport in his luggage, records show. However, Panamanian authorities deported him to the U.S. due to a travel alert. The FBI arrested him when he arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, records show.\nFoox's lawyer had advised him not to think about fleeing. \"Even if you succeed somehow, you'll never have a good night's sleep for the rest of your life,\" the lawyer reportedly told him.\nThe government wanted Foox behind bars, noting that he is a pilot who owns a plane and is known to \"gallivant the globe for pleasure.\"\nBut Foox's defense lawyer argued that his client \"panicked\" and suffers from life-threatening health problems, including heart problems and skin cancer.\nU.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater ruled on Jan. 27 that Foox should be released if he deposits $15 million in the court registry to ensure his appearance.\nHe did so and was released on Thursday, said his lawyer, Jeffrey J. Ansley.\n\"He is looking forward to defending the case,\" Ansley said.", "external_links": ["https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/pr/executives-surgeons-physicians-and-others-affiliated-forest-park-medical-center-fpmc", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?auto=format&q=50&or=0&w=350", "http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/New-Hospital16x9_Dallas-Fort-Worth.html", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486151890-Beauchamp.jpg?q=30&w=200&fit=clip&auto=format&frame=1", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486151890-Beauchamp.jpg?auto=format&q=40&or=0&w=350", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?auto=format&q=50&or=0&w=600", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486151890-Beauchamp.jpg?auto=format&q=40&or=0&w=400", "http://www.dynacq.com/facilities.htm", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?auto=format&q=50&or=0&w=700", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?auto=format&q=50&or=0&w=800", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486151890-Beauchamp.jpg?auto=format&q=40&or=0&w=700", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?q=30&w=200&fit=clip&auto=format&frame=1", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486152572-FPMC2.JPG?auto=format&q=50&or=0&w=400", "https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1486151890-Beauchamp.jpg?auto=format&q=40&or=0&w=600"], "published": "2017-02-03T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:34:59.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
