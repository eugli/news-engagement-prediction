The home supporters will be subverting the visitors’ Carefree to scoff at the relative novelty of their achievements. It begins “F--- off Chelsea FC, you ain’t got no history’” before descending into slanderous remarks about some of the club’s most decorated players. \n• Arsenal v Chelsea: The worst combined XI \nBut despite being outnumbered Chelsea’s away support will not grimace and bear the contention that they are vulgar upstarts, answering the slight with a question they answer themselves to the tune of Coming ‘Round the Mountain : “Have Arsenal ever won the Champions League? Have they f---.” \nRepartee never pales by repetition in football. Indeed saying the old things over and over again is part of its appeal, allowing supporters to cast clubs’ identities in concrete by contrasting them with the perceptions of one’s own virtues: hence Chelsea are parvenus while Arsenal are synonymous with European failure. Both are based on gross exaggerations and distortions but in all this ribbing about pedigree, tradition and the hardened fan’s fixation, ‘authenticity’, this is a rivalry that is almost wholly devoid of long-standing antagonism. \nMajor established derbies tend to have historic religious, social, cultural or geographical roots. Yet the rancour between Arsenal and Chelsea is a recent phenomenon. Of course, they share a city but territorial competition in a metropolis of London’s scale is demarcated on more subtle lines than many outsiders notice. Both clubs share a loathing of Tottenham while Chelsea’s old west London rivals Fulham and QPR have faded from parity . \nS till, although no derby has flourished more in the Premier League era when both teams have been truly competitive simultaneously for an extended period of time, its roots extend beyond that. Dominance was cyclical for much of the preceding decades – Chelsea lost merely twice in the Sixties, Arsenal only three times in the Seventies while the Eighties were roughly shared even if the Blues spent six of those seasons in Division Two. \nThere were classic matches, too: Peter Osgood’s goal of the season in the 1972-73 FA Cup sixth-round tie (below) stands as an enduring testament to the skill that preserves his reign as the King of Stamford Bridge long after his death and Ray Kennedy’s two at Highbury in 1971 were a crucial step on the road to the Double. \nT he intensity of the occasions – pretty fraught through much of the preceding 15 years whenever they met – escalated throughout the Nineties. It was Chelsea in 1990-91 who ruined Arsenal’s original chance of becoming the first modern Invincibles by inflicting the only defeat of the season on George Graham’s side, but much cherished memories such as Dennis Wise beating the offside trap to smash in a stoppage time equaliser at Highbury in 1996 aside, the decade ended with Arsenal winning the matches that counted and some of them in imperishably glorious fashion.

When Sylvinho rattled in a curling drive four minutes from time that swerved as much as any of Roberto Carlos’s ‘banana’ shots to equalise after being 2-0 down, Chelsea would have been forgiven for thinking themselves cursed by Arsenal full-backs. They would ultimately remove their albatross necklace by buying the best of them all, Ashley Cole. Kanu completes a remarkable hat-trick Credit: Getty Images \nT wo victories in the League Cup apart, Arsenal were undefeated in the fixture from 1995 until 2004, Roman Abramovich’s first season. Ken Bates, the Chelsea chairman, and David Dein, the Gunners’ vice chairman, held each other in mutual, caustic contempt as Football Association board members which must have made Arsenal’s mastery of the last nine years of Bates’ association with the club he bought for a £1 hard to swallow. At the Millennium Stadium in 2002 they sat on the same row as Arsenal won the FA Cup final and a third Double with Ray Parlour’s thunderous shot and Freddie Ljungberg’s slalom dribble and perfectly executed finish. The look on Bates’ face as he gazed at a grinning Dein rivalled Medusa’s. \nOne month before the end of his eighth season in charge at Arsenal, and on the brink of his greatest achievement, the invincible Premier League campaign, Arsene Wenger remained unbeaten against Chelsea in all but the League Cup. But then Claudio Ranieri brought his expensively remodelled side to Highbury for the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final tie, having drawn 1-1 at the Bridge. Three minutes from the end it was 2-2 on aggregate until Wayne Bridge spurted into the box from the left, played a cute one-two with Eidur Gudjohnsen that left Arsenal’s defenders rooted to the spot in confusion, and buried the winner. Cue pandemonium in the Clock End away enclave and the balance of power in London tilting westwards.

On the touchline he bristled with rage from the start – when Thierry Henry scored with a free-kick in December 2004 while Petr Cech was still organising his wall – and off it he used all the machinery of modern football, tapping into the media’s mania for spurious ‘mind games’, feeding Sky Sports News with first strike or tit-for-tat soundbites and generally acting as if victory gave him a conqueror’s right to denigrate. Bad winners are rare but Mourinho acted like one at times though Wenger was not blameless here. He could not have been unaware of the effect his pointed remarks would wreak.

It became like the ‘Chicago Rules’ from the Untouchables: “He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.” \nWenger would call Chelsea defensive or hint that their manager liked to use the chequebook, Mourinho would call him a ‘specialist in failure’ and note that his club had ‘a tradition of crying’. In 2005 Mourinho’s remark that “he is what you call in England a voyeur” was the poisonous icing on a pretty rancid cake so it was usually a relief when they got the ball out – if not for Arsenal, who famously won only the 2015 Community Shield with Mourinho at Stamford Bridge. \nThe ill-feeling between the two bred bitterness among the supporters and it allowed the clubs to be portrayed as conflicting archetypes: pragmatists v purists. But that only feeds the hype. In truth, as ever, the battles on the pitch count for far more than words and at times over the past 12 years since Abramovich’s billions transformed Chelsea these have been extraordinary.

Two years later, but this time for Guus Hiddink, Drogba struck again with six minutes to go to seal a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup semi-final while in 2011 Robin van Persie’s hat-trick fired Arsenal to a remarkable 3-5 win. Diego Costa winds up Gabriel Credit: Getty \nL ast season’s first encounter – a 2-0 win for the champions Chelsea against an Arsenal side reduced to nine men - was the last Mourinho voodoo act and probably the one episode he will continue to treasure from his wretched last three months at the Bridge. \nWith him gone, will this most modern of rivalries continue to flourish? These clubs are now so rich, the Premier League's marketing so dependent on what Sky once nauseatingly called 'Grand Slam' meetings, local bragging rights between teams made up of foreign players barely matter. Cosmopolitan teams in a cosmopolitan city are duelling over television and social media as well as the field for corporate hospitality cash and multinational sponsorship deals. It's peak Premier League. \nNo one really cares anymore about the struggle for the mastery of London. But this will endure for as long as eyes are fixed on other prizes and on those few clubs who stand in each other's way. The atmosphere at the Emirates for Chelsea's away victory in January 2016 under Guus Hiddink and Arsenal's dominant first-half performance that engineered the 3-0 victory last September that forced Antonio Conte was as intense and salaciously barbed as ever. It will always matter to supporters who have an inexhaustible appetite for reminding the opposition of their shortcomings. \n*This article was originally published in January 2016 and has been updated", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:29:29.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
