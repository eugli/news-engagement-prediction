(Theopolis Waters/Reuters)\nHowever, many of the instructions to immigration agents outlined in the guidance will not be implemented immediately because they depend on Congress, a public comment period or negotiations with other nations, the officials said.\nFor example, the DHS will need to publish a notice in the Federal Register subject to review in order to implement one part of the plan that calls on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to increase the number of immigrants who are not given a hearing before being deported.\nThe new guidance would subject immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to \"expedited removal.\" Currently, only migrants apprehended near the border who cannot show they have been in the country more than 14 days are subject to rapid removal.\nHow 'sanctuary cities' are reacting to Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants The memo also instructs ICE to detain migrants who are awaiting a court decision on whether they will be deported or granted relief, such as asylum. DHS officials said they are reviewing what jurisdictions may have laws in place that prevent the amount of time immigrants can be held.\nThe agency also plans to send non-Mexican migrants crossing the southern U.S. border back into Mexico as they await a decision on their case. The DHS officials said this plan would be dependent on partnerships with the Mexican government and would not be implemented overnight.\nTrump's planned measures against illegal immigrants have drawn protests, such as an event last week that activists called \"A Day Without Immigrants\" to highlight the importance of the foreign-born, who account for 13 per cent of the U.S. population, or more than 40 million naturalized American citizens.\nÂ© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:41:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
