A time to celebrate, right?\nNot for Jane Park. Four years ago, when she was just 17, she won Â£1,000,000 (that's roughly $1.6 million given the exchange rate at the time) on the British lottery. But now Jane says that the money has actually made her life pretty miserable.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below She appeared on the British daytime talk show Loose Women (think The View , but with more tea) on Thursday, and explained just how hard she's found having a baller bank balance:\n\"I never realised how difficult it would be,\" Jane said. \"I thought everything would be amazing when in there were times where it was just completely different to what you expect it to be like... There's a part of it that is, like, going shopping and getting all the handbags and having all the money. And then there are other times when it's the opposite.\" (Jane did not explain what she meant by \"the opposite,\" other than presumably not having all the handbags?)\nJane was asked whether she expects sympathy from the wider public over her comments.\n\"I have had a lot of hate on Twitter,\" Jane said when asked whether she expects sympathy from friends, family, and people who, you know, didn't win the lottery. \"I can relate to a lot of people's problems, because before I won the lottery, I was in a similar situation when I was making ends meet,\" she replied.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below And, of course, the panel asked the obvious question: if Jane is so unhappy with the money, how come she hasn't given it away? \"I have had so many folks saying that,\" she replied. \"I'm not saying I'm completely unhappy, because there are parts of my life which are good, and there are days where I wouldn't change anything... I'm just saying that there are other days when I'm upset and it gets on top of me.\"\nWant up- to -the-minute entertainment and tech news?
