A post shared by antoniovalencia2525 (@antoniovalencia2525) on Feb 23, 2017 at 7:56am PST \nFalcao commented on the post: \"Ander the sun is free hahaha\", referring to his pale skin complexion. \nIt's great to see the former Manchester United and Chelsea striker back to his best. \nKeep up the good work, Radamel.
