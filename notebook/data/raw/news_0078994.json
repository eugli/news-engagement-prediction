After X-Men: Apocalypse debuted last summer, Hugh Jackman will bid farewell to his long-held place in the franchise with Logan . The leading man is set to don Wolverine ’s claws one last time in the blockbuster, but the actor won’t be the only mutant slicing and dicing. Set in a distant future, Logan will follow the grumpy mutant as he cares for an aging Professor Xavier, but the two will be forced into action again when a young girl winds up on their doorstep. And, when she gets provoked, you can expect the claws to come out. MORE: Logan Official Review \nIn the most recent TV spot for Logan , fans can get a better look at the girl’s familiar mutation. The heroine, who is named Laura, is seen being dragged before she unsheathes a single metal claw from her foot. When the shot changes, Logan can be seen looking surprised by Laura’s gift as he has one like hers. While he can extend three adamantium-coated claws from his hands, Laura can extend blades from her hands and feet. \nOf course, comic book fans will not be too phased by Laura’s powers. The character is taken from the pages of Marvel’s comics where she is better known as X-23 . Having been cloned from Wolverine, Laura manifests a similar mutation to the X-Men before she is bred into a deadly assassin who one days goes rogue. \nIn Logan , Dafne Keen will be playing Laura, and it looks like the actress may have a future with the franchise should she want. Recently, director James Mangold gushed over Keen’s acting abilities and said he’d be surprised if fans didn’t see more of her. \n\"I think Dafne is a remarkable actress and I think she does an incredible job with this role. Personally, I would be shocked if we don’t look into trying to develop that character further,” Mangold stressed. \nAre you excited to see Logan ? Let us know how hyped you are with our anticipation rankings! Currently, the film is #6 on our site! \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men , are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet.

Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green. \nMORE LOGAN NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:52:57.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
