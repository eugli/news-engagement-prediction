Girl, 13, who was 'raped' leaves warning to bullies before taking her own life \nTylah, a beauty student, felt her eyebrows begin to itch just minutes after using a 1000 Hour’s Eyelash and Brow Dye kit. \nHer face quickly began to swell and her eyes began to weep pus. The skin around her brows was red and blistered and her eyelashes started to fall out. \nShe said: ‘I woke up almost blind because of the reaction, my eyes had blown up like huge balloons, I was crying and screaming,’ Tylah said. Tylah was almost blinded (Picture: Caters) \n‘It was like having beach sand thrown in your eyeballs and not being able to get it out, then a stinging like razor blades on my eyebrows.’ \n‘My eyes were pretty much swollen shut, I could only see a tiny amount and my eyes were weeping with a lot of pus.’ \nTerrified Tylah was hospitalised, where medics discovered she had suffered an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the tint – Paraphenylenediamine (PPD). Paraphenylenediamine \nPPD is a common ingredient in hair dyes and ink used in henna tattoos. \nSadly, Tylah hadn’t performed a patch test before applying the dye to her eye area. \nDoctors explained that she’d suffered a rare but severe reaction. She has been left with chemical burns, but doctors say she is extremely lucky not to have been permanently blinded. \nShe’s been warned off using hair dye again. \nTylah added: ‘’I went through inexplicable pain just by tinting my eyelashes and eyebrows. \n‘I’m never using dye on myself ever again. \n‘No one really does the patch test in my family, so I thought I would be okay and hadn’t suffered any reactions when dying my hair in the past, but those dyes didn’t have PPD in them.’ Tylah says the horrific hair dying allergy left her looking like a frog and nearly blinded her (Picture: Caters) The allergic reaction was extremely severe (Picture: Caters) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:32:23.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
