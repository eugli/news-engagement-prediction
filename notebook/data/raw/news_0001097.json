The nomination of Viola and several other defense nominees reportedly infuriated Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who was sworn in two weeks ago.\n“I appreciate the confidence President Trump showed in me,” said Viola in a statement Friday. “I offer my continued support for President Trump and his administration, and look forward to redoubling my efforts to support the Army and its veterans as private citizens.”\nViola ran into trouble early on when news surfaced of an allegation that he had once tried to punch out a concessions worker at a horse auction. Mattis, for his part, was reportedly upset with Viola’s appointment from the moment the Army nomination made headlines, and even threatened to quit , CNN reports. Mattis found out about it from the media, after the Trump campaign had promised he could have a major hand in the nomination of top leaders, an anonymous source told the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin in January.\n“Mattis was furious,” the source told the Washington Post Jan. 6. “It made him suspicious of the transition team, and things devolved from there.”\nMattis announced his support for Viola unequivocally Jan. 25.\nThe secretary of defense has clashed with the Trump transition team over other appointments as well, having rejected all candidates for undersecretary of defense for intelligence, according to Rogin.\nAfter attending the United States Military Academy at Westpoint, Viola qualified as a Ranger and served with the 101st Airborne division. Upon leaving the Army, he went on to become a successful businessman, once chairing the New York Mercantile Exchange. Viola went on to found Virtu Financial, a digital stock trading company, and currently owns the Florida Panthers hockey team.\nViola planned to give ownership of the team to his family and hand over operations to his vice chairman, but his plan did not meet the Pentagon’s requirements, according to a report by Military Times .\nFollow Russ Read on Twitter \nSend tips to russ@dailycallernewsfoundation.org . \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
