Think of this label as something of a dust-flecked golden beam cutting through the harder, sportier streetwear shroud that still dominates the zeitgeist. The Atlanta-raised designer—who graduated concurrently from Parsons with a menswear degree and Eugene Lang College with a philosophy degree—has a deeply throwback sensibility about her approach, with a “love instilled by [her] mother” of textiles. Bode’s pieces are mostly one-offs—singular applications of 19th- and 20th-century quilts, repurposed with printed cottons from the ’30s and ’40s—and she sources her antique fabrics from around the globe. If there was a datedness to her Fall collection, it came across as light, and oftentimes as pretty lovely—no expiration date in sight. “I was inspired by an old family home on Cape Cod,” said Bode. “There’s this vignette of domestic movements but something is off—should there be this many people in a house?” Madras-mimicking cubic patches of faded quilt clippings patterned their way across a jacket, while dead-stock shearling was cut into a lumpen bomber with slightly longer proportions through the body. Vertically striped pants, partially pajama-esque in vibe, drew double takes. There were also really great integrations of chinoiserie embroideries on silk panels. All in all, Bode kind of perfectly (and contemporarily) invoked the glory days of simpler (though no less detailed in consideration) familial dressing. (Her presentation reminded this writer of looking through his grandmother’s meticulously chronicled photo albums of the ’60s and ’70s.) She is one to watch, and closely at that.
