In the dressing room, he had such a great impact on the team,\" Lukaku added. \"To witness that with my own eyes, it was something amazing. \n\"[Vincent] Kompany used to be a very good ball playing centre-half back in the day and he has still got it. He comes from the same academy at Anderlecht, has been an example for us, the younger kids, and has been an example for us, the younger kids, who came through the ranks.\" ALSO READ: Chelsea eye Sergio Aguero transfer swoop as doubts over his Manchester City future grow \nLukaku made a special tribute to the newly retired Frank Lampard, who made an impression on the striker as a youngster. \n\"Frankie was just a joke, unbelievable finisher. I've seen him do stuff where I think 'my god,'\" Lukaku revealed. \nLukaku was often compared to Blues legend Didier Drogba when coming through as a teenager and the Ivorian's influence is enough to earn him a spot to round off his side. \n\"The main man [Didier Drogba]. The game-winner, game-changer,\" Lukaku said. \"He used to win games whenever we were in trouble.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:43:25.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
