Loved it from beginning to end!! Overrated by TheOnlyWeber Not as funny as I hoped it would be. Very slow moving and very annoying at times. Not even close to being a hangover type movie. :( What about this movie do people find funny? by DesertMermaid702 I have a great sense of humor, and I am VERY open minded, but I can't grasp what it is that people liked about this movie. Melissa McCarthy was the best at what she did, but I only chuckled once because of her. It was not funny other than that. Maya's humor and wit could have been put to better use. I found it to be rather dull, and boring, and when it ended, I actually couldn't believe I sat and watched the whole thing. Kristen Wiig was awful, and the script / story was even worse.
