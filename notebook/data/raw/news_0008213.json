According to the researchers, this indicates ‘the presence of buried physical wastes at depths consistent with those predicted for the Camp Century tunnels’ In the maps, blue means a net gain in ice cover, while white means no change. The analysis comes after a study published last year in Geophysical Research Letters revealed that dramatic ice loss could affect the area by the end of the century. According to the authors, there are 200,000 liters (53,000 gallons) of diesel fuel, 24,000,000 liters (6,340,000 gallons) of wastewater, including sewage, and an unknown quantity of low-level radioactive waste and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). THE HISTORY OF CAMP CENTURY By the time it was abandoned in 1966 as the ice cap started to crush the camp, soldiers had built two miles of tunnels Camp Century was built in 1959 in northwest Greenland by the US Army Corps of Engineers, 8m beneath the surface of the ice sheet. It was one of five bases built near the Thule Air Force Base, with the purpose of resting Arctic construction techniques and scientific research. The original plan was to build 2,500 miles of tunnels which would have covered an area of 52,000 square miles – which is bigger than the size of England. By the time it was abandoned in 1966 due to the ice cap starting to crush the camp, soldiers had already built two miles of tunnels and a facility that boasted a hospital, theatre, church and a shop for 200 of its inhabitants. The real plan was top secret - known as Project Iceworm,' it was designed for a proof of concept for a planned subsurface nuclear missile base. Scientists now estimate that the snow and ice that sealed the base will melt away by the end of the century as a result of climate change, potentially releasing the hazardous chemicals The hidden launch site would be able to shoot as many as 600 intermediate range ballistic missiles that could reach the Soviet Union. But, the plan was thrown out in 1963. It housed 85 to 200 soldiers during its time of operation Camp Century is completely encased within the ice sheet, positioned roughly 125 miles inland from the Greenland coast. It housed 85 to 200 soldiers during its time of operation, and scientists at the site collected ice core samples that are still used in research today. The project, though it was built with Denmark’s approval, was kept secret from the Danish government. And, several years after it became operational, the camp was decommissioned. The US removed a portable nuclear reactor that had supplied heat and electricity, but left behind an estimated 200,000 liters (53,000 gallons) of diesel fuel and 24,000,000 liters (6,340,000 gallons) of wastewater, including sewage, according to an international study published in August. And, they left an unknown quantity of low-level radioactive waste and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Under the secret mission 'Project Iceworm', the hidden launch site would be able to shoot as many as 600 intermediate range ballistic missiles that could reach the Soviet Union. But, the plan was thrown out in 1963 The original plan was to build 2,500 miles of tunnels which would have covered an area of 52,000 square miles – which is bigger than the size of England Remarkable footage sheds new light on the 'City under Ice.' A narrator in the video explains: 'Camp Century is buried below the surface of this ice cap. 'Beneath it, the ice descends for 6,000 feet. 'In this remote setting, less than 800 miles from the North Pole, Camp Century is a symbol of man’s unceasing goal to conquer his environment, to increase his ability to live and fight if necessary under polar conditions.' While surface melting may not be imminent yet, the researchers say liquid meltwater could pose a threat much sooner. The phenomenon could carry the PCBs deeper into the ice, according to NASA, and farther downhill. Camp Century (red) is completely encased within the ice sheet, positioned roughly 125 miles inland from the Greenland coast A radar profile from NASA’s Operation IceBridge captured on May 2, 2011 shows disturbances within the smooth ice. According to the researchers, this indicates ‘the presence of buried physical wastes at depths consistent with those predicted for the Camp Century tunnels.’ Solid waste buried roughly 100 feet (30 meters) below the surface can be seen as the darker splotch in the image. Researchers warn that the waste, which lies near the edge of the retreating Greenland Ice Sheet, could soon be exposed as the temperatures continue to rise. ‘How are we going to adapt to this and start talking about what to do in 2090?’ said William Colgan, the study’s lead author. ‘This is just one in a very long list of reasons to say: how do we try and mitigate climate change now?’ Share or comment on this article 38 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:36:01.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
