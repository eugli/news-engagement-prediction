The forest industry provides employment for workers across the entire value chain. \n- In Victoria alone, is estimated that more than 21,000 people are directly employed in the forestry / forest products manufacturing industries, with an approximately an additional 48,000 in-direct jobs generated. \n- Forest management practices under RFAs are adaptable to changing circumstances: \n- Leadbeater's possum - last year the Victorian Government instituted timber harvesting exclusion zones around 160 colonies that had been found in state forests. \n- Swift parrot - Forestry Tasmania works to protect swift parrot habitat, for example, wood harvesting on Bruny Island has been temporarily ceased pending the completion of a management plan for the species. \n- RFAs balance competing economic, social and environmental demands on forests by setting obligations and commitments for reservation and forest management. It's important we get the balance right. \nThe Australian Government is seeking to ensure the conservation and productive use of Australia's native forests by establishing rolling extensions for each RFA. \nAs part of the extension process, the Australian Government will work with the relevant state government to deliver some improvements to the RFA framework, including streamlined and strengthened review and reporting arrangements focussed on outcomes, improved and contemporary dispute resolution mechanisms, improved communication and consultation, and modernisation of the RFA. \nThe extended RFAs will continue to: \n- deliver a robust, sustainable and adaptive forest management framework that is continually improving \n- protect environmental values, through the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, which includes formal and informal reserves \n- deploy ecologically sustainable forest management practices in harvesting areas \n- be flexible and adaptive to new information and issues. \nVicForests was unavailable for interview. A spokesman provided RN Breakfast with the following statement: \nVicForests has welcomed the extension of the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). \nRegional Forest Agreements play a critical role in the native timber industry, providing additional certainty around the way harvesting operations are planned to help ensure the protection of threatened species and their habitat. \nA range of conservation measures mean only 6% of Victoria's forest estate is available and suitable for commercial timber production yet this 6% of forest continues to sustain a vibrant and important industry. \nVicForests remains supportive of the current RFA process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:34:46.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
