Even before he made his name, though, he was just a kid, hoping to make it big in Brazil. Back then, when he was only 16, Sao Paulo had the option to sign him for just $15,000. And they turned it down. \nBrasil Online reports that Ronaldo was offered to Sao Paulo president José Eduardo Pimenta Mezquita by scout Kalef Joao Francisco Neto, who had watched the young Ronaldo play for Rio club Sao Cristovao. Neto sent Pimenta a letter that was published on Wednesday, detailing his offer: \n“I have a player in Rio, who is not yet 17, who people are saying great things and who plays for the Brazil youth team. He’s a centre forward. They want him to play at São Paulo in exchange for $15,000,” wrote Neto. “The player will belong to São Paulo and we will form a company with 50 percent of his rights each. Please, have a look at the proposal.” \nUnfortunately for Neto, and for Sao Paulo, President Mezquita didn’t feel this unproven kid was worth $15,000 and he offered half that for his services. Sao Paulo didn’t secure Ronaldo’s services, and he joined Cruzeiro before eventually leaving for Europe where the rest is history. \nOh, what could’ve been.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:26:20.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
