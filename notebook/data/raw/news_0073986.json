But it looks like Ahaan is not happy with that identity.Ahaan was live on Instagram earlier today and interacted with fans and gave them a quick peep into his life. While answering questions from the fans, the 19-year-old was at his candid best. Image Source: twitter/ahaanpanday Ahaan has acted in few short films, which he made along with his friends and the lad made his runway debut at designer Nandita Mahtani's fashion show in Mumbai recently.The youngster, whose circle includes other star kids like Aryan Khan and Alia Furniturewala, flashed his abs and shared fitness tips during the live chat.Ahaan talked about his future plans of studying cinema and becoming an actor. He openly admitted to being in a relationship and dropped a few hints about a secret project too.While he answered all of these probing questions without any hesitation, Ahaan was ticked off when asked about his connection with chacha Chunkey Pandey.Ahaan burst out and said: It's funny that my surname is Panday but I'm nowhere connected to him. My dad is Aloke Sharad Panday and that's the only Panday connection I have. I have established myself in the B-town through my popularity. ahaan pandey nephew of chunky pandey More Image Source: coludfront We think, Ahaan's statement is rather self-contradictory. His father Aloke Sharad Panday, who is better known by his nickname Chikky Panday is indeed Chunky's brother. And for a teenager who is yet to make his mark, the statement reeks of arrogance. After all Chunky is a beloved '90s star who enjoys tremendous goodwill in Bollywood. Despite the fact that his stardom has faded, no one will ever ask, Chunky Pandey who? And the same cannot be said of Ahaan, yet.Is there a family rift we do not know of or is Ahaan simply trying to carve an independent identity? We hope he answers our questions in his next post.
