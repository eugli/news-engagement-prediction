The emaciated lurcher was not much more than skin and bones when it was found abandoned by a carriageway in Maidstone, Kent, by passing motorists. She weighed no more than 22lbs – around 10 bags of sugar – when she was rescued on February 16, but thankfully now she is making a steady recovery in the care of the animal charity.

Rosie Russon, an inspector for the RSPCA, said Snoopy was so skinny the members of the public who found her mistook the starving dog for a pile of rags. She added: “Snoopy was curled up and collapsed in the kerb of the busy street when she was found.
