Instead, the show featured the same The-Dream song on repeat the whole time. Kanye West Photo by Earl Gibson III/WireImage \nKanye West debuted his Yeezy Season 5 fashion collection today. The show took place at New York’s Pier 59 Studios , as part of New York Fashion Week. He did not premiere any new music of his own at the show, which was instead soundtracked by The-Dream singing J. Holiday’s “Bed” (a song he cowrote). It played on repeat. The presentation began with models projected onto a screen before actual models walked the runway. Some of the clothing had “Calabasas” and “Lost Hills” printed on it. West did not appear at the show’s end. See videos and photos from Yeezy Season 5 below. \nAs West has done in the past, the physical invite to the show was a piece of apparel. For 5, West sent out sweatshirts with “Lost Hills” or “Mullholland” written on them, as Hypebeast and Vogue point out. Throughout the day, rumors swirled that West would debut a new Drake collaboration due to a promotional photo allegedly attached to one of the invites. According to GQ Style ’s Jake Woolf , the “Lost Hills” sweatshirt was sent with a “Kanye West & Drake” billing. The invite package also came with a zine for 2016’s Season 4. Below, see the sweatshirts and some shots from the zine (via Jackie Nickerson ). \nThis past summer, West received backlash for his Yeezy Season 4 show , due to delays and difficulties, including a model fainting from heat exhaustion. Although he has not played new music at his last two shows, he did so at his first three: “Wolves” was first played at the Yeezy Season 1 launch in February 2015, and “Fade” was played at Yeezy Season 2 later in the year. Yeezy Season 3 , of course, was also the premiere of The Life of Pablo . \nRevisit our recap of West’s Season 2 zine event, “ On Kanye West’s Zine-less Zine Party in a Parking Garage ,” on the Pitch.
