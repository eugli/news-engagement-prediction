The vehicles, along with other equipment, arrived at 2.40pm. They will be transported to an Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camp for a standard post-training administration, which includes “serviceability checks and routine maintenance”, the statement added. The vehicles had previously been confiscated during a routine inspection at Hong Kong’s Kwai Chung Terminal during a stopover. The SAF had contracted container shipping firm APL to ship the vehicles back to Singapore from Taiwan, where SAF has been holding training exercises since 1975. Multiple meetings between APL and Hong Kong’s Customs and Excise Department did not yield any results, until 24 January, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Hong Kong will be returning the vehicles to the Republic.
