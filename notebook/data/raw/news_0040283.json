I've seen the anti-vaccine movement pull some stunts, but this is on a new level Fiona Pettit O'Leary H owever, critics say the film is based on pseudo-science and it has already been pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival , the Curzon cinema in Soho and the European parliament.\nWakefield set off a public health time bomb in 1998 with a paper published in The Lancet that claimed the joint MMR vaccine might be the cause of rising numbers of autism cases.\nHe offered no causal mechanism but called for use of the triple vaccine to be suspended until further research could be done.\nHowever, other scientists were never able to replicate the results. Subsequent investigations found a string of failings, which led the General Medical Council to conclude that Wakefield had acted “dishonestly and irresponsibly\". \nThat was not enough to prevent thousands of parents avoiding the MMR vaccine, sparking a rise in case of measles and mumps .\nDavid Robert Grimes, a University of Oxford scientist who has long opposed Mr Wakefield, said that he was no more deserving of public attention than a far-right idealogue.\nSupporters of Andrew Wakefield in 2008 Credit: JANE MINGAY \"Wakefield is a long-debunked fear merchant whose attempt to paint himself as a Galileo-like figure is at once completely narcissistic and utterly dishonest,\" he said.\n\"Whether by oversight or intention, giving Mr Wakefield a platform on vaccines is a grievous mistake, given that we're still reeling from the damage his falsehoods inflicted on public health.\n\"Not only are his claims devoid of evidence, they are vividly disproven by the overwhelming scientific data to date.\n\"When the evidence points in only one direction there is no debate, yet by hosting someone so notorious [the university] gives the perception his assertions might have merit. They do not.\"\nD uring a question-and-answer session Mr Wakefield was asked about Fiona Pettit O'Leary, an Irish woman with Asperger's syndrome who founded the organisation Autistic Rights Together and has criticised Vaxxed.\n\"I've heard her name,\" he replied. \"I really know nothing about her. I've heard that she herself may be on the autism spectrum, is self-reported, and if that is the case my heart goes out to her. I'm certainly not going to go on the attack. It's unfortunate. It's extremely unfortunate.\"\nMrs O'Leary told The Times that she had been belittled and patronised by the remarks. She also castigated Regent's University for not carrying out due diligence on the event.\n\"I was humiliated last night,\" she said. \"I am on the autistic spectrum and I couldn't believe it. I've seen the anti-vaccine movement pull some stunts, but this is on a new level.\"\nA university spokesman said that it had not been told about the nature of the event and had severed links with the CHE.\n\"[Our] commercial business arm leases space to a range of clients and does not endorse the views of the film that hired our venue last night,\" he said.\n\"The name and content of last night's film were not disclosed to us. As a result we are re-vetting all clients and acting accordingly.\n\"The reported content of the film is against all of Regent's University London's values and we have taken the decision to immediately terminate our relationship with the organisation which screened the film.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:04:48.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
