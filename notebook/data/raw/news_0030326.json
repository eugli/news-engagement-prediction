I was a little rusty in the first innings, got into a better rhythm in the second innings straightaway, bowling with the new ball,\" Ashwin said after the end of the fourth day's play on Sunday. ( Also read: One-off Test, Day 4: Bangladesh left with 7 wickets to survive after Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja strike ) \nAshwin also became the fastest bowler to take 250 Test wickets. The Chennai spinner achieved the milestone in 45 Test matches, surpassing Australian legend Dennis Lillee, who had reached the 250-wicket mark in 48 matches. \nAshwin scalped all-rounder Shakib al Hasan (82) on the third day and then sent back skipper Mushfiqur Rahim (127) in the first session on the penultimate day to achieve the landmark. \n\"Good to have the (250) record out of the way,\" he said. \n\"Today was one of those days when I started enjoying my spell right from the start. It's going to be an interesting day tomorrow. The wicket is not giving too much help for the spinners, we have to be very very patient in the morning session,\" Ashwin said.
