We will play to our best possibilities,” Federer, 35, told the media launch in Prague. \nFederer, the world number nine, is due to figure with sixth-ranked Nadal at the September 22-24 event. \nThe Laver Cup will be held every year except in an Olympic season, with four matches each day -- three in singles, one in doubles. \nEach team comprises six players -- four based on the ATP singles rankings after Wimbledon and two picks by the captains, Borg and McEnroe.
