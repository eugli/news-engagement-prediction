Article continues below \nAccording to MMAFighting.com , de Germaine told Joe Rogan that she was sorry for hitting Holm after the bell: \n“It wasn’t meant for me to hit her after the bell,” the Netherlands native said. “It was in the heat of the moment. I apologize. I’m not like that.” \nDe Germaine won the fight by one point in a unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 48-47), so if de Germaine had been penalized for her late punches, the title bout could have had a completely different outcome.

She said she wanted a more open fight, but Holm's strengths are on the mat: \n“It was a close fight,” de Randamie said. “She [caught] me in the third round with a head kick. It was close, but I came to fight and she didn’t want to fight me. I’m a brawler. I want to fight. \n“I hoped she was going to fight with me. Holly is a tremendous champion. I truly respect her. But I love to brawl, I love to fight. Clinching is not my game. But whatever.” \nAs the first champion in the featherweight division, de Randamie will likely have plenty of competitors gunning for her new title. UFC fans will be anxiously awaiting her next opponent, but de Randamie will have to be more careful to stop when the referee tells her to in her next match. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
