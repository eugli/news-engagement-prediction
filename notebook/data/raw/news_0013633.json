Joseph had 2 uncles, 2 aunts and 2 cousins turned away at Philadelphai International Airport and were forced to return to Qatar. The family had bought a house in Allentown, PA to settle in Aemrica. Mayor Kenney holds a press conference at City Hall along with ACLU attorneys and family of those detained or deported this weekend. Mayor' Arrow icon \nA Syrian family turned away at Philadelphia International Airport last week are crossing the Atlantic once again, and should enter the United States Monday morning. \nSix Syrians, brothers Basam and Hassan Assali, their wives, Jozfin and Jurfeet, and Hassan’s two children, are scheduled to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York Monday morning, a lawyer representing them, Jonathan Grode, said Sunday. On Sunday, in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, they received preflight clearance to enter the United States. \nWhen they arrive they will take a van to Allentown, where a third brother, Ghassam Assali, awaits them. The family arriving from Syria plan to live in the United States. \n“I don’t see this family having any more problems,” Grode said. \nMonday’s flight is expected to end a week of contradiction and confusion for the family that has been seeking visas to the United States since 2003 and was finally granted visas last year. President Trump’s executive order signed Jan. 27 suspended all visas from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, suddenly making their visas worthless. When they arrived in Philadelphia on Jan. 28, they were denied entry. \nU.S. officials instead put them on a plane to Qatar, and from there they traveled back to Damascus. A federal judge in Washington state Friday temporarily suspended Trump’s travel ban, which allowed American customs officials to reinstate the family’s canceled visas. On Sunday a federal appeals court declined a White House request to reinstate the travel ban, ensuring the suspension would remain in place at least into Monday. \nGetting a flight back to the United States, their third transatlantic crossing in 10 days, was made possible through money donated to a GoFundMe account. \nThe Assalis' experience were among those that prompted about 5,000 to demonstrate at the Philadelphia airport last Sunday to protest Trump's executive order, which also barred the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely.
