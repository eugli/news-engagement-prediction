Close Rescuers attempt to refloat stranded whales in New Zealand UP NEXT \n- Around 180 new whales have been stranded during low tide at Farewell Spit on Saturday afternoon- Around 20 other whales that restranded are to be euthanised by DoC- Project Jonah has issued an appeal for more volunteers to help on Sunday morning - Some 417 whales became stranded overnight on Friday, one of the largest mass stranding in the country's history. \nLATEST: \n11.52am: \nThe rising tide has lifted all 17 stranded whales from the sand. \nVolunteers have formed a human chain in the water to stop them from returning to the shallows. \nOne News reported that cheers erupted from the volunteers as the whales took off out towards deeper water. \nDepartment of Conservation's Herb Christophers said rescuers were delighted so many whales refloated overnight, especially since hundreds of animals had died in the past few days despite desperate efforts to save them. \n\"They got themselves off actually, they didn't need any help from us,\" he said. \n\"We've called off the need for more volunteers. So we may have it in hand, as long as this group (from overnight) doesn't re-strand we should be OK.\" \n11.12am: \nScientists have ruled out any suggestion that a 5.2 magnitude earthquake, which struck 15km north-west of Culverden at a depth of 9km on Sunday morning, was linked to the mass whale stranding at Farewell Spit. \nUniversity of Auckland marine biologist Dr Rochelle Constantine told NZME that the quake and the recent mass whale strandings at Farewell Spit were likely unrelated. \n\"There's no strong evidence that strandings are linked to earthquake events. For marine mammals these events are mostly unconsequential to them.\" \nMORE: Severe earthquake rocks central New Zealand \n9.56am: \nDOC spokesman Herb Christophers says the response from volunteers has been huge over the last couple of days. \n\"It's a pretty daunting task, but we've got a lot of volunteers, I've just got a phone call from a guy from California who wants to come over, so we've had offers of help,\" he said. \nVolunteers wishing to help must have a wet suit and should bring buckets and sheets. Big shout out to all the volunteers doing an awesome job working day and night helping the whales at farewell spit. @seashepherd — Peter Aden (@PeterAden) February 11, 2017 \n8.02am: \nAn update from Project Jonah says only a small group of whales had been spotted on Sunday morning. \n\"Beaches along Farewell Spit were checked at first light this morning. So far only a small group of 17 live whales have been spotted and our medics are attending to these. \n\"A spotter plane is currently up and looking for any further whales in the bay.\" *stranding update* First light. Sunday. Situation currently being assessed. pic.twitter.com/ApiS2XU7yb — Project Jonah (@ProjectJonah) February 11, 2017 \n7.38am: \nProject Jonah are calling for volunteers to return to Farewell Spit this morning as fears remain over a likely possibility that more whale strandings will take place. \nThe amazing efforts of rescuers on Saturday morning saw about 100 pilot whales successfully re-floated at high tide. Photo: AFP/Getty \nRescuers were told to call it a day last night as the incoming tide, as well as sightings of sharks and stingrays in the area, made it too dangerous for volunteers to continue. \nProject Jonah told One News it is likely more whales will strand today and they'll need another huge turnout to help save them. \n7.16am: \nVolunteers battled exhaustion as attempts were made to save a new pod of whales stranded at Golden Bay on Saturday night. \nMore than 300 whales have already died on Farewell Spit over the last few days, despite huge relief efforts to refloat them. A further 200 pilot whales beached themselves on Saturday night. \nRELATED: As it happened: Hundreds of whales dead after Farewell Spit mass stranding \nThe Department of Conservation's Andrew Lamason told Newshub it's disheartening. This was what we @ProjectJonah trained medics looked like at 7am. We looked a lot more broken at 7pm after dealing with 100s of whales today pic.twitter.com/ck2AbuF5lc — Abbie Reynolds (@abbie_reynolds) February 11, 2017 \n\"These are a new pod from the ones we were dealing with before. None of them are marked. They are scattered along quite a long stretch of beach. \n\"There's an awesome group of people down here, but people are tired. They've had a few days out in the wind. We've had a few issues with people getting hypothermia.\" Close Stranded whale yelps as rescuers try to keep it upright UP NEXT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:15:17.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
