Thompson left us 12 years ago today 1 / 59 Back to Gallery In the world of literary figures, Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald stand in a class above the rest.\nHunter S. Thompson, an ardent admirer of both men, stood in a class by himself. The famed \"Gonzo journalist\" who chronicled Houston's 1974 Super Bowl for Rolling Stone , died Feb. 20, 2005, - 12 years ago - at his Owl Farm home in Woody Creek, Colo., where he took his own life.\nFans remember Thompson for his books, including \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" and his wild persona, that of a heavy drinking, drug swilling writer with an acid wit.\nSMOKE 'EM: Hunter S. Thompson's widow to clone writer's pot strain\nAnd, that he was, to a degree. Thompson certainly lived hard, played harder and wrote wild (mostly true) tales of his adventures in books and for Rolling Stone and other publications. His story, \"The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved,\" is still discussed and studied among writers.\nBut, Thompson was also a big fan of Fitzgerald, Hemingway and other writers. He loved Hemingway so much, Thompson even took a pair of antlers from an Idaho bar where the iconic writer once hung out. (Those have since been returned by Thompson's wife .)\nAnd, Thompson, who claimed a doctorate in divinity from a mail-order church, was as sharp political mind and loud critic of President Richard Nixon and, later, George W. Bush.\nODD LUCK: Houston has had some strange happenings during Super Bowls\nAnd, he lived life on his terms.\n“Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming \"Wow!
