It’s been a while since the winger-cum-forward was last truly spotted making a fist of being a footballer, at the Euro 2016 final, when the his France team-mates seemingly mistook him for a latter day Michel Platini and gave him the ball at every opportunity. It’s a tactic that worked well .\nTottenham fit enough to stay in running on three fronts, says Jan Vertonghen Read more \nMeanwhile, Spurs like the cut of the Hull City defender Harry Maguire ’s jib. The 23-year-old has been attracting the kind of lusty glances from Ronald Koeman that inevitably make the Everton manager’s rosy cheeks an even deeper shade of rouge. And Nabil Bentaleb is expected to make his £16m move from Spurs to Schalke a permanent one at the end of the season.\nManchester City are willing to listen to offers of around £20m for Joe Hart , who is doing a sterling job in goal while on loan at Torino. They will even let him go to a top-six Premier League club. They really ought to consider including themselves among his potential suitors. Whoever City have in goal next year, they may be done a big favour by not having Nicolás Otamendi charging out to the halfway line, missing the flight of the ball spinning on the spot and legging it back to the edge of the box to discover his side have gone a goal down. Apparently, Real Madrid want some of that excitement in their back line, if reports in Spain are to be believed. \nIt’s that time of year when Arsenal are linked with a Napoli forward. Step forward Lorenzo Insigne who, it says here, will slot right into the Olivier Giroud -shaped hole in the Arsenal squad when the France striker does one to Marseille at the end of the season. Oh, and Lucas Perez – remember him – is happy with his role as an ornament the Arsenal squad and does not want to leave. Nope.\nChelsea and Manchester City are donning their boxing gloves and preparing to get fisty over the services of Lemar, that’s 21-year-old Monaco string-puller Thomas Lemar, not the former reality TV crooner from Tottenham. \nAnd Southampton’s Cedric Soares is a target for Barcelona , who could do with a half-decent defender or two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:52:27.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
