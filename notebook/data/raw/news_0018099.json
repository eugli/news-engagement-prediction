But as they passed the microphone down each row, there were no political statements on immigrant bans or building walls, just a large auditorium at Belleville West High School filled with gratitude. \n\"It took 15 years, but we made it,\" said Gene Antiporda, 45, who came from the Philippines in 2002 and was sworn in with his wife, Anna, 44. \nQamar Zaman, 34, moved from Pakistan about nine years ago to have a more promising career as a physician. He now works as an emergency room doctor at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Belleville. \nHe urged the other new citizens to make the most of the home of the free and the brave. \n\"The American Dream is very much still alive,\" Zaman said. His wife, American born Nayab Bashir, watched proudly as he recited the Naturalization Oath, which says, in part: \"I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United State of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" \nThe naturalization ceremony was scheduled long before the legal battle over whether President Donald Trump can place a temporary ban on immigrants. For Belleville West school students, it was an in-house field trip, a natural extension of their U.S. History and American Problems classes, the latter an elective for seniors to engage in discussions on the country's most divisive social issues, including abortion, health care, race relations, climate change, media bias and immigration. \n\"As teachers, we try our best to leave our own ideology at the door,\" said Cari Novaria. \"We want them to discuss these topics and have their own opinion and express it in a respectful way.\" \nThose who became U.S. citizens on Friday represented 40 countries, from Albania to Zambia. They ranged in age from 19 to 79. They were doctors, bankers, social workers and homemakers. As a group of students sang the Star Spangled Banner, the soon-to-be citizens put their hands on their hearts and turned to the American flag. \nU.S. Judge District Judge Laura K. Grandy, who administered the oath, asked the students how many of them had spent their entire life in the Metro East. Almost all raised their hands. \n\"Imagine leaving everything that is home to you. Your friends, your favorite coffee shop,\" Grandy said. Those sitting on the stage left their countries for various reasons, the judge said. To flee a country in war. To attend college. To be with family. \n\"Or maybe they just came to receive this gift of freedom,\" Grandy said. \nGrandy focused on the words of the Declaration of Independence, a document that new Americans must become familiar with as part of a citizenship test. \nThe passage most often quoted is the second paragraph, which begins: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" and refers to the \"unalienable rights\" of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \nBut Grandy urged the new citizens to focus on the final paragraph. \n\"And for the support of this Declaration ... we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\" \nGrandy referred to this as the \"put up or shut up section\" that all Americans should focus on. \nBelleville Mayor Mark Eckert noted that his city, the largest in southwestern Illinois, was built by German immigrants and its diverse population today is what keeps it strong. \n\"We challenge you to get everything you can out of your U.S. citizenship,\" Eckert said. \"Be informed. Register to vote. Ask questions.\" \nAs the new citizens introduced themselves, over and over they expressed gratitude and pride. \n\"Thanks for letting me be part of this country\" said a woman from Vietnam. \nAs the new citizens left the stage with their naturalization certificates, each was handed a U.S. flag by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution and urged to visit the voter registration table in the lobby. They posed for photos with Judge Grandy and family members. There were hugs and tears. \n\"This is what I've been waiting for like everyone else here,\" Antiporda said, as he stepped off stage and waited for his wife. \"This is a big event.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:29:40.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
