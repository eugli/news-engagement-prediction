(Photo: John David Mercer, USA TODAY Sports) 14 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHighlights from the 59th running of the Daytona 500, Sunday at Daytona International Speedway: \nWINNER: Kurt Busch took the lead on the final lap to win the Daytona 500 for the first time in 17 attempts. \nUPSETS: If drivers continue to be this aggressive for stage wins and top-10 finishes — the top 10 at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2 are awarded points — get ready for some different names in victory lane. Several big names were collected Sunday, including Earnhardt. Two-time Daytona 500 winner Jimmie Johnson, two-time winner Matt Kenseth, Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski and Danica Patrick. Granted, this was a restrictor-plate race, where drafting and bumping come into play. But every point counts in this new system. \nSTAGE 2 (61-120): Kevin Harvick won the second stage. Earnhardt and Elliott Sadler jockeyed for the front and Earnhardt was leading the pack by Lap 100. Busch lost it between Turns 3 and 4 when a tire went down. He collected Earnhardt, whose right front was damaged when he briefly went up over Busch’s car. \nRAIN ON TOYOTA PARADE: Busch was the early leader of the Joe Gibbs Racing contingent, but the team that looked dominant in qualifying races and practices took a heavy blow in Stage 2, when Busch’s flat tire also collected Matt Kenseth and Erik Jones, who drives for fellow Toyota team Furniture Row Racing. \nPHOTOS: Best of the 2017 Daytona 500 Facebook Posted!
