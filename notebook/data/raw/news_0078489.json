By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Tuesday, February 28, 2017 - 18:45 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nAhmedabad: Gujarati Brahmins are now demanding caste-based reservation in the state assembly. \nThe Brahmin community in state has demanded reservation in the assembly ahead of upcoming assembly elections, according to a report in Nav Gujarat Samay (TOI). \nAccording to a Gujarat Brahmasamaj leader, \"Brahmin community constitutes less than 10 per cent of the state's population, which is why they are neglected.\" \nThe leader demands, \"In the upcoming elections Brahmins should get 19 out of the 182 assembly seats in the state.\" \nYagnesh Dave, General Secretary of Gujarat Brahmasamaj (State level) and Convener of Brahma Vikas Aayog says, \"All political parties tend to offer assembly seats to other castes in proportion to their population but when it comes to Brahmasamaj the things are different\". \nGujarat Brahmasamaj has also threatened to boycott political parties in the upcoming elections if their demands are not fulfilled.   18:40 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:47:10.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
