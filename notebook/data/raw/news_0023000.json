This was communicated to his team yesterday afternoon. \nIn considering whether to grant the dispensation, CAMS is required to satisfy itself that there are exceptional circumstances to support a decision to waive the minimum requirements. CAMS has determined that there are no exceptional circumstances to support a decision to waive the minimum requirements. It is the opinion of CAMS that Matt Chahda has not demonstrated the necessary driving skill and competency to support the dispensation requested. \nCAMS values the safety of competitors, officials and fans above all other considerations. \nMatt Chahda has been announced as the driver of the second Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport entry at the Supercars season launch at the Adelaide Oval, where he will join 16-year-old rookie Alex Rullo. \nChahda has spent the past two seasons racing in the second-tier Dunlop Series, his best race result an 11th in the final round at Homebush last year on his way to 20th in the championship. \nHowever, Chahda’s acceptance as a Supercars driver has yet to be fully confirmed. \nSimilar to his teammate Rullo, Chahda doesn’t meet the minimum requirements to qualify for the CAMS Superlicence needed to be eligible to race in Supercars, having not earnt the minimum 13 Superlicence points from results across his past five seasons of racing. \nWhile Chahda joined the other 25 drivers that make up the class of 2017 on stage in Adelaide, it remains to be seen if he will receive the same special dispensation that Rullo has received. \nCAMS has been contacted for comment.
