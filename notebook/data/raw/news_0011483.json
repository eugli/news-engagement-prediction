ABS-CBN News reported that the said beauty queen, Violina Ancheva previously announced that she will give away her Sherri Hill midnight blue gown to any girl who is in need for a dress to go to the prom. She later gave the said dress to 15-year-old Zyra Nicole Cifra, after the girl's single mother wrote to her, telling Ancheva that she could not afford one for Cifra. Nonetheless, not everybody was happy with the decision, as some began to post rude comments to Cifra, saying that her family isn't that poor and worthy of the dress. Responding to the criticism, Ancheva stated, \"It's hard to believe that it is possible for somebody to write negative and rude comments to a 15-year-old girl. The decision to give this dress to this girl was mine and you have to respect my decision.\" \"You teach me that we have to be better person and one day, all of us can be in need. We have to be ready to help each other, not to be rude. People, please stop,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:35:24.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
