EW has an exclusive sneak peek at Lifetime’s Britney Spears biopic and it features a lil’ lip-locking action between everybody’s favorite teenage pop star pairing. \nIn the short clip from Britney Ever After , Spears (played by Australian actress Natasha Bassett) is leaning against a tour bus and smoking a cigarette when Justin Timberlake (Nathan Keyes) — bleached-blond ramen noodle curls and all — approaches. The original pop power couple banter back and forth and Brit reveals she’s feeling homesick and is worried her dad’s phone has been shut off due to poor finances. J.T. cheers her up by reminding her of their Micky Mouse Club days and how they pulled through. In a fairly convincing Tennessee accent, Keyes tells her she’ll always have home with her in her heart before he steps up and plants one on Britney. \nFor a longer look at Spears and Timberlake’s gone-too-soon romance, and to witness all the other key moments from Britney’s life and career — from VMA highs to head-shaving lows — tune into Britney Ever After when it premieres on Lifetime on Feb. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. \nWatch the exclusive clip above.
