You prepare for the worst (rain, snow, sleet) while praying for the unexpected (blue skies, balmy afternoons). Lucky for the fashion flock in London, this last week the city experienced unseasonably warm temperatures in the mid-50s. Maybe it’s the weird weather, but our favorite street style sweethearts have been seen around town in an unusual getup—wearing their dresses over their pants—that’s unusually chic. The trick to traipsing around town in the layered look is all about balance. And who better to take a cue from than the street style sensations of the season? Perhaps you pull a page out of Pandora Sykes’s rulebook, and let your satin mini see the light of day—accompanied, of course, with velvet trousers in like-minded hues and sturdy-soled booties. Maybe you make like Kate Foley or Lisa Aiken and elevate your everyday denim with a proportionally playful, ditsy floral dress or calf-grazing crepe dress. If you’re afraid you’re bordering on frumpy, give your look a little leg-up with fierce leopard-printed pumps or embellished kitten-heel mules. And if you thought your spirited summer sheath couldn’t be reimagined for the winter months, think again. But if you opt for a sleeveless, swishy number in the spirit of Veronika Heilbrunner, ground your look with a lug sole boot (after all, it is still March, and an impromptu shower may be in the forecast). Don’t feel like denim? A stirrup legging will do the trick. So if you love your dresses, and don’t feel like stowing them away for the dreary months ahead, don’t be afraid to pile them atop your pants. Fashion is, after all, meant to be fun. Above, five ways to wear the layered look now. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:44:30.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
