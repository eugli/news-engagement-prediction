Photograph: Michael Thomas/Getty Images Up to 100 gravestones vandalized at Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia Police say 75-100 headstones desecrated at Mount Carmel Cemetery Israeli foreign ministry calls attack ‘shocking and a source of worry’ View more sharing options Staff and agencies Sunday 26 February 2017 21.52 GMT \nPolice said on Sunday that scores of headstones have been vandalized at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia . 'It has to stop': Trump condemns antisemitism after Jewish cemetery vandalized Read more \nA police spokeswoman said preliminary estimates were that 75 to 100 graves were damaged at Mount Carmel Cemetery in the Wissinoming section of the city. \nThe damage came less than a week after a Jewish cemetery in suburban St Louis reported more than 150 headstones vandalized , many of them tipped over. \nThe Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia lists Mount Carmel as a Jewish cemetery in the north-eastern part of the city. \nWPVI-TV reported that a man who went to visit his father’s grave on Sunday morning discovered headstones toppled. Police said a vandalism report came in just after 9.30am. \nAfter the vandalism in Missouri, Governor Eric Greitens wrote in a Facebook post : “Anyone who would seek to divide us through an act of desecration will find instead that they unite us in shared determination. From their pitiful act of ugliness, we can emerge even more powerful in our faith.” \nThe Missouri incident prompted a response from Donald Trump, who had been criticised by Jewish groups and political opponents for a lack of comment on an increase in threats against Jewish community centers around the US and a White House statement to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day which did not mention Jews or Judaism . \nHillary Clinton’s presidential running mate, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine, likened that omission to Holocaust denial . \nSpeaking at the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Tuesday, Trump said: “Antisemitism is horrible and it’s going to stop and it has to stop. \n“The antisemitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are a painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.” \nTrump said he would speak out against antisemitism “whenever I get a chance”. \nVice-President Mike Pence also condemned “this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms” after the Missouri incident. Jewish community centers in US receive nearly 50 bomb threats in 2017 so far Read more \nQuestions regarding Trump’s attitude to antisemitism and possible antisemitic views among his aides and supporters have persisted since he announced his run for the White House. \nDuring the campaign, Trump attracted criticism for tweeting an alleged antisemitic image – he denied any intent to do so but deleted and replaced the image in question – and running ads that critics said employed timeworn antisemitic tropes . \nSome observers pointed to the influence of advisers including campaign chairman and now senior White House counsel Steve Bannon, the former head of the “alt-right” Brietbart website who was accused by his ex-wife of making antisemitic remarks, an accusation he denied . \nTrump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is Jewish . The president’s daughter, Ivanka, converted when she married. \nOn Sunday, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, called the damage reported in Philadelphia “shocking and a source of worry”.
