\nNice were 1-0 down against Montpellier and in danger of falling behind their Ligue 1 title rivals until Mickaël Le Bihan scored two vital goals on his comeback Mickaël Le Bihan scored the first of his two goals just eight minutes after coming off the bench. Photograph: Yann Coatsaliou/AFP/Getty   Adam White and Eric Devin   12.52 GMT \nN ice did well to beat Lorient last weekend and keep pace with Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain in the title race, despite finishing the match with 10 men. Nice had lost to Lorient in the Coupe de France in January and Bernard Casoni has had Lorient in better goalscoring form since taking over in November. Wylan Cyprien scored an early goal, however, and that was all Nice needed to pick up three points on a weekend when Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain could only draw. \nThe dismissed player in last weekend’s match was, inevitably, Mario Balotelli. After a strong   Balotelli’s form has dropped off – he has accumulated more red cards (two) than goals (one) in his last five league starts – but, with Nice’s top scorer Alassane Pléa ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury, the team were desperately short of strikers for their trip to Montpellier on Friday night . Having brought in only the promising but untested winger Bassem Srarfi and the veteran midfielder Mounir Obbadi in January, Nice were left without an orthodox striker against Montpellier, who have won three of four matches since Jean-Louis Gasset replaced Frédéric Hantz last month. \nYoungster Anastasios Donis had played as a striker a handful of times in the Europa League, but Nice had been lining up in a 3-5-2 in those matches, so the Juventus loanee was playing next to Balotelli or Belhanda. In the absence of the injured Ricardo Pereira and the out-of-form Malang Sarr, manager Lucien Favre switched to a 4-3-3 and asked the slightly built Donis to lead the line . When Montpellier scored a slightly fortuitous opener through Steve Mounié, an already grim situation looked potentially catastrophic; leaders Monaco would be facing out-of-form Guingamp the next day and could move six points in front of Nice with a win, all but ending their title hopes. \nNice have never been a big-spending club. It was only the sales of Nampalys Mendy to Leicester and Jordan Amavi to Aston Villa that have allowed them to spend on any significant level in recent seasons. The club received investment from China last summer but that seems to have been directed towards wages rather than transfers. The €5m they paid for Wylan Cyprien was the club’s biggest outlay last summer and that fee was more than recouped when Mendy left for Leicester for €15.5m. Modest though Nice’s spending was last year, it still demonstrates a marked increase over the previous summer, when the €1.5m they paid for Mickaël Le Bihan represented the height of the club’s ambitions. \nNice’s top scorers in the 2014-15 season, winger Eric Bauthéac and midfielder Carlos Eduardo, had both been sold that summer, so Le Bihan represented a necessary purchase. He was unproven at the top level but he had impressed in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, when his record of 18 goals in 36 matches made him the league’s top scorer in 2014-15. Neither a poacher nor a targetman, Le Bihan’s skills spoke to a versatility that could be useful in constructing a new attack along with Hatem Ben Arfa, Pléa and Monaco loanee Valère Germain. \nInitially used off the bench after arriving late in the window, Le Bihan was finally given his first start against Bordeaux two months into the season and he impressed with a goal and an assist. Physically imposing enough to hold up play but also a willing runner who creates space for his team-mates, he looked a good fit in Nice’s up-tempo attack. However, disaster struck when a broken leg ended his season prematurely. \nLe Bihan remained out of action until last month, when he made a run of appearances with the reserves, his condition and sharpness finally impressing enough to be included on the bench on Friday. With no other attacking players available and Donis doing little but running about, Favre rolled the dice and put on Le Bihan with half an hour to play. He responded with two well taken goals to give Nice an unlikely 2-1 victory. \nFor the first, just eight minutes into his return, Le Bihan saw Valentin Eysseric getting forward with the ball at his feet and pulled away from the winger towards the edge of the penalty area, nimbly shaping his body around the ball before firing home with his right foot. The second was equally impressive, running on to Arnaud Souquet’s through ball and holding off Daniel Congré before shooting across the face of goal, once again with his first touch. \nRyad Boudebouz struck the post for Montpellier from a free-kick in injury time, but Nice held on, putting the pressure on their title rivals. Le Bihan is not the quickest player, nor the most prolific scorer, but he succeeds simply through movement and graft, creating space for others while remaining a scoring threat himself. He has the physical presence to lead the line in a 4-3-3, but could also partner one of Balotelli or Belhanda in a 3-5-2. Given how often suspensions and injuries have forced Nice to change systems this season, his versatility could be a real boon to the team’s title hopes. Marcelo Bielsa is joining a Lille team that has been lost in transition for too long Read more \nLe Bihan’s comeback was remarkable but Montpellier are not known for their defensive solidity and Congré was making his first start after missing more than six weeks through injury. Le Bihan’s fitness may also yet be an issue, but he has started four games for the reserves on his way back to the first team. \nPlayers suffering a serious injury and never returning to their best is a not-uncommon occurrence in Ligue 1 recently, as Lyon’s trio of erstwhile internationals, Yoann Gourcuff, Clément Grenier and Nabil Fékir, can attest. Fékir is starting to look back to his best again after scoring a hat-trick in the Europa League last week but Gourcuff and Grenier have been relative non-entities in the last three seasons, cautionary tales of the pitfalls of injury changing a player’s career. \nIf Le Bihan can avoid the fate of Lyon’s midfielders, there may yet be life in the current season, both for player and club. Nice’s next three matches are against relegation candidates Dijon, Caen and Nantes, while both Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain also have European and Coupe de France matches before the international break, with the Coupe de la Ligue final to follow in early April. If Le Bihan’s fitness stays at a sufficient level, he could very well be an unexpected catalyst for Nice’s season. Ligue 1 talking points \n• During his press conference before the visit of Dijon on Friday, Nantes manager Sergio Conceição said he would do something he had never done before in confirming that one of his players, Yacine Bammou, would start, saying: “I hope he will score and that the whole stadium will applaud him.” Bammou, famously, formerly employed by the PSG club shop , had not scored at home since October 2015 and had been the subject of Nantes’ supporters ire since an on-pitch altercation with a colleague at the Parc des Princes in November. However, the committed if often erratic forward seized his chance within three minutes to fire his side in front, instigating a 3-1 win and maintaining the uptick in goals at the Stade de la Beaujoire after Nantes’ superb 3-2 triumph over Marseille in the previous home fixture. The six goals accumulated over the last two outings better their tally for the entirety of the rest of their Ligue 1 home campaign as Conceição emerges as the man to provide the vociferous fanbase and the often overbearing club president Waldemar Kita with the flair and verve they craved under Michel der Zakarian and René Girard. Nevertheless, the 22 goals amassed so far still leaves just Nancy as more impotent in Ligue 1, with Nantes having finished as the league’s lowest scorers in 2014-15 (29) and only outscoring hapless Troyes last term (33). However, with Conceição starting to hit his stride and the club as a whole resuscitated from its slumber under Girard, that trend seems sure to change. Bastia handed three-match stadium ban for racist abuse of Mario Balotelli Read more \n• “Combative” has a become borderline clichéd description for a midfielder who likes a tackle and the odd booking but, if anyone deserves that label, it is Bastia captain Yannick Cahuzac. His sending off during the disastrous 3-0 loss at Angers, resulting in considerable ground lost to a relegation rival, was his fourth in his last 10 games, and his third in his last four, as the Corsican native with over 300 league appearances for Bastia (his only professional club) crossed the boundary into petulance once more – and this time in bizarre fashion. As Cahuzac, substituted, left the pitch, replaced by Nicolas Saint-Ruf, the fourth official raised his electronic board to display both players’ numbers. However, in doing so, the board made an unfortunate connection with the Bastia captain’s cheek, bringing Cahuzac to slap the board out of the official’s hand, much to the referee’s displeasure. The ensuing suspension will be his fifth since mid-November and Bastia will once again have to do without one of their most influential players as they slip to five points from of the safety mark. They will also have to do without the François Ciccolini, who was relieved of his duties on Monday morning. Bastia are a club who often loiter on the edge of the gaping trap door marked “Ligue 2”, their formidable home form regularly keeping them from the drop. They boasted the fifth best home record last term, but this season has been different. With just three wins at the Stade Amand Cesari – which will be partly closed for three games as punishment for racial abuse suffered by Mario Balotelli earlier this month – Bastia are losing grip on their form along, perhaps, with their Ligue 1 status. \n• Although the acquisition of Memphis Depay amounted to a marquee signing, some sections of the Lyon fanbase pointed out that the sizeable fee could have been better spent on weaker areas of the squad. Four of Depay’s seven outings to date have come off the bench, the Dutchman largely flitting in and out of games as form and fitness slowly return. However, Sunday’s encounter with Metz provided the strongest indication yet that any risk on Lyon President Jean Michel Aulas’ part would be a worthwhile one. Bruno Génésio’s team overwhelmed Metz with some incisive, fluid interplay from their frontline. Although the first of his brace, which opened the scoring in the five-goal thrashing, was a mere tap-in, the second showed the power, intensity and eye for goal that made Depay such a heralded talent. Jinking into the area, Depay lost out to Metz midfielder Cheick Doukouré, only to immediately wrestle possession back and fizz a shot past Thomas Didillon for 2-0. Depay’s finishing is not as clinical as he would hope it to be – he was one of many guilty of wasting clear openings – but his close control and ability to dispense with a defender are slowly returning, joining Nabil Fékir, Alexandre Lacazette and Maxwel Cornet in twisting and teasing an increasingly dizzied Metz back four. Depay could have had the match ball as early as the 70th minute but instead his unselfish attempt to find a colleague rebounded in off the hapless Ivan Balliu to finish the tie. Lacazette toyed with Franck Signorino before firing in the fourth on 78 minutes, his 22nd of this league campaign, before a sublime dink over Didillon from substitute Mathieu Valbuena in injury time rounded off the victory. Although Lyon’s return to the title race may have to wait until next season, the gap to the podium staying at 13 points with their defence still in need of a degree of refining, the 20 goals scored in their last four games proves that they are a frightening prospect going forward, with a Europa League final a distinct possibility come May. \n• Much like Cahuzac’s affinity for red cards or Nantes’ inability to score goals, Javier Pastore’s obscene injury record has become a maxim of French football in the last 18 months. At the zenith of his powers, his grace and guile makes for utterly compelling viewing, but he has been absent for long stretches. Seeing his name on the team sheet for Le Classique on Sunday night was a triumph for both Paris Saint-Germain fans and followers of the league as a whole. Within 15 minutes his class began to show. A well-worked set-piece had given PSG the lead over Marseille at the Vélodrome, Marquinhos heading home in the sixth minute. Cavani doubled the lead and Pastore’s rabona in the build-up to Lucas Moura’s third typified the confidence PSG are showing after their 4-0 crushing of Barcelona. PSG passed and pressed Marseille to death. Despite their resurgence under Rudi Garcia, the additions of Dimitri Payet, Morgan Sanson and Patrice Evra (who was withdrawn at half-time having been overrun by an electric Lucas) and the intoxicating atmosphere at the Vélodrome, Marseille were simply not good enough. A marauding Thomas Meunier squared for Julian Draxler to tap home, before a rejuvenated Blaise Matuidi grabbed a fifth with 20 minutes still to play. Rod Fanni’s consolation will do little to help the mood in Marseille on an embarrassing night. With Monaco and Nice both taking crucial wins, Ligue 1’s title race continues apace, the top three separated by just three points with 11 games to play. Pastore’s return will only strengthen the Parisian challenge.
