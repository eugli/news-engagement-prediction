It is the third time that maggots have been found in food bought from Aldi supermarkets in Victoria in just over a week. On Wednesday, a video surfaced showing maggots inside beef that a family were about to eat. The sickening discovery was found inside a pack of a dozen extra large free range eggs from Lodge Farms A video filmed by the disgusted Aldi customers shows several larvae crawling around the cooked meat. A spokesman for the supermarket insisted that the matter was an isolated issue. They said they launched an investigation after becoming aware of the video, which features Brannans Butchery Butterflied Beef with BBQ Mustard Sprinkle that was bought from a store in Victoria. The spokesman added that the vacuum-sealed product was purchased on February 4 and refrigerated and cooked the following evening. 'Upon being notified of the matter, we immediately contacted the customer and commenced a high-priority investigation with our supplier,' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'We can confirm that this is an isolated issue, with no other complaints received by our customer services department.' Aldi said its meat products are produced in 'industry-leading facilities with a high-level of quality assurance processes in place.' 'This includes a processing room refrigerated to approximately four degrees, a temperature level which does not support fly/larvae development,' the spokesman said. The family claim they found maggots inside the meat after cooking it and sitting down for dinner The spokesman added that the video has been examined by Skye Blackburn, an independent Entomologist and Food Scientist. Ms Blackburn believes it is unlikely that the contamination occurred during the manufacturing or distribution process. 'By viewing the video supplied and noting the fly larvae are freshly hatched, it is most likely that the eggs had been laid after this meat had been cooked, and the heat of the meat has accelerated the hatching of the eggs,' she said. 'Heat allows eggs the potential to hatch within minutes of being laid. Due to higher than average temperatures we're experiencing at the moment, it is common for the lifecycle of insects to occur more quickly.' She added: 'If the meat had been contaminated before cooking, it would be very unlikely that the eggs and larvae would have survived the cooking process.' She explained that fly larvae generally cannot survive temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius. The revolting discovery came just days after a woman found live maggots inside chicken tenders she bought from Aldi. Tooradin man Bill Johnson told 3AW that his daughter and her friend were eating the tenders bought from the supermarket giant when they found the fly larvae crawling inside their meal. Mr Johnson's daughter made a video as the cooked chicken tenderloin was split open, and small yellow specks could be seen wriggling inside. 'This was what was found inside a chicken tender,' Mr Johnson says. 'They are still moving as you can see'. Mr Johnson said they had recently purchased the Farmwood brand of chicken tenders from the Casey Central Aldi store in Victoria. A Victorian woman was left traumatised after discovering live maggots in her chicken tenders during her meal An Aldi spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia at the time that this was an isolated incident with no further complaints made. 'Upon being notified of this matter, we immediately contacted the customer and commenced a high-priority investigation with our supplier,' he said. And Ms Blackburn said it was extremely unlikely that the contamination occurred during the manufacturing or distribution process. 'I have taken a look at the video supplied and believe it would be extremely unlikely that the larvae of the fly would survive the cooking and freezing process associated with producing this product,' she said. 'Furthermore, the larvae of the fly in the video looks to be approximately just two days old and given this product was manufactured on 12th December, 2016, it would be almost impossible that this would have happened during the manufacturing process. 'The larvae also appear to be moving very quickly, which indicates they are quite warm and therefore have not been in a fridge or freezer previously.'
