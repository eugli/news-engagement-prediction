Erin Cox 's immigration ban, online commenters bombarded Gov.

Protesters wanted Hogan to join them. \nThe governor's press staff labeled the comments spam and deleted them. \nProdded by reporters, a spokeswoman issued a statement that navigated a narrow path between praise and condemnation: The Hogan administration supports \"strengthened and more clarified vetting\" that also \"upholds our American values.\" \nHogan's goal to be the first GOP governor to win re-election in Maryland in more than 60 years grew more complicated in November, when his fellow Republican won his surprise victory in the presidential election.

Larry Hogan , offering rare public comments about the election of Republican Donald J. Trump , said Monday that \"everyone ought to take a deep breath.\" \nThe Republican governor said he would not comment on the president-elect's staff appointments, which have been criticized by senior Maryland ... (Erin Cox) \nRepublicans across the country are trying to strike the right tone in response to the president's actions, but the political climate in deep-blue Maryland creates a particular peril for its governor. \nHogan is popular here. Trump is not. \nThe governor's approval ratings have consistently topped 70 percent. Trump captured less than 34 percent of the state's vote in November. \nAs the new president's policies draw protests, Hogan has resisted pressure to engage on any national issues that could alienate either his crossover Democratic supporters or his Republican base. \nA leading General Assembly Democrat pressured Republican Gov. Larry Hogan Thursday to forcefully defend parts of the federal Affordable Care Act that insure many Marylanders. \nDel.

Kirill Reznik, who chairs the House of Delegates subcommittee on health, urged Hogan to weigh in directly with Republican... (Michael Dresser) \nHe declined to be interviewed for this article and has brushed off questions about Trump as \"stupid.\" \n\"It's pretty clear he has a strategy here,\" said Daniel Schlozman, a political scientist at the Johns Hopkins University. \"And that's to avoid the subject.\" \nHow long Hogan can do that is uncertain, Scholzman said, given the likelihood of more controversy ahead. \n\"There will be something else and then something else. This game is going to be up, somehow.\" \nFor some Hogan supporters, silence is just fine. \nChris Diehl, a Republican charter boat captain from Conowingo who said he voted for the governor, said he'd rather Hogan focus on schools, roads, bridges and public health than the president. \nDiehl, 52, said it would be foolish for Hogan to talk about Trump's policies when a state official has no influence over them. \n\"Most of the politicians in Maryland are pretty petulant and partisan,\" Diehl said. \"I don't see any reason to give anyone who's going to run against him ammunition. \n\"If he was a U.S. senator, I might have a different opinion.\" \nHogan's political opponents show no sign of letting up. \nThe governor's aides say more than 2,500 people called his office over the past week asking him to take a position on the travel ban. Several groups planned to demand the same during a rally in front of the governor's mansion in Annapolis on Saturday. \n\"Donald Trump is the proverbial cloud on Larry Hogan's horizon,\" said Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College. \"For Hogan, it's a rock and a hard place.\" \nThe coalition that elected Hogan two years ago — and drives his sky-high approval ratings today — includes moderate Democrats and independents, many of whom oppose Trump. It also includes nearly all of the state's Republicans, whose turnout in 2018 will be crucial to Hogan's re-election. \nAlienating either could create a political vulnerability. \n\"If you're Hogan, you hold off going down that path of condemning Trump as long as you can,\" said Todd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary's College. \nA spokesman for the governor dismissed pressure to weigh in on Trump as the work of misguided Democratic operatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:28:29.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
