All of them. Nick V is now a dead person so RIP. Finally someone from the show saying what we’ve all been thinking all season. Nick STINKS. Everyone on Twitter who watches the Bachelor unanimously agreed that Nick has been a train wreck of a Bachelor. He’s awkward. He doesn’t open his mouth or his teeth when he talks. He’s a teenager in a 36-year-old body on some Jack/Robin Williams shit. He’s just not very good at being The Bachelor. ABC absolutely thought he was going to be a home run because he has such a deep back story (AKA has been on the show a million times cause he stinks) and they were probably right in theory. But that was all predicated on the notion that Nick wasn’t just going to be a warm body in a suit. Well. That’s exactly what they got. It honestly seems like 95% (and probably higher) of the girls don’t even wanna be there cause he sucks so much. \n\nEnter Shark/Dolphin girl on Twitter last night. Just murdering Nick dead. Basically saying he wasn’t anything she expected him to be, like we’ve all been saying. Could she possibly be bitter that she didn’t make it further on the show? That’s a possibility but an unlikely one. Especially given how many parts of this season feature multiple girls crying and wondering what the hell is going on with Nick. And props to Shark/Dolphin Girl for stepping up and spreading the truth. She’s become somewhat of an internet darling since she got kicked off the show. Which basically means she was the most normal of them all and everyone was pissed when she got sent home. That’s how you become an internet darling after The Bachelor. Her cold-blooded killing of Nick last night will only make people like her more.
