Photo: Getty \nTakapuna Rugby and Football Club chairman Simon Cheesman said they're hopeful Dalton will pull through. \n\"Tania is a fighter, and I'm sure she'll fight this one as well as she can,\" Mr Cheesman told Newshub. \n\"We're obviously giving the family space and time because that's what they've requested. Should Duane [Dalton, Tania's husband] or the family need any help they know where we are and we'll definitely be there for them.\" \nDalton played for the Silver Ferns for 11 years, but withdrew in 2007 to concentrate on her family. \nShe returned briefly in 2008 and 2011 to play trans-Tasman games for the Southern Steel. \nThe 45-year-old also works for SKY Television, commentating alongside other former international players. \nTh family have told media the situation is \"very serious\" and are fully focusing on Tania and her health.
