But on Sunday, as it stepped onto its biggest stage, the entertainment industry took another approach in its war against President Trump . \nIt decided to show rather than tell. \nThe verbal ripostes at the Academy... (Cathleen Decker) \nThat would likely mean a cut of at least 10% to other portions of the budget — including environmental protection, diplomacy, education and job training — which have already absorbed sequestration cuts of their own since they kicked in in 2013. \nCutting some programs, such as heating assistance, public housing and grants to communities that help the poor, could have a disproportionate impact on the group of Americans whom Trump has labeled the “forgotten man and the forgotten women” hit hardest by the loss of manufacturing jobs. \n“These are all core functions of government,” said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who has advised Congress on deficit reduction. \nAt the same time, Trump repeated his promise on Monday to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, but has yet to explain how he would do so without increasing the size of the deficit. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the program would be negotiated separately with Congress as part of a longer-term deal. \nTrump will also make a separate request to Congress to pay for his promised wall on the Mexican border, said Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney. The cost is estimated at $12 billion to $38 billion if the administration were to build along the entire 2,000-mile border. \nMulvaney did not rule out making deeper cuts to Social Security and Medicaid, saying the discussion would come as part of the debate over changing the tax code. Yet Trump also promised again Monday to initiate a major tax cut as part of that process, further complicating efforts to trim the deficit. \nTrump seemed eager to put off many such details. Mulvaney called the military proposal top-line numbers and said the full budget would not be released until May. Congress, which has had a hard time passing budgets that cut popular programs even under GOP leadership, may reject some or all of Trump’s plans. Because the sequester was written into law, Republican Senate leaders would need Democratic support to reach the 60 votes necessary to reorder spending. \nTrump said his speech would also emphasize his efforts to reduce government regulation, which has put him at odds with environmental advocates but in sync with many traditional conservatives in his own party.

(Noah Bierman and Joseph Tanfani) \nStill, Trump’s roll-out seems geared more toward setting up a debate than articulating a full-blown agenda. He and his aides have stressed repeatedly that he is “keeping his promises.” \n“We are taking his words and turning them into policies,” Mulvaney said. \nTrump is single-mindedly focused on that goal, forcing his staffers to go through a checklist of campaign promises, said Chris Ruddy, a Trump confidante and founder of the conservative website Newsmax, calling it a “shotgun approach.” \n“If Congress doesn’t go along with this, that’s their problem in his mind,” Ruddy said. \nRuddy said he believes Trump is a bit too anxious, failing to leave time to think through how the military should spend the money or, with his flood of executive orders in his initial weeks, bring Congress along on his goals for beefing up border enforcement. \nStill, Democrats have also expressed an eagerness to debate over promises. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has begun using the Twitter hashtag #brokenpromises to criticize Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that “Trump fully intends to break his promises to working families by taking a meat ax to programs that benefit the middle class.” \nThe president’s budget plan means “helping the wealthy and special interests while putting further burdens on the middle class and those struggling to get there,” Schumer said. \nTrump is certain to get backing for military spending increases from defense hawks in his party. \nThe Republicans who lead the Senate and House armed services committees, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, called Trump’s increase too small, given the cuts absorbed in recent years. The Pentagon's budget fell by a total of more than $100 billion between 2011 and 2014, causing top U.S. military leaders to gripe about the struggle to fight the Islamic State militant group and other terrorists while also staying prepared to confront threats from Russia and China. \n“With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3% more than President Obama’s budget,” McCain said in a statement. “We can and must do better.” \nIn September, Trump called for adding more than 80,000 Army soldiers to get to 540,000 on active duty. He wanted to increase the number of active-duty Marines to 200,000 from the current 182,000. He also wanted to increase the Navy’s ships from 287 to 350, and add to the Air Force’s fighter jet fleet by two dozen, to 1,200 aircraft. \nBut the party is no longer unanimous in that position. In recent years, deficit hawks have gained influence, blocking attempts to restore cuts made as part of the sequester. And other GOP members of Congress have made clear they are unwilling to pay for increased defense spending by cutting other domestic programs, especially state and local services.
