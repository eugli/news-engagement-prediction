At Sunday's Grammy Awards, she explained that she was 10 when she first saw the video for George Michael's Fast Love , and was \"blown away by how how he was\". She was a year older when she \"fell in love immediately\" with Beyonc√©, whom she regretted beating to Album of the Year: \"my album of the year was Lemonade, so a part of me died inside\". \nBut that also means that Adele was the perfect age to enjoy Tina Fey's seminal Mean Girls, which was released in 2004 and made waves as a proto-feminist take on the teen movie, especially at sleepovers hosted by adolescent girls. \nMean Girls concludes with Cady (Lindsay Lohan in what is arguably her greatest performance) being crowned Spring Fling Queen over Queen Bee Regina George, much to everybody's surprise. When she takes to the stage, she makes a remorseful speech about not being deserving of the honour, before snapping the plastic tiara into several pieces and throwing them to others she admires, including her fellow Spring Fling Queen nominees Gretchen Wieners, Janis Ian and George. \nW hether consciously or merely as a result of plenty of Mean Girls re-runs, Adele re-created the scene with her Album of the Year Grammy award on Sunday. snapping the minature gramophone and raising a bit of it aloft to Beyonc√©, saying: \"All us artists adore you. You are our light.\"\nPlenty of people made the connection on Twitter: \nI know I'm not the only one who thought about mean girls when Adele shared her Grammy with Beyonce. pic.twitter.com/I2hGjdcNPA \n‚Äî Alexis (@lexi__tay) February 13, 2017 Adele and Beyonce having a Mean Girls moment is pretty much all I needed in 2017 #GRAMMYs #Beyonce #adelegrammys pic.twitter.com/1imANONRcq \n‚Äî Nikaelia Timothy (@NikaeliaT) February 13, 2017 Adele trying to be Cady Heron from Mean Girls https://t.co/dWUe0GK18J \n‚Äî daddy üåê (@feeeraaaz) February 13, 2017 I woke up to an Adele/Mean Girls moment and I can't possibly be happier https://t.co/U2MrDdpGhb \n‚Äî Abby Pratt (@Abigail_Lauryn_) February 13, 2017 Did Adele just pull a Mean Girls crown breaking for Beyonce? üòç #Grammys \n‚Äî Mica Blackwell (@micablackers) February 13, 2017 Maybe Adele loves Mean Girls too pic.twitter.com/UukR9tdpQK \n‚Äî Janel ‚úå (@janellamarey) February 13, 2017 Adele is a boss for going Mean Girls on the #Grammys but like also, how breathtaking was Bey pic.twitter.com/xYiu65x3og \n‚Äî Charlie Cuff (@CharlieBCuff) February 13, 2017 I frigging love @Adele aka Cady Heron #meangirls #GRAMMYs üèÜ pic.twitter.com/kruCgFpJ9Z \n‚Äî Emma Bing (@TheEmmaBing) February 13, 2017 The way Adele broke her grammy in half and gave some to Beyonc√© üòç just like in Mean Girls when Cady breaks up her Prom Queen crown üòÇ pic.twitter.com/0kfvvDfwLi \n‚Äî Cath Merchant (@Cath_merch) February 13, 2017 adele in quotes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:26:30.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
