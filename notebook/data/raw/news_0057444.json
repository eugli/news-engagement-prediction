Unemployed youth should join the army: Zuma \nOn October 21 2016 Masutha announced that South Africa had initiated the process of withdrawing from the ICC. \nThe decision followed several court judgments that the state violated the law by not arresting Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir‚ who has been indicted by the ICC‚ during his visit to South Africa in June 2015. \nDA federal executive chairperson James Selfe said his party was delighted by the judgment‚ saying it believed all along the decision was irrational and unconstitutional. Proposed statue of President Jacob Zuma a ‘national shame’: DA \n“We have been vindicated by the court. It is quite clear from the court's judgment that the withdrawal in such haste had everything to do with the fact that the government is embarrassed by the fact that it has lost two court cases around the validity of their actions in the in the Al-Bashir matter and they took the easy option which was simply to withdraw from the ICC‚” he said after the ruling. \nSelfe said the DA hoped the ruling created the opportunity for the government to reconsider the decision and for it to come back to parliament with a more considered approach to the question of the withdrawal. \n“We hope this judgment creates a breathing space for the government to go back to the drawing board‚” he said. Selfe said if the government appealed against the ruling‚ the DA would oppose it‚ but it was hoped there would be no further waste of taxpayers' money. \n“It is inexplicable for a political party that was at the forefront of fighting for human rights during the armed struggle should find itself in a situation where it defends people who have been found guilty‚ or at least charged with gross human rights abuses and genocide. \nWe believe that we have completely lost our moral compass as a country‚ we have completely abdicated what Madiba stood for‚” he said. \nThe government was also ordered to pay the costs of the applicants‚ including the costs of two senior counsel.
