(JEROD HARRIS/GETTY IMAGES FOR LA/FIRSTTEAM.COM)  16 AM \nHGTV star Christina El Moussa's latest relationship is apparently also a flop. \nEl Moussa — who recently announced her separation from husband and \"Flip or Flop\" co-star Tarek El Moussa — has broken up with family contractor Gary Anderson, Us Weekly reported. \n\"Christina is single and being in a relationship is the last thing on her mind,\" her rep told the magazine. \"She is taking this time to focus on her children and herself.\" \nChristina and Tarek announced their highly publicized split in December but had reportedly been separated since May. They revealed in a joint statement to people last year that they had already begun dating other people even before announcing their breakup, and Christina was quickly linked to Anderson. Celebrity breakups \n\"(They) broke up because of too many outside pressures,\" a source told Us Weekly. \nTarek and Christina have been squarely in the public eye since a May gun-related incident where cops were called to their home was revealed. \nChristina, 33, apparently called police to report a possible suicidal male with a gun, with the man turning out to be Tarek. He has insisted ever since that he was not suicidal that day, and was only carrying the weapon to protect himself during a hike. \nInTouch magazine reported that the incident was sparked by Tarek finding inappropriate text messages between Christina and Gary, but the couple has denied that either suspected the other was being unfaithful. Tarek and Christina El Moussa announced their separation in December. (Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Lakewood Center) \nThe two stars — who continue to co-star on their popular home improvement show despite the split — appeared on competing morning shows Tuesday to dish on what it's like working with their ex. \n\"We met at work,\" Christina said on \"Good Morning America,\" revealing they film at least three episodes together each week. \"We worked together before we ever started dating. It's our normal.\" \nTarek, however, admitted it hasn't exactly been an ideal scenario. \n\"I'm not gonna say it was easy. It's like anything, there's challenges in life,\" he said on the \"Today\" show. \nChristina and Tarek — who have two kids together — have been married for eight years. Tarek officially filed for divorce earlier this year.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:36:03.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
