I couldn't do the manual work quick enough which was then creating pressure upon myself.\" \nAnthony left his job and opened the business which he describes as \"not your usual bakery\" focusing only on rustic, handmade, breads and steering clear of the \"really pretty breads\". Image caption All of the bread made in the Loaf and Ladder Secret Bakery is handmade \n\"They're rustic and they're more in tune with the way my brain will allow my hands to work,\" he says. \nAfter spending some time unemployed Anthony said making the leap from benefits to business-owner was difficult. \n\"Once I hit a threshold of Â£73 a week they start drastically reducing the housing benefit which effectively means I'm not taking a salary and I'm having to rely on my tax credits to basically feed me and keep the house warm.\" \nHe says the financial reality of running his artisan bakery comes with some tough decisions in the future which he hopes he doesn't have to make. \n\"The business has to take off within three to six months. If it's not done so by then I'm going to have to seriously reconsider my options.\" The farmer: Continuing tradition Media caption Paralysed tractor driver Matthew Evans: \"It's a lifestyle, not a job\" \nIn 2014 Matthew Evans, a farmer from North Wales, was hit by a car as he returned from an agricultural show and was paralysed from the chest down. \nRather than give up working on his family's farm he decided to set up a contracting business to hire himself and his tractor out. \n\"I've always been in agriculture, from working at home with my father on the farm. Of course I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do it again, but there's always ways around things. Image caption Matthew Evans transfers from his wheelchair to the tractor using a specially built hoist \nEvans set about adapting his tractor so everything could be controlled by hand and a hoist enables him to transfer between his wheelchair and the vehicle's cabin. \nHe is now focused on building up his business which serves farms across his local area and specialises in hedge-cutting, silage and hay bailing. \n\"It's a lot different. Frustration's the biggest thing, not being able to just jump out and open a gate. You have to be patient and ask a lot of people for help. \n\"But I also have a passion for doing it and I'll do it whatever. It's a lifestyle, it's not a job, I just love it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:04:25.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
