When he signed the EO, he was surrounded by a bunch of old white men who aren't doctors—you know, just the people who should have the final say on women's reproductive health.

Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045. For a safer and better future. pic.twitter.com/OqOO2y8BU6 \n— Isabella Lövin (@IsabellaLovin) February 3, 2017 Brilliant, ladies! Not only is it an epic rebuttal to Trump's gross photo, but it's also making the world a better place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:15:38.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
