The water temperature and conditions were too much to overcome, and Officer Craig was forced to get out of the water.\"\nMumaw went missing in the 15-feet-deep water and was not found until 9:15 a.m. by a fire department diver. He was less than 100 yards from the boat ramp.\nThe woman who launched the tragic chain of events managed to make it back to shore and was found on the riverbank, police said. She was taken to TriStar Skyline Medical Center and later detained by police.\n\"She showed clear signs of intoxication,\" the statement read.\nShe has not been charged with a crime.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmz9Dv&lang=en-us&flow_id=71e24566-b029-466b-b608-fd2e3745491d", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz9Dv?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;424&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;240&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz9Dv?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;424&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;240&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/4675a8c6-f", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz9Dv?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmz9Dv%3focid%3dst&text=Nashville+Police+Officer%27s+Body+Recovered+After+Drowning&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmz9Dv%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz9Dv?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz9Dv?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;424&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;240&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/4675a8c6-fa0a-42fd-a2c9-cf4a6fcf241e/2ee09513-6255-4903-99c4-55d51c16f056.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBpgYjR.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nashville", "http://www.nbcnews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmz7bu.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmz9Dv%3focid%3dsl&title=Nashville+Police+Officer%27s+Body+Recovered+After+Drowning&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmz9Dv%3focid%3dsl", "http://www.walb.com/story/34407886/police-identify-officer-who-died-while-helping-to-save-woman-in-cumberland-river", "https://twitter.com/MNPDNashville/status/827160761080414208", "https://t.co/4MQI9DW9MZ", "http://data.nbcnews.com/drone/api/query/MSN/nbcnews/1.0/video&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBpgYjR.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA36Tom.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA2oHEB.img"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:51:18.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
