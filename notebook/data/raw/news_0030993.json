Splash News 5 Bradley was injured during the fourth show \nHe flew back to England over the weekend and saw a specialist who told him had to be kept off his feet for up to six weeks. \nA source said: ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need an operation, but he does need to rest and that‚Äôs why he couldn‚Äôt carry on competing. \n‚ÄúHe hurt himself in snow cross training, where they wear boots, it‚Äôs a cross between ice skating and skiing, it‚Äôs like an obstacle course.

I wanted to give you an injury update... \n‚Äî Brad Wiggins (@SirWiggo) February 12, 2017 \n‚ÄúFrom everything we know the break should heal properly. It is a small fracture so much so that he had been hoping to be able to carry on from it. \n\"But the specialist he needed to keep off it. He is really disappointed not to be able to carry on and he would have done if there had been any chance to compete.‚Äù 1/2 Seen a specialist, I have a small leg fracture & need to rest for 3/6 weeks. Good news no surgery or cast required. \n‚Äî Brad Wiggins (@SirWiggo) February 12, 2017 2/2 Huge thanks to the crew & good luck to all of the cast.
