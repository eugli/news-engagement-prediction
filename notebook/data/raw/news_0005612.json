My ideal happy hour involves cardio rather than cocktails, and I never leave home without a pair of gym shoes in my bag just in case the mood strikes to hop into a fitness class while I’m floating around the city. Needless to say, I love working out. \nBonus: being in my role here at InStyle means I get to try a lot of different workouts as studios open around town, which means I rarely commit to the same workout for an extended period of time. Or that was the case, rather, until I found SLT . \nBlend muscle-lengthening yoga moves with core-toning Pilates principles and you get the full body-sculpting workout known as Strengthen Lengthen Tone. It’s basically a hyped up Pilates class done on a calorie-torching Megaformer machine, and it's one of the most challenging 50-minute sessions you can find. \nSince I started taking class (I’ve been a twice-a-weeker for well over a year now) I’ve seen my body transform unlike any other workout I’ve done (and trust me, I've tried them all). Nothing has worked as well to create a seriously defined core (among other things, including glutes of steel) than regular visits to this hotspot (no wonder that Sofia Vergara , Jamie Chung , and Nina Agdal are regulars. I once took class right next to Karlie Kloss .)

And there are a wide variety of moves, so your body is constantly challenged. “ \nBut like most good things in life, it doesn’t come easy. The first time I took class, I could barely hold a plank. My muscles were shaking beyond control. I was next-day sore before I even got off the machine. Afterwards, I couldn’t walk up stairs for days. Now, I can pike up and down the machine like a pro, and I have the core to prove it. I don’t always break a sweat during class (which in the past was always my gauge for how hard I was working; I hated not sweating during a workout) yet every time I take class, I’m still incredibly sore afterwards, further proving that this workout is still changing my body. \nRELATED: The Hottest Workouts in New York City \nWhy is it such a good ab definer? “Thanks to the Megaformer machine, our clients are forced to engage their core nearly the entire 50-minutes of a class,” Freeman says. “The variety of moves that are performed in a class target your abs from all angles in ways no other workout can. You will feel your abs engage and work in specific and unique ways throughout a session.” \nWill I continue my long-term relationship with SLT? Obvi (even though my bank account feels the pain from it). Will I continue to try out workouts all over the city to fuel my passion for breaking a sweat? Absolutely. Will I continue to buy sports bras with my paycheck instead of regular bras? You better belief it. \nLearn more about SLT ($40 per class, several packages available) at sltnyc.com .
