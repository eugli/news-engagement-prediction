Then someone like Emma Watson comes along, who seems to be the right person in every way, but has been capsized with the wrong gifts at the wrong time in her life. And has yet to recover. Since appearing in the Harry Potter films, 26-year-old Emma has carved out an unusual identity for herself as an actress-activist; a self-appointed global feminist and a crusader against... well, whaddya got? Yet it is clearly all becoming a bit much. In an interview with Elle magazine, she has claimed that being an international activist is so tough, sometimes she struggles to get out of bed. This came after her work as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and a passionate campaigner for the HeForShe campaign, which aims to promote gender equality, was gently mocked. Critics called her the worst kind of ‘white privileged feminist’, whose male-focused drive actually furthered the oppression of women. And while she had factored centuries of female oppression into her role and her conscience, Emma clearly never thought that she would be the one to end up feeling oppressed. She admits that she struggled to cope with the backlash and sulked instead. Never mind. One of her feminist friends — Laura Bates of the Everyday Sexism project — sent her a care package of sequins and glitter, notes of encouragement and chocolate. Oh God. And this was something the pair of them boasted about. Sometimes, one despairs of modern feminists, whose love of portraying themselves as victims seems to be an important part of the struggle; an indicator of how they measure their worth. In an interview with Elle magazine, Watson has claimed that being an international activist is so tough, sometimes she struggles to get out of bed Think of the original Suffragettes, remember the Pankhurst women and those who were imprisoned, chained themselves to railings, went on hunger strike or were force-fed and beaten by police. Would a tube of Smarties and a pack of glittery face stickers have eased their burden? What would Germaine Greer make of a gift of such girlish rubbish? No doubt, she’d throw it on her bra bonfire and tell everyone to grow up. Yet I don’t think Emma is a terrible person, even if she is yet another tiresome millionaire celebrity lecturing everyone else on how we should be living our lives. She cannot seem to decide if she is an actress who is an activist, or an activist who sometimes acts — but perhaps the choice is no longer hers. The former Harry Potter star accepted, then turned down, the lead role in musical La La Land, which was then taken by Emma Stone and looks likely to win her an Oscar. She is not exactly washed-up, but where does she go from here? It all goes to underscore my theory that nothing good comes of being a child star. Very few of these preternatural protégées successfully make the transition into adult celebrity — and they all reach a crossroads where their potential seems to be stuck in the past. And realising in your mid-20s that you might have already peaked cannot be easy. Other Potter stars have fared little better. Daniel Radcliffe had a battle with alcohol and is shortly to appear on the West End stage in a Tom Stoppard play. Rupert Grint struggles to weed out genuine friends from hangers-on and has done some film and theatre work, but nothing spectacular. Of her Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe (left) had a battle with alcohol, while Rupert Grint (right) struggles to weed out genuine friends from hangers-on The trio pictured together as child stars during the first photocall for Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone Each has earned more than £50 million from the Harry Potter films, and need never work again — which can be a burden and a curse, instead of a blessing. For, just at the exact moment in life when their prospects should be soaring, the shutters are rolling down on their hopes and expectations. It must be hard to find the motivation and the hunger when you are already filthy rich. No wonder so many young stars grow up and struggle for meaning and purpose in their world. Shame on Foxy Knoxy and her sordid tell-all Hate to be so rude, but why doesn’t attention-seeking Amanda Knox just shut up and go away? Nearly two years after Italy’s highest court acquitted her of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, Knox has written an article for Vice magazine about a same-sex experience during her time in prison. The 29-year-old American describes how she met a woman called Leny while in an Italian jail and developed a relationship with her. Knox says she was forced to hold Leny’s hand and that her budding suitor told her: ‘I can do things to you that no man can.’ However, she had no sexual feelings for the woman and ended the relationship. ‘ “You can’t change me,” I’d respond,’ Knox writes, with the kind of dead prose that makes Fifty Shades Of Grey author E. L. James look like John Keats. Hate to be so rude, but why doesn’t attention-seeking Amanda Knox just shut up and go away? Published to coincide with Valentine’s Day, Knox notes in the essay that some prisoners decide to be ‘gay for the stay’, but she concluded that she is firmly heterosexual. Back home in America, after being acquitted of murder in 2015, Knox has long expressed a wish to be an author. Presumably, that is why she thought that her wannabe episode of prison drama Orange Is The New Black was worth publishing. Yet how ghastly for Meredith Kercher’s family, who continue to mourn their daughter and sister. If Knox really was a writer, she would stop putting herself in the middle of this tragic story and write about other things. However, she is clearly too self-centred and tone-deaf to the continuing misery of the Kercher family to do so. Shame. On. Her. Sorry, Donna, I don't care about your rocky romance Mayday, mayday! Sending out a Save Our Sisters SOS! Emergency one: Donna Air hits a pothole in her three-year romance with toy boy James Middleton. Emergency two: BBC2 Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark is going through the menopause. Emergency three: What are you talking about? Could things get any WORSE? Donna was so undone about her struggling romance with the royal brother-in-law that she was diagnosed with stress, she reveals in a magazine. Mayday, mayday! Sending out a Save Our Sisters SOS! Emergency one: Donna Air hits a pothole in her three-year romance with toy boy James Middleton She checked herself into a private Alpine clinic to ‘rest, re-set and re-boot’ and had vitamin infusions, liver compresses and quite possibly a manicure to mend her broken heart. She also did aerial yoga and learned how to chew more slowly, and if that doesn’t bring him back, what will? Kirsty has made a TV documentary about her ‘hard menopause’, which one supposes is like a ‘hard Brexit’, but with marginally fewer trade deals. ‘The most disconcerting side-effects were disturbed sleep and night-sweats, waking up literally wrung out,’ says the 62-year-old. ‘The tumultuous nights have persisted, though to a lesser extent.’ Well, that’s one way of describing the Newsnight experience to its dwindling band of viewers. Look, no one is saying that having a relationship break up or going through the menopause is a picnic, especially if you are on the cusp of middle age — or on the other side. However, millions of women go through the same challenges every day and, unlike celebrities, don’t feel the need to purge, splurge and urge us to feel their pain, too. Sometimes, you just have to put your big girl boots on, get out there and deal with it. Look at teenager Emily Bonney, who has cystic fibrosis and has defied the odds of her condition to pursue her dream of becoming a cheerleader. A member of the team Airborn Nitros, the 18-year-old, from Blackpool, will represent England in the world cheerleading championships in Florida. Her irrepressible zest for living in the face of a serious illness that means she has to take 60 pills a day and may need a double lung transplant in the future is inspiring. For all of us.
