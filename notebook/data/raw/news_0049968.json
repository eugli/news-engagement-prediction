UK should expect a very hefty bill for Brexit, says Jean-Claude Juncker Read more \nThe UK’s critics have said Davis should leave the negotiating for when he sits down with the European commission’s negotiator, Michel Barnier , after formal notification from Theresa May that the UK wishes to leave the EU. It is feared that the future of the EU will be threatened if a deal is struck that appeals to a majority of states economic and security interests but weakens the European project as a whole by encouraging others to peel away. \nSpeaking in Tallinn after talks with Davis, Estonia’s chief Brexit negotiator, Matti Maasikas, said his country, which will take over the rolling presidency of the European council in July, had maintaining the “ unity of the 27 ” as its chief goal. He said there had been no signs in his meeting with Davis of any UK intention to negotiate bilaterally over Brexit. He added: “You cannot logically have a better deal [outside the EU] while not belonging to the single market or the customs union.” \nAsked what the chief obstacles Britain faced in the coming negotiations were, Maasikas said: “Mr Davis maintained the line of the prime minister that they think that due to their regulatory convergence that the trade agreement can be negotiated in the two-year period. Everyone else is saying: ‘Do you really think that an agreement is negotiable in this time period?’ And the answer [from Davis] is: ‘We think it is feasible because we have regulatory convergence.’ \nHe said Britain faced a problem in how the process of negotiations will be arranged because of the European commission’s insistence that it will only negotiate on a future trade deal once the UK has agreed to pay all its liabilities, which could amount to a bill of €57bn (£48bn). Haggling over the sum is expected to continue deep into the talks, with ministers and MPs likely to baulk at the size of the divorce bill . \nThe Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, said of the EU member states: “We all 27 understand that we need to keep unity and solidarity in negotiations with the United Kingdom.” He said that Britain understood this but added that he believed the timescale allowed under article 50 would be “quite an issue” for the UK. \n“One of the major issues at the beginning will be how we organise the process,” he said after talks with Davis. “The EU want to see first the divorce and second the future relations. The UK wants comprehensive negotiations on the divorce and the future. That’s going to be quite an issue.” \nRinkēvičs added: “The biggest trouble is we [in the EU] have quite a good experience of enlargement [but] we have no experience of members exiting and it is going to be quite a learning curve for everyone.” \nThe former Lithuanian prime minister, Gediminas Kirkilas, the chair of the Lithuanian parliament’s EU affairs committee, said he had raised with Davis the importance of Britain paying its dues. Lithuania is depending on EU money for the decommissioning of a nuclear power station and for infrastructure works. \nAt a press conference in Riga, Davis described recent media reports that money would be diverted from development projects in Africa and Asia to the Baltic states and other eastern EU countries as part of his charm offensive as “implausible”. \n“I didn’t recognise the story I saw in the papers the other day,” he said. “It seemed to me to be wholly implausible. We have not started the negotiation yet but that is not the way I think it’s going to go.” \nHe added: “It’s not a divorce, it’s a new relationship ... it’s very modern in that respect.” \nDavis assured Latvians that Britain wanted to preserve equal rights for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit . “We want to see Latvian citizens in the UK have all the rights they have now continuing into the future. That’s not just resident rights, that’s public services, healthcare, all the normal rights we would give our own citizens,” he said.
