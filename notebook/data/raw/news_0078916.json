A sentry found Thanaseelan Muniandy, 43, unconscious in his cell at about 1.50am Saturday and alerted the officer manning the information counter at the Bukit Sentosa station. Hulu Selangor OCPD Supt R. Supramaniam said the constable then informed the Bukit Sentosa chief of the situation and was instructed to contact Hospital Kuala Kubu Baru. \"An ambulance arrived and medical personnel pronounced him dead at the scene. \"He was sent to Hospital Sungai Buloh for a post-mortem scheduled to be held on Monday,\" he added. Supt Supramaniam said Thanaseelan was under court remand from Feb 22 until Feb 25 for burglary. \"He was referred to Hospital Kuala Kubu Baru on Friday after complaining of stomach pains where he was given treatment,\" he added. The case has been classified as sudden death. On Feb 8, S. Balamurugan, 44, died at the North Klang police headquarters. He had earlier been taken to a magistrate's court to be remanded, which was denied after the magistrate saw him vomit blood. The court then ordered that Balamurugan be taken to a hospital or released but police took him to the police headquarters where he died. Lawyers N. Surendran and Latheefa Koya said that a second autopsy conducted at Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) revealed that Balamurugan had died from \"coronary artery disease with multiple blunt force injuries\". \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:41:04.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
