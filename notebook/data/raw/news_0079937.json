In any case, singer-composer Vishal Dadlani manages to grab attention. From singing songs to making music, the 43-year-old continues to pedal on two musical traditions – one of the indie rock and other of popular Bollywood music where he had a series of hits last year. Before a concert in Gurugram, he opened up about his love for indie music, his political stand and much more. \nExcerpts: \nHow do you see the present state of indie music in India? \nThe independent music scene in India is at its peak with a lot of changes in last five years with many new talent having emerged. The crowd which is showing up at various music festivals is, in itself, a testimony to its popularity. And I think it is reaching a critical mass due to creative acts and good and original song writing. I am sure that it will reach to more people in near future as distribution pattern is changing. \nDoes it, in any way, face competition from film music? Are your criteria for picking talent for Bollywood and independent music different? \nNo, not at all. I think they both are two different worlds which cannot compete as they both require different sort of sensibilities, I guess. \nAs far as picking up new talent for Bollywood or indie, I keep my options open as I follow my instinct and whichever music or voice I like and if it is fitting the context, I choose it. I just hear them and if that works for me, I select them and there is no separate process of selection. I listen to every kind of music and my only criterion is the artist should be what I term a ‘complete artist’ who can write his own songs, can make legitimate music, produce it as well and who is a good performer. \nWe still do not have a global star coming out of India... \nIf I compare to other countries, like those in the West, there are numerous platforms for them but in India, there is a lack of infrastructure. More platforms like NEXA music lounge, where we have been given platform through music videos and live performances are needed, as there are a lot of talented musicians in India who need it. The whole world looking at India right now and music scene is changing, and with Priyanka Chopra’s success globally, I hope an international music star will emerge from India within 10 years . \nWhat kind of music did you grow up listening? How different is it building an emotional connect with newer forms like electronic music? \nI was very fortunate that I grew up listening to every kind of music at my home, ranging from pop to classical, as we had stacks of records which were not defined by genres and Santana, Led Zeppelin and R.D. Burman were placed together in them. There was no distinction between Western or classical, and I was told that they were good music. \nFor building connect, whether you use music equipment like a guitar, dholak, tanpura or produce music electronically through synthesiser and sampler, at the end of the day music should come from the heart and that is what connects people. There are several kind of electronic dance music, techno music, psychedelic, trance with which people connect very deeply. So irrespective of medium, good music remains good music. \nHook lines are replacing lyrics in songs these days... \nIt is not the case all the time but yes, the hook phenomenon has been overpowering the music industry these days. But if the music is good, it will not depend on the ‘hook’ part for its success. \nYou have been vocal on several issues on Twitter as well as other social media. As a celebrity, what are the perils for an artist to comment on political issues? \nAs a citizen, it is very important to be aware and be involved in politics and we should be vocal on certain topics to demand accountability from our politicians. It does not matter which political party you support or what are your political views. As a citizen, your duty does not complete with voting. You have to constantly remind them that we are watching them. \nIt is very dangerous to say anything in this context right now but it was never like this before. It is extremely unfortunate that an artist is scrutinised for speaking. But if more people become vocal, things will change and I am sure that the freedom of speech is one thing that cannot be suppressed in India. \nYou praised Aditya Thackeray for his party's performance in the recent BMC polls. Is it a signal of changing political allegiance? \nI do not have any political allegiance. My only allegiance is towards India. I was with Aam Aadmi Party and I still support it as I love my country and I believe that they are the best option at this point of time. But anyone who does good work for the nation, will have my support, as I am open to working with BJP, Shiv Sena or any other party which is doing work for the nation and, in fact, I recently performed at a celebration which Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis organised and we were very cordial there. I do not have any grievances towards any specific political party per se but my point is the party in office should do work for the betterment of India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:44:41.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
