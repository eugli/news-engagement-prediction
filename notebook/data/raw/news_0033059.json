I don't think we are. \n\"It is a hard-line view compared to what any policy outcome might be from the current inquiry, but we definitely think our state would be a better place if poker machines weren't here.\" \nMr Young said there was a rare opportunity for young Liberals, young Greens and young Labor members to \"speak in unison\" on the issue. \nToday, the state director of the Tasmanian Liberal Party, Sam McQuestin, tweeted \"all Lib members entitled to their views, but please note no formal link/affiliation between Lib party and tas uni (sic) Libs\". Greens praise for anti-pokie stance \nYoung Greens convenor Holly Ewin congratulated Mr Young and the TULC on its position. \n\"The Young Greens support the removal of pokies from pubs and clubs, and it's my personal view that they have no place in the community at all,\" she said. \nMs Ewin said all three \"young\" parties could agree and it would send a strong message to politicians. \nShe said the Young Greens did not have a formal position on the removal of pokies from casinos, but there was \"strong support\". \nYoung Labor has been contacted for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:40:07.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
