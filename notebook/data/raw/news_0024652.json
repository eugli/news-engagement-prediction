TNN | Feb 8, 2017, 08.43 AM IST NEW DELHI: Ahead of Bangladesh 's first Test match on Indian soil, we take a look at the top 10 stats to know for the two teams. 1. India have won six of their eight Test matches against Bangladesh, four by an innings and one by ten wickets. The two draws came in 2007 and 2015, matches which were both hit by inclement weather. 2. Bangladesh will become the ninth team to play a Test in India. The last time a team played Test cricket in the country for the first time was 1996, when South Africa toured. 3. At the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, venue for this one-off Test, R Ashwin has claimed 18 wickets at an average of 10.50 apiece in two Tests while Cheteshwar Pujara has scored 363 runs at a whopping 181.50, courtesy innings of 159 and 204. 4. Bangladesh have won just three of their 44 overseas Test matches - two in the West Indies in 2009 and one in Zimbabwe in 2013. 5. Sachin Tendulkar is the leading batsman in India v Bangladesh Test matches, with 820 runs in nine innings at an average of 136.66 and featuring five centuries. His highest Test score of 248* came against Bangladesh in 2004. 6. Zaheer Khan is the leading bowler in India v Bangladesh Test matches, having taken 31 wickets in seven matches at 24.25 apiece and a best of 7/87. 7. This will be Virat Kohli's 23rd Test as captain, moving him to ninth place in India's overall list of most Tests in charge. 8. Kohli's team is two wins away from leveling India's longest unbeaten run in home Tests - 20, achieved between 1977-1980. The current streak stands at 18. After the Bangladesh Test, India play four against Australia. 9. If India win, it will be the country's 95th Test victory at home. Only three teams have won more matches on home soil: Australia (234), England (207) and South Africa (96). 10. Shakib Al Hasan is one of only three players to ever score a century and take 10 wickets in the same Test. Ian Botham and Imran Khan are the others.
