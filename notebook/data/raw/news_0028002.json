Or Clyde? Maybe Hannibal - as in Lector? Or what about Ivan, forever tarnished by the Milat connection? \nWrong. The most common first name for criminals in Australia is … Leon. \nThat’s right, Leon. And if you’re a criminal called Leon you’re most likely to have committed an assault. \nWomen caught up with long arm of the law are most likely to be called Robin. \nLaw firm Go To Court collated the names from over 25,000 crimes found on the Australian CrimeNet database and then cross-referenced them with the most popular names in Australia in the last 90 years.

For every 100,000 Robins, 934 had committed a crime with fraud the biggest misdemeanour. \nSecond placed Kyms were mostly into burglary, Nicoles had dabbled in drugs. \nAnd you shouldn’t trust your aunty Jean. Around 300 in every 100,000 Jeans are a crim and they’re likely to be murderers. Watch out what she’s put in those scones. \nBut what of Bonnie, Clyde and Hannibal — how do they fare? Well, despite their namesakes nefarious pasts, the people who now carry their names are likely to be law abiding citizens. \nMost criminal male names ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:16:47.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
