It now has fantastic road, rail and and a new direct tram link into Manchester city centre . \nThe town enjoys a picturesque countryside location and boasts some of the best restaurants in the region. \nBut the best reason to start your property search here is price - the average cost of a home here is more than £40,000 cheaper than the Greater Manchester average. \nWe spoke to local experts to find out everything you need to know about one of the region’s most picturesque boroughs. Why Rochdale? Hollingworth Lake \nWell the real question is why not? \nRochdale is sometimes overlooked by couples looking to settle down because it lacks the glamour of more popular areas, like Trafford and Manchester. \nBut with increasing investment in both transport and leisure, local estate agents say that it’s a place on the up. \nIan Tweedley, from Barton and Kendal estate agents, said: “Rochdale is a great town with superb commuter links to Manchester, Leeds and beyond. Situated on the edge of the Pennines, you are never far away from wonderful countryside walks.” \nAs well as great transport links, Rochdale has a lot to offer anyone looking for something a bit different. \nBoasting everything from great homes, delicious restaurants and wonderful scenery, it could be the region’s best kept secret. Read More Where are the best places to live Bamford Way, Rochdale \nSimilar to Saddleworth, it’s more about the villages themselves rather than individual roads. \nIf you’ve got a bit of money to spend the Bamford, Norden and Smithy Bridge are ideal destinations. \nAs well as the impressive array of properties, St Michael’s Primary School in Bamford, which got the top mark in its last Ofsted inspection, is also a draw for parents. \nFurther out the hidden gems of Whitworth, Littleborough and Wardle, surrounded by stunning scenery and lush hills are the pick of the bunch. Rochdale Town Centre \nHowever, peace and quiet comes with a price, and this time it comes in the form of the dreaded morning commute. \nCloser to home, Rochdale town centre is set to be boosted by £100m of investment, with plans including a host of new shops and cafes as well as 100 new apartments. \nIt is also reported that both M&S and Next have signed up for spots in the heart of the redevelopment. \nSo, areas like Shawclough, which are perfect for families on a budget, could be set for house price rises in the future. \nMaybe it’s time to get in early? House prices? Woodstock St, Rochdale \nNow we get to the nitty gritty - just how much will it cost you? \nIt would definitely be unfair to say that cheap housing is the only reason to move to Rochdale but there is not doubt it is a major factor. \nThe average cost of a house in the region will set you back just £142,267, which is considerably cheaper than places like Trafford and Manchester. \nAnd it’s not just limited to smaller terraced properties, larger sums and detached properties are also on the more affordable scale.

Types of property available \nCity dwellers don’t panic. \nRochdale has something to suit all tastes, from older, stone-built cottages to modern five bedroom mansions, \nIan Tweedley said: “There is a variety of properties available from older houses to new builds. There are also some wonderful new developments including Greenbooth Village in Norden,” Littleborough Town Centre \nAnd with the added investment, there will be a number of apartments, if that’s more to your taste. \nThose feeling particularly experimental, can even buy their own ultra-modern ‘caterpillar house’, in Littleborough, for £1.15m. \nNow, if that doesn’t scream variety then nothing does. Read More Schools \nAfter price, schools are top of the list for an family upping sticks or couples settling down. \nFortunately, Rochdale has some excellent choices for both primary and secondary education. \nAs mentioned earlier, St Michael’s, in Bamford, and St Patrick’s RC Primary, on Foxholes Road, are both ‘Outstanding’ school, proving popular with parents. Hollingworth Academy \nWhittaker Moss is another excellent school, while St Vincent RC Primary is also popular. \nIan Tweedley commented: “Most of the Primary Schools are excellent and the Secondary Schools appear to be improving year on year.” \nOne such secondary is Hollingworth Academy, which was also in the inspectors’ good books, getting top marks. \nThere many other good schools in the area however, so parents won’t be short of options. Family Friendly \nIf you’ve lived close to Manchester it can be hard to take the plunge outside the M60 ring road. \nBut according to Ian Tweedley, you won’t have to sacrifice good food. \nHe said: “Well, both Nutters and The Crimble are renowned restaurants in the Norden and Bamford areas, but you are never far away from a good restaurant. Crimble Hall and The Peacock Room in Rochdale \n“The Norden Arms, The Elephant, The Baum, The Waterside, The Cedar Tree, La Mancha, The Wine Press to name a few.” \nDavid Attenborough wannabees are also in luck. According to residents, in the summer you can go to the Crimble and spot some of the local peacocks. \nAway from the region’s gastronomic excellence however, there is plenty of green space, rolling hills and parks to keep the family busy. \nDanielle Magiera, property valuer at Cowell-Norford estate agents, said: “There’s lots of parks for families and Healey Dell Nature Reserve as well, so it’s a great place for walking.” Hollingworth Lake \nFor those who prefer a gentle stroll rather than a hike then you could do worse than visiting the award-winning, Queens Park, in Heywood. \nIan Tweedley added: “If you want some great local football action, take a trip to Spotland – the football is great but the pies are even better.” What do they say? \nMatthew Bruch lives in Norden having moved over from Burnage, Manchester just over six years ago. \nThe father-of-one said: “What’s great about Rochdale is its semi-rural location. \n“One minute you can be in the midst of some beautiful countryside or you can easily be in Manchester city centre in 30 minutes. I think you get the best of both worlds. The River Roch and Rochdale Town Hall \n“The houses here are much more affordable than suburbs in Manchester and you certainly get value for your money. \n“My wife and I had thought about moving back to Manchester but we have decided to stay in Norden. \n“The primary schools here are excellent and at weekends there’s plenty of places to take our two year old to and there are some great restaurants in our doorstep.” Read More Transport Rochdale Metrolink \nOver the past few years, with the expansion of the Metrolink line transport links have been massively improved. \nCommuters working in either side of the Pennines can be in and out of Leeds or Manchester in around 35 minutes. \nAs mentioned above, the new investment in housing, retail and infrastructure will also see a new bus station built. But a regular train service takes just 17 minutes into Victoria and the tram extension which opened in 2013 is 50-minutes into Piccadilly. \nThe M62 is just a few minutes drive from the town centre, providing easy road access to Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds.
