In spite of all the issues thrown up by the court case brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, the pressure will be on to maintain the export trade, with potential for many future arguments over human rights. There are both external and internal reasons why this is so, starting with the impact of Donald Trump . \nBecause of Brexit, Theresa May is going to need Trump a lot more than he needs her, and this will almost certainly involve a continuing commitment to the US-led war against Islamic State, at a time when Trump plans to expand that war. For all the talk of isolationism there are clear signs of an increase in military adventurism. It is not just the appointment of senior ex-generals to head the Pentagon and department of homeland security and to the post of national security adviser: more significant still is the plan for a substantial increase in military spending, even if the US defence budget is already not far short of 45% of the world total. \nTrump is even prepared to increase the budget through deficit financing if necessary, and his recent visit to the Pentagon was a prelude to receiving new ideas for destroying Isis. One proposal is to deploy a reinforced brigade of more than 5,000 troops into Syria to aid the Kurds and other militias in the assault on the Isis HQ in Raqqa later in the year. \nAs the war expands, May will be put under heavy pressure to ensure Britain takes a larger role. For all Trump’s emphasis on making America great again, it is still essential to avoid war in the Middle East being seen purely as a US venture. As the UK gets sucked in, the pressure on the defence budget will rise, making it even more necessary to have a vibrant arms industry made more robust through exports. \nThe internal reasons have much more to do with the arms lobby and the famous revolving door. Of all the lobbies that assail parliamentarians, both government and opposition, the arms lobby is especially potent and pervasive. For giant companies such as BAE Systems (the world’s third largest after Lockheed Martin and Boeing), lobbying is a substantial transnational endeavour, with Britain just one part of a much wider target list. But for specialist UK-based companies, it is a more narrowly focused operation. \nIn addition to direct lobbying of MPs and their advisers, by trade unions as well as the companies, there is the assiduous funding of thinktanks and university research, as well as support for conferences. The process even extends to the sponsoring of the Royal British Legion by Lockheed and BAE, perhaps with unconscious irony. \nGo to any major industry conference, frequently in luxury venues in nice warm places, and the evidence of industry influence will be there. In the main lobby or the largest hall will be a huge board with the logos of all the sponsors – often 20 or more – all helping to meet the costs. Coffee breaks, lunch and tea may well be sponsored by named companies, with the drinks reception and conference dinner providing much-sought-after exposure. \nThen there is the revolving door. At its most obvious it involves offering directorships to senior military figures and politicians. Retired generals, air marshals, admirals, cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries are all sought for board positions, with consultancies for those at a slightly lower level. \nLess obvious is the seeking of military personnel and civil servants involved specifically in weapons development and procurement. Any such person within five years or so of retirement will be thinking of the size of the pension that awaits. The prospect of doubling it for a couple of days’ work a week is certainly attractive, and this means that pre-retirement “cooperation” with future employers is thoroughly tempting. \nBeyond all this lies the one great advantage for the whole industry: patriotism. Any criticism is met with cries of “Appeasement!”, and it is here that the current era contrasts so well with the 1990s. Back then, in the bleak days of the peace dividend, there was hardly an enemy in sight: but now we have terrorists, Russia and potentially even China. Happy days are certainly here again. \nPaul Rogers ( @ProfPRogers ) is professor of peace studies at Bradford University and international security consultant to the Oxford Research Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:31:41.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
