Beck has repeatedly criticized Trump as “immoral,” “depraved,” and “unhinged.” In August, he told his radio listeners that he believed Trump was “a dictator in the making,” TheBlaze reported.\nTrump, in response, has called Beck “irrelevant,” “wacko” and “a real nut job,” as reported by TheBlaze.\n“Have you seen him during the last year and a half truly feel for someone that couldn’t help him, truly connect on a human level?” Beck told Fox’s Charlie Rose . “A sociopath is somebody who doesn’t really see the human experience in anyone else, and I haven’t see that in him. I haven’t seen him deeply affected by the human condition in an individual.”\n \nA certain Facebook post of Beck’s drew a lot of fire from Republicans, accusing Beck of posturing and supporting Hillary Clinton. He clarified, saying “neither candidate has the values, decency or principles to be the leader of the free world.”\nBeck did say, however, that he would support the president, saying “we cannot have a failed presidency.” By voicing support of Trump’s pick, he seems to be holding true to his promise.\nTrump, for his part, offered a self-congratulatory assessment, saying this nomination process may be “the most transparent” in history before dozens of lawmakers and his senior aides gathered in the White House East Room.\n“Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president. I am a man of my word,” he said Tuesday, seconds before announcing Gorsuch’s nomination .\n  Obama’s Statement Supporting Protests Of Trump’s Executive Order Ticks Off MSNBC Host Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order New York Times Called Out For Forgetting ‘Biden Rule’ In ‘Temper Tantrum’ Over Gorsuch Nomination Gorsuch was one of 21 potential candidates for the Supreme Court vacancy included in the list Trump released early in his campaign. Trump had vowed at the time to nominate one of the 21 conservative individuals if elected president.\nThe Colorado Republican attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School, after which he clerked for D.C. Circuit Court judge David Sentelle. He then clerked for Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy in 1993–94.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated him to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.\nGorsuch, thus far, has been hotly contested by some Democrats and praised by most conservatives, who have called him a “brilliant jurist” who “writes with clarity, force, and verve.” \nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:17:47.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
