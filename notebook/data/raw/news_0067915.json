According to The Hollywood Reporter , Warner Bros. is currently developing a film that will follow the grown-up former sidekick of the Caped Crusader. The Lego Batman Movie director Chris McKay is currently attached to direct, though there’s no word yet on when the film might be released.\nNightwing is one of the most important characters in all of DC Comics Nightwing, otherwise known as Dick Grayson, was Batman’s first sidekick in DC Comics continuity, and he’s long been one of the core parts of the Batman mythos. After serving as Robin for 40 years, Grayson eventually retired from the role and took on the Nightwing persona, eventually going on to defend his own city in his own solo run. Fans consider Dick, with his sunny disposition and the understanding that he’s the natural heir to the Batman mantle, to be one of the most important characters in all of comics, even though he doesn’t enjoy the pop cultural stature that Bruce Wayne does.\nThat Warner Bros. is planning a film following Nightwing’s exploits comes as something of a surprise considering the tortured state of the DC Extended Universe. Ben Affleck’s The Batman only just found a director in Matt Reeves , and the DC slate is currently littered with critical failures and directors who’ve abandoned their projects. However, the success of The Lego Batman movie and the fact that Nightwing is fairly resistant to a grimdark tone might be a clear indication that the studio is moving in a lighter direction with proven directors. We’ll just have to wait and see if this effort works.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:46:53.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
