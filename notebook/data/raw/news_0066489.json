After Australia lost their first wicket, of David Warner, two new Australian batsmen came at the crease. \nFans as well as experts were left surprised when Shaun Marsh joined skipper Steve Smith at the crease after Australia's lost Warner's wicket in the 28th over of the innings. \nIt was soon realised that Matthew Renshaw, who was unbeaten on 36, immediately left the field after Warner's dismissal post the umpire's permission. The left hander was looking good during his stay at the crease, but went back to the dressing room due to a stomach bug. \nBefore being dismissed, Warner added an 82-run opening stand with his opener. \nAfter the two left-handers were back in the pavilion, skipper Smith batted sensibly with Shaun Marsh and added 37 runs for the second-wicket partnership before the latter was dismissed by Jayant Yadav. \nThe Australian batsman looked in total control of the proceedings on a pitch which looked tailor-made for the spinners. \nAt the end of 51 overs, Australians were 120/2 with Smith (23*) and Peter Handscomb (8) at crease.
