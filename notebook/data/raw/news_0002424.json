I imagine that each of us has our own price, including Lara. \n“So, when you combine all three, it seems lucrative. But people need to realise that there are three individuals involved,” he told Mega Hits , the entertainment pullout of Utusan Malaysia . \nAwal said what was more important was that the family would draw the best publicity for advertisers. \nLara has 2.5 million followers on Instagram while those on her Facebook page have reached the one million mark. \nThe toddler has captured the hearts of her fans with her daily antics, especially her “outfit of the day” posts, marked by the hashtag #raraootd (Rara’s Outfit of the Day) on Instagram. \nAt a tender age, Lara already has at least three major endorsements under her belt. \nNot to be outdone by their daughter, Scha has amassed 3.5 million Instagram followers while Awal has three million. \n> Kosmo! reported that a 54-year-old man was believed to have died from a heart attack during a raid by police on an illegal gambling den in Alor Setar. \nThe man was among seven others gambling at a shed in Kampung Titi Keling, Batu 3 1/2, Jalan Alor Setar-Tandop when police arrived. They fled the scene but the man was caught and suddenly collapsed. \nHe was taken to Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah but was dead on arrival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:31:27.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
