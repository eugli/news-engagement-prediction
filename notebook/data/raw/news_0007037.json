This is also the conclusion of the Senate’s committees on justice, and on public order and illegal drugs,” Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a statement. \nThe Senate has conducted hearings on alleged extrajudicial killings amid the government’s brutal war on illegal drugs. ADVERTISEMENT \nSen. Richard Gordon, chair of the Senate justice committee, has said that he found no proof to support allegations that the Duterte government sanctioned extrajudicial killings in his no-nonsense campaign crackdown on illegal drugs. \n“Their joint investigation of deaths during police anti-drug operations shows there is no state-sponsored policy of extrajudicial deaths and that there is relentless effort on the part of the PNP to carry out the campaign properly and within legal processes,” Abella said. \nAbella cited the success of the government’s drug war, saying some 1.1 million drug personalities have already surrendered as a result of the 43,593 anti-drug operations under the Oplan Double Barrel of the Philippine National Police (PNP). \n“The same operations have yielded 53,025 arrests and neutralized 2,555 drug personalities,” he said. \nAmid the success of the government’s drug war, the PNP has been tainted with allegations of corruption and police involvement in illegal drugs. \nAbella, however, assured that reforms in the police force would “rid the force of rogue cops.” \n“In line with this, he has directed the abolition of all anti-illegal drug units in the PNP for its zero tolerance policy against corruption within the organization,” he said.
