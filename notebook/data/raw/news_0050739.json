Burlington Central's Austin Macias, right, rallied for a 10-7 win in the Class 2A 126-pound state final on Saturday. (Brian O'Mahoney / The Courier-News) Steve Millar Elgin Courier-News Privacy Policy \nCHAMPAIGN — Burlington Central junior Austin Macias said he considered transferring to Montini, which several of his friends attend. \nOne thing, though, convinced him to stay with the Rockets: the opportunity to become the school's first state champion wrestler. \n\"I wanted to be that kid on the wall that everybody wanted to be,\" Macias said. \"That's the reason I stayed.\" \nMacias made his dream come true Saturday, rallying for a 10-7 win over returning champ Tyler Delaware of downstate Washington to capture the Class 2A 126-pound final at State Farm Center. \n\"Part of me wanted to (leave for Montini),\" Macias said. \"I'm a hometown kid, though. I've always lived in Burlington. I decided this is where I wanted to be and this is what I wanted to do to make my town proud.\" \nMacias (36-2) lost to Delaware (33-7) — who won the 2A 120-pound title last year — in the championship match of the Sterling Sectional. The rematch seemed to be headed in a similar direction when Delaware jumped out to a 5-1 lead. \nMacias, though, was still confident. \n\"I just felt like I couldn't lose,\" he said. \"When I was down, I didn't care. I knew he couldn't stop me on my feet. I started taking it to him. I was getting in on my shots. I was feeling it. I just knew it.\" \nMacias took control in the final period, sealing the win with a late takedown. \n\"I'm that kid that I wanted to be now,\" he said. \"I've got to be even better next year and get another title.\" \nMacias' teammate, Nick Termini (40-5), took home a medal with a sixth-place finish at 132. \nIn Class 3A, Huntley freshman David Ferrante finished fourth at 152. \nFerrante (29-4) advanced to the semifinals before being pinned by St. Rita's Austin O'Connor, who went on to become a four-time state champion. \nHe battled back to beat Montini's Matt Ortiz 8-4 in the semifinal wrestlebacks before a 4-2 overtime loss to Marmion's Brad Gross in the third-place match. \n\"After the match (against O'Connor), I had my mind set on coming back strong (Saturday),\" Ferrante said. \"It's been a great run. I'd like to thank my coaches, my family, my friends and my teammates for pushing me.\" \nIt's been a memorable year for Ferrante and Huntley, which will take on Wheeling in Tuesday's team sectional at Rockford East. \n\"The team has had a lot of firsts this year,\" Ferrante said. \"First Fox Valley championship, first regional championship, most state qualifiers. Just to be a part of that is really awesome, especially as a freshman.\" \nDundee-Crown senior Chase Raap came home from his first state meet with a medal, finishing sixth at 182. \nRaap (43-11) pulled off a dramatic 4-2 overtime win over Prospect's Alex Kozcwara in the quarterfinal wrestlebacks to clinch the medal. \n\"I'm definitely proud,\" he said. \"It was my goal just to make it to state, then I made it the goal to get a medal. This feels great.\" \nSteve Millar is a freelance writer for The Courier-News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:49:41.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
