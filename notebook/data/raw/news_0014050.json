Could   \nKatherine Jenkins has hit back at David Beckham ’s alleged claim that her OBE honour was a “f***ing joke”. \nIn leaked emails the dad of four fumed: “Katherine Jenkins OBE for what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F***ing joke.” \nRepresentatives of the Welsh singer have now provided Mirror Online with a “fact sheet” detailing why she received her honour in 2014. \n“We are not issuing a statement – just providing a fact sheet as to why Katherine Jenkins received an OBE in the 2014 New Year’s Honours List for services to music and charity in response to Beckham,\" a representative for the star said. Katherine Jenkins and husband Andrew Levitas (Photo: PA) David Beckham has done lots of work for charity (Photo: UNICEF) \nKatherine’s reps also addressed the claims she took cocaine. \n\"With regards to the taking of coke which Katherine has courageously publicly admitted with great honesty - this was when she was in her early 20s still a student – over a decade before she was awarded her OBE and started her recording career,” her rep said. \nThe statement lists “Katherine’s services to charity prior to being awarded an OBE”. \nThese include her visits to troops in active war zones including Iraq in 2005 and 2006, Afghanistan in 2007 and 2013, Cyprus in 2007 and 2009 and Kosovo in 2009. \nIn 2006 Katherine also became a trustee of the British Forces Foundation and is also a trustee of Care after Combat and an Ambassador of the 2016 Invictus Games.
