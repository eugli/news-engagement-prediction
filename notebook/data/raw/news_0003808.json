Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nWhoops! \nThe Boston Globe on Friday tweeted what they thought was a bombshell of sorts after recording Donald Trump answering “the press is ‘not behaving'” to a question asked after the president signed an executive order today on financial regulation reforms. Note — you can’t hear the actual question in the video: VIDEO: Trump remarks that the press is \"not behaving\" after signing executive order https://t.co/t39RfhgFLF pic.twitter.com/jFbULWm6kr \n— The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) February 3, 2017 \nAnd now for the correction, 3 hours later. The question was on Iran, not the the media, and it’s the Iranians who are “not behaving”: Correction: Trump remarks \"they're not behaving\" after press pool asks question on Iran https://t.co/7USNhGvdX2 \n— The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) February 3, 2017 Trending 'Get TF outta here'! Oof: No, CNN, that is NOT Faith Hill \nBut why the error and why the delay in the correction? There was plenty of coverage at the time of just what President Trump said: \"They're not behaving,\" said Pres Trump about Iran, when asked about new US sanctions targeting Iran missile program. \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 3, 2017 Trump on Iran: \"They're not behaving.\" pic.twitter.com/lBCysqmAwz \n— Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) February 3, 2017 \nAnd we’d also like to point out this is the Boston Globe’s pinned tweet right now: Real journalism matters, now more than ever. #PressOn #FactsMatter https://t.co/Yplg8yvVlU \n— The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) February 3, 2017 \n#FactsMatter, indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:23:17.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
