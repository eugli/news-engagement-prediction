The Nov. 24 home game against USF is set for Black Friday, which is when it was played in 2013 and 2014. The 2013 game at Bright House Networks Stadium was a sellout.\nDue to three non-conference home games and an early season conference game, UCF will play a total of four games on campus in September: FIU (Sept. 2), Memphis (Sept. 9), Georgia Tech (Sept. 16) and Maine (Sept. 30).\nDespite the front loading of home games, UCF will not be burdened with back-to-back weeks of road games. The Oct. 21 road game at Navy will be followed by a bye week which precedes the Nov. 4 game at SMU.\nThe Navy game has already been slotted for a 3:30 p.m. kickoff on CBS Sports Network. The USF game will air on ABC or an ESPN network at a time yet to be determined. Kickoff times and TV networks for the first three games will be announced during the summer.\nThe Sept. 9 home game against Memphis is Family Weekend, while UCF's homecoming is set for the week leading up to the Oct. 14 game against East Carolina.\n2017 UCF Football Schedule Date Opponent Sept. 2\nFIU\nSept. 9\nMemphis*\nSept. 16\nGeorgia Tech\nSept. 23\nat Maryland\nSept. 30\nMaine\nOct. 7\nat Cincinnati*\nOct. 14\nEast Carolina*\nOct. 21\nat Navy*\nOct. 28\nBYE\nNov. 4\nat SMU*\nNov. 11\nUConn*\nNov. 18\nat Temple*\nNov. 24`\nUSF*\n*American Athletic Conference game\nDates and times subject to change\nMore news and discussion in the Dungeon\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/gqo9sdr5by2a7omy1cb3)", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/gqo9sdr5by2a7omy1cb3"], "published": "2017-02-09T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T22:04:41.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
