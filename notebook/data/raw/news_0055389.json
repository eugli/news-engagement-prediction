(Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty) Share Tweet \nKanye West could probably make a cottage industry just out of being Kanye West and making announcements at this point, but in this case, he’s actually putting actions behind his words. TMZ reports the musician filed legal documents today regarding his plan to create a line of cosmetics under the label DONDA, which was the name of West’s mother, who died from surgery complications in 2007. Soon, you’ll be able to smell, condition, and paint your face all in service of making Yeezy wealthier, unless you just want to continue using the same products you do now. \nEven more exciting, however, is what we can look forward to from the DONDA brand, if West has his way.

Maybe we can just give him Earth 4 and call it a day. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:06:07.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
