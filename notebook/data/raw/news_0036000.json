Keith Quinn and Colfer's manager Rob Weisbach also exec produce alongside the actor. \nA network is not yet attached but the plan at the moment is to shop the project to broadcast, cable, premium and streaming services. \nFor Colfer, Indigo would mark his return to series regular television following his six-season run as Kurt Hummel on Fox's Ryan Murphy/Brad Falchuk/Ian Brennan phenomenon Glee . \nIn the years since Glee wrapped, Emmy-nominee Colfer — who also penned a season five episode of the Fox musical — has remained busy as an author. His New York Times best-selling children's series The Land of Stories has been translated into 20 languages. He also had his book Struck By Lightning adapted into a feature film which he wrote, starred in and produced. He previously had a deal with Disney Channel to adapt The Little Leftover Witch for the small screen. \nFor Sonar, meanwhile, the independent studio has multiple TV series in the works including season two of MTV's The Shannara Chronicles, AMC's Pierce Brosnan drama The Son, David E. Kelley's adaptation of Stephen King's Mr. Mercedes for the Audience Network; and also serves as a distributor on FX's Tom Hardy vehicle Taboo , among others. \nColfer is repped by ICM Partners, Rob Weisbach Creative Management and Myman Greenspan.
