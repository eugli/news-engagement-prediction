The way he discusses the script with the staff and expresses his opinions is very respectful and earnest, and he completely understands the screenwriter’s intentions.” \n“Everyone had a hard time shooting in the cold and pulling all-nighters, but Baro didn’t show any signs of how tired he was. Instead, he livened up the mood by always responding to the producer’s requests with a smile, no matter how difficult they were,” he continued. \n“Closed Eyes” is an action thriller web movie about a blind man (Baro) who attempts to dig up the truth behind a serial killing incident. It will premiere in March through various online platforms. \nMeanwhile, Baro made his acting debut through “Reply 1994” and appeared in dramas like “ Master: God of Noodles ,” Angry Mom ,” and “ God’s Gift – 14 Days .” \nAre you looking forward to Baro’s new movie?
