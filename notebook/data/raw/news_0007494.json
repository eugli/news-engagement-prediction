M. Berger , a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague and co-author of “ISIS: The State of Terror.” “Those fears may now be justified.” Erroll G. Southers , director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. From 2009 to 2016, according to figures from the Anti-Defamation League , these groups accounted for 84 percent of the extremist violence in which shots were exchanged with law enforcement. “Data should dictate policy,” Mr. Southers said. “If you ignore data, you ignore the real problem, which is that extremism comes from a diverse range of sources.” The federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations saying they stigmatize entire communities. In Minneapolis, some groups have participated in a program run by the local United States attorney to counter Islamic State propaganda efforts directed at Somalis. But other groups have criticized the government’s efforts, saying they are overwhelmingly focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities and pay little attention to the threats posed by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists. Faiza Patel , a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent Extremism Program would make a bad project worse. “It makes explicit what was already implied in C.V.E.,” she said. “Now all of that window dressing goes out the door.” Despite millions of dollars in government-sponsored research, there remains no consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist or how to identify such people before they attack. Clark R. McCauley Jr. , a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years, said that programs to counter extremism were already too focused on Islamic terrorism. “It’s not all that easy to get money to study right-wing stuff,” he said. “There’s a big oversupply of attention to Islamic extremism as it is.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Making that focus more explicit may not significantly change how the programs operate, he said. “But what it will mean for Muslims in the U.S., that’s going to be a problem, even if the machinery doesn’t change,” Professor McCauley said. “It means the country has decided to say, ‘You people are a special threat.’” Christian Picciolini, the founder of Life After Hate , a Chicago group devoted to countering right-wing extremism, said it would be dangerous to minimize white extremism, pointing to gunmen like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and Wade Michael Page, who killed six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012. “They are being radicalized by fake news and conspiracy theories,” he said of such attackers. “We are ignoring a massive domestic terrorism problem that already exists in our borders.” \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:09:36.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
