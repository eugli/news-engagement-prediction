As exciting as those news were, they came with one condition: All previous mythology established outside of the movies' continuity spread throughout comic books, board games and video games was no longer considered canon. \nThat included the beloved video game series, Knights of the Old Republic . [Credit: LucasArts/Bioware] \nFortunately for us, the people working on the new canon have been slowly reintroducing elements from the Legends storylines into the universe, such as (Grand Admiral Thrawn), and that includes Knights of the Old Republic . \nAftermath: Empire's End - the third installment in the Aftermath trilogy of books, focused on the time period between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens - was just released. \nNot only does it close the acclaimed storyline by telling us what happened in the infamous battle of Jakku, it also contains a Knights of the Old Republic shoutout. \nThe novel features a reprogrammed battle droid named Mr. Bones, owned by Snap Wexley (played by Greg Grunberg in The Force Awakens ].

Oh, how I hate that term.\" \nSee Also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:17.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
