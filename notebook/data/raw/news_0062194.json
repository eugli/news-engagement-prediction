Most of these imports comes from the southeast US, where there are growing concerns about the trade.\n\"This report confirms once again that cutting down trees and burning them as wood pellets in power plants is a disaster for climate policy, not a solution,\" said David Carr, General Counsel of the Southern Environmental Law Centre in the US.\n\"Forests in our region, the southeast US, are being clear cut to provide wood pellets for UK power plants. The process takes the carbon stored in the forest and puts it directly into the atmosphere via the smokestack at a time when carbon pollution reductions are sorely needed.\"\nWithin Europe the push for pellets is also providing incentives for the forest industry to plant more and harvest more trees. Environmentalists are worried that the system is creating a cycle that can't keep up with itself.\n\"If you keep increasing your harvest over a period of time you will never be able to recoup your emissions from burning that growth, you will never catch up with yourself,\" said Linde Zuidema from Fern.\n\"They are shooting themselves in the foot, they are not taking into account that increased harvesting of trees will actually have an impact on the role that forests play as a carbon sink.\"\nThe new study also highlights concerns over the use of BECCS - bio-energy with carbon capture and storage .\nScientists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have suggested that this system could be used to suck carbon from the atmosphere to keep the world from dangerous levels of warming.\n\"It's really worrying,\" said Duncan Brack.\n\"The number of scenarios that the IPCC reviewed that rely on BECCS for ambitious climate change targets, it's crazy, I'm not the only person who's said that.\"\nConcern is growing about the continued use of wooden pellets and chips for electric power. The EU has proposed a new system for biomass under its revised Renewable Energy Directive .\nDuncan Brack says it's a good opportunity to review the current methods of giving subsidies for the use of wood energy across Europe. The use of saw mill waste should be encouraged - but the burning of pellets should be curtailed.\n\"The simplest way is to limit support to those type of biomass that really represent genuine carbon savings, primarily sawmill waste and post-consumer wood waste,\" said Duncan Brack.\n\"I would rather see support for forest industry, not forest energy.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook .\nView comments", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/BBCMattMcGrath/", "https://www.ipcc.ch/", "https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/1_en_act_part1_v7_1.pdf", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26994746", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13AEC/production/_94802608_gettyimages-159978824.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17BC4/production/_94802279_gettyimages-510831798.jpg", "https://twitter.com/MattMcGrathBBC", "https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2017-02-23-woody-biomass-global-climate-brack-embargoed.pdf", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12DA4/production/_94802277_mediaitem94802276.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:21:51.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
