However, the French side are now guided by Spaniard Emery, who knows Barca very well from his days of coaching Valencia (2008-12) and Sevilla (2013-2016). \n\"Knowing Unai, I know he will try to make our life complicated,\" said Luis Enrique. \n\"He knows us perfectly, he knows exactly what we have to offer. \n\"Our goal will be to keep the ball and create space because they will be taking risks,\" he added. \n\"They are now more thorough than they used to be and they are more structured, and they also have great forwards\". \nWhile Barca can count on their magic trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, PSG will rely on Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani, who is in the form of his life having scored 25 league goals this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:07:04.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
