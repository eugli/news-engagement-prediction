It was last rereleased here six years ago for its 35th anniversary and five years before that for the 30th. \nIt has become a critical tradition to muse on how much has changed in New York since Travis Bickle, unforgettably played by the livewire Robert De Niro , roamed the night-time streets in his checker cab. He’s the insomniac ex-marine, traumatised by Vietnam, so hardened he doesn’t mind going to scary rough places such as … Brooklyn. Rejected by beautiful political aide Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) after a catastrophic date at one of the ubiquitous porn theatres, Travis becomes ambiguously obsessed with child prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), abused by her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). The violent pressure inside his skull is made worse by listening to the psychotic fantasies of a creepy passenger, a cameo from Scorsese himself. Chekhov said that a gun introduced in act one goes off in act two: as for a suitcase full of guns bought in a scuzzy hotel room from a guy called Easy Andy … uh oh. \nIn the cleaner, brighter, shinier New York of 2017, it is as if the cleansing process that Bickle brooded about (“Some day a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets”) has actually happened. I have in the past offered my theory that Schrader was inspired by Gerald Kersh’s 1938 novel Night and the City, the basis of the 1950 London noir by Jules Dassin , in which “the heavy rain shot down at an angle, as if it meant once and for all to wash away all the vermin that swam over the feverish face of this dreary and interminable City”. Now the historical process is complete. The New York of Taxi Driver is as firmly of the past as the one in Sweet Smell of Success . Robert De Niro: 'Every day for 40 years someone has said: You talkin' to me?' Read more \nAs ever with this movie, no matter how many times you watch it, the horror, the almost physical smear of sleaze across your skin strikes you afresh, along with the N-bombs and the misogyny – read politically now in a way they weren’t in 1976. And the blitzkrieg horror of the penultimate scene tends to expunge from your memory the actual last scene, which seals the film with a layer of irony. Watching it again now, what strikes me is that ending’s anti-Chinatown quality. What looked like an irredeemable squalid mess from which nothing can conceivably be salvaged, nothing straightened out, is a hellhole from which Travis returns in Gladstonian triumph. \nYou can also find yourself forgetting about the fascinating daylit scenes in the political office where Albert Brooks gives a great, overlooked performance as the nervy and nerdy researcher Tom, failing to get to first base with Betsy. (Disturbingly, Scorsese’s passenger is hanging around outside there, too.) They are working for Senator Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) a candidate in the presidential primaries – party unspecified – who is at risk of assassination Like Robert Altman’s Nashville , Taxi Driver had a dark political significance in that bicentennial year of 1976. Palatine’s slogan is “We are the people.” It was only on this viewing that I noticed the posters for his opponent: Goodwin, whose slogan is the familiar-sounding “A Return To Greatness”. \nThe visual mastery of Taxi Driver is still gripping, particularly the fixed camera shots on the side of the cab, and the vérité scenes in the real mean streets themselves. De Niro’s two dialogue scenes with Foster and Shepherd are superb. Go see.
