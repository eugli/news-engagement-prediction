Congress has even filed a complaint against Modi with the Election Commission (EC). \n\nSlamming the opposition parties, Modi said the successive governments failed to develop the region even after 70 years of independence. \n\n\"If you want to develop the Bundlekhand region in just five years which could not happen in last 70 years, you need to have a BJP government in the state,\" Modi told voters. \n\n\"Bundlekhand has got everything but unfortunately you elected such govts that those CMS, ministers, govts, MLAs destroyed you. SP ,BSP, Congress all these are faces of the same coin,\" the PM said. \n\nAttacking BSP, he said that the party has now become just \"Behenji\" from \"Bahujan\". Modi also accused BSP for amassing ill-gotten wealth which the party, he said, had deposited after demonetisation schme was announced last November. \n\nBSP is now Behenji Sampatti Party . Can those keen on filling their own coffers solve your problems, asked PM. \n\nModi said both BSP and SP came together against the demonetisation scheme though they usually oppose each other on most topics. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:50:46.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
