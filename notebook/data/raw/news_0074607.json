External Link: Biopixel video shows bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef \nThe sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef were the hottest on record during February, March and April last year — a degree or more above the long-term monthly averages. \nThe resulting coral die-off was the largest ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef, with about two-thirds of corals dying in the 700 kilometres north of Port Douglas in far north Queensland. So widespread bleaching could happen every year? \nIf emissions are not cut significantly and quickly, then temperatures like March 2016 are likely to become very common by the 2030s and 2040s, according to Dr Andrew King, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne who led the research. \nIn 2030, there would be a 70 per cent chance of getting temperatures similar to March 2016. \nIn 2050, that chance would be 97 per cent — and it only goes up from there. \n\"Beyond that [the 2016 temperatures] become much cooler than average, to the point that by the late 21st century an event like 2016 would actually be remarkably cold,\" Dr King said. External Link: March 2016 temperatures will occur every other year by 2024 if emissions are not reduced \nWhile coral can recover from bleaching, the most conservative estimates said once in every five years was the most they can tolerate, while it was more widely accepted that most recoveries took 10 to 30 years. \nFor the research, Dr King ran over a dozen climate models under a low-emissions scenario and a high-emissions scenario to find the chances of getting temperatures similar to or hotter than those experienced last March. \nDr King said the high-emissions scenario was what would occur if emissions were not cut significantly and quickly from their current state. What's the best-case scenario? \nUnfortunately, it is not terribly encouraging either. \nEven under a reduced-emissions scenario the same high water temperatures that caused last year's bleaching would occur as often as every second year. \n\"The event that we saw in March 2016 is roughly the kind of event that we'd expect every four years from now on in the next few years, becoming more frequent after that,\" Dr King said. \n\"By the 2030s it would be once every two years.\" External Link: Reducing emissions doesn't stop the rise in temperatures in the Coral Sea, but it does slow the increase \nWhat is important to note is that this low-emissions scenario — officially called RCP 2.6 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — is at the higher end of what the Paris Agreement is aiming for, about 2 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels. \nBut Dr King said even this is \"probably unduly optimistic\". \n\"We're not reducing our greenhouse gas emissions at the moment anywhere near that scenario,\" Dr King said. \n\"We'd have to see a very quick turnaround, really strong action in the next decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions very rapidly and very substantially in order to get anywhere near that.\" Can the reef be saved?
