Governor should break silence and address media personnel about current political scenario in TN. Based on the test of majority in the floor of assembly CM should be elected. All MLAs should share their views freely over current situation without coercion.\" 11.50 a.m. \n\nSchool Education Minister Ma Foi Pandiarajan has extended support to O. Panneerselvam. He had been in the Sasikala camp and had criticised Mr. Panneerselvam earlier for his rebellion.
