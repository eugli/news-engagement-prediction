It's expected to open in late 2018. (Florida Hospital and Winter park Health Foundation) Naseem S. Miller is getting an 80,000-square-foot facility that’s more than just a fitness center, officials announced on Wednesday.\nThe Center for Health & Wellbeing, expected to open late next year, will provide wellness, fitness and medical services. It’s the result of a partnership between Florida Hospital and Winter Park Health Foundation. The fitness center is operated by Central Florida YMCA. \n“Every part of the facility, from top to bottom, is designed to help people become and stay healthy,” said Patty Maddox, president and CEO of the Winter Park Health Foundation, in a news release. \nMaddox said that with more than 30,000 seniors living within five miles of the new center, the facility “will give them a ‘one-stop shop’.” \nThe new building replaces the 27-year-old Crosby YMCA on Mizell Avenue near Winter Park Memorial Hospital, which was torn down in late 2015. \nBack then, officials estimated that the project would be finished by end of 2017 , but the opening date is pushed back a year. The previously-estimated cost of the project was $35 million to $40 million, paid for mostly by the foundation. \nThe Center for Health & Wellbeing will feature educational classes, an indoor farmers’ market and programs like cooking demonstrations; two pools, one of which is designed for warm-water therapy and aquatic exercises; and a 15,000-square-foot clinical space, staffed by Florida Hospital specialists and programs like Florida Hospital Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation. \nThe City of Winter Park has dedicated a new road — the Crosby Way — which leads into the facility. \nFor more information, visit wphf.org/chwb .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:08:32.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
