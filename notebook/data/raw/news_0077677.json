Bey and Jay Z made their grand entrance just as Cynthia Erivo, Corbin Bleu, and Chris Jackson were finishing up a three-song set from the studio's film adaptation of the musical In the Heights .

So Weinstein Company boss Harvey Weinstein requested the first five minutes of the performance be repeated just for the pair. \nWhile the trio belted out musical numbers, the couple jived in their seats and gave a standing ovation when the performance was finished. A post shared by marcmalkin (@marcmalkin) on Feb 25, 2017 at 11:05pm PST \nBeyonce and her recently revealed baby bump with twins looked radiant in body-hugging green gown and jeweled bracelets. Jay Z dressed in all black with a blinding diamond ring on his left hand. \nThe A-list couple noshed on desserts, including a vanilla caramel budino and chocolate cake while sipping champagne — just water for Beyonce. The Carters were also spotted holding hands, with Jay Z rubbing his wife's back.

Cynthia was seen shaking hands with the \"Formation\" singer while designers Zac Posen and Georgina Chapman also chatted up the star. \nOther attendees included Lion stars Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel, and Sunny Paware, as well as Glee actor Matthew Morrison and shoe designer Christian Louboutin.

A post shared by Norah Lawlor (@lawlormedia) on Feb 26, 2017 at 12:41am PST \nBeyonce and Jay Z stayed at the party for roughly 25 minutes before leaving through a doorway next to the stage. No word yet on if Bey locked eyes with Rachel. But maybe it's good for the designer that the singer left early. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint 's Beyonce coverage below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:26:40.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
