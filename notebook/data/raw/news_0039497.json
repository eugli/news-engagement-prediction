While EastEnders are confirming nothing following the dramatic exit of Babe from the show, it seems that Annette Badland is certainly not ruling out the idea. \nSpeaking to Inside Soap , she warned: ‘She’s cursed the Carters, and you don’t cross Aunt Babe and get away with it! Could Max and Aunt Babe join forces? Oooh, yes! Although then we would be vying for supremacy, wouldn’t we? ‘I suppose Babe would have to let him lead, and then she could get up to things on the sidelines. She would only let Max think he was in charge!’ The star recently spoke to us at Metro.co.uk and hinted that fans haven’t seen the last of Aunt Babe. When asked if she would want to revisit the character, she enthused: ‘Oh, yes, yes, yes! A thousand times, yes! The door is open, she is vengeful, she curses them, says she’ll be back – and I think she will.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:44:56.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
