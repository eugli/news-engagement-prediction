On Tuesday, Kendall tweeted a GIF of the new shoe — a $125 Kylie + Kendall chainmail Shiloh platform slide sold at Nordstrom — and fans quickly noted the similarities between the shoe and a $995 version made by Chanel . “Did you guys just see the Chanel slides and decide to copy it?” wrote one person on Twitter. “Kendall Kylie collection knocked off the Chanel slides LOL,” wrote another.\nhttps://t.co/LTeHeAp2kq @KendallandKylie pic.twitter.com/w0RFBjEohO \n— Kendall (@KendallJenner) February 21, 2017 \n\n\nA representative from Chanel declined Yahoo Style’s request for comment, however, the iconic brand has always maintained a relationship with the Jenner sisters. In January, Chanel’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld hand selected Kendall to walk in the label’s Spring/Summer 2017 Couture show during Paris Fashion Week. And in mid-February, the model appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon wearing a classic tweed Chanel skirt and blazer. In 2016, Kylie also made headlines wearing mom Kris Jenner’s vintage Chanel bathing suit and Instagrammed a shot of herself rocking a Chanel catsuit .\nLeft: Kylie and Kendall’s shoe (Photo: Kendall + Kylie). Right: Chanel’s shoe (Photo: Chanel) More Kendall and Kylie have been accused of imitation  in the past. In 2015, the sisters and Pacific Sun, which collaborated on a clothing line, were sued for allegedly copying retailer Island Company’s trademarked logo, “Quit your job. Buy a ticket. Get a tan. Fall in love. Never return.” In contrast, Kendall and Kylie’s Pacific Sun T-shirt read, “Run away. Fall in love. Never return,” which Island Company said was “confusingly similar.”\nRelated:  \nThe Weirdest Places Kardashians Have Worn Sexy Clothing \nEven Kylie Jenner Had to Stand at Alexander Wang’s Show \nLet’s keep in touch!
