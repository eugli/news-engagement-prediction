Trump has released a bizarre \"media accountability survey\" to try & get poll results he likes.

What a joke. That isn't a survey it's political propaganda. Trump is seriously & dangerously deranged — Plural_prints (@PluralPrints) February 17, 2017 \n“Do you believe that the media unfairly reported on President Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting people entering our country from nations compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?” and “Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump's temporary restriction executive order?”, were among the more specific questions in the survey. \nUsers were also asked if they believed that political correctness was the cause of the biased news coverage with regards to illegal immigration and radical Islamic terrorism. Note the last Q in the Donald Trump \"media accountability\" survey - This was sent to supporters. pic.twitter.com/NKacQWYJIG — Jackson Proskow (@JProskowGlobal) February 16, 2017 \nRespondents were asked to comment on Trump’s “media strategy” to cut through the “media’s noise” and deliver the message to the people and on his decision to “break with tradition by giving lesser known reporters and bloggers the chance to ask the White House Press Secretary questions?” \nThe bizarre survey received a lot of attention online, with many choosing to essentially troll the president by filling out the survey with their opinions and comments. \nOthers appeared confused by the wording of the questions. answering the dumb trump media survey & honestly not even sure how to parse this sentence to give a yes/no answer pic.twitter.com/i23WwAb93p — Josh Fruhlinger (@jfruh) February 16, 2017 Trump has released a bizarre \"media accountability survey\" to try & get poll results he likes.
