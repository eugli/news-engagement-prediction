The groups that are coming, there’s men, there’s women, there’s married couples, there’s families,” Major Rob Kerr, with the Salvation Army said. \nRELATED: More asylum seekers make the trek from the US in to Manitoba Saturday morning \nThe new arrivals are divided between men, women and families at the Booth Centre. Right now almost every room in the men’s area of the building is filled with two people. \n“We are looking at what resources we have to make it more manageable, how we can make this work going forward because we’re quite certain there’s more people coming,” Kerr said. \nA lounge area is available for the newly arrived asylum seekers to relax. Shelden Rogers/Global News \nOn average, the hearing process to receive refugee status can last around three months. \nAbdulrahman Mohamed illegally crossed the border in Emerson last Sunday. He is originally from Kenya and is staying at the Salvation Army until his hearing in April. \n“For me, I just want to live, how hard is that? It’s a simple thing,” Mohamed said. \nWith nothing but the backpack he carried across a frozen field a week ago, Mohamed said he is thankful for the Salvation Army. As he waits for his hearing, he said he is using his time to bring his story to light, hoping it will make a difference. \n“I wish that someone could follow us, through the hassle, through the travel that we went through to get here, I believe we would get residency as soon as we apply for asylum,” Mohamed said. \nTown officials in Emerson confirmed Sunday morning that another group of asylum seekers crossed the border illegally overnight. \nRELATED: Town officials say another group of asylum seekers crossed in to Emerson, Manitoba Sunday \nThe Salvation Army said they will be looking at all of their options to try and welcome as many people as possible. \n“We are going to do everything we can to make sure we have a place for them, and anyone who is coming to the Salvation Army,” Kerr said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
