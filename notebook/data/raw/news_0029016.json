The co-hosts weigh in. pic.twitter.com/U9r96Md5EK \n— The View (@TheView) February 15, 2017 \nOn The View today, the panelists took on — what else? — all the commotion about Donald Trump ‘s campaign being tied to Russia. \nTrump himself has already passed the blame for the story to intelligence agencies. Jedediah Bila , too, noted that it is a little concerning that unelected bureaucrats within intelligence agencies can leak information they think should be out there “at will.” Still, she said, that did not undermine the importance of the content of the Russia-related leaks. \nWhoopi Goldberg jumped in to say, “The leak is not the issue. They’re on the phone with Russia .” \n“And that is the issue,” interjected Sunny Hostin . “It’s almost like a thief blaming the surveillance video for the crime. Isn’t that what it’s like? You steal something and get caught on surveillance and you go, ‘It’s that damn surveillance video.’ That’s what the Trump administration is doing to all of us.” \nWatch the whole thing above. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
