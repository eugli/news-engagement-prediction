Many of us are the sons and daughters of immigrants, if not immigrants ourselves. We strongly believe that the best of Harmonix flows from a diverse set of perspective held by talented individuals spanning many ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, cultures, and religious beliefs. The strength and wisdom derived from diversity and inclusiveness have made us who we are. We stand together in opposition to the President’s immigration bans and anything which runs contrary to our core values. \n\nOur Take A number of game makers have taken the move to publicly oppose this particular executive action. Harmonix takes a risk in taking a stance on political issues, as they may alienate some portion of their player population. On the other hand, other players may appreciate that Harmonix is willing to make a statement on the subject. Either way, it’s clear that Harmonix feels strongly about the issue of recent immigration actions, and is willing to take the heat that might come from sharing its collective stance as a developer. \nEmail the author , or follow on Twitter , and Game Informer .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:59:14.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
