He can take it:John showed he could definitely take the joke, even poking fun at himself for being a few years old than his wife, earning him a reply from The Hollywood Reporter staff writer Ryan Parker Did she see it? An earlier tweet was posted by a woman who goes by the username @sowahblanket, that made a more direct comparison between the two; the couple are seen here at the Grammys in Los Angeles on February 12 Emily said it first: 'John Legend look like Arthur lowkey,' Emily Sowah wrote with side-by-side images of Legend and the animated animal An earlier tweet was posted on Sunday by a woman who goes by the username @sowahblanket, that made a more direct comparison between the two famous faces. 'John Legend look like Arthur lowkey,' Emily Sowah wrote with side-by-side images of Legend and the animated animal. But it was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover model's joke that got the attention of her many followers, including several verified celebrities, who weighed in on the striking similarity between the cartoon and Legend. Buzzfeed's Ellie Sunakawa was inspired to create her own version of the tweet, adding an edited photo of Legend in a yellow jacket and the fist from Teigen's post placed where his actual hand would be. A writer for Fox Sports by the name of Obamaye West saw the update, and applauded her efforts as he tweeted 'flawless execution' in reply to them both. Sunakawa got in a few last words there, thanking the self-proclaimed digital bridge builder and adding, 'He has the same jacket, I couldn't help myself!!' Getting attention: But it was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover model's joke that got the attention of her many followers, including several verified celebrities, who weighed in on the striking similarity between the cartoon and Legend 'Flawless execution': A writer for Fox Sports by the name of Obamaye West saw the update, and applauded her efforts as he tweeted 'flawless execution' in reply to them both Other social media users also joined in on the fun, making their own memes of Legend as the eight-year-old animated catalyst for children to learn life lessons about interacting with others. Notable mentions included the singer in a yellow turtleneck with an Arthur mask layered on top of his face and an actual image of the cartoon character, this time with the Grammy winner's face where the drawn version would normally be. Author Jonathan Sun created his own meme as well, creating a collage by using an actual photo of Legend and zooming in twice on his hand, which looked remarkably like Arthur's in the black and white image. Fun for all: Other social media users also joined in on the fun, making their own memes of Legend as the eight-year-old animated catalyst for children So real!

'LOL. So stop telling him that,' he wrote. 'He's your HUSBAND, for God's sake. Let the man LIVE. (we know you're right tho).' Digital media reporter Sami Main was totally there for all of it, though. 'Yâ€™all @chrissyteigen is better than any of us on Twitter,' she wrote. 'ANY AND ALL OF US.'
