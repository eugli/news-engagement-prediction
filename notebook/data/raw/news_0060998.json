which will be called BBC Scotland - are:\nA \"prominent\" slot on the Electronic Programme Guide Broadcast from 7pm to midnight every evening A £30m budget for the new channel - £19m new money and £11m from current BBC2 opts Integrated hour-long news programme at 9pm, edited and presented from Scotland 80 new posts for journalists Lord Hall described it as the biggest single investment in broadcast content in Scotland for more than 20 years.\nScotland should receive about £40m in new funding annually - £19m for the new channel and digital developments, and £20m for making network programmes.\nIt is hoped that spending on network programmes made in Scotland for a UK-wide BBC audience will rise from about £65m this year to closer to £90m over the next three years.\nThe new BBC TV channel for Scotland will broadcast every evening and will show drama, factual, comedy and news programmes made in Scotland.\nThe development of a nightly news hour at 9pm means that the news output on BBC One in Scotland will remain in its current form.\nThere had been calls for a Scottish Six, which would integrate the main BBC News at Six from London and Reporting Scotland in a news hour that would provide UK, Scottish and international stories from Scotland.\nThe proposals for a Scottish Six were in response to criticism that the Six O'Clock News often featured stories - for example on education and health - that had little relevance to Scottish audiences.\nTony Hall said: \"It's a channel that will be bold, creative and ambitious.\" The Scottish government argued the BBC needed to \"catch up\" with devolution and to give its Scottish operation greater control of budgets, staffing and decision making.\nHowever, the BBC said the BBC News at Six had performed strongly in Scotland in recent years.\nIt said the 9pm news slot on the new channel offered the audience choice and quality and would provide comprehensive reporting of the news from a Scottish perspective.\nBBC director-general Tony Hall said: \"We know that viewers in Scotland love BBC television but we also know that they want us to better reflect their lives and better reflect modern Scotland.\n\"The best way of achieving this is a dedicated channel for Scotland.\n\"It's a channel that will be bold, creative and ambitious, with a brand-new Scotland-edited international news programme at its heart.\"\nSubject to approval Lord Hall said Scotland already made network programmes such as Shetland, Two Doors Down and Still Game but it needed to make more.\nHe said the additional £20m for making UK-wide programmes would be a \"huge boost for BBC Scotland and for the creative industries in Scotland\".\nThe director-general also announced £1.2m for Gaelic channel BBC Alba, taking its budget to £20m.\nThe proposals will be subject to approval by the BBC's new unitary board and possibly by Ofcom.\nThe announcement on Scottish funding followed the BBC saying an extra £8.5m a year would be spent on programmes made in Wales .\nPlans for Northern Ireland will be announced shortly.\nReporting Scotland presents Scottish news after the main Six O'Clock News from London When she took over as BBC Scotland's new director in December, Donalda MacKinnon pledged to spend more licence fee funds raised north of the border on programming produced in Scotland.\nIn 2015/16, 55% of licence fee funds raised in Scotland was spent on local and Scottish network content.\nThe BBC's 2015/16 accounts showed £320m was raised from the licence fee in Scotland. Of that, £176.5m was spent on local content and Scottish-made BBC network output.\nThis was a sharp decline from the £203m spend the previous year, which was 63% of the £323m collected. The funds not spent locally go towards BBC programmes developed elsewhere and aired across the UK.\nIn comparison, 95% of licence fee funds raised in Wales in 2015/16 were spent in Wales - including on network-wide programmes like Doctor Who, Sherlock, Casualty and Crimewatch - with the figure for Northern Ireland standing at 74%.\nView comments", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6805/production/_94792662_bbcscotland.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39040455", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11DF4/production/_88440237_rep_scot_jackie.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38266253", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1758D/production/_94792659_bbcbudget_new.gif", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0BDF/production/_94793030_tony_hall_iv.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:33:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
