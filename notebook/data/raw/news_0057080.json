Didn't expect downtown #Kamloops to empty out like this, sweet buildings like Stuart Wood & Kam News shuttered pic.twitter.com/McfUkiHFKe\n— @KamloopsArchaeo The Kamloops Daily News building has sat empty even longer, since January 2014, and though there have been rumours and discussions about what to do with the large space, nothing has been confirmed.\nKamloops' only daily newspaper closing after 80 years \"We just see more and more businesses not choosing to relocate in downtown Kamloops,\" said Erwin's Bakery co-owner Shawn Haley.\nErwin's Bakery was a popular spot in downtown Kamloops but decided to leave the core for an industrial area. (Courtney Dickson/CBC)\nOn the other hand, a new bike store opened up on Victoria Street. on Feb. 14, but is that enough to keep the Interior city's downtown alive?\nThe Kamloops Central Business Improvement Association (KCBIA) says yes.\n\"Our [property] assessments have risen significantly downtown.
