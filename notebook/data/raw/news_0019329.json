Just five days later, the three-star defensive end from Grandview (MO) was back on campus to tell head coach David Beaty he wants to be a Jayhawk too.\n\"It feels great,\" Crook-Jones said of committing to KU. \"Knowing I can get the burden off my chest of having the pressure of not knowing. That feeling of not knowing where you are going to be at. It just feels like home.\"\nThe 6-foot-4, 230-pound edge rusher brought an early end to his recruitment, choosing the Jayhawks over an offer from Iowa State. He also was drawing interest from Arkansas, Kansas State, and Missouri.\n\"The coaching staff,\" he said, crediting Beaty and his associates with making Lawrence feel like home. \"Really, talking to everybody about it. Everybody that’s close to the campus is like 'You coming to KU, it’s going to change it around. We can use people like you.'\"\n\"Basically everybody that has to do with KU, even the fans,\" Crook-Jones continued. \"They all just basically telling me 'We would love to have you down here, Rock Chalk.' Just making me feel at home.\"\nThe three-star DE has built a strong connection with coach Todd Bradford and the staff. Crook-Jones has seen Daniel Wise and Dorance Armstrong earn All-Big 12 honors at KU.\nAfter leaving campus on Saturday, the Bulldogs DE knew a return trip would have to happen soon. Not to confirm in his mind he was ready to be a Jayhawk, but to ensure his mother's blessing by letting her meet with Beaty herself.\n\"It was very important,\" the Grandview standout said of AiKeisha Crook's role in his decision. \"Because, really, I wouldn’t have committed if it wasn’t for my mom’s final say.\"\n\"My mom’s been doing this for 17-years. She’s given me everything I could ever ask for. I can’t even put it in words. She helped me a lot. I would just like to tell her that I love her, and thank you, for everything.\"\nCrook-Jones said the Jayhawks will use him at his natural position on the defensive line to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. And the coaching staff has said he had the potential to see the field early in his college career.\n\"They plan on using me as a defensive end, how I play it now,\" he said of his role at KU. \"Just being a pass-rusher, being an athlete.\"\n\"I’m going to be real explosive,\" Crook-Jones said of his game. I’m a big, fast, strong, athletic kid. They feel like, if I put on some muscle weight, get bigger and stronger, I’ll probably be one of them freshman kids that come in and play a little.\"\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/td86nmqlw6rzahw9moss)", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/td86nmqlw6rzahw9moss"], "published": "2017-02-10T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:06:29.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
