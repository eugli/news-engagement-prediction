I have a right to buy anything I want. I could even buy a lorry or a plane, this is none of their business,\" he told The Star Online. \nKhairuddin also chided the \"socialist group who liked to pick on the matter.\" \n\"I bought the car using legitimate sources, as long as I can still afford it,\" he said. \nThe social media was abuzz recently when a Facebook user, that goes by the name Datin Norhayati Abd Malek, believed to be Khairuddin's wife, posted a photo of a brand new Audi Q7, saying that it was a \"gift\" from her husband. \nAnother posting on her Facebook showed Khairuddin and their children walking on a beach in which she said she is the wife of \"YB Kuala Nerus\". \nKhairuddin and Norhayati are known to operate a business selling beauty products.
