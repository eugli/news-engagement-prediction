The parents were simple, good, decent people who could not comprehend why they were being treated the way they were by the church. \n“They couldn’t understand why this man had been shifted from one place to another, to another. I had no answers.” \nDoyle is one of many experts called this week to give insights into the church and the causes of the crisis to the royal commission into institutional response to child sexual abuse . \nThe royal commission is in its final three weeks of examining the Catholic church and, on Monday, heard damning statistics showing that 7% of priests abused children between 1950 and 2010. \nIn one Catholic order, St John of God Brothers, 40% of clergy were alleged perpetrators, while one in five Marist and Christian brothers were the subject of allegations. \nDoyle said the church’s approach to the issue still failed to comprehend the damage done to survivors and those around them. \n“One of the massive holes in the Roman Catholic church’s approach to this issue, still today, is a failure to completely comprehend the depth of the spiritual damage that is done to the victims, to their families, especially their parents, to their friends and to the community itself,” Doyle said. \nDoyle said the church did not want to understand just how profound the impact of abuse was on survivors. \n“Because if we learnt how bad this really is, it’s not going to make us look good in the long run,” he said. “We’d rather look the other way.” \nThe institutional structure of the church, as the official entity for Catholics to achieve salvation, had become sacrosanct, Doyle said. Victims say Catholic church data on child abuse underestimates scale of offending Read more \nHe said the protection of the “institutional church” had become “of all-encompassing importance” to the Catholic hierarchy. \nDoyle said that had contributed to efforts to cover up crimes and silence victims. \n“The protection of this entity is of all-encompassing importance and that means the bishops themselves must be protected at all costs, and must be protected from embarrassment, from being lowered in the esteem of the community,” Doyle said. “Because if these things happen, the church will be seriously tainted.” \nThe privileged status of priests in the community, he said, put them “on a pedestal” and in positions of power and trust. He said that could be used to control and scare victims. In the eyes of children, the priest represented god. \n“Many victims that I have talked to are completely confused through all of this because they’re taught that anything sexual is a mortal sin,” he said. \nThe training of clergy, particularly in celibacy, prevented them from maturing emotionally, sexually and psychologically, he said. \nHe likened priests to a highly educated groups of 14-year-olds. The few priests who stood with survivors and victims were sidelined, silenced, or punished by the church, he said. \n“Because they have gone public with an issue that the system would still prefer to keep unknown and buried in secrecy,” he said. \nHe praised the work of the commission, saying it would have a profound impact, including on the Vatican. \n“What you are doing is unique in the world, it is historic, it is going to make a mammoth difference in the long run,” he said. “You’ve taken something on that is mind-boggling.” \nThe royal commission continues on Tuesday.
