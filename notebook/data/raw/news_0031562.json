Henson and Janelle Monae, will be screened for free in honor of Black History Month. \nTheater chain AMC and distributor 20th Century Fox announced Tuesday that the screenings occur on Feb. 18. at 10 a.m. in select cities, The Associated Press reports . Cities include Atlanta, Dallas, Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago. \nAt publication time, many screenings are full due to “high level of interest,” but schools, community groups and non-profits may apply for additional free screenings through a form on the studio’s website . The deadline to apply is Feb. 28, and winners will be notified in March. \n“Hidden Figures,” the story of three black NASA scientists at the height of the ‘60s space race, is the first non-franchise live-action film with more than one female lead to hit No. 1 at the box office two weekends in a row since 2011. (That was when “The Help,” a story about a white woman’s mission to report stories of mistreated black maids, came out.) \nIt’s up for three Academy Awards ― including Best Picture. The Oscars are set to air Sunday, Feb. 26 at 7 p.m. on ABC.
