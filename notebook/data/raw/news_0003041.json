His name Cyclone.\nAccording to ABC News 5 , the golden retriever just joined the Ohio special needs cheerleading team.\nThe group of talented kids recently gave fans a sneak peek of the performance they’re planning to use at their upcoming national competition, and viewers were pleasantly surprised to see Cyclone was part of the mix.\n“This is the first time we know of that a service dog is going to be on the competitive mat,” AJ Gamin, Cheer World co-owner, told the station.\nCyclone is the service dog to Team Zeta member Harrison Chmura, who is non-verbal. The loving and loyal pup helps the 7-year-old stay focused during performances and has helped the boy open up to teammates.\n“He’ll go up to them now and initiate interaction and dance with them, plays with them, and that was something when we started Harrison wasn’t doing at all,” said John Chmura, Harrison’s dad.\nThe next stop for Team Zeta and their newest member Cyclone is the Cheerleading World Championships in Orlando, Florida, which is filling everyone with tail-wagging excitement.\nShow Full Article", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/ym3RsK6i1n4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/ohio-special-needs-cheer-team-adds-dog-to-roster-team"], "published": "2017-02-01T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:05:38.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
