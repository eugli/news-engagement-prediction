Steve O'Keefe swept the rug out from under India's feet while delivering a surprising statement to his detractors. \nIt is only his fifth Test and first in India but O'Keefe grew in confidence after being handed the ball by Smith in the second over of the hosts' innings. \nHe made a nervous start and during the lunch break spent some time in the practice nets working with former India spinning all-rounder Sridharan Sriram, who is helping Australia during its four-Test series on the subcontinent. \nBut after overcoming the early jitters the 32-year-old began to make an impact with the ball and he praised his skipper for his show of faith. \n\"I thought Steve Smith was excellent again,\" O'Keefe told Grandstand. \n\"I was probably kicking the dirt a little bit at not bowling the way I'd wanted to, but he instils that belief and faith and it's amazing when you play under a captain who believes in you.\" \nO'Keefe, whose previous best return in Tests was 3-53, admitted it was a whirlwind experience to spin Australia into a commanding position against a side ranked number one in the world and who it had not beaten in an away Test since 2004. \n\"I probably didn't bowl very well in my [first] six overs, and then it all just happened really quickly,\" he said. \n\"I guess that's the sort of wicket it is. We played and missed at a lot of balls, fortunately for us they nicked them and we caught them, so it was a good day to be a part of and well finished off by the batters.\" O'Keefe benefits from Aussie fielding excellence Photo: Australia team-mates congratulates Steve O'Keefe after the removal of Ajinkya Rahane. (Reuters: Danish Siddiqui) \nO'Keefe pointed to the fielding effort of the Australians as playing a key role in his Test career-best figures, with five wickets resulting from catches and the other from a stumping. \nIt was in stark contrast to the display of the Indians in the field on day two, with Smith being dropped on three occasions on his way to making an unbeaten 59. \n\"I think the fielding was a highlight of our performance today,\" O'Keefe said. \n\"Every half chance was taken and I think Petey Handscomb was the highlight and when those things go to hand it certainly makes a big difference.\" \nSmith will resume on day three alongside all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, who is on 21 not out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:48:13.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
