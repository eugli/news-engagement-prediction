He secured a role as closer. \nHe learned how to ready himself for a repeat — and the riches that could await. \n“That’s not the first thing that comes to my mind,” Oh said, through translator Eugene Koo. Oh wiped sweat from his forehead with a towel as he explained. “I learned that I need to look more carefully for Yadi’s sign and his mitt. As long as I’m placing my stuff wherever Yadi is giving his sign and putting his mitt, I know I’m good.” \nFollowing catcher Yadier Molina’s guide took Oh to a familiar destination by the end of last season. He joined the Cardinals in spring as the all-time saves leader in Korea’s highest league, the KBO, and then he went to Japan and had 80 saves in two years to own the ninth in a new country. Oh, 34, began his Cardinals career as a setup man, assigned the seventh or eighth inning in Mike Matheny’s bullpen, and it was only after injury unwound All-Star Trevor Rosenthal that Oh took ownership of the ninth, with 19 saves and a 1.92 ERA. He’s the closer incumbent, and on the precipice of a defining year. \nA spring that will begin with him flying home to Korea to compete in the World Baseball Classic — his first time pitching in Korea in nearly four years — could end with him jetting to another team via free agency. \n“Of course, it’s something big,” Oh said. “But as a player, I just need to focus on what I’m doing on the field, in the stadium, on the mound. The rest is going to be taken care of by my agent. My job is to focus on what I need to do for the team. Everything depends on that.” \nOh and Lance Lynn were two of a handful of Cardinals pitchers to enlist available catchers and throw bullpen sessions Thursday. As many as two dozen players are already at the team’s spring facility for informal workouts. Lynn, with his 4-year-old daughter eagerly urging him on, completed a bullpen session and then raced to Walt Disney World. (Hence, Mia Jane Lynn’s urging.) While her dad warmed up, Lynn’s daughter had joined Oh for his run from foul line to foul line on one of the practice fields. She peppered him with questions when they returned. Koo served as go-between, explaining Mia Lynn’s questions and passing along Oh’s answers. \nOh followed the Lynns onto the mound. \nHe snapped a fastball for his first warmup toss, and backup catcher Eric Fryer noted the verve of it. Only then did Oh shout to him, in Korean, with a smile. \n“It’s his first bullpen,” Koo translated. \nFor his first bullpen of the year, Oh then went through an aggressive and extended session. He flashed several different pitches, including a hard, sharp curveball. Asked why he didn’t throw it more often, Oh said that Molina never called for it. He insisted later that he threw it more than people think. FanGraphs.com calculated 0.8 percent of his pitches were curveballs. Or, about 10. The movement and deception of his fastball and pinpoint placement of his slider meant he rarely needed the curveball. Hitters made contact on only 65.7 percent of Oh’s pitches, and no other reliever in the National League flummoxed opponents more. American League pitchers who had lower contact rates were Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Zach Britton — three of the game’s late-inning torchbearers. \nOh’s success made him the obvious replacement for Rosenthal, and by moving into that role in time to finish at least 30 games Oh triggered the most obvious option in baseball. The Cardinals had a $2.75 million team option for 2017. Though the bargain deal had a hidden price. \nThe Cardinals’ control ends after two years. \nUnlike shortstop Aledmys Diaz, who signed as an international free agent but will remain under the Cardinals’ control until he has six years of major-league service time, Oh’s contract gives him earlier access to free agency. When his two-year deal with the Cardinals expires at the end of this season, he gets to explore his options, something he and his agent felt was important — if he wanted to return to Asia or, more appealingly, if a major-league team or seven wanted to give him ample reason to stay. \nOh downplayed that idea Thursday.
