It's a place where new hotels eschew fancy dress but insist on fancy service, where fine dining and foodie breakfast spots are at home with sports bars. And everywhere, tradition, tradition, tradition. The region is experiencing a boutique hotel boomlet, with three new properties opening in early 2017 totaling nearly 500 rooms and suites. A rendering of the lobby at The Stella in College Station. A rendering of the king room at The Stella in College Station. The Stella \nThis area has been underserved in upscale properties, observes Peggy Trott, general manager of The Stella , the Trust Hospitality hotel opening this spring in the area known as Research Valley or the Biocorridor. The nickname is derived from the spate of biotech companies and the nearby presence of Texas A&M Health Science Center . \nThe hotel is situated in Lake Walk , an 180,000-square-foot lifestyle center with restaurants, retail, a 5-acre lake, pavilion and hiking trails. We see lots of family reunions and proposals in its future! Campfire restaurant will be integrated into the Stella's open lobby, and a bar named Herschel's pays homage to the original ranch owner and Aggie football player Herschel Burgess . \nFrette linens and freestanding tubs in some rooms add luxury touches, while the outdoor Back Yard and two pools outfitted with cabanas complete the resort feel. \nA deal: The hotel now has a Grand Opening Offer for all guests who book a stay through July 31, which includes 20 percent off the best available rate and two specialty cocktails. Cavalry Court hotel in College Station (Cavalry Court) Cavalry Court hotel in College Station (Cavalry Court) Cavalry Court hotel in College Station (Cavalry Court) Cavalry Court \nA few miles away lies Cavalry Court , the first of the new hotels to open. Located inside Century Square, a mixed-use development adjacent to A&M, it is, for now, hard to find inside a construction zone. But that hasn't stopped the locals. \nTexas A&M football coach Kevin Sumlin has discovered the Canteen sports bar and lounge. He spent a Saturday afternoon watching the Patriots-Texans game. And the locals who swarmed in the next night for the Cowboys-Packers game have figured it out, too. Canteen bar and restaurant at Cavalry Court hotel in College Station (Cavalry Court) \nThe 141-room hotel revels in its military theme, nods to A&M's Corps of Cadets and the Parsons Mounted Cavalry. Fun touches: camo-print carpets, at ease/do-not-disturb magnets, military green armoires styled as lockers, canteen-style water pitchers and mess kit-inspired flatware. Two century trees are preserved on the property, a nostalgic spot for a fun, tradition-filled wedding reminiscent of the famous century tree on the Aggie campus. The Canteen is a live music venue on weekends and sports bar that opens onto the pool area, fire pits, cabanas and a pavilion. It's one rockin' furlough indeed. Rendering of the lobby at The George hotel in College Station. The George \nJust across from Cavalry Court and still under construction is the 162-room hotel called The George , named for two beloved Georges around town, the 41st president and philanthropist George Mitchell. The two hotels are owned by Midway and managed by Valencia Group.
