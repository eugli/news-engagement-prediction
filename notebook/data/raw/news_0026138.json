Donner Related Content The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to pull its business from Wells Fargo & Co. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has managed the city’s operating account since 2013. The city will begin a competitive bidding process for a new bank to take over when the city's contract with Wells Fargo expires on Dec. 31, 2018. Enlarge The Seattle City Council voted to pull $3 billion in city business from Wells Fargo at… more Council members cited the bank's customer account fraud scandal and the lender's financing for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. Wells Fargo Washington market CEO Mary Knell asked for another chance ahead of the vote. \"A socially responsible business owns up to mistakes and makes itself better,\" she said in a statement to the Puget Sound Business Journal. \"Our No. 1 priority is rebuilding your trust. We are resolute in strengthening our culture and becoming a company that Seattleites take pride in.\" She said the city's operating account have an average balance of $10 million with Wells Fargo and that about $3 billion flows in and out of the accounts each year. The ordinance requires city business partners to be socially responsible, stating it’s in Seattle’s “best interest to strengthen its framework for social equity and responsibility” and emphasizes relationships with businesses “who are committed to engaging in fair and responsible business practices.” The divestment is a $3 billion opportunity for another bank . In order to bid on the contract, banks must have $300 million to $450 million in collateral, the capacity to process up to $450 million in deposits, robust overdraft protection and an adequate number of branches to serve the city’s 80 payment centers. Bidders on the city's 2012 contract included Bank of America, Union Bank and U.S. Bancorp. At least eight Puget Sound-area banks appear to meet some of the city’s financial requirements , but the deal-breaker for many of the smaller banks could be the need for an adequate number of branches to serve the city’s 80 payment centers. City law doesn't define what qualifies as an \"adequate number of branches.\" Ashley Stewart covers technology and finance for the Puget Sound Business Journal.
