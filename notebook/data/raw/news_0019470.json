(New York Daily News)  00 PM \nThe NYPD rookie killed in a fiery Bronx crash was mourned Friday, less than two months before she was set to be married. \nOfficer Bianca Bennett dreamed of walking down the aisle at the Greater Allen A.M.E Cathedral in Jamaica, Queens, alongside her high school sweetheart. \nInstead, a white urn containing the 27-year-old’s remains sat alone at the center of the church’s stage, surrounded by flowers and flanked by two officers in dress uniform. \nFamily, friends and fellow Finest packed the pews for the fledgling cop’s funeral Friday, as the mournful sound of gospel songs played in place of wedding bells. Yvette Bennett (c.), mother of Bianca, mourns the loss of her daughter at her funeral. (Gardiner Anderson/for New York Daily News) \nOne of Bennett’s colleagues stood before the crowd to offer a final salute to her fallen friend. \n“Even though she is not here in body, she is above me right now,” the officer said as she raised her hand to her temple. “It’s one of the last times I’m going to be able to salute her.” \nFifteen multicolored floral arrangements of blue, red, white and pink flowers crowded the sides of the stage. Buses shuttled fellow Finest to the funeral. (Gardiner Anderson/for New York Daily News) \nSeveral large pictures of a smiling Bennett stood at the center of the room with a large NYPD badge cutout. \nKin of cop killed in Bronx wreck sympathetic to speeding NYPD pal \nOutside, cops directed traffic and two buses arrived to shuttle officers to the funeral. \nBennett and her fiancé Michael Coleman were scheduled to be wed on April 8. The Queens native, assigned to the Ninth Precinct after joining the department in April 2016, was a passenger in a 2012 Dodge Charger driven by Sgt. Randolph Price late Feb. 1 when the speeding car careened into a tree stump near City Island in the Bronx. \nWhile fast-moving flames doomed Bennett, Price was critically injured and pulled from the muscle car by a pair of cops who happen to be driving home from the nearby Rodman’s Neck firing range.
