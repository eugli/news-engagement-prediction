Jerry Falwell , evangelist and founder the Moral Majority – has served as Liberty University president since his father’s death in 2007. \nThe younger Falwell made headlines when he alluded to killing Muslims in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting in December 2015. \n“If more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in and killed them,” he said. \nHe encouraged Liberty University students to enroll in campus courses that would help them to obtain a conceal weapon permit. He also said he carries a weapon for protection. \n“Let’s teach them a lesson if they ever show up here,” Falwell added.
