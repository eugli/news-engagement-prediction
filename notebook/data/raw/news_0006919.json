Actually, not drag so much as unisex sportswear (Swindon FC-themed). This Country shares with that other BBC3 cult success People Just Do Nothing an uneasily well-observed quality that raises the comedic genre almost to an art form. If that doesn’t sound too pretentious. \nThis first episode of six is nominally about the annual village scarecrow competition, but is actually a bawdy sort of Dickensian romp with a satisfyingly violent twist. It isn’t in fact as hog-whimperingly amusing as the later episodes, but it’s still worth summoning up on your tablet. So my strong advice is to stick with the series. Kerry and Kurtan, by the way, are played by real-life brother and sister team Charlie and Daisy Cooper, the funniest siblings of this or any age. We will, I hope, see and hear much more of these. Strong language throughout, by the way. \nI don’t suppose I ever expected to see Roots back on our screens, nor any reason why I shouldn’t. It was a classic mini-series, and curiously seldom seen since. For those who remember it first time round, about 40 years ago it was quite a phenomenon, tracing as it did the African origins of the black diaspora through the life of one in particular, Kunta Kinte, whose suffering in slavery was given a fully graphic treatment. It was, basically, quite a shaming thing to watch, the violence, the greed, the plundering and sheer human suffering on such a scale – inflicted by white slavemasters and slaveowners but some allied African traders too. At the time it was so revelatory because it confronted a generation of people in Europe and America who had only relatively recently abandoned their lazy assumptions of imperialism and white supremacy. More than anything, they had to be impressed by the spirit of Kunta Kinte, and his descendants, whose lives were followed on their path through American history through to the Civil War and, in sequels, to the last century. \nNow Alex Harvey’s multi-generational historical novel has been adapted for TV again, and this one is more naturalistic and just as harrowing to observe, albeit slightly tucked away on BBC4. Malachi Kirby plays Kinte, and Forest Whitaker joins as fellow slave Fiddler: a fine drama in its own right. \nAs a bit of a history fan, I enjoyed my preview of Ben Macintyre’s SAS:Rogue Warriors . Macintyre is a skilled story teller in print and television, and you might recall his previous books/shows about spies. This time it’s the most daring of the daring, and. Although much of their story has been familiar for some time, Macintyre has got his hands on some revealing and previously unseen material to add to the lustre of the Special Air Service story, in all its semi-psychotic semi-amateur splendour. \nBy the way, the gut-wrenching excitement of the Derby County/Leicester City FA Cup tie vindicated my choice of it as the pick of last Friday’s viewing; I feel just as confident in mentioning to you the England v France Six Nations Rugby match today, the whole Brexit thing adding to the usual traditional friendly rivalries.
