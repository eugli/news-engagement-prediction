A powerful storm swept through that region of the state on Saturday. Credit Mark Rightmire/The Orange County Register, via Associated Press A powerful storm with near hurricane-force winds swept through Southern California on Saturday, killing at least two people and causing widespread disruptions, but providing a definitive respite from five years of drought. Amid one of the wettest winters in decades, more heavy rainfall was due to strike Northern California starting on Sunday. “I’ve been a meteorologist here for 25 years and I personally can’t remember a storm that had that much wind with it,” said David Sweet in the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service . “It was a very impressive storm.” Parched for the past five years, California now finds itself in some areas with too much water. Workers have rushed to fix the damaged embankment of the Oroville Dam north of Sacramento, which this past week was weakened by water discharged from an emergency spillway. Some forecasts said that the area could be hardest hit by the new round of rainfall on Sunday. At the Port of Los Angeles, winds reached 75 miles an hour on Friday, just above the threshold to be considered a hurricane, Mr. Sweet said. Rainfall on some inland mountain slopes reached nine inches, the same amount of precipitation that would normally fall during an entire winter month. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sweet described a plume of moisture extending from Hawaii to Southern California, bringing with it tropical moisture. “It was an atmospheric river,” he said. The combination of wind and rain knocked down trees across the Los Angeles area, prompted mudslides, flooded freeways and opened up a sink hole in the San Fernando Valley large enough to almost swallow two cars. Tens of thousands of Southern California residents lost power during the storm, portions of Amtrak train service were suspended and dozens of flights were canceled or delayed. The two storm-related deaths involved a person retrieved from a flooded vehicle and a man electrocuted by felled power lines. The frequent winter storms are taking a toll on other parts of the state’s infrastructure, with landslides closing a number of roads. A bridge at the tourist town of Big Sur was closed by the authorities this past week, cutting off access to part of the town. An online map by the California Department of Transportation showed at least 70 road closings. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
