He did not say why those particular news organisations were excluded, a decision which drew strong protests. \nReuters was included in the session, along with about 10 other news organisations, including Bloomberg and CBS. \nSpicer said his team decided to have a gaggle in his office instead of a full briefing in the larger White House briefing room. \n\"Our job is to make sure that we're responsive to folks in media. We want to make sure we answer your questions, but we don't need to do everything on camera every day,” he said. \nReporters at the Associated Press and Time magazine walked out of the briefing when hearing that others had been barred from the session. \nOff-camera gaggles are not unusual. The White House often invites handpicked outlets in for briefings, typically for specific topics. But briefings and gaggles in the White House are usually open to all outlets and they are free to ask anything. \nA pool reporter from Hearst Newspapers was included in the gaggle on Friday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said, and was preparing a pool report for distribution to the entire press corps. Media outlets allowed into the gaggle also shared their audio with others. \nPresident Donald Trump has regularly attacked the media. Earlier on Friday, at a gathering of conservative activists, he heaped criticism on news organisations that he said provide \"fake news\" and called them an \"enemy\" of the American people. \nProtests \nSpicer's decision drew a sharp response from some of the media outlets that were excluded. \n\"Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,\" Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times , said in a statement. \n\"We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organisations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.\" \nThe White House Correspondents Association, or WHCA, also protested. \n\"The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today's gaggle is being handled by the White House,\" said Jeff Mason, president of the association and a Reuters reporter. \nTrump says some news organisations lie and on Friday denounced their use of anonymous sources. Critics say Trump's attacks endanger press freedoms. \nDuring the election campaign last year, Trump's team banned a few news organisations, including The Washington Post and BuzzFeed , from covering his campaign rallies for a period of time to protest their coverage. \nCNN posted a Twitter message on Friday afternoon saying: \"This is an unacceptable development by the Trump White House. Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like. We’ll keep reporting regardless.” \nBen Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News , said in a statement: \"While we strongly object to the White House's apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we won't let these latest antics distract us from continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively.\" \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:28:29.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
