But where in the world have British holidaymakers been hit hardest by the weakening pound after the Brexit vote? \nThe map below reveals all - how the pound has fared, rising or falling, since the country went to the polls. \nDifferences between exchange rates on June 23, 2016 - the day of the referendum - and February 1 this year, were measured as percentage changes by currency providers Travelex. \nWith this data we are able to show the strength of British spending power in every world currency that the foreign exchange company tracks. \nUnfortunately, we found that in nearly every country, the pound will now buy you less. People on safari in Namibia Credit: This content is subject to copyright./David Young-Wolff \nWe can see that Brexit has had the most impact on holidaymakers heading to parts of Africa, Russia and Brazil. In Namibia, a growing destination for safaris, travellers currently get 21 per cent less of the local dollar than they would have done before Britain decided to leave the European Union. \nThe same drop in the pound was recorded in South Africa, but travellers shouldn’t be too downhearted as last January returns on sterling were at a record high. Then, £1 bought 24.5 rand and although those gains have now been diminished, the pound still buys around 16 rand and Britons will find that meals out and drinks are still surprisingly affordable.

Exchanging £500 today buys 1920 Brazilian reals as opposed to 2400 reals on June 23, 480 reals less. maps that will change how you see world \nBritish holidaymakers will also be able to afford less in Iceland - the next worst hit country with a fall recorded of 19 per cent - and in Chile and Kazakhstan, which both saw drops of 18 per cent. \nIn the US, the gloom continues, as Britons will have 15 per cent less in their pockets now, with £500 worth $88 (£70) less than last year. \nAustralia offers less value too, with sterling also falling 15 per cent in six months. UK cheapest city breaks \nIn Europe the pound has suffered less but it has still shrunk 11 per cent since the day of the Brexit vote, with Britons currently getting €76 (£65) less in return for £500. \nThe map shows however that there are a handful of countries where the pound has in fact strengthened over the same period. It’s not a holiday destination for obvious reasons but the pound has gone up 102 per cent in Syria, while also strengthening by 81 per cent against the Egyptian pound, which was devalued so the Egyptian government could receive help from the IMF.

Exchanging £500 now gives you 2245 lira, 222.5 (£50) more than before. \nBritons can afford more now in Mongolia too, where a 7 per cent rise was recorded. In Burma the pound took only a very slight tumble of 1 per cent.
