Chahal's 6/25 surpassed R Ashwin 's figures of 4/8 as the best for India and inflicted a crushing 75-run win on England, meaning that Virat Kohli 's team has beaten the visitors in all three formats of this tour.\nChahal's figures are the third-best in T20Is after Sri Lankan all-sorts spinner Ajantha Mendis' 6/8 and 6/16.\nIn his sixth appearance, the 26-year-old Haryana legspinner was sensational as he triggered a dramatic England collapse of eight wickets for eight runs in 18 deliveries. This helped India, who made 202/6, bowled England out for 127 in 16.3 overs.\nGiven the daunting task of bowling the second over of England's chase, Chahal struck with his third delivery when opener Sam Billings inside-edged a drive into his boot and was taken by Suresh Raina running in from slip. He was taken off after two overs which went for 19 runs.\nChahal returned to bowl the 14th over, at which stage England needed 86 from 42 balls, an asking rate of 12.28. Off his third ball, a googly tossed up outside off stump, England captain Eoin Morgan, on 40, mistimed his slog-sweep and was taken by the debutant Rishabh Pant at deep midwicket. Off the next ball, a well-set Joe Root (42) was trapped in front of off stump by a faster flipper. It was very smart bowling from Chahal.\nThen on the 16th over, his final of the match, Chahal picked up three wickets - that of Moeen Ali , Ben Stokes and Chris Jordan - to surpass Ashwin's mark and claim his first five-wicket haul in T20 cricket. This also meant that Chahal had taken five wickets in 12 balls for just six runs. It was, as former England captain Nasser Hussain put it on air, \"ridiculous batting\" but no one can take away from Chahal's bravado in repeatedly tossing the ball up.\nFewer bowlers can claim to have had such performances in T20 cricket. No surprises for guessing who the Man of the Match was.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:27:42.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
