Photo: Supplied \nNos. 48 and 52 Pembroke Road would need major work if they were to be lived in but still held the character from when they were first built, Mr Dracic said. \n“The houses are in original condition,” he said. “If you walk in the houses, everything is really original.” \n“I think they’re some of the oldest houses in the area.” \nLooking at 48 Pembroke Road from the street.

Mr Dracic said one potential buyer had already said they would apply to demolish the properties, rather than move them. \nThe Szogis were not open to selling the blocks separately yet, but Mr Dracic said there was some interest in saving at least one of the properties from demolition. \n“We have had a bit of interest from a lady in the street who offered a reasonable price for one of the houses for restoration.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:28:03.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
