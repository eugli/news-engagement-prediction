At one point, he said Putin was a better leader than former U.S. president Barack Obama . \nOn another occasion he said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” in reference to messages that could not be found on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s private server. \nWATCH BELOW: Does Donald Trump have close ties with Vladimir Putin? \nCNN backed up the Times account , saying that both Trump and Obama were briefed on communications that had occurred between Russians and people attached to the Republican candidate’s campaign, according to unnamed officials. \nIt’s not unusual for campaigns to commiserate with people attached to foreign governments, CNN said. \nBut U.S. intelligence and law enforcement raised a “red flag” about these communications because of their frequency and the “level of the Trump advisers involved,” the network said. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump knew for weeks Michael Flynn was misleading over Russia \nThe report came one day after Michael Flynn, Trump’s security adviser, resigned his post while admitting that he had given “incomplete information” to Vice-President Mike Pence about his communication with a Russian envoy. \nPence had initially said that Flynn never discussed sanctions with the Russians. Flynn later admitted that he may have discussed that. \nMore to come.
