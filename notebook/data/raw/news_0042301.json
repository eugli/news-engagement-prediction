John McCain (R-AZ) said that was “how dictators get started.”\nMcCain said, “I hate the press. I hate you especially. But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It’s vital. If you want to preserve – I’m very serious now – if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press. And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That’s how dictators get started.”\nHe added, “They get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n John McCain", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/pamkeyNEN", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fmccain-trumps-attacks-press-dictators-get-started%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=McCain%3A+Trump%E2%80%99s+Attacks+on+Press+Are+%E2%80%98How+Dictators+Get+Started%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fmccain-trumps-attacks-press-dictators-get-started%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=McCain%3A+Trump%E2%80%99s+Attacks+on+Press+Are+%E2%80%98How+Dictators+Get+Started%E2%80%99", "http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/880252483608", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fmccain-trumps-attacks-press-dictators-get-started%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=McCain%3A+Trump%E2%80%99s+Attacks+on+Press+Are+%E2%80%98How+Dictators+Get+Started%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:30:19.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
