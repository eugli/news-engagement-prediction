Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAn 11-year-old child allegedly had shapes carved into their bare stomach - as they were pinned down and had their eyes taped up shut - in the latest case of 'child bullying'. \nAngry relatives have released a shocking photo which they claim exposes the horrendous ordeal their child suffered - after they claim a school told them after another alleged incident: \"Boys will be boys\". \nThe picture is alleged to show scratches carved into the stomach of the victim with bamboo sticks taken from the garden at Stebonheath Primary School in Llanelli. \nIt's claimed the 11-year-old victim - who the South Wales Evening Post is calling Child X to protect their identity - was pinned down and had their eyes taped up shut during the alleged attack last April. \nThe victim was allegedly so petrified, they wet themselves. \nThe worried relatives released the photo to the media - which was taken a day after the 'attack' - after Child X was allegedly told by bullies last week: \"We wish you had cancer and would die''. \nThe pupil also came home from school on Wednesday with lumps on their head, claiming it had been forced to the floor. \nThe family have immediately withdrawn the child and their sibling from the school - and say they want to warn other parents. (Photo: Google) \nAt the time of the April incident, Child X was allegedly threatened by the bullies not to tell anyone - with a warning they would otherwise end up with no friends. \nThe pupil eventually told their family of the alleged incident and the perpetrators are reported to have been suspended from school for one month as a result. \nBut it's claimed the victim has been unable to recover. \nA relative of Child X told the South Wales Evening Post that there had been a lasting effect. \n\"(Child X) regularly wets the bed and tries to hide their school shoes so they won't have to go,\" they said. \nThe South Wales Evening Post reports that the police were called at the time of the incident and a welfare officer was subsequently sent to the school to talk to the children. The child was allegedly bullied again - despite measures taken in the past (Photo: Getty) \nThe relatives of Child X say they were reassured by the school that nothing like it would ever happen again. \nBut then just a few days ago tensions appeared to resurface. \nAccording to the relative of Child X, the bullies allegedly told the pupil: \"We wish you had cancer and would die.\" \nAnd when the relatives of Child X approached the school about the verbal abuse the response,according to the family, was: \"Boys will be boys.\" \nThe final straw came on Wednesday, when Child X returned home from school with two lumps to the back of the head. \nChild X's claims its head had been forced to the floor. \nThe relatives decided to pull Child X and their sibling from the school immediately. \nThey said: \"We just wanted to tell others what has happened to us. We don't want it to happen to anyone else. \n\"(Child X) has had a heartbreaking time, but now they've left (Child X) is over the moon, and very relieved.\" Read More \nA spokesperson for Stebonheath Primary School said: \"The school has followed all policy and procedures appropriately in respect of the historic incident and the current allegations are under investigation. \n\"We can confirm that parents have withdrawn two siblings from the school.\" \nThere have been several worrying incidents of alleged child bullying in the press in recent days - not least in Wales when two teenage school pupil died earlier this week in separate unrelated incidents. \nBishop Gore pupil Nyah James, aged 14, from Swansea, was found dead at home on Monday. \nHer mum, Dominique Williams, told Mirror.co.uk her daughter was bullied online. \nThen Megan Evans, 14, was found dead at home on Tuesday after a secret battle against cyber-bullies that she kept from her parents. \nGrieving mum Nicola Harteveld, 40, only found out about her daughter's torment when cruel messages were discovered on her phone after her death.
