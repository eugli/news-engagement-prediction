They had also caused trouble in three other matches this season, the DFB said.\nDortmund won the Leipzig game, but club bosses repeatedly apologised to Leipzig for their fans' behaviour.\nSome Dortmund fans apologised to Leipzig for the violence and offensive messages during their midweek German Cup fixture with Hertha Berlin\nBanners reading 'No to violence' condemned their own fans' actions in attacking Leipzig fans\n'Such a defamation of individuals or clubs by using banners and chants is unacceptable and needs to be sanctioned,' said Anton Nachreiner, head of the DFB committee. 'The same goes for the flares'.\nThe south stand, nicknamed the 'Yellow Wall', is the largest standing stand in Europe with a 25,000 capacity.\nDortmund have until Monday to either accept the proposal or reject it in which case the decision will be taken by FA's sports court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:42:12.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
