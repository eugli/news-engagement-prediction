well up from November's estimate of 1.4 per cent.\nThe Bank has also increased its forecasts for 2018 and 2019, with economic growth expected to come in at 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.\nThe upgrades will embarrass the Bank as they expose as unnecessary its dire warnings of severe economic damage from the Brexit vote.\nBoE Governor Mark Carney was all smiles today but ahead of last June's referendum he controversially warned that a Brexit vote could trigger a UK recession.\nIn August, the Bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2009, when they were reduced to 0.5 per cent in the heat of the financial crisis.\nThe Bank said a more gradual slowdown in consumer spending, measures announced by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement, and stronger outlook for the global economy would all support UK output over the next few years.\nOn what's been dubbed 'Super Thursday', the Bank of England also said its inflation forecast remains broadly unchanged for this year, at around 2.7 per cent.\nThe Bank said the weaker pound would lead inflation to rise to 2.8 per cent in the first half of 2018 and fall back 'gradually' to 2.4 per cent in three years time.\nIt added: 'The value of sterling remains 18% below its peak in November 2015, reflecting investors’ perceptions that a lower real exchange rate will be required following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.\n'Over the next few years, a consequence of weaker sterling is that the higher imported costs resulting from it will boost consumer prices and cause inflation to overshoot the 2% target.'\nConsumer price inflation rose to a two-year-high of 1.6 per cent in December, primarily because of a slump in value of the pound, which has lost over 14 per cent of its value since June’s referendum.\nOn the back of the Bank's report, sterling is down 0.36 per cent to $1.2610, after reaching a seven-week high against the dollar this morning.\nAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.80 per cent to €1.1664.\nNeil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: 'Despite the upgrade to growth, the market sees this as a bit doveish as inflation is not expected to run away as much as thought and we are seeing sterling hand back earlier gains.'\nHe added that the upgrade was 'a touch of humble pie for the Bank, as it's been made abundantly clear that the economic Armageddon it expected in the event of Brexit has just not materialised.\nThe upgrade is a \"touch of humble pie\" for the Bank 'The UK remains the fastest growing G7 economy - not bad for a nation that some think has committed an act of self-mutilation in choosing to leave the EU.'\nThe FTSE 100 is up 0.33 per cent or 23.68 points to 7,131.33.\nMinutes of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee showed some policymakers believe it is becoming harder to justify keeping rates at record lows, with growth showing surprising resilience and inflation rising.\nThe Bank said: 'The more time that passed without a noticeable reduction in economic growth, the more difficult it would become to tolerate the extent of the inflation overshoot.'\nFinancial markets are factoring in a rate rise in 2018 and for borrowing costs to be hiked twice over the next three years, although economists are not expecting an increase until 2019.\nInflation: Consumer price inflation rose to a two-year-high of 1.6 per cent in December\nProjections: The Bank of England's GDP projections announced today\nThe Bank said it would continue to balance the trade-off between higher inflation and growth in 'such exceptional circumstances' and cautioned that the consumer spending spree boosting the economy is set to come to an end, which would weigh on growth.\nIt said a consumer spending slowdown is 'highly likely given the scale of the depreciation of sterling and the consequent effect that higher import prices would have on real income growth.'\nTom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said: 'With the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street prepared to keep sitting on its hands when it comes to raising rates and with inflation expected to breach the central bank’s 2% target this year, anyone with savings still sitting in cash will struggle to generate real returns.\n'One alternative is to look to the stock market. History shows there has been a sweet spot in the inflation range that suits equities well - normally at around 2% to 2.5%.\nPredictions: The Bank said the weaker pound would lead inflation to rise to 2.8 per cent in the first half of 2018\nInflation: The Bank of England's prediction for CPI in 2017 announced today\n'Shares tend to perform particularly well if the rise in inflation reflects higher growth expectations rather than a wage spiral. This is the Goldilocks scenario for equities and it may well apply for much of this year and next.'\nSuren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The Bank of England’s latest forecasts paint a much more optimistic picture of the UK's growth prospects compared to their previous post-EU referendum predictions.\n'Although the central bank is slightly less concerned over price growth, inflation is still expected to breach the 2% target for a prolonged period. This means that MPC’s attempts to combat rising inflation and support growth is likely to remain a challenging balancing act through the forecast period.'\nMeanwhile, Yael Selfin, KPMG Chief Economist said: 'Less pressure on the pound, as the focus of markets’ attention turns elsewhere, is providing a backstop for any further deterioration in the inflation outlook.\n'Given the volatility expected in the first half of 2019, as the UK exits the EU, we could see rates beginning to rise later than markets are currently indicating.\n'The MPC may decide to start its tightening cycle only after the UK is safely out of the EU, despite a short to medium term peak in inflation above the MPC target of 2%.'\nTime to reconsider: Cash savers have fared poorly against their stocks and shares counterparts in recent years\nRising: CPI inflation is expected to continue to rise, the Bank of England said\nThe latest forecasts come after the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane admitted last month the Bank had suffered a 'Michael Fish moment' in making overly gloomy predictions last year over the impact of a Brexit vote.\nThe Bank's Canadian Governor Mark Carney controversially warned that a Brexit vote could trigger a UK recession ahead of last June's referendum.\nIn August, less than two months after the EU referendum, the Bank downgraded its UK annual growth forecasts for 2017 from 2.3 per cent to just 0.8 per cent.\nBut, in November, the Bank raised its forecast to 1.4 per cent after data showed the economy hadn’t weakened as it feared.\nThe UK's economy grew by 2 per cent last year, with growth of 0.6 per cent in each of the last three quarters.\nToday, the construction purchasing managers' index hit a five-month low of 52.2 in January after December's nine-month high of 54.2, a steeper decline than forecast in a Reuters poll, though still indicating modest growth.\nThe latest PMI reading for the key services sector, which accounts for almost 80 per cent of the UK economy, has shown five consecutive months of growth, and unemployment also has remained at an 11-year low.\nOn Wednesday, figures from Markit revealed the UK manufacturing sector showed signs of a 'strong start' last month, but remains under pressures as the cost of imports rise.\nUK construction activity falls\nGrowth in the UK's construction sector fell to its lowest since September 2016 last month.\nFigures from the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index reveal activity in the sector fell to a five-month low of 52.2 in January after December's nine-month high of 54.2.\nWith the cost of imported goods rising after sterling's depreciation in recent months, costs in the construction sector have climbed to their highest since August 2008.\nAll three sub-sectors (housing, commercial and civil engineering) recorded softer rates of output growth in January.\nWhile housebuilding remained the best performing category, the latest expansion was the weakest for five months.\nOn the upside however, the number of jobs coming up in the sector grew at the fastest rate for eight months in January. The use of sub-contractors grew at the steepest pace since December 2015.\nStronger job creation 'reflected a sustained improvement in business confidence among construction companies in January', Markit said.\nTim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, said: 'UK construction firms experienced a subdued start to 2017, with all the key categories of activity losing momentum.\n'While housebuilding retained its position as the fastest growing part of the construction sector, the latest upturn was the weakest since the post-referendum rebound emerged in September 2016.'\nOn Wednesday, figures from Markit revealed the UK manufacturing sector showed signs of a 'strong start' last month, but remains under pressures as the cost of imports rise.", "external_links": ["http://investing.thisismoney.co.uk/modules/main-markets-beta"], "published": "2017-02-02T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:54:13.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
