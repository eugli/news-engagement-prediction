Jeep had previously said that its maiden locally produced model 'Jeep Compass' will be rolled out in the first half of the next year from its plant at Ranjangaon, Pune. With Compass, FCA is planning to take on the price-sensitive mid-market SUV segment. \nKevin Flynn, President and MD, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles India said, \"We have named our first to-be-India-made SUV as Jeep Compass which will be locally manufactured from mid-2017. The Compass will be our first localised Jeep product in India and will roll out of our Ranjangaon facility near Pune.\" Jeep Compass \nALSO READ: Jeep Compass test mule spotted on NH8 in Gurgaon \nThe company unveiled Compass in Brazil last year and was also showcased at the Los Angeles Auto show as well for the North American market. On August 30, FCA had launched two models of its legendary Jeep models -- Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee -- in India. \nDesign: \nLook at it from any angle and it is unmistakably a smaller Grand Cherokee. It offers the seven slat grille which has become the identity of this American brand. The sleek pair of headlamps flanking the grille come with LED daytime running lamps. The fog lamps sit on the bumper which also has a dual tone effect to it. In profile it is clear that the Compass has proper SUV intentions. The big wheel arches house the 18in alloys and the claddings give it that tough look. Jeep Compass \nALSO READ: Jeep Compass: Everything you need to know \nEngine: \nThe Jeep Compass is available in both petrol and diesel guise internationally. The diesel in question is a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine which comes from Fiat's MultiJet series. In the Compass, it churns out 170bhp and 350Nm of torque. Jeep claims that the Compass in this spec can sprint to 100kmph in just 10 seconds and can keep going until it touches 194kmph. We also expect Jeep to offer this same engine here in India. An AWD version is also expected to be offered in this spec and gearbox options will include a 6-speed manual and 9-speed automatic. Details of the petrol engine are yet to be revealed but we believe that it is going to be the 1.6-litre unit. \nVariants: \nJeep is offering the Compass in four variants which include the entry level Sport followed by the Limited. Then comes the Longitude and finally one can have the top of the line Trailhawk. The Trailhawk though will come with even more features which include a dual-tone paint treatment.
