Story continues below \nHowever, he then managed to escape from the police vehicle and ran away. \nA police dog helped to track the man down at a nearby residence where he had broken in. \nThe man then became involved in an altercation with an officer at the home and ran away again. \nPolice later found the man in a tree he had climbed and were able to talk him into climbing down. He was then arrested once again. \nJohn William Roberts is facing a number of charges: escaping lawful custody, two counts of break and enter, attempting to disarm a police officer, assaulting a police officer, choking to overcome resistance, obstruction, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, mischief under $5,000, impaired operation of a motor vehicle, possession of property obtained by crime, possession of a firearm while prohibited and possession of break-in instruments. \nNo one was injured as a result of Tuesday’s incidents. \n“We are very happy that no innocent bystanders were injured and that our RCMP member did not suffer serious injury during this incident,” Staff Sgt. Brent Meyer, detachment commander of the Peace Regional RCMP, said in a statement. “The RCMP appreciates the assistance that we received and are pleased to successfully bring these incidents to a close.” \nPolice said Roberts was also wanted on an arrest warrant out of Stony Plain, Alta. \nHe is scheduled to appear at the Provincial Court of Alberta in Peace River on March 6 and at the Provincial Court of Alberta in Stony Plain on March 8. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:57:51.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
