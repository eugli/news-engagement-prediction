He added that it was Albais, who earned the monicker because residents found him odd, who told Grace where her daughter’s body was before he escaped. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe victim’s head was wrapped in plastic while there were bruises and cuts on her body. The police, however, were still waiting for autopsy results to determine her cause of death and whether she was raped. \nBudios said Galguerra frequented the vacant lot to pick mangoes. On Friday, a day before she went missing, the victim and her sibling were at the vacant lot when Albais grabbed her and touched her private parts. This prompted both children to run away. \nThe next day, the victim failed to come home. Grace recalled that she last saw her on Saturday morning at their house. \nThe next day, a neighbor told Grace to check the vacant lot on Cypress Street because Galguerra frequented the area. \nAlong the way, Grace said she saw Albais and asked him if he had seen her daughter. He replied that Galguerra was near some bushes in the vacant lot. \nBudios said that investigators were looking for Albais since all the circumstantial evidence pointed to him as the perpetrator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:07:24.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
