Updated: Feb 24, 2017 08:28 IST New Delhi, Hindustan Times Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.(HT Photo) \nAam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called a meeting of state in charges on Saturday to discuss the party’s national plan post-Punjab and Goa elections. \nAAP will focus on the assembly elections in Gujarat later this year and Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh next year, party sources said. \nThe Aam Aadmi Party launched a multi-pronged attack against the BJP accusing it of engineering violence at Delhi’s Ramjas college to communally charge the Uttar Pradesh election and its governments in Gujarat and Chhattisgarh for unleashing police brutalities on farmers and tribals. \nRead: Two years of AAP govt: Survey shows Delhi’s Kejriwal govt curbed corruption \nOn a day the party’s highest decision making body — the political affairs committee —met to firm up the plan, AAP leaders in Delhi also raked up the issue of an alleged spy racket in MP in which a local BJP leader was arrested. \nParty leader Kumar Vishwas accused the BJP along with its affiliate, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad — Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s student wing, of fomenting violence at Delhi University in the last two days. \n“ABVP’s actions in Delhi University are triggered by the BJP’s impending defeat in UP,” Vishwas said. “They are trying to communalise the election,” he added. \nParty leader Gopal Rai, who is in charge of Gujarat, MP and Chhattisgarh led a delegation of farmers from Gandhinagar and tribals in Bastar to the National Human Rights Commission against alleged police atrocities. \nRai alleged that farmers and their families from 32 villages were attacked by the police on their way to Gandhinagar on February 14. \nRead: Arvind Kejriwal’s breakout moment in national politics \nThe victims were demanding water for their villages and marching to the state capital a few kilometres away. \n“These villages are left untouched by Modi’s Gujarat model. They do not have even drinking water,” Rai said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:06:12.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
