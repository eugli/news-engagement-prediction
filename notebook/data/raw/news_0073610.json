That hair! That dress! By Jamie Feldman \nIt’s been a busy two months for Paris Jackson . She was Rolling Stone’s February 2017 cover star , she hit a style home run at the Grammys, and now she’s one of CR Fashion Book’s latest cover stars. \nRocking a blue Gucci gown, a totally rad, cropped hairdo, a bold red lip and long red nails, the 18-year-old and her piercing blue eyes looked gorgeous on one of three covers of the issue. Mario Sorrenti \nJackson joined rapper Gucci Mane and model Halima Aden , who each got their own respective covers, and was interviewed by director Lee Daniels inside the mag. Revealing that she hopes to possess her father’s “strength,” she explained how big of an influence he still has on her life. \n“I would say 99 percent of my inspiration comes from him, because he has always been my world,” she said. “He is my roots.” \nJackson, who told Daniels she is currently “doing the modeling thing,” is also interested in acting and being involved in activism. She has a tattoo for Standing Rock and stands firmly against the utilization of real fur and leather in fashion. She also has seven piercings to represent her father’s favorite number and has upcoming plans to get a new tattoo with her mom, Debbie Rowe, who recently finished chemotherapy. \nIf this interview is any indication , we have a feeling we’re about to see ― and learn ― a lot more about Jackson than ever before.
