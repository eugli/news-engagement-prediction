I just help people. I'm just one human who cares for others, simple as that.\" \nMr Rayner knows that bringing his work out into the open carries a huge risk. \n\"It will definitely draw some attention,\" he said.

(ABC News: Tony Hill) \nSince police raided Jenny Hallam's property in January she has become a fierce advocate for people's rights to take their own medicine, even if it means breaking the law. \n\"We are sick and tired of being treated like criminals, for doing something to try and save our lives,\" she said at a recent rally outside Parliament House in Canberra. \n\"And even worse, when we try and heal people, they come and raid our homes, they take our medicine, and they treat us like pieces of shit.\" \nLike Mr Rayner, Ms Hallam had produced cannabis oil for sick people around Australia. She believes she can get around the law by using donated cannabis, and not charging her clients for the oil she provides. \nWhile South Australian Police are yet to lay charges, Ms Hallam blames the Federal Government for pushing her industry underground. \n\"I'm concerned for the other producers out there that they will be targeted just like I was.\" Using medicinal cannabis still illegal in Australia Photo: Filtering the cannabis oil. (ABC News: Tony Hill) \nOil producers and their clients operate in a confusing regulatory environment. \nLate last year, the Federal Government legalised the cultivation and manufacture of cannabis for medicinal purposes under strict conditions. \nBut using medicinal cannabis is still illegal in Australia, and only available through trials and limited special-access schemes which vary from state to state. \nRight now, there is no legal domestic supply to dispense to potential patients. \nIn South Australia they are trying to close down the backyard operations by turning medicinal cannabis into a legitimate business. \nBut the businesses poised to enter that market say they can not get approvals. \nEven if they could, with few doctors allowed to prescribe it they would have no one to sell it to. \nState Industry Minister Kyam Maher is desperate to streamline the process. \n\"We've started the conversation now with the Federal Government about ways to make sure it's as easy as it can be. It necessarily needs to be regulated. These are schedule eight drugs that we're talking about,\" he said. Photo: Cannabis oil bubbles away. (ABC News: Tony Hill) \nDespite the delays, Mr Maher warned backyard production was not the answer. \n\"The backyard production of any sort of drug is illegal. There is now a pathway for prescription in Australia, in terms of the manufacturing, there is an ability to do that, but it is very new and there are some things that I think need to be sorted out and streamlined. \n\"But it is against the law to take matters into your own hands and manufacture it and I'd recommend anyone not to do that.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:49:33.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
