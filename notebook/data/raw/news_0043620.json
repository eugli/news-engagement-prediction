In turn, upper management and HR told her “that they wouldn’t feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to” because it was the employee’s first offense.\nAccording to Fowler, HR and management were generally insensitive to, if not completely dismissive of, her claims and those of other women at Uber. At different points they apparently revised her performance reviews surreptitiously, allegedly suggested to Fowler that she was the cause of her sexual harassment issues, and threatened to fire her for reporting a manager to HR (a move which Fowler says her CTO later acknowledged was illegal).\nThough Fowler wrote that she was “lucky enough during all of this to work with some of the most amazing engineers in the Bay Area,” she claimed that by the time she left the Site Reliability Engineering team in January, only 3% of the 150 engineers in the unit were women.\nSince Fowler’s blog post was published on Sunday, it has been shared widely across social media, and has provoked a significant response from Uber.\nThis MUST be read by all (and keep in mind that her appalling experience is all too common throughout tech): https://t.co/jFhWMAlstW\n— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) February 20, 2017\nIn a statement emailed to VICE News, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that “What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes.” Additionally, he said that he has instructed Uber’s new chief HR exec Liane Hornsey to “conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.”\nArianna Huffington — media impresario, entrepreneur, and Uber board member — tweeted that she will work with Hornsey to “conduct a full independent investigation starting now.” When asked for more detail on the nature of the “independent” investigation, an Uber spokesperson said that Huffington “will be working closely with us in the coming days.”\nJust talked w/ Travis & as a representative of Uber's Board I will work w/Liane to conduct a full independent investigation starting now 1/2\n— Arianna Huffington (@ariannahuff) February 20, 2017\nSexism and gender discrimination are widely considered endemic in Silicon Valley, and efforts to combat them have largely fallen flat . Some of Uber’s behavior over the last couple years may offer a little insight into where a corporate culture like this might have come from.\nIn 2014, CEO Travis Kalanick joked to a GQ reporter about a “women on demand” startup called “Boob-er.” In response to a BuzzFeed News investigation last year, Uber suggested that BuzzFeed had overestimated the number sexual assault complaints that Uber had received about its drivers, in part because “any email address or rider/driver last name that contains the letters R, A, P, E consecutively (for example, Don Draper)” would affect the number of results that show up.\nIn a correction later posted to its letter, Uber admitted that its customer support software provider had “contacted us to say that their search tool would not return a name such as ‘Don Draper’ when searching for the word ‘rape.’”\nSusan Fowler did not immediately respond to a further request for comment.\nCover: Sipa USA via AP", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html", "https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/833497535880818688", "https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/the-sexism-of-startup-land/387184/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Uber", "https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/833494350701133824", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-opens-urgent-investigation-into-sexual-harassment-claims", "http://www.gq.com/story/uber-cab-confessions", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-fowler-263b6343/", "http://www.economist.com/news/business/21647611-tech-firms-can-banish-sexism-without-sacrificing-culture-made-them-successful-valley", "https://t.co/jFhWMAlstW", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathonan/uber-responds-to-buzzfeed-news-story-on-sex-assault-complain?utm_term=.wkqp4kPkJ7#.tc2oX2Q2L5", "https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:04:55.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
