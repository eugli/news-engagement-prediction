Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks Feb. 8, 2017, about being rebuked on Feb. 7 by the Senate leadership and accused of impugning the character of a fellow senator. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took to Twitter on Wednesday night to promise that she — and other Democrats — will fight back, hard, now that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) has been confirmed as attorney general.\nShortly after Sessions was confirmed Wednesday night by the Senate, Warren vowed that “ this is just the beginning ” of opposition from Democrats.\nShe used extremely strong language to warn that if Sessions brings “his racism, sexism & bigotry” to the Justice Department, he will hear from “all of us.” The senator then tweeted that those senators who voted to put Sessions’s “radical hatred” at Justice would also hear from the opposition.\nWarren, a possible 2020 presidential candidate, was presumably referring not only to lawmakers, but also to those who make up the activist base of the Democratic Party that is vigorously protesting President Trump and his policies around the country.\nIf Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism & bigotry into @TheJusticeDept , he'll hear from all of us.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 \n\nAnd you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 \n\nWarren’s national profile was abruptly elevated Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning when she was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) from speaking during the remainder of the Sessions debate because she allegedly had impugned Sessions’s character by trying to read a letter written by Coretta Scott King that was critical of Sessions.\n[ Amid deep partisan rancor, Sessions is confirmed by Senate ] \nAn outcry from Democrats ensued, spawning social-media hashtags including #letlizspeak and #shepersisted, the latter a reference to McConnell’s statement that Warren was “warned” that she shouldn’t attempt to read King’s letter but “persisted” anyway.\nNow, it’s Warren who is putting Republicans — and everyone else — on notice, tweeting Wednesday night:\nThere’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly & clearly: This is just the beginning.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 \n\nIf Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 \n\nConsider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:18:18.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
