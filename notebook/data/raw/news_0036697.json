Hormones which are crucial in developing a mother-child bond are also present in men, a new study has discovered. Oxytocin, known as the ‘cuddle hormone’, increases empathy and motivation to care for a child, and helps synchronise a father’s emotions with that of his children. The hormone is released by mothers while they breastfeed and cuddle their babies. But experts have now realised it surges in fathers as they hold their children or play with them. The 'cuddle hormone' Oxytocin, which is crucial in developing a mother-child bond are also present in men, according to researchers in Atlanta, Georgia (file photo) The study, by Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, raises the possibility that oxytocin could be artificially given to fathers who are failing to bond with their children. It is available in a simple nasal spray. Earlier this week a separate study suggested that at least 30,000 British fathers suffer from depression following the birth of a child. One of the causes of post-natal depression, which has never been recognised in men before, is thought to be a failure to bond.
