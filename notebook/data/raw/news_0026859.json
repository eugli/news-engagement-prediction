RUDRAPUR: Addressing his first election rally in Kumaon's Udham Singh Nagar on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi exhorted voters to give the BJP \"a comfortable majority in Uttarakhand\" so that \"we can take up the task of translating Atal Bihar Vajpayee 's vision of Uttarakhand into a reality.\" \"I am confident that exactly a month from now, Uttarakhand will celebrate 'vijayotsav' (victory day) after BJP sweeps the polls in the state,\" he told the assembled crowd at the rally grounds in Kiccha Bypass road in Rudrapur. In a direct attack at CM Harish Rawat, Modi said that the state will soon be rid of corruption and the 'Harda tax' referring to the CM who is often called 'Harda'. \"Harish Rawat has been busy in making money through a nexus of illegal mining, liquor policies and transfer politics. He was involved in negotiating deals to save his government which was caught in a sting video. It is clear that every citizen of the state is paying a 'Harda tax',\" said Modi. He also took a swipe at the recent videos which showed Rawat as the hero of the movie 'Bahubali.' He added that being termed a Bahubali was \"not exactly a compliment but still some leaders in the state are referring to themselves in this manner.\" Earlier, Modi reached the rally ground at 3:15 pm, delayed by around two hours. He started his address by offering salutations to \"devbhoomi, the land of brave warriors.\" He also called Rudrapur a \"mini India which has a diverse demographic profile with people from various parts of the country settled here.\" He shared with the crowd the news that the MLC election results of three seats in UP, namely Bareilly, Gorakhpur and Kanpur had been swept by the BJP.\" \"I was in Badaun when I got the news, this result shows that Congress-SP alliance has lost people's faith and people trust BJP only. It will be a similar scenario in Uttarakhand too. Seeing the crowds in Rudrapur, I can sense which way the wind is blowing,\" Modi said. Surgical strikes and OROP also formed the basis of his address as in Haridwar on Friday in order to target the substantial defence voters -estimated at around 30% of the electorate. Modi reiterated that if a \"double engine\" was implemented in U'khand- BJP's government in the state working in tandem with the Centre - many development projects including the ambitious Rs 12,000 crore all-weather char dham road that was lunched by him in Dehradun over a month ago would be \"completed ahead of schedule.\" He also talked about his government's initiatives like Start-up India, Make-in India as well as skill development schemes in an apparent attempt to connect with the crowd which comprised mainly of those associated with the industrial and agri-based economy of Udham Singh Nagar. \"I want to develop this district on the lines of London,\" Modi said. He added, \"My fight is not against those in small business, but against the officers and babus who have been looting the poor for decades. Corruption and black money will have to go, come what may. Like Atal ji who faced difficulties in implementing his vision for Uttarakhand because of resistance from the state government, I am also facing a similar problem since the last two and a half years.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
