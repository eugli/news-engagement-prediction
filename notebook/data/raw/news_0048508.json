Lavar Ball loves his son, Lonzo, and is clearly proud of everything he has accomplished as freshman at UCLA. But this is an insane take bordering… — warriorsworld (@warriorsworld) February 19, 2017 \nYeah, no. \nLonzo Ball is great. He'll be a top-five pick in next year's draft. But Steph Curry would average a billion points in college. A billion. College 3s would be like free throws for him. It just wouldn't be fair. \nCurry averaged 21.5 points a game as a freshman. Ball is averaging 15.5. Also, Curry dragged Davidson to an Elite 8. Let's see how far Ball takes UCLA before we even start with these ridiculously unfair comparisons. We're not even talking about college Steph Curry. We're talking about current Steph Curry, who is the two-time defending NBA MVP and the greatest shooter any of us have ever seen. \nIt's hard to compare Ball to even college-aged Curry, who was fantastic from the moment he stepped on campus. He dropped 30 on a good Maryland team in his first NCAA tournament game. He was unstoppable in the tournament as a sophomore. In his junior season, one team triple-teamed him all game. That's how good he was back then . Now he's eight years better. \nGood dad. Bad take.
