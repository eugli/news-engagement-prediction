This might be one of the few devices released with Android 4.4.4 KitKat on board that will get not two, but three major OS updates throughout its life cycle.At least one carrier has confirmed that it is now testing Android 7.0 Nougat update for the original Samsung Galaxy A5, and that it expects to complete the testing this month. If all goes well, Australian carrier Optus might start deploying the update in February.We believe other carriers from around the world are testing the update as well, so if you still own a carrier-branded Galaxy A5 , then you might want to check with your network operator and ask when it plans to release the update.As for the unlocked Galaxy A5 units, they are usually the first to receive the update, but exceptions happen from time to time, so there's no telling when Samsung will kick off the rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat for these devices.The bottom line is Samsung Galaxy A5 will certainly be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat, and that could happen in a matter of weeks, not months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:37:02.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
