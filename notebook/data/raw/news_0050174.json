COWS \nAs the first step to recover their cows, the herdsmen had ordered closure of all their cattle markets in Ibarapa areas. \nReacting to the incident, Chief Oladapo said: “We are aware of what Fulani herdsmen are doing in Oke Ogun and Ibarapa areas of Oyo State.” \nCorroborating the hunters’ leader’s stance, Idris who is the National President of Soludero Hunters Association of Nigeria, said: “We are calling on all Fulani herdsmen to comport themselves and not disturb Oyo State’s peace.’’ \nWe have to make rituals so that their killing instincts will not gain ground in Oyo as they do in other places. All of us – Christians Muslims and traditional worshippers – have to pray so that peace will reign in this state. All adherents of all these three religions have to come together to pray.” \nHowever, he warned the herdsmen not to foment trouble but should behave orderly for the issue to be resolved.’’ Nwafor Polycarp ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:19:59.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
