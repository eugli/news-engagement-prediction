After finishing the test, they were given a couple of minutes to while away the time - with their movements secretly filmed – before being asked to complete a series of word games and a questionnaire about their attachment to their mobile. Analysis showed that those separated from their phones were more likely to display heartbeat patterns often associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. During the short break, three quarters of those left without a mobile exhibited displacement behaviour, such as fidgeting and scratching, which are telltale signs of stress and 20 per cent were drawn towards the cupboard. Test analysis showed those who'd been separated from their phones displayed heartbeat patterns associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Among those allowed to keep their devices, the figures were 47 per cent and 0 per cent respectively. However, the effects tended to be moderated where participants had been given a different phone. Questionnaire responses elicited evidence that mobiles are used to relieve tension and impart feelings of confidence and security. The study – in the journal Computers And Human Behaviour – states: ‘We are in the middle of a nascent digital culture, with children being born into the world of smart devices. This age group was chosen because they are considered to be “cell phone natives”. ‘The results support that humans form attachment toward their mobile: they seek the proximity of the mobile and show stress response upon separation. ‘Separated individuals had different heart rate responses compared to unseparated participants. Furthermore, separated participants tried to repair proximity to their mobile. ‘They approached the cupboard where their mobile was placed more frequently than unseparated participants. ‘Interestingly, the presence of an unfamiliar mobile decreased the effects of separation from their own mobile, similarly to the calming effect of a stranger on children who are separated from the caregiver. ‘Naturally, adults have a higher tolerance of separation from attachment figures and a higher acceptance of other social partners. There are now more active mobile phones then people on the planet, and researchers warn youngsters are becoming more dependent then ever on their phones ‘Therefore, although they may be distressed upon separation from their mobile, an unfamiliar mobile has the potential to comfort them.’ There are now more active mobile accounts than people on the planet. And youngsters in particular are becoming ever more dependent on their phones. A recent survey found that 79 per cent of smartphone owners have theirs at hand for all but two of their waking hours. Other research has found that US young adults spend an average of 5.2 hours on them daily while one in eight UK users is showing signs of addiction. Dr Michael Sinclair, clinical director of the London-based City Psychology Group, said: ‘Young people are rarely without a mobile phone and can become incredibly reliant on them. ‘Where they may have once looked to their elders for comfort, reassurance, information and direction, they now get much of these from a smartphone. ‘The technology is wonderful, however, it’s a double-edged sword. All these things are more readily available on phones so users become more dependent on them. ‘They also encourage multi-tasking which is shown to affect concentration and encourages the mind to wander – and distraction is linked to unhappiness, anxiety and depression. ‘We are at the beginning of a fast-changing technological era and the effect on individuals, emotionally and behaviourally, could perhaps be quite profound.'
