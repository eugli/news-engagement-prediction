Each time construction crews went to work, churning the earth or building sound walls or tearing down overpasses to make way for new toll lanes and access roads, \"it was like an earthquake,\" said Valencia Jones Powell, who grew up along LBJ near Rosser Road. \n\"The house would shake,\" said the 54-year-old Powell, whose family moved from South Dallas to the Farmers Branch side of LBJ in the early 1970s, when that stretch of freeway was brand-new. \"It would literally shake .\" Homeowners living next to LBJ Express sue contractor for damage to walls, foundations \nBy the dozens, then the hundreds, northwest Dallas and Farmers Branch residents living along Interstate 635 pointed to the damage, asked for help, begged for compensation. Walls once smooth were being cracked in half; so, too, floors and bathroom counters. Ceilings, they said, rained down flecks of drywall. Trinity Infrastructure, the company overseeing construction of the $2.7-billion transportation project, would always maintain it was looking into it — while, at the same time, insisting that all was well. \nBut on Tuesday, a Dallas jury determined otherwise. \nAfter a weeklong trial, Aurora and Felipe Rodriguez were awarded $248,723 for damage caused to their home during construction of the LBJ Express project, which began in 2011 and ended, officially, in 2015. Aurora would later say she was stunned by the jury's decision, perhaps, in part, because the award was more than her attorney, Dean Gresham, was seeking.

One down, 223 to go. \nGresham said earlier this week that if he wins them all, Trinity Infrastructure could be on the hook for \"north of $60, $65 million\" in damages. \n\"Each house will be analyzed,\" he said of the trials ahead. \"Some are worth more; some less. But that's a good gauge. And that's assuming there are no punitive damages.\" \nAnd, he said, there's one other factor: Aurora and Felipe Rodriguez live a quarter mile from the LBJ Express site. Most of the other plaintiffs in this case live along the freeway on the north and south sides. \n\"And most are on the first row,\" he said, meaning the freeway and the sound barrier planted during construction sit directly behind them. \"It's about 150 homes, and their damage was much more significant.\" \nGiven the amount of homes involved, attorneys on both sides chose four cases to serve as bellwethers, a common practice when there's a significant number of plaintiffs attached to a single case. The theory is that one verdict will predict others down the road. \nGresham said Thursday he expected this week's verdict to nudge Trinity Infrastructure toward a settlement, since the Rodriguezes live farther from LBJ than most of the other plaintiffs. Maria Cazares is one of more than 200 plaintiffs claiming the LBJ Express project ruined her home.

This, she said, happened shortly after construction on the road project started in 2011. (David Woo/Staff photographer) \nBut Trinity Infrastructure's representative said Friday that the company has no interest in settling — at least, not at the moment. The company said all work was done \"in accordance\" with the Texas Department of Transportation's plans and specifications, and that it \"stands behind the integrity\" of the work. \n\"While Trinity remains sympathetic to these types of claims, we are disappointed with the verdict,\" spokeswoman Heather DeLapp said by email. \"Evidence clearly demonstrated that construction activities did not cause the alleged damages and that the wrong decision was reached. Trinity intends to appeal the matter and is confident the appellate courts will ultimately reach the correct decision.\" \nValencia Jones Powell said Friday that she felt \"vindicated\" by the verdict. Her case is next up -- but not until June, more than likely. She's champing at the bit to take her seat on the witness stand. \n\"This has been a long fight for justice for my mother,\" Powell said. \nHer mother, Sara Jones, is 84 and suffering from Alzheimer's and other ailments. She had a nervous breakdown, her daughter said, caused by the construction that once took place at all hours behind their house on Kerr Trail, which backs up to LBJ. Sara Jones no longer lives in the house in which she's resided for close to 50 years. Her daughter said that's because it's no longer safe for her mother or a home health aide. \n\"There are cracks in the ceiling — what if it fell in?\" she said. \"There are cracks in the tile floor — she could trip and fall. And you could see through a crack in the wall; light would shine through. You should have seen the AC bills, the plumbing bills. In the guest bathroom, the granite counter-top cracked in half. It was the most amazing thing.\" \nThen -- \"to pour salt in the wound,\" Powell said — crews would shine stadium lights in her mother's house at all hours to expedite work on the project. It could look like noon at midnight. Valencia Jones Powell said this is what the back of her mother's house looked like during construction on the LBJ Express. (Courtesy Valencia Jones Powell) \nPowell said she and other neighbors often complained to Trinity Infrastructure and officials in Farmers Branch and Dallas, but that their pleas went unheeded. Finally, she said, she went looking for an attorney and found Gresham. One case eventually became more than 200. \nAnd attorneys say there are still others affected by the construction who did not step up, either because they're elderly, infirm or don't speak English. Powell said a neighbor of her mother's never filed suit simply because he didn't think he would win. \n\"But God does not like ugly,\" Powell said. \"They have taken advantage of innocent people, old people, people who don't have the same power and control. They wanted us to give up, to go away, I can't even tell you. But I am ready. I am ready to sit on that stand and tell my mother's story.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:12:35.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
