Berta Vázquez and Mario Casas in Palm Trees In The Snow . Courtesy of Warner Bros. Netflix is good for many things: discovering endlessly bingeable shows you wouldn’t have known about otherwise, making a good excuse to invite people over for sex , and on that note, if you watch the right things, broadening your sexual horizons. Given the breadth of Netflix options, it should come as no surprise that the streaming service offers plenty of movies hot enough to make you fan yourself. Even better, there’s something for everyone, no matter what you’re into. Here, 11 sexy movies on Netflix that are so worth your time. 1. Palm Trees In The Snow This Spanish historical romance takes a look back in time at the relationship between Killian (Mario Casas) and Bisila (Berta Vázquez), an interracial couple who needs to keep their connection secret due to the prejudices of the time. Tune in for intrigue that persists throughout generations, plus the intense sex scene that opens the film. 2. Weekend Lose yourself in this movie about Russell, played by Tom Cullen, and Glen, played by Chris New, two men who spend 48 hours together after running into one another in a nightclub. It’s one of those movies that provides just a snapshot into people’s lives, but in a powerful enough way to leave a lasting impression. Another thing that will leave a lasting impression: the sex scenes, which are of the frenzied, just-met-you-but-have-to-have-you sort. 3. Blue Is The Warmest Color You’ll laugh, cry, and maybe want to fall madly in love with someone who takes you to new sexual heights, just as Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos) and Emma (Léa Seydoux) do in this film. Adèle starts out having a dalliance with a male classmate of hers, but she soon becomes involved with blue-haired Emma, who shows her what it truly means to love someone , body and soul. 4. Anatomy Of A Love Seen Mal (Jill Evyn) and Zoe (Sharon Hinnendael) start an intense relationship after working on a movie together, fittingly playing the role of lovers. All is well and good until they break up but need to reunite to re-shoot the very love scene that brought them together in the first place. 5. Y Tu Mamá Tambien This one’s a modern classic for a reason. Y Tu Mamá Tambien tells the story of two best friends, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael García Bernal), who have the kind of closeness that only comes about when growing up together. After they meet a woman named Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the three embark upon a road trip. Spoiler alert: Expect a lot of sexual tension building up to a pretty explosive threesome . 6. Cruel Intentions If you like your sex with a side of scheming, this one’s for you. Cruel Intentions revolves around a crew of wealthy teenagers with entirely too much time on their hands, plus rollercoaster hormones to boot. Devious Sebastian (Ryan Philippe) and his step-sister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who together have some intensely weird sexual attraction, bet that Sebastian can’t have sex with the headmaster’s daughter (Reese Witherspoon). Extremely manipulative hijinks ensue. 7. Sex And Lucia With a name like this, how could this movie not be hot? Sex And Lucia focuses on the complicated, intertwined relationships of protagonist Lucia, played by Paz Vega, and her boyfriend Lorenzo, played by Tristán Ulloa. It features a sex-on-the-beach-under-the-moonlight scene, and if that weren’t enough to sway you, Rotten Tomatoes says it has a lot of “gratuitous nudity .” 8. I Am Love Tilda Swinton stars as Emma, a Russian woman living in Milan and heading up her influential family, which has made a name for itself in the industrial realm. But problems arise when she meets Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a chef who turns her world—and her family’s— completely upside down . 9. Frida This stunning biopic charts the life of revered Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, played by Salma Hayek. Amidst all her creative passion, the movie showcases her sexual passion as well, both with her husband Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) and various male and female lovers. 10. On The Road Based on Jack Kerouac's book of the same name, this movie is chock-full of all sorts of sex. After Sal (Sam Riley), who is dealing with the loss of his father, runs into Dean (Garrett Hedlund) and Marylou (Kristen Stewart), they set off on various adventures together, many of which involve intense sexual exploration . 11. Shakespeare In Love This dreamy love story, helmed by Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, is perfect for anyone who finds sex is its best when they’re head over heels in love . The movie starts out with Shakespeare (Fiennes) working his way through a severe lack of inspiration. But he soon stumbles upon Lady Viola (Paltrow), who refuses to let her gender stop her from acting as Romeo in Shakespeare’s new play, “Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.\" Soon, she becomes his muse, and multiple bodice-ripping love scenes follow.
