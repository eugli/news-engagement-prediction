On April 21, he’ll make a stop at the University of Tennessee for a show. \nTosh bears a striking resemblance to former Vols coach Lane Kiffin , who is not the most popular man on the Knoxville campus. So it only made sense for Tosh to request some extra security for the show. hey @utknoxville will i need extra security on the off chance people think i’m lane kiffin? #vols https://t.co/Pm1zrxlZMH \n— daniel tosh (@danieltosh) February 15, 2017 \nBased on the university’s response, it’s clear the folks in Knoxville still haven’t gotten over Kiffin ditching them for the head coaching job at USC back in 2010.
