What an exciting moment. \nI’ve loved this past week of being a Barstool Employee. From the moment that “press” conference went live last week my life hasn’t been the same. Huge shoutout to Greg Olsen, Adam Vinatieri, and Ian Rapaport for being a part of the most ridiculous retirement announcement in the history of professional athletics. \nBut, seriously this shit’s been wild. My brain hasn’t fully come around to the idea that I can say/do whatever the fuck I want, but it’s getting there. I’m so incredibly lucky to join Barstool, I hope you all understand that I understand that. And on that note, I hope you enjoy my perspective on things. \nMost of the time when athletes who have a personality retire, they join the big TV networks. Those networks in turn, put a muzzle on them when it comes to certain things. Not Barstool tho cuz. So Imma just keep it real with my thoughts. Some of you will probably hate them, but to be honest you and I probably wouldn’t have gotten along anyways, so I don’t really give a shit.. \nLet’s get started.. Last night on NFL Network Deion Sanders decided to take a shot at the Indianapolis Colts. My former employer. He mentioned that The Colts were stealing signals from other teams’ offenses and using it to their advantage.. he said it was cheating.. Tony Dungy spoke at length this morning about it, but the actual guy that Deion took a shot at was the guy calling the plays for the defense. The Mike linebacker who would’ve been the one changing the plays and such… That man, was Gary Brackett.. Gary tweeted about it this morning, so I asked him if he would chat with me about it all.. We addressed the cheating allegation, and he also spit some knowledge about football that I think you’ll be interested in hearing.. \nHe said Tom Brady is “unarguably” the greatest QB of all time.. So Patriots fans, know that you’ll enjoy this as well. Here’s the first edition of #2Stools2Beers… Viva cuz.
