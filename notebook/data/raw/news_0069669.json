MacLean's lawyer, Joel Sellers, said during the sentencing hearing in Pictou provincial court Tuesday that his client regrets what happened, but maintains he did not intentionally bite Paul Gaudet's nose.\nThe defence had argued during trial that MacLean, 49, was acting in self defence during a drunken fight on Oct. 14, 2014, and latched onto Gaudet's nose in a desperate bid to balance himself and stay upright. \n\n\"Apart from acrobats … nobody keeps his balance with his teeth,\" Atwood wrote in his decision. \"People will use their arms, hands, legs or otherwise contort themselves when they need to maintain balance. People do not bite into other people to maintain posture.\" \nThe deep bite exposed cartilage, an emergency room doctor testified, and left a \"partial amputation to the tip of the nose.\"\nDoctors were able to save and re-attach Gaudet's nose tip. \n' Nobody keeps his balance with his teeth,' says judge in convicting Randall Edwin MacLean \nwith files from CBC © The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:01:26.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
