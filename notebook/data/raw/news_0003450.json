I will do everything in my power to help return the Lakers to their rightful place among the elite teams of the NBA.” \nTerms of the agreement were not disclosed. \nThe announcement comes as the Lakers (17-34) sit near the bottom of the Western Conference standings. \nWith the team on the verge of missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, pressure is mounting among fans to replace either Lakers executive vice president and co-owner Jim Buss or general manager Mitch Kupchak, or both. \nThe Lakers last year revoked Johnson’s honorary title as vice president in an attempt to clarify his role with the team. Johnson had asked the Lakers to revoke the title, ESPN reported. \nJohnson sold his 4.5 percent stake in the Lakers in 2010 to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:14:59.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
