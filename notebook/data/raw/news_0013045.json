However, I cannot elaborate further,\" he said when contacted Tuesday. \nMedia personnel at the airport's arrival hall, however, saw no sign of the man. \nHailing from Penang, Selva Kumar is the third among four siblings. He has two older brothers and a younger sister. \nHe comes from a family of educationists, his late father was a senior education officer in the Penang Education Department while a late brother was a teacher from a primary school in the state. \nInspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said last week that police would closely monitor Selva Kumar upon his arrival in Malaysia. \nKhalid added that police were looking into the possibility of recruiting community groups to help keep an eye on him. \nMalaysian police have also asked their Canadian counterparts for his criminal record. \nSelva Kumar had unsuccessfully tried to block Canadian newspaper Toronto Star from publishing details of his parole hearing in June last year and his photo, arguing that it would be dangerous for him. \nHe had claimed that he would be a victim of discrimination in Malaysia because he is Jewish. \nThe newspaper had argued that it was important for his victims to know the details of the case and what he looked like now. \nSelva Kumar came to Canada as a student in 1980 and his visa was extended after he was sponsored by a spouse. \nHe was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women in the late 1980s and early 1990s while posing as a modelling agent, movie producer and professional dancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:04:43.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
