You can now get the iPhone 7 from as low as RM1,363. The catch? You will need to sign up for a contract under a Celcom Postpaid plan – Celcom First Gold Plus or Celcom First Platinum. \nFrom now until 31 March 2017, get the iPhone 7 from Celcom at a further discounted price at RM1,363 (32GB), RM1,783 (128GB) and RM2,213 (256GB). The prices before this were RM1,688, RM2,108 and RM2,538 respectively. The bundle will tie you up to a 24-month contract. \nThis promotion is only valid until 31 March 2017. After that, it will revert back to its old price, so visit a Celcom store now. You can also get it from Celcom’s online store . Sadly, if you were hoping to get the iPhone 7 Plus, Celcom currently does not have any promotion for it. \nAlternatively, if you do not wish to pay so much when you sign up for an iPhone 7 bundle, Celcom is also offering the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with NewPhone. NewPhone iPhone allows you to walk away with a brand new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus without paying thousands of Ringgit upon signing up. You can even upgrade to a new device after 12 months. Check out Celcom for more information about its iPhone 7 promotion .
