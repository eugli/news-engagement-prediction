'Not a normal case' \nMyanmar is a major producer of methamphetamine, usually smuggled from the north-east to neighbouring countries. \nIt is also the world's second biggest producer of opium, from which heroin is derived. \n\"This is not a normal case, and when we were informed that the monk was arrested, we were all shocked,\" said Kyaw Mya Win, a township police officer. \nAsked about the case, the director general of the Religious Affairs Ministry, Soe Min Tun, acknowledged some surprise. \n\"It is not a very common case, but not impossible to happen. What will happen to the monk is that he will have to give up his monkhood right away and face trial as an ordinary person,\" he said. \nPolice said they were still questioning the monk on Tuesday. \nLast year, Myanmar officials seized 21 million methamphetamine pills, with a street value around $46.6 million, near the border with China in the biggest such seizure in recent memory. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:43:45.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
