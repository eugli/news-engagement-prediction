However, the lady has been making news since past couple of days for totally wrong reasons. As per reports, Urvashi has been literally stalking Hrithik Roshan to the extent of calling him up at 3am! Another story mentioned that she has been constantly badgering him for a film. The actress apparently does not have a film in hand right now, and is very keen to do a film with Hrithik. The piece of news had surprised quite a few people in the industry. In fact, gossip was also doing the rounds that she went uninvited for Manish Malhotra’s birthday party.

She is a Miss India Universe and her songs have got millions of hits. Urvashi gets paid to attend the events of any brand or label. The rumours of her making calls to Hrithik Roshan for another film is absolutely rubbish. She does not call up people to ask for work. Urvashi’s team enters into discussions with producers and a joint decision is taken. These are stories are absolutely ridiculous. Urvashi does not come from a film family and is a soft target. It is irresponsible journalism to defame a woman like this and earn attention. Publications talk about being responsible and respecting women and this is what they write about.” (Also Read: Urvashi Rautela: I am an actress and I want to do films but had to do Haseeno Ka Deewana coz couldn’t say no to Hrithik Roshan) \nAfter participating in a number of beauty pageants, Urvashi entered the glam industry. She became a known name after being featured in Yo Yo Honey Singh’s music video, Love Dose. Urvashi’s hot avatar in Sanam Re and performance in Great Grand Masti also earned her a lot of appreciation. “She does not come from a film family. It is her hard work that is getting her more projects in the industry. Urvashi is quite busy with corporate shows and events,” said her PR.
