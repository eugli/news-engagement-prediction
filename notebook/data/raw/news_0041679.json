By Paul S. Makishima Globe Staff February 20, 2017 \nIt was high political drama played out over social media. \nAfter video emerged this weekend showing Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos casting sexual relationships between older men and “boys’’ in a positive light, an influential conservative group rescinded its invitation to the right-wing provocateur to speak at its annual gathering this week, and publisher Simon & Schuster dropped plans to publish his book. Advertisement \nMatt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chairman, tweeted a statement Monday disinviting Yiannopoulos from the group’s Conservative Political Action Conference. \n“Due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia, the American Conservative Union has decided to rescind the invitation,” he wrote. “We realize that Mr. Yiannopoulos has responded on Facebook, but it is insufficient. It is up to him to answer the tough questions and we urge him to immediately further address these disturbing comments.’’ Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

News emerged of the deal in December. Advertisement \nThe publisher said previously it would stand by its decision to publish the book because, while it didn’t necessarily agree with the opinions of all of its authors, it sought to promote a diversity of points of view. \nReports also emerged Monday evening that Yiannopoulos’s future at Breitbart might be in jeopardy. Several newsroom staffers told managers that they would leave if Yiannopoulos were allowed to remain, two unnamed people familiar with the organization told The Washington Post. \nThe Yiannopoulos video was tweeted out Sunday by the Reagan Battalion, a conservative blog. In it Yiannopoulos describes a sexual relationship he had when he was younger with a Catholic priest and he goes on to say: “In the homosexual world particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men — the sort of coming of age relationships in which those older men have helped those young boys to discover who they are. . .’’ \nOn his Facebook page Yiannopoulos sought to clarify his position. “I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a co-ordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject. \n“If it somehow comes across (through my own sloppy phrasing or through deceptive editing) that I meant any of the ugly things alleged, let me set the record straight: I am completely disgusted by the abuse of children.’’ \nHe noted that his own personal relationship took place “when I was 17 with a man who was 29. The age of consent in the UK is 16.’’ \nThe disclosure of the clips ignited calls online for CPAC to reconsider its invitation. \nNed Ryun, a member of the board of the American Conservative Union, organizer of CPAC, opposed having Yiannopoulos speak, tweeting on Monday, “This isn’t about free speech. This is about decency.’’ Paul S. Makishima can be reached at Loading comments...
