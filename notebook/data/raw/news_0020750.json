How Grace Learned To Play Ukulele \nIn the video above, Grace shows us how to play \"I Don't Know My Name\" on the ukulele, an instrument she learned to play by watching YouTube tutorials at home at 11 years old. \"I didn't teach myself. Like, I wasn't like, 'Oh, that sounds good.' YouTube taught me. The internet is an amazing place nowadays. I first started off on YouTube tutorials, and then I started to recognize the chords. So, I more learned it at home, rather than myself.\" \nUkulele isn't the only instrument that Grace knows how to play. She recently started to learn to play the guitar. But instead of YouTube, she got herself a teacher this time. And she has a great guitar to play now, because Shawn Mendes recently gifted her one . \n\"I didn't [want to learn at first]. But then I have a teacher who taught me how to play a song, and a few things on the guitar, and I actually really liked it. I didn't want to admit it, but I did. So, it's really nice. It's definitely easier having a teacher rather than [learning] online because then when I learn a song, and there's something I'm having trouble with, I can be like, 'Hey, I'm having trouble with this. Can you help me?'\" The Recording Process for Grace's First EP Perfectly Imperfect \nFor her debut EP, Grace tells us that Perfectly Imperfect was a lot of fun to put together. \"I thought it was gonna be so much more stressful and [more] work than it was. I didn't realize that it would be so much fun. Obviously, there was hard work that got put into it from me and Greg [Wells], and everyone who was involved. But it was a lot of fun in the making.\" \nMany might already be familiar with Grace's single \"I Don't Know My Name,\" and as you're exploring her EP, you will definitely want to give her song \"Gossip Girl\" a listen -- it's Grace's favorite. She tells us of the track, \"I like all the little different effects it has with the whispering. I like the sound of it. It's also always been my favorite, even before we recorded it, because I really like how kind of dark it is, rather than a lot of my other songs.\" Her Plans on a Full-Length Album & Jingle Ball Experience \nWith such tremendous talent at such a young age, the future looks extremely bright for Grace. During America's Got Talent, Simon Cowell called the 13-year-old (12 at the time) \"the next Taylor Swift.\" Grace says of the compliment, \"Hearing, 'You're the next Taylor Swift,' at first, I didn't realize when it was happening, how big of a deal it was. And I was just like, 'Okay.' And then it spread like a wildfire, and I'm so grateful. It's like the best compliment anyone could give you.\" \nSo what's next for Grace? She hopes to put out a full-length album at some point, and go out on tour. She already got a taste of performing at New York City's iconic Madison Square Garden where she treated the crowd to a quick version of \"I Don't Know My Name\" during the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour. She says of the experience, \"Since there's a crowd behind you, and everything, it's like echoing in your ears, everyone. And that's why it was so amazing. I could hear all around me, everyone singing. It was a really amazing experience.\" She adds, \"I felt like a superstar.\" Watch Grace perform \"I Don't Know My Name,\" \"Gossip Girl\" and a cover of Alessia Cara's \"Scars To Your Beautiful\" on the Honda Stage below: \"I Don't Know My Name\" \"Gossip Girl\" \"Scars To Your Beautiful\" (Alessia Cara Cover) \nPhotos: Rachel Kaplan for iHeartRadio ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T21:34:34.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
