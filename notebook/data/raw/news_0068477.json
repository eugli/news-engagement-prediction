(Facebook)  51 PM \nNewly released court documents in the murder of New Jersey 19-year-old Sarah Stern suggest her alleged killer confessed to plotting his classmate’s death so that he could steal money she had recently received. \nLiam McAtasney, a 19-year-old from Neptune City, supposedly confessed to a friend in a taped recording that he strangled Stern, a longtime friend, in her home on Dec. 2 and then stole about $7,000 from her, according to arrest affidavits cited by NJ.com . \nPrior to the murder, McAtasney and Stern took a trip to the bank where she recovered a safety deposit box containing her thousands. \nThe documents don’t indicate whether or not Stern voluntarily went with her alleged killer to the bank or if he forced her to take out the safety deposit box. \nN.J. teen admitted to strangling Sarah Stern for 30 minutes \nIt’s also not clear how Stern got the money or why she’d been keeping it the deposit box. The documents only suggest McAtasney knew his pal had “recently come into possession of” money, according to the website. \nOnce they returned to Stern’s Neptune City home, McAtasney allegedly strangled her with so much force that he lifted her off the ground. He watched her take her final breaths, timing out exactly how long it took her to die.

COSTELLO/AP) \nThe 19-year-old then confessed to his friend that he took the box full of cash and buried it Sandy Hook. \nMcAtasney called his then-roommate, Preston Taylor, also 19, and asked him to move their friend’s body. When McAtasney returned, they took Stern’s body to the Belmar bridge and dumped it in Shark River, leaving her car behind atop the bridge, according to the affidavits. \nJudge refuses to release suspect in New Jersey teen's murder \nStern’s body has still not been found, but officers did find the safe buried at Sandy Hook and another containing pieces of Stern’s clothing buried in Shark River Park. \nThe information in the court documents comes from a taped recording between McAtasney and another friend — something his attorney, Charles Moriarity, believes sounds more like a “scripted” recounting of the fatal encounter as opposed to an actual recollection of the events. Preston Taylor listens as his defense attorney addresses the court during his detention hearing. (Peter Ackerman/AP) \nTaylor, who was also arrested in connection with the murder, reportedly gave police a statement confirming the contents of the recording, though his attorney has similarly challenged the reliability of his client’s statements given he is not yet aware of the circumstances surrounding the confession. \nMcAtasney and Taylor have both been charged with conspiracy, hindering apprehension and disposal of human remains. McAtasney was additionally charged with murder and felony murder. \nThe pair grew up in Neptune City with Stern, all three of them attending high school together. Taylor even took Stern to their junior prom. \nA judge ordered both men remain behind bars while they await their pending trial.
