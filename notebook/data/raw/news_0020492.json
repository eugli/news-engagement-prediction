Greg Abbott on Wednesday threatened to \"bring the hammer down on Dallas County\" if it acts on its new resolution welcoming unauthorized immigrants. \nThe symbolic resolution the Dallas County commissioners approved Tuesday may have put a chunk of its budget squarely in the crosshairs of Republican lawmakers in Austin and Washington who are determined to outlaw so-called sanctuary cities in Texas. \nThe commissioners essentially thumbed their noses at GOP state leaders' anti-sanctuary efforts, calling on local law enforcement agencies to \"end nonessential collaborations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" \n\"If anybody acts on that resolution to make Dallas a sanctuary city, if any sanctuary city policy is implemented in any way, the hammer will come down on them,\" Abbott said. Dallas County passes resolution welcoming unauthorized immigrants \nAbbott, who has cut funding to Travis County over the sheriff's sanctuary policy, said he would make it \"financially impossible\" for Dallas County to reduce its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But he acknowledged that the resolution alone wasn't an actual policy; he vowed to take action if any policies are enacted. \nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the move a stunning betrayal of what the American public wants and said it puts the community at risk. \nBut the tough talk didn't worry most of the commissioners, who said that the resolution is not legally binding and that Sheriff Lupe Valdez fully cooperates with federal immigration authorities at the Dallas County Jail. \n\"It's just politics,\" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. \"People in the Legislature want to show who's the toughest on immigration and these so-called sanctuary cities.\" \nDallas County's \"Welcoming Communities\" resolution came as state leaders are waging an all-out political assault on local governments that fail to enforce federal immigration laws. The Texas Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would cut millions in state funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, levy significant fines against them and make elected officials who promote such policies subject to criminal charges. Texas Senate approves measure to cut funds for sanctuary cities \nCritics of the anti-sanctuary movement, though, worry that it will spark fear in immigrant communities and harm the state's economy. Most of the state's big city police chiefs have opposed the ban, saying it would damage their relationships with immigrant communities they serve, making it harder for them to contact crime victims and witnesses. They also worry it could subject them and their officers to racial profiling lawsuits. \n\"We should remember that Texas, and this country, was made great by the hard work of so many people who came here from other places,\" said Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio. \nThe four Democratic Dallas County commissioners felt the need to pass the resolution, Jenkins said, to make immigrants feel safe calling 911, working with police and sending their kids to school. \nLawmakers will debate a new law banning sanctuary cities, but Abbott has already cut nearly $2 million in funding to Travis County after the sheriff there refused to reverse a policy she adopted that prohibits officers from asking about immigration status and declines to turn over all undocumented immigrants to federal officials. \nPatrick took to the airwaves Wednesday, telling a conservative talk show on WBAP-AM that he was \"stunned\" by Dallas County's resolution. \n\"They're putting the citizens of Dallas County and the greater area at risk,\" Patrick said. \"I don't think they understand we're serious about putting an end to this.\" \nBut most of the Dallas County commissioners weren't concerned. They insisted that the county was compliant with ICE requests, and wasn't changing anything, despite the resolution's call to \"end nonessential cooperation.\" The county's legal advisers reviewed the resolution in advance, Jenkins said, even though it carries no legal weight. \n\"Hell, I wish I could hold everybody to the resolution,\" Commissioner John Wiley Price said. \"Hell, we'd have [slavery] reparations by now.\" \nCommissioner Theresa Daniel said she, too, wasn't concerned. \n\"We're in 100 percent total compliance with federal law,\" she said, adding that she sees the Austin lawmakers' actions as \"posturing.\" \nAbbott declared banning sanctuary cities an emergency issue for the legislative session. He and other Republican supporters of the ban worry that if local governments allow unauthorized immigrants who are criminals to go free, they could victimize others. \nSen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, author of the bill the Senate approved Wednesday, said the measure is about enforcing the \"rule of law.\" \n\"Government's role is to protect good and to punish evil,\" he said. \"It's to provide a basis for social stability so that we, as a nation, can have a viable vibrant place to discuss the gospel.\" \nNot all state lawmakers opposed the county resolution. \n\"I'm hopeful that leaders in Texas will see this resolution for what it is: an attempt to quell the fears of children and parents living in an unfriendly political climate,\" said Rep. Victoria Neave, D-Dallas. \"Texas veterans and crime victims should not bear the burden of a political fight created by statewide politicians.\" \nUnder the Senate bill, local governments would lose state grant funding and face steep fines if they adopt policies that prevent local officers from enforcing immigration laws. They would also be punished for failing to honor all detainer requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Detainers are nonbinding requests to keep suspected unauthorized immigrants in jail after their release date so that federal officials can ascertain whether the person should be deported. \nThe bill would apply major fines to agencies that adopt sanctuary policies. An initial violation would bring a fine of up to $1,500. For each continuing day the offending policy is in place, the agency could be fined up to $25,500 per day. Law enforcement agencies could also face civil suits from crime victims if they are hurt by an individual who was released by police despite the existence of an immigration detainer. \nUpping the ante for police leaders who adopt sanctuary policies, the bill would also make sheriffs and police chiefs subject to a Class A misdemeanor for doing so. That could mean a fine of up to $4,000 and a year in jail if the district attorney presses charges. \nIf it becomes law, cities and counties that adopt sanctuary policies could face a double whammy from Texas and the Trump administration. The president signed an executive order that would also rescind federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions. \nU.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he supports the state proposals and expects more action from Washington to rein in sanctuary cities. \n\"We are all obligated to support the law, especially if you are a law enforcement officer, a county sheriff or local police official. You are duty-bound to enforce the law,\" he said. \"That's not just local and state law. That includes federal law.\" \nU.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, also lodged his displeasure with the resolution on Twitter. I refuse to stand by & let this misguided, lawless resolution undermine our nation's laws and endanger our families. https://t.co/9aZQOukiyx — Pete Sessions (@PeteSessions) February 8, 2017 View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:11:12.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
