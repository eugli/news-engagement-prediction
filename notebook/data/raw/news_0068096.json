He was one of two African-American families in town, but didn't experience much racism. That would change when he signed with the Phillies in 1960, and made his major league debut in 1963. Playing and living in Philadelphia wasn't easy for the Allen family.\n\"My father was fearful for us,\" Allen Jr. explained. \"It was one of those things, for my mother, he would tell her to sit somewhere so when he would go off the field he could make sure she was all right. He also felt like, 'If they'll hurt me, they'll hurt my family.' \"\nAllen was labeled as a controversial figure in large part because of Philadelphia's lack of acceptance of an African-American star and the way Allen conducted himself with the media. With constant tension and threats surrounding the slugger, he somehow managed to produce on the field.\n\"He said, 'I wasn't going to let it beat me,' \" Allen Jr. said of a recent conversation he had with his father. \"He kind of internalized it and made him stronger.\"\nAs for that production, Dick Allen was a seven-time All-Star and the American League MVP while with the White Sox in 1972. For an 11-year period, the former Phillie was one of the most dangerous offensive threats in baseball. Allen's offensive wins against replacement ranked him first among position players, ahead of Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, and Joe Morgan according to the blog Dick Allen Belongs in the Hall of Fame. Bill Jenkinson, a baseball historian, confidently called Allen, \"The most powerful hitter in the last half century in American baseball.\"\nWith those numbers and plenty more, Dick Allen has not been elected into the baseball Hall of Fame. It's well-documented that Allen is one of the best players not inducted into Cooperstown. Mark Carfagno, the campaign director for Dick Allen Belongs in the Hall of Fame committee, said the slugger is one of the most misunderstood players in professional sports.\n\"When he played, he was controversial. He didn't speak to the writers,\" Carfagno said. \"The writers voted for 15-years and the percentages were real low. All of a sudden he goes to the Veteran's Committee and he misses by one vote. So, what does that tell you?\"\nAllen retired in 1977 and was on the BBWA Hall of Fame Ballot for 15 years beginning in 1982. The highest percentage Allen ever received in his 15-years was 18.9 percent. The requirement to get voted in is 75%. Allen then qualified for the Veterans Committee Ballot, which considers players not eligible for the BBWA ballot. This process consists of 16 voters, in which media members only account for four votes. Eight players and four executives make up the other 12 votes and again, 75 percent of the vote is needed. In 2014, Allen fell one vote shy of enshrinement.\nAlthough heartbreak set in after the decision in 2014, Carfagno remains driven to get Dick Allen into the Hall of Fame.\n\"He's a very dear friend of mine,\" Carfagno said of his motives. \"In the mid-60s I was a teen and probably went to 40 games a year. So, I saw half of those home runs.\"\nAllen is eligible for another ballot in September as one more quest for Cooperstown awaits. If Allen gets in, it'll be mission accomplished for Carfagno. \"It's one big party,\" he said.\nTo contribute, search \"Dick Allen Belongs in the Hall of Fame\" on Facebook.
