But there's, like, 300 boxes?!? \nIf you want to make sure your preferences are followed, ensuring the candidates you support have the strongest chance of being elected, you must number every box below the line. \nIf you are happy for your preferences to flow according to the voting tickets negotiated by the candidates and parties, you can vote above the line. All you need to do is put the number one in the box of the party whose ticket you support. Photo: The vote counting system gets complicated when preferences are distributed. (ABC News: Jade Macmillan) \nIf it sounds like hard work to vote below the line, it will be even more involved this year, given the record number (302) of people in the running for an Upper House seat. \nThat is almost double the number of candidates from the 2013 state election, with voters in the South Metropolitan region having 58 candidates to choose from on their ballot paper. \nUndoubtedly, voting above the line is quick, straightforward and popular — the WA Electoral Commission says more than 95 per cent of voters choose to do so — but it gives you a weaker chance of influencing the outcome. \n\"By voting above the line electors relinquish their right to determine their own order of preference,\" the spokesperson said. \n\"The electoral commission must then distribute preferences in accordance with the ticket submitted by that party or group.\" What are voting tickets? \nTo be listed above the line, a candidate or party must have lodged a voting ticket, which shows how their preferences should be distributed by the WAEC. \nGiven that such a high percentage of people vote above the line, these tickets are incredibly influential and often the result of complex negotiations by political parties. \nFor example, the WA Liberals have a deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation to preference PHON ahead of the WA Nationals in the Upper House in regional areas. \nSome microparties, like the Fluoride Free party and Flux the System, have also struck preference deals with each other with the hope of giving each of them a chance to win a seat in difference upper house regions. Do I have to follow a how-to-vote card? \nNo, it is entirely your choice how you decide to fill out your ballot paper. \nHow-to-vote cards indicate how political parties, candidates and interest groups would like you to vote. How does WA's Upper House election system differ from the Australian Senate's? \nBoth houses had the same system until new Senate voting laws were passed by the Australian Parliament last year. \nGroup voting tickets were abolished and above-the-line voters are required to number the boxes one to six. \nThe changes were introduced partly in response to the election of candidates who received a tiny proportion of the vote yet benefited from the preference deals they had negotiated, for example, Ricky Muir, of the Australian Motorist Enthusiast party, whose party received just 0.51 per cent of the vote. \nAs ABC election analyst Antony Green noted in his blog last year, the new system ensures that preferences are directed by voters and not the parties. \n\"What the changes did do was abolish the system of group voting tickets that had existed since 1984,\" he wrote. \n\"This ended the ability of parties to control and engage in preference deals with each other. Under the new system, the only between party preferences counted would be those filled in by voters themselves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:38:01.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
