After “La La Land” was announced as the winner of the long-expected best picture award and its team was in the middle of acceptance speeches, a commotion broke out on stage . “La La Land” had not won after all. Because of a mix-up — one of the presenters, Warren Beatty, blamed having the wrong results card — it turned out that the underdog “Moonlight” had not only pulled out a stunning upset but, for once, made it truly worth sitting to the end of a long, long awards show. Video Oscars Mix-Up: It’s ‘Moonlight,’ Not ‘La La Land’ “La La Land” was announced as the winner of the best picture Oscar, but then something bewildering happened. By ABC and A.M.P.A.S. on Publish Date February 27, 2017. . Watch in Times Video » embed The jaw-dropping live reversal of fortune came at the end of a night of celebration and politics dominated by references, overt and oblique, to the man who gave us last fall’s late-night TV shocker, President Trump, who was the first person thanked from the stage. “I mean, remember last year,” said the show’s host, Jimmy Kimmel, “when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” It was indeed just a year ago that the controversy hanging over the Oscars was #O scarsS oW hite , when no minority actors received nominations. This year, with a more diverse field of nominees — and controversy over race and xenophobia hanging over the entire country — the film industry was ready to turn its flagellation outward. \nAdvertisement The Oscars 2017: It’s not us — it’s him! Video Jimmy Kimmel Pokes at Trump and Streep The host was playful in his opening monologue. By ABC and A.M.P.A.S. on Publish Date February 26, 2017. . Watch in Times Video » embed Mr. Kimmel does less political material than many of his fellow late-night hosts. But he has a roastmaster streak that he showed off in a brisk, biting opening monologue . Announcing that the show was airing in “more than 225 countries that now hate us,” he congratulated in advance the winners who would “give a speech that the president of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5 a.m. bowel movement tomorrow.” There have been years in the past that the Oscars have been an uneasy blend of celebration and seriousness. This year, they were also a reminder that there are few escapes from politics in public life right now. But given the awards’ exclusionary history, maybe the strongest rejoinders to the political arguments of the day — over whom to let into the country, and to whom the culture belongs — were the winners. In addition to “Moonlight,” we saw Viola Davis win best supporting actress for her role in We saw a Muslim man win best supporting actor (Mahershala Ali, for “Moonlight” ). We saw the Italian-born Alessandro Bertolazzi dedicate his makeup award for “Suicide Squad” to “all the immigrants.” Video A Swipe at Trump in ‘The Salesman’ Oscar Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director, did not attend the ceremony in response to the president’s travel ban.

Watch in Times Video » embed We didn’t see the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose “The Salesman ” was named best foreign-language film, because he was boycotting the ceremony in protest of Mr. Trump’s ban against travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. But he sent a statement: “Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.” The broadcast will probably be polarizing, because what isn’t today? No one is entitled to an audience for political speech. Nor is anyone entitled to an awards show free of political speech. And the presidency of the guy who hosted “Celebrity Apprentice” is a tough time to argue “keep your politics out of it, celebs.” Video Gary From Chicago Steals the Show One of the tourists invited into the auditorium at the Academy Awards by the host Jimmy Kimmel, Gary became America’s new everyman. By ABC and A.M.P.A.S. on Publish Date February 27, 2017. . Watch in Times Video » embed The Oscars being a vast show, though, there was plenty of time for material that wasn’t topical. Mr. Kimmel brought a tour- bus group into the theater in a bit that felt endless. But it was a way to bring regular people to the party. One of the more moving appearances of the evening, in fact, was not a celebrity but Katherine Johnson, one of the African-American women whose contributions to the space program were celebrated in “Hidden Figures.” Her appearance illustrated the moving acceptance speech by Ms. Davis, who said that the actor’s job is to tell “the stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story On a night that Hollywood was collecting its hardware and feeling its voice, these moments reminded us that none of it would happen without the people who buy the tickets and live the stories.
