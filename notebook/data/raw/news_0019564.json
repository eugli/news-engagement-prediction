It is the latest report by a major university detailing its past with slavery, and the report sheds light on how slavery and slave-owners helped fund and shape the trajectory of Columbia over time. \n“From the outset, slavery was intertwined with the life of the college,” Foner wrote. \nFrom the 1700’s onward, many wealthy slave-holding New Yorkers provided substantial donations to King’s College — the predecessor to Columbia University. \nMany of the school’s governors also were investors in the slave trade too. \nFor example, one of the governors of King’s College from 1754 to 1776, John Watts, invested in ships engaged in the Atlantic Slave Trade, and was the owner of at least one ship that brought slaves from Africa to New York. \nAnother governor of King’s College, Nathaniel Marston, invested in at least 20 slaving voyages between 1716 and 1740, according to Foner’s report.

Lightfoot, a Columbia professor who often teaches about slavery, said, “It is of paramount importance for students to know that the history of slavery … bore clear connections to the institution from which they seek knowledge.” \nStudents “should know that their education and the privilege they derive from it stand on a complicated legacy of African bondage,” Professor Lightfoot told USA TODAY College. \nMatthew Vaz, a professor who completed his graduate work at Columbia, noted the historical contingency of slavery related to Columbia’s past. \n“The report reminds us that, while top universities often carry a presumption of enlightened progressivism, it is entirely possible that … these top universities may prove ready to avail themselves of whatever practices of exploitation and exclusion happen to be conventional at a given historical moment,” he told USA TODAY College. \n“Students should guard against that night and day,” Professor Vaz said. \nThe very first class on Columbia’s link to slavery was offered by Professor Karl Jacoby in 2013, and it’s a class that’s still being taught.

At Columbia, this semester’s selections include an English class on American slavery and a class on the relationship between slavery and finance in the 19th century, among others. \nLearning about Columbia’s relation to slavery doesn’t just teach us history, it teaches us about morality too, said Professor Jacoby. \n“One of the sobering aspects of studying slavery and Columbia is discovering how rarely students or faculty at Columbia pondered the morality of slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries,” Professor Jacoby told USA TODAY College. \n“Rather than seeing the Columbians of the past as morally numb and ourselves as somehow enlightened, we ought to wonder what moral issues of our own day are we not grappling with. What will the historians of the future say about us? How will they judge our responses to the great moral questions of today?” Toni Airaksinen is a student at Barnard College and a USA TODAY College correspondent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:48:15.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
