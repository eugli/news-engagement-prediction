Hosted at Northeastern’s Boston campus on Oct. 13-15, and live-streamed to Northeastern’s regional campuses across North America, the three-day conference will bring together more than 1,000 college students from more than 75 countries to discuss and develop effective solutions to pressing global challenges. \n“Northeastern is a global community of innovators and change-makers,” said Northeastern President Joseph E. Aoun. “It is the ideal institution to welcome representatives from around the world committed to social entrepreneurship and improving the human condition.” Northeastern is a global community of innovators and change-makers. It is the ideal institution to welcome representatives from around the world committed to social entrepreneurship and improving the human condition. Joseph E. Aoun Northeastern University President \nEach student participating in CGI U will identify a pressing global challenge in one of five areas: education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation, or public health. As part of the conference, students will collaborate to develop “commitments to action,” which are specific plans to address persistent global challenges. These plans often attract funding from third-party sources to support expansion and implementation of the commitments. \n“We are thrilled to work with Northeastern in bringing together students from all 50 states and around the world to make a meaningful and lasting difference for their communities and the world around us,” said Clinton Foundation President Donna E. Shalala. “CGI U is proud to inspire great ideas and turn them into action: students at CGI U don’t just discuss global challenges – they take real, concrete steps toward solving them.” \nOn the last day of the meeting, students will participate in a variety of community service opportunities with organizations throughout Greater Boston as part of the CGI U Day of Action. All participating students will attend CGI U free of charge. \n“Bringing CGI U to Northeastern will challenge and inspire students to explore the power of social enterprise to use business for global good,” said Cayman MacDonald, a Northeastern student who is president of the Social Enterprise Institute. “This is an awesome opportunity for our university, especially for students committed to bringing about meaningful change in the world.” \nSince 2008, CGI U has brought together more than 8,700 students from 940 schools, more than 145 countries and all 50 states, and nearly $3 million in funding has been awarded to these commitment-makers through CGI U. Prior host universities have included UC Berkeley, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Miami. \nStudents from around the world can now apply here , and must include a detailed outline of their action plan. The early decision and funding assistance deadline is March 1, and the final application deadline is May 1.
