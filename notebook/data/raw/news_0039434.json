Tyriek Mack, said in a statement. “If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant.” \nThe resolution demands free access to the university for all black people, including former inmates. That means free tuition, free housing and no fees, Mack said. It says 10 per cent of donations to the university should go toward bolstering financial aid and studying the feasibility of test-optional and geographically weighted admissions. \nBlack students currently make up about 2 per cent of Madison enrolment. University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone noted the proportion of “students of colour” has grown from 11 per cent to 15 per cent over the last decade. She said the school supports the spirit of the resolution but that it’s unclear whether the methods it proposes are legal or the best way to accomplish those goals. \nChancellor Rebecca Blank has proposed giving first-generation transfers from two-year schools free tuition for a year, contingent on funding in the upcoming state budget, and a recent $10 million donation will be invested in expanding the Chancellor’s Scholarship Program, which supports minorities, McGlone said. \nACT and SAT scores are not the only factor in UW admissions, but their inclusion is required under regent policy, McGlone said. \nLast spring, pictures of swastikas and Adolf Hitler were posted on a Jewish student’s door, someone hurled racial slurs and spat at a black student in a dorm, and police arrested a black student during class for spray-painting anti-racist messages on campus buildings. Minority students spent the semester pressuring administrators for change. \nLast month, a student who was imprisoned for burning down two black churches tried to start a white supremacist group on campus. He abandoned his efforts following intense backlash, but the student government criticized Blank for saying he had a legal right to express his views. \nThe university in August proposed building a black cultural centre, introducing discussions about social differences and expanding ethnic studies courses and diversity training for all faculty and staff. \nIn-state undergraduate tuition has been frozen for four years and Gov. Scott Walker has proposed a 5 per cent tuition cut for resident undergraduates in the second year of the upcoming state budget. Representatives of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee haven’t responded to an email Thursday seeking comment. \nMike Mikalsen, an aide to state Sen. Steve Nass, a Republican and one of UW’s most outspoken critics, called ASM a waste of student fees. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:05:59.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
