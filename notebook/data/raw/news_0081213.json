I wasn’t talking about that. I was talking about the fake media, where they make up everything there is to make up.” \nAsked by Boyle to expand on his CPAC speech where he harped on the fake news media, Trump then went after the Times . \n“It’s intent. It’s also intent,” POTUS said. “If you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it’s—the intent is so evil and so bad. The stories are wrong in many cases, but it’s the overall intent.” \nAfter claiming that the NYT wrote a letter of apology to its readers for getting the election wrong — a charge he’s made before — Trump then stated that the paper got its “front page article” wrong about his potential misconduct with several women. After calling the the “failing New York Times”— a favorite insult of his — and complaining that they haven’t apologized, he proceeded to rip into Barbaro. \n“For instance, when people read the story on the women — first of all, the reporter who wrote the story has a website full of hatred of Donald Trump,” Trump said. “So, he shouldn’t be allowed to be a reporter because he’s not objective. It’s not all, but it has many negative things about Donald Trump. But he shouldn’t be allowed to write on Donald Trump.” \nFollowing the publication of the interview, Barbaro made the following observation: A reminder. Nobody has sought a correction on this story since it's publication or pointed out a single factual error. https://t.co/q2hEm0X4uh \nIn the same interview, Trump claimed that the Best Picture Oscar flub happened because they were so focused on politics. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:46:32.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
