Subramaniam said the Cabinet had decided to review some charges for the first and second class patients as these charges have not been reviewed for a long time. \n“I would like to reassure all Malaysians that the Government will not shirk its responsibility to the poor and those from the low income group. \n“They will continue to receive the high level of care that they have been receiving as before,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:29:39.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
