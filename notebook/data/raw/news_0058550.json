There’s a conservatory below it, with Italian tile flooring. It was built on an independent foundation and pillar, so the telescope can align with true north. \nThis full-featured property also includes a 130-foot tunnel connecting the main house to the carriage house. \n“It serves many purposes,” says listing agent Jeffrey Post . “Access to carriage house, escape from the main house if needed, shelter if storm or an event might happen. It is structurally strong enough to withstand all kinds of impact, and is lit with self-closing fire doors on either end.” \nAs a bonus, the homeowner built the tunnel to potentially serve as an indoor shooting range. \nPost occasionally sees properties hit the market with old fallout shelters, but says tunnels are relatively rare. One notable exception outside Detroit is the estate of late Ford executive Harry Bennett , who was rumored to have a tunnel leading to a fortified concrete cabin, complete with gun ports in the attic.
