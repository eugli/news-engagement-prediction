PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Feb 5, 2017 GETTY Nearly half of all new households between now and 2039 will be for immigrants \nGovernment figures reveal that almost half of all new households will accommodate immigrants between now and 2039. \nThe Department for Communities and Local Government’s household projections show there will be an average of 243,000 new households forming each year for the next 22 years – meaning an extra 5.3 million new homes could be needed to meet the needs of the growing population. Related articles MIGRANT WALKOUT: Mass protest planned across Britain \nNet migration accounts for an estimated 45 per cent of this growth, meaning an extra 2.4 million new homes will be needed to house the UK’s booming migrant population over the next 22 years. \nThe figures were published just days before the Government is due to release its long-awaited Housing White Paper on Tuesday, in which it is expected to spell out the Government’s plan for solving the housing shortage. Migrant 'children' from 'Jungle Camp' arrive in the UK Wed, October 19, 2016 Migrant 'children' from the 'Jungle Camp' in Calais arrive in the UK to be reunited with relatives. 1 of 26 GETTY An extra 2.4 million new homes will be needed to house the UK’s booming migrant population \nThe statistics were released in response to a question by Lord Green of Deddington, Chairman of Migration Watch, who claims that even based on a conservative estimate 300 homes a day would need to be built to accommodate new arrivals. There is a cost to migration \nSpeaking in the House of Lords, the peer said: “To put the point slightly more dramatically, that would mean building a new home every five minutes, night and day, for new arrivals until such a time as we can get those numbers down. GETTY Lord Green of Deddington claimed 300 homes would need to be built a day \n“I know there is a strong view in the House that there is a lot to be said for migration. \n“All I am pointing out is that there are also costs.” \nThe estimates are based on official population growth projections produced in 2014, which do not therefore take account of the vote to leave the European Union , which is expected to end free movement and reduce net migration. \nNevertheless, Migration Watch has argued that the projections underplay the real effect of immigration on housing demand because they are based on a lower estimate of likely net immigration than has been the case in recent years. \nIt was also revealed in the Government’s Brexit White paper last week that migration may not be curbed for years after Britain leaves the EU. \nTheresa May’s Brexit plan said Ministers will “consider very carefully” how to cut the number of people moving to Britain.
