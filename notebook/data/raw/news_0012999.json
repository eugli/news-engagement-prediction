What are the child care changes? \nCurrently the Government provides two payments to families to help with child care costs: the means-tested Child Care Benefit and the Child Care Rebate, which is not means-tested. \nThe proposal is to create one means-tested payment instead, called the Child Care Subsidy. How will this affect families? \nFamilies on the lowest incomes will receive the highest amount of subsidy. \nFamilies earning less than $65,000 will receive a subsidy covering up to 85 per cent of their costs. \nThe rate of subsidy will gradually taper off as income increases to a floor of 20 per cent when family income reaches $340,000 or more. \nThe Government also wants to lift the yearly cap on the amount of Child Care Subsidy that can be paid to families. \nThe cap will be lifted entirely for families earning up to $185,000. For families earning more, the cap will be lifted from the existing $7,500 a year to $10,000. What will families have to do to qualify? \nThe bill includes an activity test that both parents have to meet before they can receive any subsidy from the government. \nParents will have to be working, studying, training or volunteering for a minimum of eight hours a fortnight. The more parents work, the more subsidy they are eligible to receive. Is there a safety net? \nYes. Families earning less than $65,000 a year who fail the activity test will still be eligible for 12 hours a week of subsidised child care. \nBut that is half the hours they are guaranteed under the current system. What are the sector's concerns? \nThe early childhood sector is worried about the impact of the activity test on disadvantaged families. \nIt wants the minimum guaranteed hours a week increased to 15 hours instead. Why is child care linked to welfare cuts? \nThe Government argues that the increased spending on child care must be paid for by cutting some family tax benefit payments. \nBut critics argue the two are linked purely for political reasons and the package should be paid for by cuts in other areas instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:13:14.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
