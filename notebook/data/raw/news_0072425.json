(Photo by Surachai Pitaksa) - + BURI RAM - The mother of a student injured when her motorcycle was hit by a car could not hold back tears when shown footage of the accident involving her daughter. \nAree Boonpok originally planned to forget the driver of a car which hit the motorcyle of her daughter, Attariya, but she changed her mind after watching the clip. \n\"I was crying. I feel sorry for my daughter. She was lying unconscious on the road and nobody helped her,\" she said on Wednesday at Buri Ram Hospital, where Ms Attariya is being treated. \nMrs Aree has filed a complaint with police to hunt for the driver after seeing the clip. \nMs Attariya, a student at Thon Buri Rajabhat University, was riding a motorcycle home after buying allergy medicines in Muang district on Monday. \nA car made a swift left turn and hit her motorcycle when it was outside the provincial government complex, leaving her unconscious on the road. The car driver then drove off instead of helping her. \nAfter five vehicles and five motorcycles passed by -- some probably not seeing her, while others only slowing down -- a pickup truck stopped and a woman got out to look at her and make a phone call for medics to come to the scene and take her to hospital. \nMs Attariya said on Wednesday that she did not know anything after getting hit by the car and on regaining consciousness found herself in hospital. \nHer face, arms, legs and hip were injured. \n\"I also feel bad after watching the clip. That car should show responsibility for what happened,\" she said.
