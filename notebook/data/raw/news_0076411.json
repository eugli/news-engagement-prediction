Target Corp. is scheduled to open its Ala Moana Center store in part of the former… more Tina Yuen Pacific Business News broke the news that Target would be expanding to Ala Moana Center. It will be a full-line store that will include grocery items. The Minnesota-based big-box retailer is taking up part of the first level and the entire second and third levels. Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th will lease up 41,000 square feet of the first level, as first reported by PBN. Target’s initial lease at the Honolulu mall is for 20 years with options to extend the term for eight straight additional terms of five years. Architecture firm CallisonRTKL is the architect for the project, and Swinerton Builders, which worked on the Target project on Maui and several others on the Mainland, is the general contractor. It also built the Bloomingdale’s store in the mall’s new Ewa wing. Nordstrom moved to the Ewa wing near the state’s first Bloomingdale’s and Zara stores. PBN broke the news regarding Nordstrom’s move to the other side of the mall. Target currently has stores in Kailua in Windward Oahu, Salt Lake in Honolulu, Kapolei in West Oahu, Kahului on Maui and on the Big Island in Kailua-Kona and Hilo. The retailer also has a 32,537-square-foot facility on Oahu that serves as a central distribution warehouse for all of its stores in the state.
