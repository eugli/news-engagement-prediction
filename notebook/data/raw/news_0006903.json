Eyewitness statements in the report detail \"unprecedented\" levels of violence, include burning people alive, raping girls as young as 11 and cutting children's throats. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement the report indicates \"very likely commission of crimes against humanity.\" Aye Aye Soe, a spokeswoman for the Myanmar government, said the government has seen the report and is \"very concerned about the allegations\" \"The Investigation Commission headed by the Vice President will look into it. If evidences of the violations are found we will definitely take action on them,\" she told CNN via email. Read More Soe said she would respond to CNN with more details at a later date. A United Nations team in Bangladesh interviewed about 220 Rohingya Muslims who had fled Rakhine State after the outbreak of violence for the report. There have been numerous allegations of human rights abuses in Rakhine State in recent months, but CNN has been unable to verify them, due to the Myanmar government's tight travel restrictions. The United Nations estimates about 69,000 people have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh since the violence began. Mother burned to death 'before my eyes' Out of the 220 people interviewed, the report said 65% had witnessed killings, while just under half had personally had a family member murdered. A woman from Kyet Yoe Pyin village alleged her 5-year-old daughter was killed when she tried to stop attackers from raping her mother.
