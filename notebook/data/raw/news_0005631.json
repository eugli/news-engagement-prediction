(Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Greg Trotter ' Frontera Grill opened almost 30 years ago, according to the celebrity chef, Chicago was a \"wasteland for local agriculture.\"\nBefore the proliferation of farmer's markets and surge of farm-to-table marketing, Bayless pleaded with farmers in Illinois and Wisconsin to just to sell him some tomatoes, he recalled Wednesday. \nHe even lent farmers money to grow food for him, a prelude to what would become the Frontera Farm Foundation. \n\"I knew if we could get chefs to taste stuff that was seasonal and fresh and do a little work with farmers ... it would really change the restaurant culture in Chicago,\" Bayless said. \nHis mission continues this spring with a new partnership with FamilyFarmed, a Chicago nonprofit that trains farmers and mentors local food entrepreneurs. By joining forces, Bayless' foundation and FamilyFarmed hope to raise enough money to bolster the \"good food movement\" in Chicago in a meaningful way, perhaps commencing a long-term arrangement that could eventually grow to a national effort.

The collaboration kicks off April 30 with a fundraiser celebrating Frontera Grill's 30th anniversary; the event will be held at the Art Institute, during the week of the James Beard Awards. The Frontera Farmer Foundation and FamilyFarmed will split the proceeds 50-50. \n\"This is our little 'let's test the waters' event,\" Bayless said. \nThe partnership could provide a boost for FamilyFarmed, which runs a six-month food business accelerator program that connects food startups to mentors and resources to grow their businesses. Many of the participants now sell their wares in Whole Foods Market stores in Chicago. \nSince 2004, the nonprofit has also staged the Good Food Festival, a three-day trade show showcasing food that's somewhere in the ballpark of local, healthy and sustainably produced. And FamilyFarmed, which has received more than $1.8 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture since 2010, also provides training and technical assistance to farmers throughout the U.S. Nick Kindelsperger \nWhen Rick Bayless opened Xoco Bistro in Wicker Park in 2014, it sounded like a surefire hit. After all, the original location of Xoco in River North has been going strong since 2009, still regularly bringing in throngs for its wood-fired tortas and rich hot chocolate.

A new FamilyFarmed program called Incubator Without Walls would provide guidance — in areas such as marketing, financing, food safety and distribution — tailored to the specific needs of a given company, Slama said. \nAnd Slama hopes to launch a regional grain network, connecting grain farmers to distributors, retailers and restaurants. But those dreams take money, which is where Bayless comes in. \n\"With Rick's success and brand, we think we can leverage this partnership to attract additional funders both regionally and nationally,\" Slama said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:10:10.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
