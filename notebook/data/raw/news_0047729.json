As one young woman knows, it requires emotional honesty, self-awareness and humility. \n“I really truly did mess up everything we had,” she wrote. “I was the cause of our downfall. This is how I feel. I have no reason to hide, lie, or hold anything back from you. I have no part of you, so I can’t lose anything else.” \nThis unnamed woman’s painfully raw words were sent in private to her ex-boyfriend Nick Lutz. However, the American university student decided to share her letter on Twitter - after first grading it in red, and highlighting her grammatical errors. \nUnsurprisingly, the letter has been retweeted more than 100,000 times and the poor woman’s handwritten admission of guilt is now plastered all over the internet for the world to read.

They deserve to be left alone.” \nDating coach Elizabeth Sullivan is more definite with her advice: “I think they’re generally not a good idea. They worked in Pride and Prejudice , but that was a very different era. They thought about it, reflected on it. In today’s times, you wouldn’t take your time like that. It’s a lot faster, there are more distractions.” \nFor her, the best way to handle a post-break up conversation is to do it face-to-face. “The problem with sending a letter is that you don't know what state the person is in,” she explains. “But if you chat on the phone or face to face you can see their mood. It reduces the risk of this kind of thing happening.” Should you ever write a letter to an ex?
