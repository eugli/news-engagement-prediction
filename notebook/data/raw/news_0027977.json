She also encouraged the audience to send any interested suitors to apply for the show.\n\"I'm happy to represent myself as a black woman in front of America and I'm happy for America to rally behind me and see what it's like for me to be on this journey to find love,\" Lindsay told People. \"Honestly, it's not going to be that different from any other season of 'The Bachelorette.'\"\n\"The Bachelorette\" begins airing on ABC in May.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:10:47.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
