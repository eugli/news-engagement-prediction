By David Moye \nThat’s one treatment that doesn’t seem like a treat. \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at Washington Dulles International Airport stopped 13 pounds of horse genitals from being smuggled into the country last month, according to a CBP release. \nThe equine sex organ smuggling was attempted by two women traveling from Mongolia as customs officials had them go through a routine agriculture inspection. \nBut the horse genitals were only part of the package. All told, the women attempted to smuggle 42 pounds of horse meat and 3 liters of yak milk. US Customs and Border Protection U.S. customs officials found 42 pounds of horse meat, including 13 pounds of horse genitals, concealed inside juice containers. \nHorse meat is prohibited from entering the United States unless accompanied by an official government certification from the country or government where it originated. \nOtherwise, it’s considered “unknown ruminant meat” and seized to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease, according to the release. Horse meat from Mongolia is prohibited. \n“Customs and Border Protection takes no pleasure in seizing and destroying travelers’ food products,” Wayne Biondi, CBP port director for the Area Port of Washington Dulles, said in the release. “We’re in the business of protecting America’s agriculture industries, like the livestock industry, from the potential introduction of animal diseases posed by these unpermitted food products.” \nThe women who brought in the horse genitals and other products were not arrested, but the products were incinerated.
