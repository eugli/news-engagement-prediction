The Portland group began after the genre’s first wave, but they’re so well-versed in dramatic, soundtrack-ready instrumentalism that they could pass for originators in a blindfold test. Through seven albums over 15 years, they’ve made a convincing case for the potential and durability of post-rock, covering diverse terrain—metal, psych, krautrock, ambience, soft rock—while maintaining a consistent musical language. \nIn fact, Grails’ language is so strong that the six year gap between their last album, 2011’s Deep Politics , and their new effort Chalice Hymnal feels like a mere blip. The group—sometimes a sextet, for now a trio—continues their wordless conversation so smoothly that one song, “Deep Snow II,” actually picks up almost exactly where Deep Politics ’ “Deep Snow” left off. In line with their career trajectory, this album differs from its predecessor only because Grails have subtly deepened their sonic scope, committing even more to each of the many styles they’ve explored in the past. \nYet there’s no gratuitous novelty in Chalice Hymnal ’s 11 tracks. Expansion is a goal, but it’s never the main point. As compositionally complex and technically adept as their songs are, Grails are always most interested in building moods and evoking emotions: somber reflection, energized optimism, wistful nostalgia, and most often, cathartic release. At times they prioritize mood-building to a fault, like when the misty “Rebecca” veers toward easy listening. But if they’re going to err, better that they lean toward the overly sentimental than the wankily proficient. \nThere’s not many errors on Chalice Hymnal, though, since Grails are too experienced and familiar with their own strengths to let anything egregious slip past. Each track establishes a tone firmly and executes it confidently. Hence the chugging groove of “Pelham,” the sludgy riffery of “New Prague,” and the theatrical swells of “The Moth & the Flame” feel like tonal siblings even though they’re stylistically disparate. Some tracks even contrast themselves: “Tough Guy”’s majestic march gives way to clouds of ambience before returning to forward motion. \nNone of that variety would matter if Chalice Hymnal wasn’t so emotionally resonant. Grails understand that post-rock is largely about structure—the way sounds gather and escalate, the way each part reflects what came before and points toward what’s next—and their mastery comes from treating music as sonic architecture.
