And then it does. TL;DR: I got harassed by a literal dick. Hear me out. \nDisclaimer: This is not a post meant to attack anyone. It is just to highlight a particular situation that I have encountered multiple times, just in different forms. \nI was on the train between Bishan and AMK yesterday (20 Feb) around 6:40pm to get to my grandmother's house when I felt something press up against my tailbone/butt area. Mind you, it was during the rush hour period hence, the trains were packed. Thus, this foreign object pressing up against my behind is not something that I had registered at first. However, there was a short gap between the people in front and on the side of me. While I was complaining in my mind about why I hated taking the train at this timing, it suddenly dawned upon me that this \"object\" was unnaturally close to me and was at a very VERY awkward area. Advertisement \nSo I turned my head to the side to look and there, standing INCHES away from my face, was a nose. Not just any nose, a nose that clearly belonged to a member of the male gender. I did a quick glance at his face - Chinese, estimated late 20s, early 30s-ish, with an ERECTION pressing into my tailbone. Yes, you read it right, this man was pushing his erection on my person. \nIn case you guys were wondering, I was wearing a black crew neck t-shirt with shorts that ended around my mid-thigh, and flip flops. I was wearing an outfit that I would usually wear to go to the supermarket. \nI didn't know what to do at that point and my mind just went blank. I couldn't move away because the train was packed and thus, I tried to stand in a way where I would not have contact with boner boy over here. Still, the dick persisted and now we are standing in a weird and awkward position. My emotions changed from shocked to angry because I personally felt violated. \nFinally, the train stopped at AMK station and without thinking, I pushed the guy as hard as I could manage with my back before walking out of the train. I think I heard him stumble but honestly, I couldn't care less. \nSo yes, this is the story about how I got harassed by a literal dick in the short distance of one MRT station. I know stories like this don't appear a lot because of the stigma and victim blaming nature that society has upon sexual assault cases. Hopefully, sharing my experience can bring to light that no assault case is too small to dismiss, whether in the form of an uncomfortable leering look, or in the form of physical/verbal harassment (both of which I have experienced multiple times). \nOnce again, I am not attacking anyone. Just talking about my disturbing encounter and felt the need to voice it out. I have sent SMRT a feedback on the matter and hopefully something comes out from this. \nThanks for reading! \n[FACEBOOK POST BY RAINA LIM] Source:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:52:14.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
