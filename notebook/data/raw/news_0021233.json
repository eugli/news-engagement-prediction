Let’s stop spreading hate everyone, there’s already too much of that right now in our world. Join in on the love. Only love here- always has been always will be. Media companies preying on the passion from vulnerable and or impressionable minds of fans to sell advertising through click-though traffic is a disease in our society. It’s poisonous.” \nHe added, “Let’s finish this series with respect and kindness and continue that in our lives. I think it’s time. What do think?” \nIan is of course referring to the end of The Vampire Diaries . \nIn case you don’t remember, Nina and Ian broke up back in May 2013. He got married to Nikki in May 2015.
