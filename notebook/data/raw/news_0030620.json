Underwood -- dressed in an adorable torn top -- joins Urban for the chorus as she sings, \"What if I fall?\" as Urban answers, \"I won't let you fall.\" \nThe American Idol alumni -- she was the winner of season 4 and he was a judge -- enjoy some cute interplay as well, as Urban sings, \"look in the mirror/ you're beautiful,\" to Underwood as she playfully fans herself then breaks into a cheerful smile. \n\"The Fighter\" is included on Urban's 2016 release, Ripcord .
