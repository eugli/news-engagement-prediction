Does PAM somehow enable a workaround for this, or is it less secure with PAM on? andrej February 18, 2017, 7:51 am \nwhy do you consider ssh root login unsafe? Reply Link E_Cooking February 18, 2017, 10:41 am \nThe reason to disable passwords is that users choose really poor password. You don’t want easy to guess password for the root user. Second, there are bots out there which try to log in to your computer over SSH. They run something like: ssh root@$Your-IP-Here \nThen they try standard dictionary passwords like “123456”, “root” or “password123” and so on. They do this as long as they can, until they find the right password. When the attackers have luck with enough time, and find a password, they would have root access and that would mean your server rooted. \nNow, when you disallow root to log in over SSH, the bot needs first to guess a user name and then the matching password. You are making bots life harder by disabling root login.
