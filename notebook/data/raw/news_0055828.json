Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United are set to be without Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick for Sunday's EFL Cup final. \nMkhitaryan had given United the lead against St Etienne in the Europa League second leg with a near-post finish. \nBut he was withdrawn after just 25 minutes and held the back of his right leg as he made his way off. \nMarcus Rashford replaced the midfielder in France and would likely battle with Anthony Martial for a starting spot at Wembley, should Mkhitaryan not make it. \nCarrick was also withdrawn during the second-half with a calf strain and Mourinho admitted both are unlikely to feature against Southampton.

When they are not playing it is an opportunity for others,\" he said. \n\"Marouane (Fellaini) and Bastian (Schweinsteiger) - two players who are normally not playing too much - is a good answer. \n\"I think Henrikh and Michael are both out. This is based on my experience, not based on my medical knowledge and not based on tests and what they have to do tomorrow and after tomorrow. \n\"I think no chance. A calf, a hamstring, even if it is minor, some fibres, damage, I think [they are] out.\" Manchester United's Michael Carrick after being substituted (Photo: REUTERS) Jose Mourinho looks on (Photo: Christopher Lee) \nMourinho named a strong side for the second leg with St Etienne despite leading 3-0 from the opener. \nWayne Rooney did not travel to France and could also miss out on Sunday's final. poll loading Who will win the EFL Cup? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:48:48.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
