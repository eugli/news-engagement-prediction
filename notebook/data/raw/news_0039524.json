Otters of the Ontario Hockey League had his stick taken out of his hands by London Knights defenseman Brandon Crawley after Crawley lost his stick in a collision. \nNot to be deterred, Strome skated over and picked up Crawley's stick and continued the play. \nStrome got the puck, skated in front of the next and scored a goal on a give-and-go to put the Otters up 5-1 in the third period. \nAfter the goal, Strome held Crawley's stick high in the air in a sort of salute. Then he skated over to the Knights' bench and he and Crawley exchanged sticks. \nHopefully Crawley has learned his lesson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:02:38.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
