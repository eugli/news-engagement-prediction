Gordon Mathews , an anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied communities of Nigerian traders in Guangzhou, said that the police there had cracked down on people who had overstayed their visas after dozens of Africans, mostly from Nigeria and Mali, were arrested in an August 2013 drug raid . \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mathews said that many African and Arab traders in Guangzhou overstayed their visas because the official limit on their stays — typically two weeks or a month — often did not provide enough time to commission a factory order and see it through to completion. But the government appears unwilling to loosen that rule, he added, and foreign traders who obtain legal residence permits are generally limited to one-year stays with no guarantee of renewal, even if they have Chinese spouses or children. “The whole issue is: Can foreigners become Chinese?” he said. “Yes, I know there’s a green card system and so on. But on the ground, it appears doubtful.” China also has a naturalization process for foreigners. This month, the state news media reported that two prominent Chinese-born scientists had given up their United States citizenship to become Chinese citizens: Chen Ning Yang , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957, and Andrew Chi-Chih Yao , winner of the A. M. Turing Award for computer science in 2000. Both are professors at Tsinghua University in Beijing and members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But successful cases are extremely rare. And a new work permit system has placed restrictions on which foreigners will be allowed to work in China. The system, which came into effect in November in nine cities and provinces, aims to build an information-driven economy by “ encouraging the top, controlling the middle and limiting the bottom ” of the pool of foreign workers, the state news media reported. It is scheduled to go nationwide in April. In practice, said Mimi Zou , an assistant law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the law makes it extremely difficult for workers on the lowest tier to obtain work permits. Demographers predict that China may eventually face widespread shortages of low-skilled workers and that a more liberal immigration policy could help stabilize its economy in the long term. But because so many domestic migrants are still seeking work across the country, Ms. Zou said, the government has not yet considered creating a guest worker program for foreigners, an approach many developed countries have embraced. Ms. Zou said China could eventually address labor shortages by bolstering its fertility rate or raising its retirement age, or by investing in automation. Some of that investment is underway, she added, and Chinese companies are outsourcing some low-skilled production to other countries in Asia. “But you obviously can’t outsource some jobs, such as domestic work,’’ she said in an email. \nFollow Mike Ives on Twitter @mikeives . \nKaroline Kan contributed research from Beijing. \nGet news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
