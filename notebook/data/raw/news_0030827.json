At the time, Socma claimed that the investments it had made in the postal service compensated for their failure to pay the agreed fee.\nArgentina sees migration ban and border wall proposals in immigration row Read more \nThe Macri family’s debt with the state was of 450m Argentinian pesos, which was about $128m dollars at the 2003 exchange rate. \nA long-running lawsuit over the debt was settled without any public announcement last year, when a legal representative for the government accepted a proposal under which Socma would pay off the debt in instalments over 15 years with interest payments well below market rates.\nAccording to the charges presented by the prosecutor Juan Pedro Zoni on Tuesday , the reduced interest rate – and an instalment plan under which the majority of the debt will be paid toward the end of the 15-year period – means that the company would end up repaying only around 1.18% of the total debt.\nMacri, his family and Socma have denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday, his government defended the deal.\n“After 12 years of neglect and no resolution by the authorities of the previous government, the ministry of communications worked on the outline of an agreement to end a discussion that was clearly damaging for the state because it wasn’t being resolved,” Macri’s cabinet chief, Marcos Peña, told the press.\nPeña attributed the outraged reaction to the debt deal on this year’s forthcoming mid-term congressional elections. “In an electoral year, these discussions will always become political,” the cabinet chief said.\nLast year’s settlement came to light last week when another prosecutor, Gabriela Boquín, appealed against it, saying it was “ruinous” and “inadmissible” for the Argentinian state.\nIn Tuesday’s accusation against Macri and communications secretary Oscar Aguad, Zoni said the settlement caused “pecuniary damage to the coffers of the state” and asked federal judge Ariel Lijo to launch an investigation to determine if Macri had intervened in the decision that benefitted his family.\nThe Socma firm was originally owned by the president’s father, Francisco Macri, who turned it over to three of his children, including Mauricio Macri, in 2007.\nMauricio Macri in turn turned over his shares to three of his own children in a series of steps between 2008 and 2014. He was elected president in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:30:58.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
