Adele was singing Michael’s 1996 disco hit Fastlove, but stripped entirely of its pop production: Just her voice and a single, mournful piano note. \nIt sounded off, and she knew it. By the time the orchestra came in for the first chorus, she couldn’t go on, stopping the performance in its tracks. \n“I know it’s live TV, I’m sorry,” she interrupted before a series of expletives that were bleeped for viewers watching at home. \n“I need to start again. I f**ked up.” \n“I can’t do it again like last year. I’m sorry for swearing and sorry for starting again, can we please start it again. I’m sorry, I can’t mess this up for him. I’m sorry.” \nTake two, and Adele started the song from the top once more. This time, she nailed it — but she was visibly upset at the end of the performance as the audience rose to their feet. \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:15:41.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
