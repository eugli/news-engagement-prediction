Panneerselvam and his followers queered the pitch for converting the bungalow into a memorial. Despite being asked many times if she would make a claim for the house as she was one of the legal heirs, Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar has maintained that the property was not her priority and she was more concerned about people’s issues. \nAccording to AIADMK (Sasikala faction) functionaries, currently T.T.V. Dinakaran, who is Sasikala’s nephew and the party’s newly appointed deputy general secretary, is using the bungalow for meeting ministers and party leaders. Even Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was seen at Poes Garden recently. \nJustifying the use of the bungalow for such business, AIADMK spokesperson Dheeran says there in no illegality in continuing to hold party activities from the residence. “What did MGR do with his properties? He left it behind for the party (the AIADMK headquarters). This will also go to the people,” he contends. \nMr. Dheeran says Jaya TV’s work was being done from the house as usual, and the house was being used as another party office. “No one is claiming ownership of the property. Mr. Dinakaran has his house in Adyar where he returns after the meetings. Deepak (Jayalalithaa’s nephew) is there. He also visits the house,” he adds. \n‘No legal bar’ \nBut former minister C. Ponnaiyan, who is now in Mr. Panneerselvam’s camp, alleges that anyone occupying the house for any purpose amounted to trespass. “Anybody staying there is doing so illegally and is trespassing. As far I know, the land belonged to Jayalalithaa’s mother Sandhya after which she was the sole owner. Whether she left a will or not, I do not know. But these activities tantamount to trespass,” he insists. \nWhen asked about the proposal to convert the house into a memorial, Mr. Ponnaiyan says the government can take over the house by paying due compensation to the owner. “Whoever may be the legal heir, they have to be compensated duly; a reasonable and considerable amount should be paid to the owner,” he explains. \nQueried about the propriety of setting up a memorial for Jayalalithaa, who has been indicted by the Supreme Court in the wealth case, he counters, “There is no legal prohibition. If you see World War II, there are memorials for war criminals who were treated as martyrs. It is based on perception.” Anyone can set up a memorial. “In fact, if you have adequate money, you can set up a memorial,” Mr. Ponnaiyan quips. \nMr. Dheeran, when asked about the memorial proposal, says they (Sasikala camp) will take a decision on it when the time comes. “We have taken measures to set up a memorial at Marina for Amma (Jayalalithaa). The house is more like a temple for people and cadre, and ministers, MLAs, and party lawyers continue to visit the house. “No one is going to usurp Amma ’s property. Nobody has filed any case or objection to the house being used now. So what’s the issue here,” he asks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:56:12.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
