That’s less than half, in just two years. \n“We are in discussions with Flipkart on the overall space reduction which if agreed can be a win win scenario given the current market scenario and the very low space availability in the market,” said Mike Holland, CEO of Embassy Office Parks. \nIn October of 2014, news was rife about Flipkart stitching the single largest deal in office space leasing with the Embassy Group for three million sq-ft. A few months later, in 2015, according to media reports, the demand was down to two million. \nFlipkart was suppose to build its office two phases, to sit around 20,000 employees, in anticipation of growth. But, little did its founders, Sachin and Binny Bansal (both are not related) know that the market would soon change.

To make things more difficult, there are talks of Alibaba entering the Indian e-commerce market along with Paytm. \nFlipkart’s head of communications said he wasn’t aware of the real estate matter. Another spokeswoman, he directed to get details from, didn’t take HT’s call. \nThe company recently announced Kalyan Krishnamurthy, a former Tiger Global Management executive as its CEO. Binny Bansal, its co-founder was kicked upstairs to Group CEO role, in less than a year after being designated as company chief executive. The Group has three companies Flipkart, Myntra and Jabong. \nThough executives wouldn’t comment on specifics, but grapevine has it that Flipkart is run by Tiger Global Management, its largest investor, which holds 30% to 33% stake in the company, according to reports. \nAn article by a leading financial daily called Flipkart an “unlikely” burden for Tiger Global, and said that Krishnamurthy’s being nominated as its CEO was the investor’s “best shot to salvage” its investments. \nWhile the real estate deal does not tell much about the health of Flipkart is particular but it does say that Flipkart won’t hire as many as it had planned to, earlier. Add to that, the cost it save -- around Rs 50 per sq-ft -- maybe that it will need to fund it discount was against global heavyweight Amazon. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:42:13.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
