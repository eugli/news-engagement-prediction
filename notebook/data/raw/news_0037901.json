Video courtesy: ANU More videos The search for planet nine \nAstronomers from NASA and the University of California, Berkeley, are asking for peopleâs help in searching for the elusive planet nine, a distant object in our solar system way out beyond Neptune in the icy vastness of the Kuiper belt. \nNow you can join in and help find the elusive object. \nAstronomers from NASA and the University of California, Berkeley, want you to trawl through thousands of images taken by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to see if you can spot Planet Nine.

It's exciting to think they could be spotted first by a citizen scientist,\" Dr Meisner said.

Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin last year said that from this data Planet Nine would likely be two to four times the Earth's diameter, and 10 times its mass, orbiting the sun every 15,000 Earth years. \nEven if Planet Nine doesn't exist, there are plenty of other objects citizen scientists can spot using Backyard Worlds. \nDr Meisner said: \"It's more likely volunteers will find brown dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. While Planet Nine would look very blue in WISE time-lapse animations, brown dwarfs would look very red and move across the sky more slowly.\" \nBrown dwarfs form like stars, but then evolve like planets. They never become dense enough to ignite the fusion reactions required to make stars burn. \nWISE images have already allowed astronomers to identify hundreds of previously unknown brown dwarfs, including the sun's third and fourth closest known objects. \nProfessor Chris Tinney at the University of NSW is a brown dwarf hunter. He said that the Backyard Worlds project was definitely something worth doing. \n\"I don't think they will find Planet Nine - as I don't think it's there. But there are possibly other classes of objects to be found in the WISE data,\" Professor Tinney said. \n\"If they find anything new it will be very exciting,\" he said. \nThe techniques used to identify these types of objects is similar to that used by Clyde Tombaugh to identify Pluto in 1930. Back then, glass photographic plates were compared to find a moving dot against a background of stars. \nThe principle to find Planet Nine is the same, but the technology is very different. NASA's WISE telescope scanned the entire sky between 2010 and 2011 building the most comprehensive survey of mid-infrared wavelengths available. \nBy comparing frames of the same part of the sky, astronomers - and you - can look for moving objects, which might turn out to be the distant planet. \nDr Meisner said he has loaded 32,000 animations of four images each. By looking for moving objects in the animations, citizen scientists could find Planet Nine. \n\"About 3 per cent of the WISE data has been uploaded to the Backyard World's website,\" he said. \"We have the rest processed, but we'd like to use the initial 32,000 as a testbed to further optimise our methodology.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:22:51.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
