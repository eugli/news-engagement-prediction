Not only that, but he’ll be joined on the creative team by longtime collaborator Danny McBride , who will co-write the script. \nCarpenter also figures to play a big role in the project as an executive producer available “to consult and offer my advice and feedback as needed.” He’s even open to composing music for the film, which would obviously be incredibly exciting for fans of the original film’s tense, moody score. \nMiramax and Blumhouse Productions will co-finance the film’s development and production, with Malek Akkad producing for Trancas International Films banner and Jason Blum producing for Blumhouse. As Variety reports, Gordon Green and McBride will also executive produce under their Rough House Pictures banner. \nGordon Green’s previous directing credits include 2015’s Our Brand Is Crisis and the stoner comedies Your Highness (2011) and Pineapple Express (2008), both of which feature McBride. The pair would seem like an odd couple to take on an iconic horror franchise, but Carpenter insists that “they blew me away” when they recently shared their vision for the film. \nHalloween is currently targeted for an October 19th, 2018, release date. Check out Carpenter’s full Facebook post below, and get ready for a totally new vision of Michael Myers.
