The next week, he drove another one . And then there was a tricycle . (This isn't even touching on that time he literally rode in on horseback .) \nThe Mets are now back in Port St. Lucie, and Cespedes is back filming his Fate of the Furious audition tape in real time. This time around, though, fellow New York outfielder Juan Lagares was determined to snag a photo: A post shared by Juan Lagares #12 (@jlagares12) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:36am PST \nThough the picture above appeared on Lagares' Instagram, MLB.com's Jake Elman reports that the car is actually Cespedes'. Although, knowing Yo, we're sure he's happy to share .
