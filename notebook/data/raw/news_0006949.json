Loshana, 39, who visited some friends and relatives for Chinese New Year earlier this week, said she wanted family time before school reopens on Sunday.\nShe and her husband brought their two sons to the zoo because the boys love reptiles.\n“I am scared of snakes but my sons enjoyed looking at the huge cobra and even posed for photos with a yellow python,” she said yesterday. \nAhmad Faizuddin Farris, 31, said his daughters, aged four and five, were excited at the sight of the elephants and tigers.\n“I bought some sugarcane from the animal handler and my daughters loved feeding the elephants,” he said.\nTuition teacher Alicia Gwee, 33, who brought her seven-year-old daughter and several nieces, was impressed by the zoo, saying that she had not visited the place for about 10 years.\nShe said it was a pleasant surprise to see that the management had put up shelters and covered walkways to help keep visitors out of the sun, adding that the entrance fees – RM2 for adults and RM1 for children – were very affordable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:13:10.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
