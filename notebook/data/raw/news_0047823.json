But, there were some major surprises as top Indian pacer Ishant Sharma and world No.1 limited-overs bowler Imran Tahir went unsold. What was more surprising was the fact that Ishant and Tahir were both re-called in the accelerated process but still did not find any buyers. Even unknown pacers like Aniket Choudhary, T Natarajan, Nathu Singh and Basil Thampy pocketed hefty pay-cheques but experienced Indian players like Ishant and Irfan Pathan missed out. ( How the teams stack up after the auction ) \nHere are the five major snubs at the auction held in Bangalore on Monday: \nIshant Sharma (IPL image) \nIshant Sharma is one of the most senior players in the Indian squad and has been in decent form off late. Ishant recently bowled a fiery spell to give India the victory versus Bangladesh in the one-off Test in Hyderabad. The lanky pacer bowled with sheer pace and got some bounce to unsettle the opposition batsmen and also picked up two important wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Mahmudullah. After being released by the Rising Pune Supergiants (RPS) ahead of the auction, he being an Indian and experienced bowler, was supposed to picked up by some franchises who lacked fast bowling depth but his steep base price as pointed out by Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir could have been one of the reasons behind him not getting any buyers. ( Uncapped Indian players trump India stars at auction ) \nIrfan Pathan (Reuters image) \nHe has been there in the Indian circuit for the longest of times and at Rs 50 lakh was expected to be a good buy for any team. RPS released him and going into the auction, with his abilities, he like Ishant was touted to be a major pick but he didn't find any takers as well. He has been in decent form, picking up six wickets from four matches in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy for West Zone. But, he has been out of the Indian team for quite a while now and last played an international match in time 2012. ( Tymal Mills happy to be on the same side with Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers ) \nMarlon Samuels (Reuters image) \nMarlon Samuels was one of the stars in the T20 World Cup winning West Indies side last year. He played a match winning knock of 85 in the final versus England. Samuels has been in good form recently as he scored 334 runs from eight games in the Bangladesh Premier League as well. Although Samuels' bowling has been under the scanner for a while, he was recently cleared by the ICC to bowl as well and at Rs 1 crore he could have been a decent buy for teams considering his experience in the shorter formats and the IPL, where has played for the Pune Warriors India side before. ( Stokes hits jackpot in historic Indian Premier League player bid ) \nImran Tahir (Reuters image) \nThis has to be the biggest surprise of them all. He is currently the No.1 bowler in ODIs and T20Is and with a base price of just Rs 50 lakh, he was supposed to be one of the big name buys after the likes of Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Ishant Sharma and others. Tahir has been in good form as well as he recently bagged a fifer against New Zealand in the second ODI in Auckland and also took six wickets from three matches in the last T20 series he featured in for South Africa against Sri Lanka. One reason for teams not going for him could be his unavailability after a while but then again England players went off like hot cakes and with his experience in the IPL, his exclusion is a shocker. ( Happy for myself and Rashid Khan, says Mohammad Nabi after SRH bag Afghan players ) \nJonny Bairstow (Reuters image) \nThe English wicket-keeper batsman was not as hot a name as his fellow countryman Stokes but keeping in mind his tremendous form off late - he was expected to attract buyers. Bairstow was the second highest run-getter in Tests for the year 2016 with 1470 runs from 17 Tests at an average of 58.80. He also had a decent tour of India where he scored 352 runs from 10 matches where he played 9 innings. He was one of the mainstays of the England batting line-up and could have been a solid middle-order batsman for any team. However, his steep base price of Rs 1.50 crore and unavailability for the full season could be the reasons behind him going unsold.
