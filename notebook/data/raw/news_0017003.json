Holt, director of otolaryngology research at Boston Children's Hospital, and co-author on the paper. \n\"Here we show, for the first time, that by delivering the correct gene sequence to a large number of sensory cells in the ear, we can restore both hearing and balance to near-normal levels.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:20:26.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
