The feature failed to take off for a number of reasons, not least cost and the competing passive/active technologies. Now, both LG and Sony have confirmed that there won't be any curved TV options on the menu this year either. \nSpeaking at the company's InnoFest event in Crete, LG cited a lack of consumer interest as the key reason, with its research showing consumers tend to choose flat over curved when given the choice of similarly-priced sets. \nWe've always been open-minded about the curve and in fact gave LG's curved OLED55C6V an Award just last year. The good news is if you're in the market for a curved TV you might be able to track down some great TV deals on last year's models before the class of 2017 go on sale. \nJust recently we've seen a petition to bring back 3D TVs - could we see the same for the curve or has it been well and truly flattened?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:56:45.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
