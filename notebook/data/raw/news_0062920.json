At one point, it even compared the alleged theft to stealing Coca-Cola's famously well-guarded secret recipe. Wow, Alphabet v Uber. Things are getting ugly in the high-stakes battle for self-driving cars. https://t.co/LnMhPTxPK2 \nâ€” Amir Efrati (@amir) February 23, 2017 \n\"Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company,\" the company's spokespeople wrote. \n\"Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialized and unique LiDAR system.\" \nThe spat presents a bit of an awkward situation for the two companies because Google Ventures, another Alphabet wing, is a major Uber investor. \nThe suit also comes at a bad time for Uber, which is still reeling from the fallout of a bombshell report of systemic sexual harassment and a massive boycott. \nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe suit was filed in San Francisco federal court on Thursday.
