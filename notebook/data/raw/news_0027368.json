Selena Gomez showed up at Rihanna’s after-party at 1 Oak nightclub donning a “God Bless Nasty Women ” denim jacket, Elle reports . \nAccording to Elle, Gomez did not make a formal political endorsement during the 2016 Election cycle. Fellow pop singers such as Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus came out in full force to support Clinton. But Gomez’s sartorial choices at the after-party showed that she too likely shared similar political sentiments, and she joined the rest of the Grammys stars in making not-so-subtle references to the current political climate.
