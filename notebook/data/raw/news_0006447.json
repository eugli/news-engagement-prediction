By Wednesday afternoon, the search was called off. Officials said they were hopeful that she was OK -- especially if she made it to Washington's Rock Creek Park, a veritable playground for an adventurous feline of her stature. Zoo staff did not have long to mourn her loss, however. Working on a tip, after the formal search was ended, keepers set up a live trap near -- where else -- the zoo's bird house. Shortly thereafter -- success. \"She ate a couple of goodies and left a lot of goodies sitting in the crate,\" Saffoe said. \"She was ready to come home.\" The zoo staff said they were incredibly happy to have her back. \"When you find a member of your family, or somebody who's been missing, it kind of fills you with joy, with crazy joy,\" Saffoe said. Ollie's enclosure is already being prepped for her return, with keepers going over how to increase security and prevent a subsequent adventure. As for Ollie, she's considered none the worse for wear, despite a small cut on her front left paw that zoo officials said was so minor it would not require treatment. A war wound to regale her pals about, from the time she got away. CNN's Rebekah Metzler contributed to this report.
