President Donald Trump calls on members of the press during a news conference Feb. 16, 2017, in the East Room of the White House. (Andrew Harnik / AP) John Kass 's wild news conference, and the other half probably filled with the viscous fluids of happiness.\nIt was at once frightening and charming, crazy and bizarre, with serious talk about deadly issues mixed in with one-liners, like a comic joking around with his pockets full of nuclear weapons, and at times White House reporters even laughed. \nHe threw out some whoppers about the size of his election victory, and then attacked the media as being full of \"fake news,\" complaining that journalists — he means TV commentators — exhibit a hostile \"tone\" toward him. \nSo pro-Trump and anti-Trump Americans came away validated in their belief that they're right about him and the other side is completely, stupidly wrong and should be locked in the basement. Donald Trump on Thursday made a messy case that he \"inherited a mess\" from his predecessor. Economic stats and territorial losses of Islamic State insurgents don't support his assertions about the problems handed to him on those fronts.\nA look at some of his claims in a news conference... \nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday made a messy case that he \"inherited a mess\" from his predecessor. Economic stats and territorial losses of Islamic State insurgents don't support his assertions about the problems handed to him on those fronts. \nA look at some of his claims in a news conference... (Josh Boak, Calvin Woodward) \nSpeaking of exploding heads, would you please put your personal politics aside and pity the poor foreign intelligence analysts who have to write reports about it all? \n\"I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea, and I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran,\" the president said. \"You know why? Because they don't have to know.\" \nAmericans might think that's a decent strategy, not telling, but the not-knowing probably drives foreign governments absolutely crazy, and their analysts have to make assessments, or suffer. \nHarried Foreign Analyst Nicolai: Boris, Trump said he could shoot our spy ship! I quote, \"The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water … but I won't.\" \nSupervisor Boris: WHAT?! This comes from a man who has publicly discussed the size of his genitals!! A man who brags about the size of his genitals before millions of his countrymen is a dangerous man!! \nNicolai (meekly): Yes, Boris. \nBoris: So will he shoot our ship? \nNicolai: I don't know!!! \nBoris: Your head is exploding, and you're spilling your brains all over my exquisite Oriental rug, you fool! \nAggrieved and spoiling for a fight, Donald Trump used a marathon encounter with reporters Thursday to denounce the \"criminal\" leaks that took down his top national security adviser and revived questions about his own ties to Russia.

But he offered only a lawyerly denial that his campaign aides... (Julie Pace) \nWith all the drama and the media slapping, and then endless media reaction over whether they deserve to be slapped for their tone, Trump managed to avoid the main question: \nWhat was his or his campaign staff's involvement with Russian officials during his presidential campaign? \nRussia hacked Democratic National Committee email and WikiLeaks dealt the damaging information about collusion between the media and the Democratic Party along with many other negative items. The worst thing about the leaks was that Hillary Clinton could not disprove them. And they helped bleed her campaign dry. \nTrump loved those leaks. \nHe hates the leaks out of his own government of classified information that damages his administration, like those phone conversations picked up by American intelligence monitoring the Russians. \nTrump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn , reportedly talked to the ambassador about American sanctions against Russia before Trump was inaugurated. Flynn was forced to resign because he reportedly lied about them. \nAnd Trump is sick and tired about the Russian thing, which he calls \"fake news.\" Read the story \n\"How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse,\" said the president. \"I have nothing to do with Russia. I haven't made a phone call to Russia in years, I don't speak to people in Russia — not that I wouldn't, I just have nobody to speak to. … I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.\" \nTo the best of his knowledge? \nIf I've heard a politician say \"to the best of my knowledge\" once, I've heard politicians say it a million times. \nThere's a part that comes afterward that Trump left out, the part that says, \"I can't recall.\" \nYou say \"to the best of my knowledge\" to a roomful of reporters, and one thing is for sure. It won't go away. \nHe mentioned Chicago again and the killings in the city. Liberal commentators fly into a rage when he mentions Chicago, fearful that he might win some political advantage in addressing the city's street gang wars. \nBut the dead don't care who wins. They've already lost. Three babies were killed this week. And Lake Shore Drive was shut down by a fatal shooting at Fullerton before dawn. Donald Trump on Thursday again publicly invoked Chicago violence before a national audience, this time speaking of \"two Chicagos\" during a wide-ranging news conference in the White House 's East Room.\nNear the end of the roughly 80-minute event, Trump responded to a reporter's question... \nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday again publicly invoked Chicago violence before a national audience, this time speaking of \"two Chicagos\" during a wide-ranging news conference in the White House 's East Room. \nNear the end of the roughly 80-minute event, Trump responded to a reporter's question... (William Lee) \nThink of it. Lake Shore Drive shut down. If the hit took place just a few hours later, during rush hour, there's a good chance some commuter could have been shot or killed as well. \nAnd the gangs are shooting up the expressways. If you haven't thought on it much, City Hall thinks on it all the time. Panic is setting in. And the coming weekend is expected to be warm. \nThe last president, the guy from Chicago, ignored the city. But he did make some fine speeches, didn't he? \n\"There are two Chicagos as you know,\" Trump said. \"There's the one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.\" \nSo far, I haven't seen any work from President Trump on Chicago, only a lot of talk. It was an amazing show on Thursday, and he's been president only a month. \nBut eventually, people get tired of talk. They tune it out, they turn away. \nListen to \"The Chicago Way\" podcast with John Kass and WGN's Jeff Carlin — and guests U.S. Sen.
