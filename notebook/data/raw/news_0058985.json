A No. 1 seed coming into the No. 3 seed's home is a bit strange to me. But I don't make the rules. I don't work for the IHSA.\" \nHosting a regional guarantees a team to play at home regardless of seed. Smith and Orr certainly benefited from the experience. \n\"It was great playing them early rather than late so we can get ready for the next game,\" Smith said. \nMike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune. \nPlayer of the game: Dannie Smith, Orr, 20 points, 14 rebounds. \nKey performers: Uplift — Toraze Dobbs, 22 points, 8 rebounds, 5 3-pointers; Demarius Jacobs, 21 points, 4 assists.
