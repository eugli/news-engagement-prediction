On this occasion, she was visiting with her friend, who was a dental nurse and in her uniform, but they were forced to go to another chain. Bosses at Slug & Lettuce had no problem accommodating her. Miss Brown, who lives with her boyfriend Danny Samuel, said: 'I actually feel embarrassed by the whole thing. I have never been turned away from somewhere in my life. I felt disgusted that they could turn a pregnant women away. Miss Brown claims staff refused to let her and her friend eat at Revolution because they don't allow people with 'sportswear' 'Because of the bump, I have to wear these sorts of clothes to be comfortable. This is typical maternity wear for me anyway. We can't all go round in full makeup and skinny jeans all the time. 'I get cravings but I don't just want to go rushing in McDonald's or somewhere like that. I choose a place I can relax and take my time. 'I know big businesses like Revolution need rules and use this to make judgment calls about people but they turned away two working women at a lunchtime. 'Surely they have to use sense and make exceptions, especially when the person is pregnant.' Miss Brown has confirmed that the branch have been in touch and would like to speak with her about her experience. Revolution has been contacted regarding the incident and we are awaiting a response.
