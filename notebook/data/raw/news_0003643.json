Under international law all settlements on occupied land are illegal.\nBarely 300 people live in Amona, but with so much attention focused on this one, small place, is the international community losing sight of the bigger issues that surround Israel's illegal settlement programme?\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem have grown dramatically over the past few decades.\nThe settler population has more than doubled over the last 30 years and now stands at around 600,000. Of that, 400,000 settlers live in Palestinian territory in the West Bank and the remainder in occupied East Jerusalem.\nThere are 100 outposts in the West Bank that have not been approved by the Israeli government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said he's against these, but efforts to clear them - like the current operation in Amona - have been rare. And a bill to legalise such outposts under Israeli law is working its way through the Knesset.\nNetanyahu says he backs an eventual two-state solution, but have his government's actions made that impossible?\nPresenter: Martine Dennis\nGuests: \nHanan Ashrawi - PLO executive committee member\nMitchell Barak - Israeli political analyst; former speechwriter for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\nDaniel Levy - director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, European Council on Foreign Relations\nSource: Al Jazeera News \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:06:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
