That form of the sport includes kicks and punches and meets the definition of a prize fight which is illegal under the criminal code.\nMontreal Police spokesperson Benoit Boisselle says they would have no choice but to make arrests should the tournament go ahead as planned. He says participants, promoters and some spectators could be arrested based on Article 83 of the Criminal Code.\n“It's wrestling, sort of, and all the fight events or wrestling events have to be approved by the IOC [International Olympic Committee],” he said.\nBut organizers say this tournament was to feature Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which doesn’t include kicks or punches.\nThe tournament has been rescheduled for March 5th and the promoter hopes they’ll be allowed to continue. If not, organizers say the Gatineau police department has said they could move the tournament there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:29:38.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
