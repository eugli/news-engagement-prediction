Blumenthal said he had used “misplaced words” about his Vietnam service but never meant to deceive voters. \nTrump himself received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the Times reported in August. \nTrump, who took office on Jan. 20, took to Twitter over the weekend to condemn the Friday night order by Judge James Robart that placed on hold the president’s Jan. 27 temporary travel ban on people from seven countries and all refugees. \nThe administration appealed that ruling to a three-judge federal panel, which is due to decide on the issue this week. \nTrump called Robart a “so-called judge” whose “ridiculous” opinion “essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country.” \nU.S. presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for a U.S. Constitution clause ensuring a separation of powers between the executive branch, Congress and the judiciary. \nTrump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31 to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the nine-member court. Scalia died a year ago this month. Blumenthal is a member of the Judiciary Committee that will hold a confirmation hearing on Gorsuch’s nomination. \n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey, Richard Cowan; Editing by Bernadette Baum) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:39:37.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
