They could place that protection because it was their own pick. Previously, if you acquired a draft pick via trade, you couldn’t place a new protection on it if you traded it to another team. \nNow, you can, which could make the Celtics a little more willing to include their 2017 first-round pick swap with the Nets in any potential trade for a superstar player. \nAs Lowe noted, there’s no guarantee a rival team would accept a trade that included protections on the Nets picks, but the fact the option now exists is good for Boston. \nThumbnail photo via Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:02:44.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
