Reuters Rio Ferdinand believes Michael Keane can do a Paul Pogba and go back to Man United \nKeane, like Pogba, was not given much game time after coming up through the club’s academy. \nBut now he is hotly tipped to be on the brink of a return to the Theatre of Dreams after impressing for Sean Dyche. \nAnd Ferdinand believes he can slot in nicely at his old side, much like Frenchman Pogba did when he returned from Juventus in the summer. \nHe said: “I think the moment he found out he (Keane) was going to leave Manchester United – every kid’s dream in that area is to play for Manchester United – so to leave the club was a huge wrench for him. Getty Images Rio Ferdinand believes it would make sense for Michael Keane to go back to United Reuters 3 Paul Pogba rejoined his former club for a world-record fee \n“But it allowed him to go and spread his wings and bloom really and become the player he is now. \n“At Manchester United he wasn’t afforded that opportunity, for whatever reason. \n“You look at the likes of Pogba… he’s gone away and come back now and become a huge star. Michael Keane, he could do that himself.” \nKeane said he believed he would always be a United player – but that Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure changed everything.
