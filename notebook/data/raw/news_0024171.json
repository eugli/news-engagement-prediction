Sunday's move may not signal that Portland is giving up on the 2017 season, but it does appear the team anticipates a very different roster in 2018 after adding three first-round players in the draft this year. \nOf course, the Blazers could use those three picks to make another trade before this year's deadline, or to pursue a trade for star player this offseason. \nWhatever the Blazers decide to do, they've given themselves a lot of good options for the future. The Nuggets, on the other hand, made a shrewd move for this year's playoff race, as they look to put more distance between themselves and the teams nipping at their heels for the final playoff spot.
