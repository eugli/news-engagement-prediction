The tweets have since been deleted, but Legend is speaking out to clear his name. \nThe Academy Award winning crooner confirmed that his account was indeed hacked, and although he’s not a huge fan of the president, he’d never wish any harm on him. Someone just hacked my account. \n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 I'm back. My hacker was vulgar and kinda hilarious. I'll try to be funnier from now on so he won't feel the need to ghost write for me. \n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 I wouldn't call him a Cheeto because I enjoy Cheetos. \n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 I did call him Liar-In-Chief. Then my hacker took over to do the Angrier John version of it all. \n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 My hacker's assessment of my endowment was confusing. Big in the tweet about Hillary. Small in the bio. Make up your mind, hacker. \n— John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 \nAside from spewing “vulgar” rhetoric, the “ghost writers” changed Legend’s Twitter bio, and Legend’s wife, Chrissy Teigen , couldn’t help but laugh it off.
