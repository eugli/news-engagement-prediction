But I knew what I liked, and I appreciated good products.” \nTaking her search for the perfect brush overseas, Ms Boikou came across a business-to-business company in Canada that seemed to “fulfil in part” what she was looking for in a make-up brush. \n“I bought a few of these brushes in 2008 and trialled and tested them for myself,” she said. \n“I ordered some more online, and began to sell the brushes through an account on eBay.” Zoe Boikou’s make-up brand ZOEVA started in 2008 in her lounge room, and is now one of the biggest selling brush products in Sephora in Australia. Source: Supplied \nIt was a slow burn for Ms Boikou to start making a significant income off the brushes initially. \nBorn in Thessaloniki, Greece — and moving with her family to Germany in 1990 — she didn’t come from a cosmetic background. \nWhen she was just 15, she started learning how to become an office administrator and customer service trainer for a collectables company, which she continued to do until her eBay store started to boom. \n“When the sales started to get bigger about three years after I started the store, I had to find a manufacturer who could include a logo and make the brushes look more professional,” she said. \n“After some YouTube [beauty blogger] recommendations, the sales of the brushes started to get overwhelming. \n“It’s a very tough world [cosmetics] but I was very persistent, and I would read a lot. I had to teach myself how this world works.” A photo posted by Chloe Morello (@chloemorello) on Oct 8, 2015 at 6:22pm PDT \nFollowing the growing success of her one-person eBay business, Ms Boikou decided to make the jump and move away from her former suppliers in Canada, and start manufacturing with a company in China who could create her “ideal types of brushes”. \n“It took two to three years, but my brushes started to get very popular around the same time as online make-up tutorials” Ms Boikou said. \n“At the time, I didn’t realise how a product could be marketed through social media. I kept wondering how my business was growing each day with more and more orders. That’s when I realised lots of people were buying the products, and recommending them on YouTube and other social media outlets, and their followers wanted to buy my products as well.” The rose gold ZOEVA brushes which are the third biggest selling product in Australian Sephora stores.

Social media is impacting consumer behaviour, with consumers frequently sharing their product experiences and looking to achieve the perfect and flawless look in images they share. \n“An obsession with image and a desire to look photo-ready at all times has led to manufacturers launching products targeting this trend.” Instagrammer @Katosu uses ZOEVA eyeshadow to create her look.

So all we have is the brushes, the eyeshadow palettes, and now experimenting with the strobe highlighting gel and lip products. We don’t offer everything, because we want to focus on just a few so we get them right. \n“Our attention to detail and design is something very special about ZOEVA.” How to Become a Female Millionaire 2:19 \nWhat does it take for a woman to make a million dollars?
