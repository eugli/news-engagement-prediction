surprise move, the Trump administration on Thursday night warned Israel against the construction of new settlements.\nPresident Donald Trump had previously offered his firm support to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister and signalled he could be more accommodating towards settlement projects than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n“While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal,” the White House said in a statement, adding that Mr Trump would discuss the issue during a meeting with Mr Netanyahu on February 15.\nThe statement could disappoint Israel's far-right which had hoped Mr Trump would give an unqualified green light on rapid settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem - areas Israel captured in the 1967 war.\nEarlier on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu had vowed to establish the first new West Bank settlement in more than two decades \"as soon as possible\".\nOn Wednesday, Israel announced plans for 3,000 more settlement homes in the West Bank - the third such declaration in less than two weeks since Mr Trump took office.\nUseful links Everything you need to know about Donald Trump's 'Muslim ban' Who will Donald Trump nominate for the Supreme

That's just how Donald Trump gets deals done D onald Trump is still ruffling feathers as President, amid reports that he tore into Malcolm Turnbull over a \"dumb\" refugee swap deal, and then slammed the phone down after just 25 minutes. \nThe Australian Prime Minister may feel a bit bruised, but he - and fellow world leaders - have to remember that they're dealing with a different kind of President. Donald Trump is a businessman at heart; he is transactional and sees the entire world like a profit and loss sheet. His outlook isn't the same as that of other leaders like Mr Turnbull and career politicians in Europe. That is why people are getting confused by his manner. \nThe conventional view of America among world leaders is that it is ready to stand up for allies, liberal democracies and free trade no matter what. But President Trump sees it differently. If America is going to be great again, he feels someone is going to have to pay the price. \nPrevious Presidents would think of their alliances in terms of what good they do for the world. President Trump thinks they could do much more for America. The United States shares intelligence, but seems to be getting little back for its hard-won secrets. And now Mr Trump finds that Mr Turnbull is expecting him to honour a deal made with his predecessor to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention centre. No wonder he pushed back.\nRead the full article .\nPresident on Twitter: tweets of the day Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!\n— Donald J.
