As seen in the video, his aircraft was so close that it cast a shadow over the jetliner as it taxied slowly. Photos \nHarrison Ford's Best Roles BTF/Boaz/FAMEFLYNET PICTURES \n\"Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?\" Ford, 74, asks, as heard in previously released audio from the air traffic control tower. \nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had said it was investigating the incident. \nLanding on a taxiway is a violation of FAA safety rules. The FAA had told E! News that a ir traffic controllers gave Ford clearance to land on a runway and that he read back the landing instructions correctly. \nAmerican Airlines Flight 1456 departed safely for Dallas a few minutes after Ford's plane flew over it. \nFord has flown small planes and helicopters for years and has survived at least three crashes, most recently, in 2015, during which he suffered moderate injuries after a World War II vintage plane he was piloting crashed on a golf course near Los Angeles soon after takeoff. \n\"I fly myself everywhere,\" Ford told National Geographic in 2008. \"I like all kinds of flying, including practical flying for search and rescue.\" \nIn 2000, the actor, who owns a ranch in Wyoming, used his helicopter to rescue a hiker in distress at Table Mountain in Idaho. The following year, he helped locate a 13-year-old Boy Scout who was lost in Yellowstone National Park.
