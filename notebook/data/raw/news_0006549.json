Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York calls her \"one of the worst nominees.\"\nSchumer says, \"Ms. Devos does not deserve to be secretary of education.\"\nPresident Donald Trump's nominee has spent more than two decades promoting charter schools across the country. Her nomination has come under fierce criticism from labor unions, who accuse her of seeking to dismantle public education. Two key Republican senators have announced their opposition to DeVos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:11:06.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
