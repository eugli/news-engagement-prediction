(File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) A \nSINGAPORE: DBS Group, Singapore's biggest lender, on Thursday (Feb 16) reported a 9 per cent decline in quarterly profit that came in below market expectations, with bad debt charges climbing on woes in the offshore oil services sector. \nIn what has become a test for Singapore's banks long lauded for their conservative lending standards, many firms in the city state's oilfield services industry are struggling to pay debt, hit by weak oil prices and charter rates and delays to projects. \nDBS reported net profit of S$913 million in the three months ended December, versus S$1 billion a year earlier and below an average forecast of S$936 million from six analysts polled by Reuters. \nThe bank's bad debt charges rose 87 per cent to S$462 million from S$247 million a year earlier. - REUTERS/cy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:49:22.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
