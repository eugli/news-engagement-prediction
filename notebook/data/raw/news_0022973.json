She said, \"My parents were like what have you done, why have u taken a taxi all by yourself, it's risky.\" However, things were quite smooth when she reached Goa, thanks to the cab driver who helped the actor. \nBut it all started when Smitha decided to take a stroll on the beach at night. \"There were a group of boys who would pass by me, whistle and make lewd comments,\" said Smitha. \nWhen she found a place to enjoy the sound of the waves and the chilly wind, trouble seemed to follow her. High on alcohol, the same group began to harass her. \"They followed me, laughed at me and also tried to touch me,\" she said adding that their behavior was shocking and scary. \nIt was the waiter who came to her rescue. He walked her back to her room and gave his number in case of emergency. Later, Smitha found out that the waiter too hailed from Karnataka. \n\"The moment I reached my room, I locked myself up and called my boyfriend and told him to Goa right away,\" she said. \nSmitha initially wanted to be spend some alone time for two days. But after what happened in the beach, she was in no mood. \nHaving visited Goa many times, this was the first time Smitha went alone. She feels it's normal for boys to tease girls. But her experience in Goa was beyond what one would call 'normal'. \n\"If a guy has a girlfriend, then she is seen as his and if there is no guy, she is everybody's,\" she added. \nSituation in Bengaluru is no different: \nBeing brought up as an independent woman, Smitha claims that the situation in Bengaluru is no different and women face this everywhere. \nShe explains what happens when she heads to a party alone. \"Rather than trying to get to know me as a human being, as a person, all they want to know is if I am available,\" she adds. \nThe Sandalwood star rose to fame after her performance in the film Avva. The film fetched her the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. \nSmitha, however, does not blame men for their cheap behaviour. According to her, a fundamental change has to take place in society. \n\"What I saw was just the rotten fruit and you need to deal with that, but the main issue is the root that needs to be looked into\"' she concluded. \nHer upcoming Kannada movie Shuddhi tells the story of an American girl's spiritual journey in India.
