Clyde Drexler, Gary Payton, George Gervin, Rick Barry and Rick Mahorn are listed under the players/coaches tab. \nFormer Knick Latrell Sprewell is also slated to play in the 3-on-3 league, setting up an intriguing matchup when his team plays the Killer 3s. \nSprewell was a guest of Dolan’s at a recent Knicks game , which isn't sitting well with Oakley, who was forcibly removed from the Knicks-Clippers game at Madison Square Garden last week for alleging acting belligerently and directing disparaging comments at Dolan. \n\"I'm really pissed about how they brought those guys back to sit with him,\" Oakley said, per ESPN . \"Bernard King is a legend and everything, but he went through an incident where he was wronged in college by the police. And I can't respect Sprewell. These guys were flown in town to make him look good. I can't respect those guys no more.\" \nSaid Ice Cube, whose league is scheduled to tip this summer, \"The players and coaches are our central focus at the BIG3. Charles Oakley is an NBA legend, who deserves and has earned respect, and will get just that in our league.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:06:50.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
