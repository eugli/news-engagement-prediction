It's also the biggest Hollywood bow in China — the world's second-biggest box-office territory — this year, nearly doubling Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 's $31 million launch. \nThe third entry in the xXx extreme sports/spy action franchise, Return of Xander Cage is the first Hollywood title to hit the market after the Chinese New Year holiday period, which was dominated by the latest Chinese blockbusters from Stephen Chow and Jackie Chan. \nDiesel is a major star in the Middle Kingdom, thanks to the Fast and Furious franchise. Furious 7 remains the biggest Hollywood movie ever in the country with its remarkable $390 million run in 2015. \nReturn of Xander Cage also was boosted by lots of local support, including co-stars Donnie Yen and Kris Wu, two of greater China's biggest celebrities. And the film is the first Paramount release since China's Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media closed a $1 billion slate financing deal with the studio. The two Chinese film companies were heavily involved in the xXx local marketing campaign. \nThe Chinese success of the third installment is a big win for Paramount, which acquired rights to the xXx franchise last February. Sony released the first two xXx films, neight of which got a major release in China. \nJackie Chan's Chinese New Year holdover release Kung Fu Yoga came in second for the weekend, adding $15.6 million for a $227.8 million total after 16 days, according to data from Beijing box-office tracker Ent Group. The India-set action comedy is rapidly closing in on Stephen Chow's fantasy Journey to the West: Demon Chapter to become the biggest release of the year so far. Slowing pace, Demon Chapter earned $6.8 million in this frame, taking its total to $232.3 million. \nHong Kong-Chinese culinary comedy Cook Up a Storm opened in third place for the weekend. Directed by Raymond Yip and starring Nicholas Tse, the film pulled in $12.4 million in its first three days, narrowly beating coming-of-age holdover Duckweed , which netted another $12 million, lifting its 16-day total to $127.8 million. Directed by celebrity blogger-turned-race-car-driver-turned-filmmaker Han Han, Duckweed was the sleeper sensation of CNY 2017. \nOn Saturday, La La Land earned an impressive $1.7 million from limited previews — a good sign for the Oscar hopeful's upcoming Valentine's Day release in China. Musicals historically have under-performed in the Chinese market, but early buzz around the glossy Damien Chazelle-directed romance is looking very positive. La La Land currently has scores of 8.7 and 8.3 on leading local reviews sites Douban and Mtime — higher than any other film currently on screens in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:37:23.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
