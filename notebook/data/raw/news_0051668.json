Shawna will be having a miscarriage. That's the crazy part about this now — [we're] waiting. [We're] waiting on this to happen.\" \nRelated: We're Loving This Chick! \nFrom the beginning of the pregnancy, Johnson (who is a married mother of two) was struggling with \"low positive\" numbers: \n\"Whatever these numbers are – these blasted numbers – they just never got higher. Shawna was going in every two days and getting blood tested.\" \nGloZell added of the inevitable outcome: \n\"It was a matter of her health because eventually she would have to pass what was growing inside of her and the medication is stopping her from doing that.\" \nAlthough Miz Green previously said this would be her last attempt — Johnson isn't quite ready to give up: \n\"Shawna sent me a text. She said, ‘Well, I know you said you don't want to do this again and you won't do this again, but I'm willing to do it again.' If she's willing to do that then so am I.\" \nSo for this 10th round of IVF, Glo says she's gonna do whatever it takes to make sure she's as healthy as possible: \n\"I am willing to do that even harder and for a longer period of time. Also, controlling my diet because I was doing all that, but still eating 12 cupcakes a day.\" \nWatch GloZell's open up about the sad news (below): \nBest of luck!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:18:24.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
