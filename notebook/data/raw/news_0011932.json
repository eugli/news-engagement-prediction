Now I'm saying it back to you.\" \nThe reporter, growing more and more confused by the second, says Trump himself has used the word \"ban\". \n\"He's quoting you,\" McCarthy shouts. \"He's using your words. When you use the words and he uses them back, it's circular using of the word and that's from you.\" \nWhen a journalist from The Wall Street Journal asks McCarthy if she's okay, she picks up the lectern and rams it repeatedly into the reporter. \n\"You cannot come at me like that, I will put you in the corner like CNN,\" she shouts, as the camera cuts to a CNN reporter locked in a cage and wearing what appears to be nappy. \nThe skit finishes with McCarthy using a water pistol to spray a reporter with soapy water to wash out his \"filthy, lying mouth\". \n\"That's enough for today, Spicey's gotta go bye-bye now,\" McCarthy says. \"I need a big boy nap.\" \nWith a performance like that, and so much more material to draw on, it doesn't look like the Ghostbusters star will be taking a break any time soon.
