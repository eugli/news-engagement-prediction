Shutting our door to refugees or discriminating among them is not our way, and does not make us safer.” ADVERTISEMENT \nA special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees since 2012, Jolie says refugees recommended for resettlement are often survivors of terrorism and torture or may be in need of advanced medical care. Refugees seeking entry to the US already undergo extensive screening by various federal agencies, she says. \n“The global refugee crisis and the threat from terrorism make it entirely justifiable that we consider how best to secure our borders,” she writes. “Every government must balance the needs of its citizens with its international responsibilities. But our response must be measured and should be based on facts, not fear.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:51:07.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
