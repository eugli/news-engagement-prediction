Cuomo’s executive budget from last month calls for a $65 million cut to a chunk of money the state gives to the MTA — down to $244 million from $309 million last year.\nThe 21% cut, if it survives the budget process, would hit the MTA at a time when commuters are fuming over frequent delays, spotty service, overcrowding and constant fare hikes .\n“If Gov. Cuomo wants to take credit for opening the Second Ave. subway, he also has to take responsibility of the day-to-day operations in the rest of the subway system,” said John Raskin, director of the Riders Alliance.\nMTA nixes plans for $3 base fare — but costs still going up \nThe money from the state’s general fund is supposed to keep the MTA whole after the state in 2011 slashed a politically unpopular payroll tax on businesses in the region served by the transit network.\n“This funding is based only on a promise,” Raskin said. “We had a fear that a moment like this would come to pass, where the governor is proposing to break that promise.”\nThe Riders Alliance and about 20 commuters will rally with lawmakers at the capitol Monday to get the legislature to reverse the cut.\n“We want more service and better transit options. The MTA always says they don’t have the money for it,” said Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D-Queens), who will be at the rally.\nLOVETT: Cuomo allies want to mend fences with Dem legislators \n“We can’t be funneling money away from the system.”\nThe MTA is also banking on the money — in its latest budget, it’s assuming that the reimbursement will be $311 million a year.\nThe payroll tax, meanwhile, brought the MTA more than $1.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year.\nVeronica Vanterpool, an MTA board member and director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said $65 million is no drop in the bucket, even for the MTA’s nearly $16 billion operating budget. “We don’t know how that drop will impact, but we know it will in some way,” she said.\nState budget division spokesman Morris Peters said that the MTA is actually receiving an extra net $16.7 million, compared to the previous year, due to increases in tax revenue and other types of aid to the transit agency.\nHe did not explain why the contribution from the state’s general fund needed to be cut.\n“It takes some kind of math to call an increase a cut,” Peters said. “MTA revenues from the payroll mobility tax are increasing by $17 million in this budget — part of a $30 million total increase in operating support.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:39:53.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
