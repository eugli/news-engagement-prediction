Remember Me FNC gives update on AOA Yuna's recovery from ankle injury By KpopJoA 15 minutes ago 2,569 106 4 0 Google+ Following her ankle injury , AOA member Yuna is currently recovering by taking physical therapy.\nWith AOA's concert less than a month away, the singer is focusing hard on getting back to her activities. Last month, Yuna was seen performing while wearing an ankle brace on her right ankle after tearing a tendon. \nAlthough the girls have successfully concluded their performances of 'Angel's Knock,' they still have their first solo concert coming up on March 11. FNC Entertainment stated, \"Currently Yuna is receiving physical therapy treatment and is able to walk without the ankle brace. However, she is refraining from putting too much pressure on her ankle.\" \nThe question is will she be able to attend the concert with her fellow members? A representative responded, \"Since it will be AOA's first concert, Yuna is making the extra effort to stand on stage with her fellow members... Her role in the group is very crucial as a sub-vocalist. She has skills on the piano so you may see her singing and playing the piano at the concert.\" \nMeanwhile, AOA will be holding their first solo concert at Olympic Hall in Olympic Park on March 11.
