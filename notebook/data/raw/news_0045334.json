My consultant told me that breastfeeding helps a mother and baby bond. \"In my case it did more than that - it saved my life.\nSarah Boyle, 26, and her baby son, Teddy Credit: SWNS \"Teddy could obviously smell and taste that the milk from my right breast tasted different from the milk from my left breast - and so he rejected it.\n\"My consultant said he'd never seen anything like it before and was baffled and amazed. He told me it was very fortunate I chose to breastfeed - otherwise my illness may not have been discovered.\"\nM rs Boyle first noticed a lump in her right breast in January 2013.\nConcerned, she went to her GP who told her it was cyst and nothing to worry about.\nOver the course of four years, she had the cyst scanned five times as it fluctuated in size but was told it was hormonal and not malignant.\nMrs Boyle put her fears to the side and carried on with her life.\nIn May 2015, she fell pregnant with Teddy, her first born.\n\"My pregnancy was perfect,\" she recalls, \"I couldn't wait to be a mum.\"\nIn February 2016, Teddy arrived weighing 7lb 15 ounces, and was a healthy and happy baby.\nMrs Boyle explains how she bonded instantly with Teddy.\n\"We had such a brilliant connection,\" she recalls, \"he was breastfeeding fantastically well.\"\nBut five months on, as she continued to breastfeed, Mrs Boyle noticed her right breast wasn't 'working' as well as the other and it was smaller.\nConcerned, she contacted her health care assistant but was told it was 'common' and nothing to be concerned about.\nBut one month later, when Teddy was six months old, he stopped feeding altogether from her right breast.\n\"If I offered him that booby he would completely freak out,\" she recalls, \"he'd become extremely distressed and would scream the house down.\"\nShe returned to her GP and asked if it was to do with the cyst, but was told it was fine.\nAs the weeks rolled into months, Mrs Boyle tried her best to get Teddy to feed from her right breast but he wouldn't budge.\n\"He just wasn't having it,\" she recalls, \"I had no problems with my left breast but every time I tried with my right he would start screaming and get very upset. He wouldn't go near it.\n\"He wanted nothing to do with that side, even if I gave him a cuddle on that side he didn't like it.\"\nWhen Teddy was eight months old, Mrs Boyle went back to her GP and asked to be referred for a scan.\nShe said: \"I explained about Teddy and how I was feeling very tired, I said I wanted to get a scan to check out my right breast. I felt as if Teddy was trying to tell me something. It was, what you might call, a mother's instinct.\"\nIn November 2016, Mrs Boyle underwent an ultrasound scan at Royal Stoke University Hospital.\n\"I'd just finished the scan and a consultant came in and said there was an area within the cyst which looked suspicious and I would need to undergo a biopsy.\"\nTwo weeks later, Mrs Boyle was diagnosed with grade 2 triple negative cancer - a non hormonal cancer which is extremely rare in young women.\nShe said: \"My mind went into meltdown. One minute I'd been enjoying the new experience of motherhood, the next I was being told that I needed life-saving treatment.\n\"But I felt so proud of Teddy for bringing the problem to my attention. The cancer inside the cyst had been growing for three months - the exact same time Teddy stopped feeding from my breast.\"\nMrs Boyle tells how her consultant told her that a mother and baby's bond while breastfeeding is very strong. Just like mammals in the wild, babies know their mother's scent and milk and that's how they identify it's their mother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:51:06.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
