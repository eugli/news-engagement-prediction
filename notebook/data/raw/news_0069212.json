And the venue didn't reopen until later in the day.\" Jamie reportedly isn't allowed to see his children (Photo: Rex Features) Jamie tweeted this picture with his sons following his stint in the Celebrity Big Brother house (Photo: @Mrjamieohara1 /Twitter) Danielle wasn't happy that Jamie wasn't able to pick up their children (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"So he emailed Danielle and explained the situation and said he'd be there as soon as he could. He even made plans for someone else to pick up the kids but Danielle refused. \n\"She flew off the handle and said he wasn't allowed to see the kids. He's now going to have to go to court to fight to see his children. \n\"He's absolutely heartbroken. He'd made plans for his time with the kids, had theme park tickets for them.
