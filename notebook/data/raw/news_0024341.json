(Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports) 126 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFree agent slugger Mike Napoli and the Texas Rangers are nearing a third engagement. \nAccording to multiple reports , the two sides have agreed to a one year deal, pending a physical. Who are the top remaining MLB free agents on the market? \nAcquiring Napoli would fill in a big hole for the Rangers, who are currently without a regular first baseman. The Rangers lost Prince Fielder to a career-ending injury and Mitch Moreland to free agency over the past year. They initially were looking in-house -- Ryan Rua, Jurickson Profar and Joey Gallo -- to fill the position. \nNapoli, 35, slugged a career-high 34 home runs last season and helped lead the Cleveland Indians to the AL pennant. \nNapoli last played for the Rangers in 2015, when they acquired him in a trade with the Boston Red Sox. Prior to that, he played with the club from 2011-12. He has a career .929 OPS as a Ranger, best among his four teams. Napoli also will be looking to make the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons. Gallery: Best MLB team realistic money can buy Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
