Per HuffPost, and others, DeVos’ family gave $8.3 million to Republican Super PACs in the past two election cycles while DeVos herself doled out some $115,000 to sitting Republican senators. \nBased on numbers from the Federal Election Commission, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has benefitted the most from the DeVos family’s generous giving by receiving $98,300, and the next highest are Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) with $70,200 in greenbacks each. Even Sen. Murkowski, who opposed DeVos’ confirmation, has benefitted from DeVos donations to the tune of $43,200. \nWhen DeVos was asked about the political contributions by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in January, she said it was “possible” that her family has given more than $200 million in donations over the years. That particularly demurring answer stands in stark contrast to a 1997 op-ed DeVos penned for Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call about criticism of her family’s political contributions: [M]y family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican party … I have decided, however, to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now, I simply concede the point. We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues. We expect a return on our investment; we expect a good and honest government. Furthermore, we expect the Republican party to use the money to promote these policies, and yes, to win elections. \nBelow you’ll find a list of senators who received money from the DeVos family and voted on her confirmation for Secretary of Education. \nSen.
