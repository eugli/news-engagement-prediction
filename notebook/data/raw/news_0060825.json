He collects $120,000 a year in his Screen Actors Guild pension fund. He is a Hollywood elitist,\" Clooney said. \n“Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director,\" said Clooney. \"That's the truth. That’s what he’s done. He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L.A. riots that he couldn’t get made … He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld … He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean, that’s the reality.” \nClooney also called for journalists to continue to hold Trump's \"feet to the fire.\" \n“We have a demagogue in the White House. We need the fourth estate, which is journalists, to hold his feet to the fire,\" Clooney said. “They didn’t do a very good job during the campaign and they haven’t done a particularly good job yet, but those things will change.\" \nClooney noted that Americans tend to do \"a lot of dumb things over a period of time, but we’re also pretty good at fixing them.\" The actor mentioned the war in Iraq as an example. \n\"We look back and we go well that was 2003 and then we had Barack Obama. He corrected it. We had someone who was thoughtful and considerate and intelligent,\" Clooney said. \"Now we have Donald Trump which is hard to imagine. It catches in your throat. But we’ll fix it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:51:54.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
