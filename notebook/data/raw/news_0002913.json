(Amona resident on importance of settlements 'we're not occupying') “But now that I am here, this is how it will be,” he said.Before heading out a number of the activists put on tefilin, and chanted the morning prayers. The evacuation order was issued while the High Court of Justice was deciding the legality of a relocation deal under which the families had agreed to peacefully leave the outpost by February 8. The High Court had originally ruled in 2014 that the outpost must be destroyed, because it was built without permits on private Palestinian property belonging to residents of Silwad village. In December the court accepted the relocation deal.Palestinians from Silwad, with the help of the Yesh Din NGO, have since petitioned the court against the agreement. They claimed that the state was acting unlawfully, because it planned to place the homes temporarily on nearby abandoned Palestinian property. The justices seemed to frown on the deal, stating that they prefer resettling the Amona families on state land. Justice Salim Joubran declared, “This deal is worrisome.”On Monday, Amona families were among the settlers who rallied in front of the Knesset, demanding that the government find a way to keep them in their homes. They insisted that they would leave only if it authorized the settlements bill to retroactively legalize some 4,000 settler homes on private Palestinian property, while offering the landowners compensation.Amona is excluded from the bill, because of the High Court ruling.While the IDF has been tasked with carrying out the evacuation, the Border Police will ultimately do the grunt work, with some 3,000 police and Border Police officers set to remove Amona’s 40 families from their homes. The IDF is reported to have placed eight battalions in the area surrounding Amona for the upcoming evacuation and will be in charge of dealing with any clashes that might break out with Palestinians during the evacuation, as well as making sure that any roads into the illegal outpost remain clear. Soldiers, police and border policemen have already been training for scenarios they may face in the upcoming evacuation, including the possibility of violence by settlers trying to prevent their eviction. The idea of a forced Amona evacuation has particular resonance with Israelis. The clashes that occurred there between settlers and security forces during the 2006 demolition of nine homes were the most violent of their kind to date.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and right-wing lawmakers have therefore looked for ways to avoid violence from recurring there.
