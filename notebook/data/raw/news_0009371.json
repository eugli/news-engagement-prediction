(Photo: Judy Kioski) \nStory Highlights What Judy Kioski's small home lacks for in space it more than makes up for in charm and windows. Kioski used a handbelt sander to resurface the kitchen floor Kioski transformed the home’s backyard from a barren, rectangular space to a warm sanctuary When Judy Kioski was looking to buy the home she now lives in, a 1920s bungalow in the Coronado Historic District of Phoenix, a slight pang of nostalgic destiny hit her as she walked through the home’s galley kitchen.\nIt was the white porcelain sink, a perfect rectangle, recessed below dandelion yellow and mint-trimmed tiled counters, ready to catch whatever would escape the simple chrome faucet that juts out from the wall above it. The whole set-up reminded her of her childhood home, which had the same tile and the same sink, one where she no doubt washed her hands before dinner and washed a few dishes after.\n“I figured it was meant to be with me again,” she said.\nAnd so it was.\nCharm and windows Kioski, a public information officer with the department of emergency and military affairs, will mark 13 years in the brick craftsman bungalow in May. And, it’s easy to see why. What the 828 square foot home lacks for in space it more than makes up for in charm and windows.\nFor a petite home, it boasts nearly a dozen windows. Kioski knows the number by heart. Her two-bedroom, one-bath home was featured on a home tour a few years ago, which for her sanity, necessitated a punch list of updates and touch-ups. One of those included the wood-framed windows.\nShe painted the trim and polished the hardware on each one to prep for the visitors who would soon see her home.\n“That was a lot of work,” she said.\nKitchen floor But, it paled in comparison to the elbow grease and slow grind she subjected herself to in order to resurface the kitchen floor, which was original wood and featured a diamond-shaped parquet pattern. Fearing she’d fall victim to a comedic Lucille Ball moment if she used a drum sander, Kioski got down on her hands and knees and used a handheld belt sander to rid the floor of its top layer.\nShe vividly remembers the time it took, the preparations she made in vain to protect the rest of the house from the billowing sawdust, and the day her brother delivered lunch through the kitchen window. He could see a cloud of dust wafting from her windows as he approached the house, and thought it best to keep his distance.\n“Labors of love,” Kioski said, with a laugh. “These are the things you learn along the way.”\nBackyard transformation She needed no time to learn if she would be the type of homeowner who appreciated a pond and an unfinished backyard. She knew she wasn’t. So, Kioski transformed the home’s backyard from a barren, rectangular space to a warm sanctuary by adding sprinklers and finishing it with a pergola and a hammock harbor, perfect for rocking away lazy afternoons.\n“Since the house is small, I needed the outdoor space,” she said. “I have a nice space. I can barbeque and just hang out.”\nShe certainly makes the most of what space she has, though. Her washer and dryer stack on top of each other. She utilizes recessed shelving for displays and storage, and she relies on labeled bins set on shelves above the washer and dryer for additional storage. She fits it all in, in the most charming of ways.\nFront porch That charm extends to the front porch, accessorized quaintly with a white wooden rocker.\nThat porch is where she finally found a permanent home for a set of blue pots she found, and fell in love with, while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Prior to settling at the Coronado home, Kioski had moved five times in seven years. And every time she relocated, she dragged those pots along for the ride.\n“It feels good to be settled,” she said.\nNow, those pots sit on her front porch, climbing the stoop and lining up across the landing. They match the wooden porch swing that sits off right and perpendicular to her front door. And, they hold blooms of varied flowers, adding a punch of color against the burnt brick exterior and cobalt front door.\nDating back decades When she reflects on the novelty of her neighborhood, and what her home brings to it, Kioski admits to being wooed by the original features of each home. The features that date back decades.\nYet, she still appreciates modest modern updates that add even more personalized character to each home. It’s that restrained mix of old and new that gets her.\nShe can appreciate it, because she’s done updates where she has needed or wanted to, and she’s still looking at her garage, an original structure which leans slightly to the side. She fears a good wind may just knock it down one day. But, she’ll get to it. And until she does, she’ll enjoy its slightly off-balance stance.\n“It has a lot of character,” she said.\nAZCENTRAL\nCool home: Historic home has just enough room for masks\nAZCENTRAL\nCool home: Scottsdale's first straw-bale house still offers inspiration", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:57:14.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
