Or eating more?” The awkward pause that followed confirmed it was the latter. So began my 2017. Towards the end of 2016, I had fallen into bad habits and was surviving on a diet consisting mainly of milk chocolate and hula hoops. Without any time to devote to packed lunches, I was forced to seek out healthy and filling food in NHS canteens; as scarce as empty beds are on the wards. Things didn’t improve over the festive period with the abundance of sweets, cheese and paté. Still, I wasn’t quite prepared for the boost my inevitable January self-loathing was given a few days later by the bombshell, from the NHS BMI calculator, telling me that I needed to lose 18.7kg to be my ideal body weight. 18.7kg. That’s basically an entire child I’m carting around all day. \nIt is time for a change then – of diet, but even more so of habits. And top of the list is lunch. I’m not sure why I stopped making home-made noodle pots but, rediscovering them now, I have realised they are the perfect work lunch. Just add hot water and you have a satisfyingly filling meal without the afternoon food coma that can accompany stodgier choices. They do take a bit of prep, but I usually make three or four at a time and keep them in the fridge until needed. They’re infinitely customisable, too; I have made them with the leftovers from a roast dinner: scrapings of gravy from the roasting tray and a handful of chopped onion, mange tout and chilli. The only thing I need to do on the day is remember to actually take one to work. Lentils are another tool on my quest for a healthy, filling lunch. Ubiquitous across India, they appear in all manner of different dals, from coconut infusions in the south to the rich, slow cooked dal makhani of the north. This particular recipe will be familiar to Bengalis; it’s a variation of the everyday dal eaten in many households. Much to the bewilderment of my parents, I couldn’t stand it as a child. There really isn’t much to hate; it’s a simple, nourishing dish, usually served with rice as an accompaniment to all manner of more exciting vegetable, fish and meat dishes. Just as I am unable to explain my childhood disdain for it, so too am I the craving I have for it now. Perhaps it’s that its simplicity is a perfect antidote to the excesses of winter. Or maybe it is that every nutty spoonful brings a smile to my face as I remember all those times my parents tried to coax me to try a little. Or maybe it just reminds me of home. Tama’s noodle pots.

Feel free to experiment with different meats and vegetables. Grilled aubergine makes a good vegetarian substitute for the chicken. Just remember that the hot water you add at the end only warms the meal so any meat that goes in needs to be fully cooked already. \nMakes 4 jars ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:50:42.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
