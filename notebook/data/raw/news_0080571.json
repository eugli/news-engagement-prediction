Everyone Is Confused by How a Bagel Caused This Drunken Brawl on a London Train By Follow @munchies \nStage left: A woman on a train places a bagel on her own head. \nHard cut to stage right: Two completely unrelated women are screaming at each other on the same train with a confusing caption that reads “Lost it mate” beneath. \nThese few seconds of video set the stage for a prolonged and bizarre glimpse into the darkness that emerges when a bunch of drunken adults in a confined space—with access to a seemingly endless supply of bagels—recently used food to fuck with each other on a London train. \n— dougie stew (@DougieStew) February 26, 2017 \nCaptured by Twitter user Dougie Stew , the so-called “ #BagelGate ” video has become a modern-day Zapruder film, ultimately leaving viewers with more questions than answers. Plenty of play-by-play analysis has already been written about #BagelGate, with many seeking to understand why and how one man, known only as “Bagel Boy,” became the target of infinite bagel ammo. #BagelGate All of a sudden the rest of the EU are probably relieved we left. \nBritain at its finest. \n— Alex Newman (@23Newms) February 27, 2017 Can’t wait till I have grandchildren and tell them where I was when #BagelGate happened. \n— Daniel Gibbs (@danbengibbs) February 27, 2017 \nWe prefer to treat this as the work of unintentional work of art that it is, open to many interpretations. It is as much a PSA about the childishness of drunkards as it is a testament to the effectiveness of food as a weapon of psychological warfare. \nThere are only so many times you can put a bagel on a man’s head before he finally breaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:09:22.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
