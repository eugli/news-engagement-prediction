Campaigners and doctors have welcomed the introduction of the screening kit, which is now at selected high street pharmacies for £39.99, as well as online. The availability of the kit means that for the first time expectant mothers will be able to check whether they are carriers of Group B Strep (GBS) bacterium – which lives harmlessly inside adults but can be passed to babies during childbirth and trigger deadly illnesses. Tested positive: Rebecca Hathaway-White, from Fleet, Hampshire, bought a kit, tested positive, so had antibiotics and gave birth to healthy baby Phoebe The UK is one of the few developed countries not to offer routine testing. Jane Plumb, chief executive of charity Group B Strep Support, said: ‘Women are not even routinely told about it.’ And Dr Bryan Beattie, a senior NHS consultant in foetal medicine, said: ‘It’s a ridiculous situation where, if we find that a mum has GBS we treat it but we’re not going to look for it.’ He believes the £40 kits will save lives. ‘They will be on the shelves next to pregnancy-test kits so mums will realise it’s something else they need to think about. It’s going to have a huge impact on awareness.’ One in four pregnant women carries the GBS bacteria. Carriers are not at risk but it can be transmitted to the baby during labour. In newborns, GBS can cause meningitis, sepsis or pneumonia.
