In a conversation with the New Zealand foreign affairs minister, Netanyahu reportedly declared the resolution “ tantamount to a “declaration of war” . Julie Bishop: Australia would not have backed UN resolution on Israel Read more \nIsrael threatened diplomatic reprisals against the countries that voted in favour of the UN resolution. Diplomatic ties with New Zealand were temporarily severed and ambassador Itzhak Gerberg was recalled. \nOn Wednesday Turnbull was critical of unnamed critics who viewed Israel “exclusively through the lens of its conflict with the Palestinians”. \n“They demand that the government take the side of those in the international community who seek to chastise Israel – and it alone – for the continuing failure of the peace process. \n“In a speech to the UN general assembly in 2015, prime minister Netanyahu pointed out that in the preceding 12 months, the general assembly had adopted 20 resolutions critical of Israel, compared to just one in response to the war in Syria, which has resulted in more than 250,000 killed and millions driven from their homes.” \nTurnbull said his government would “not support one-sided resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN security council and we deplore the boycott campaigns designed to delegitimise the Jewish state”. \nAs he arrived in Sydney, Netanyahu said the visit was to celebrate a 100-year friendship between the two countries. \nTurnbull and Netanyahu will sign bilateral agreements covering air services and science and technology during the visit, and will also discuss the progress of an innovation hub helping Australian entrepreneurs do business in Israel. \nDuring private meetings, the Israeli prime minister is also expected to hear concern about aggressive settlement building both from the Turnbull government, and from the ALP, which has already telegraphed publicly its intention to raise the issue during bilateral discussions. \nAhead of the visit, divisions within Labor over Middle East policy have been on display. Two former prime ministers, Bob Hawke and Kevin Rudd, and two former foreign affairs ministers, Gareth Evans and Bob Carr, have called for the diplomatic recognition of Palestine on the basis that Israel’s aggressive settlement building conduct is undermining the peace process. \nLabor has been moving incrementally in the direction of adopting a more pro-Palestinian policy stance since 2012, with the ALP national conference in July 2015 passing the strongest resolution yet seen at the national level . \nThe form of words adopted by the conference says if “there is no progress in the next round of the peace process, a future Labor government will discuss joining like-minded nations who have already recognised Palestine and announcing the conditions and timelines for the Australian recognition of a Palestinian state, with the objective of contributing to peace and security in the Middle East”. \nWhile the national conference resolution clearly references Labor being in government when it would provide recognition for Palestinian statehood, a number of current Labor parliamentarians believe the “no progress” threshold has already been reached – some assert a majority of the caucus holds this view. \nBut Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, has argued any change in policy should not be executed from opposition, and she’s indicated the ALP will speak up with Israel when it judges conduct is unhelpful to a resolution of the conflict. Prominent Australians write open letter opposing Benjamin Netanyahu's visit Read more \nThe US president, Donald Trump, used a visit by Netanyahu to Washington last week to dump America’s 20-year commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of a permanent Middle East peace agreement. \nAfter the Trump development, Bishop said the government in Canberra still favoured a two-state solution to the conflict but she nuanced that position slightly. \nBishop suggested on Sky News that Australia’s support for a two-state solution might shift in the future if Israel and Palestine favoured another means of resolving the conflict. \nShe said Trump had merely been pointing to the necessity for both parties to agree on the way forward. “The two sides need to sit down and negotiate a resolution – it can’t be imposed from outside.” \nBishop said if the parties came up with “another solution that they were prepared to live with, that ensured the Israelis and Palestinians could live side by side, together, between internationally recognised boundaries, then of course the world should support that”.
