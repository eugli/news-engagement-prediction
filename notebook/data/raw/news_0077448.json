Over the past five decades, he amassed a $76 billion fortune building Berkshire into a sprawling conglomerate with interests in insurance , energy, manufacturing, media, retail and transportation. \n\nBerkshire’s Class A shares have climbed 15 percent since Election Day, bringing the company’s market capitalization above $400 billion for the first time. \n\nIn last year’s letter, Buffett wrote sweepingly about why the country had a bright future, rebutting much of the economic pessimism that dominated Trump’s successful campaign for the presidency. \n\nSince taking office last month, Trump has continued to paint a bleak picture. His inaugural speech painted an ominous portrait of the nation as a place of violent “American carnage” where “rusted-out factories” are “scattered like tombstones” and the middle class’s wealth is “ripped from their homes.” \n\nWhile Buffett, 86, supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, he’s a widely respected business leader who has relationships with elected officials on both sides of the political aisle. The billionaire frequently clashed with Trump during the campaign and scolded him for not releasing income-tax returns, as major party presidential candidates have done for roughly four decades. \n\nSince the election, Buffett has struck a more conciliatory tone and called for unity. In an interview with CNN in November, he said that people could disagree with Trump, but ultimately the president “deserves everybody’s respect.” \n\nTrump entered office last month with the lowest approval ratings for an incoming president in at least four decades. His weeks-old administration has been met with mass protests, contentious confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks and a legal showdown over a controversial immigration order.
