A dividend of 11c net of tax is being recommended. \nCEO Yiannos Michaelides said the fact that the company delivered another very satisfactory year was encouraging and it was now also in a position to look ahead at greater growth potential. \nThe acquisition of a controlling interest in Cablenet, based in Cyprus, was a major milestone because, whilst consolidating GO's position as the leading telecommunications service provider in Malta, the group now also had a significant presence in another market, which was double the size of Malta. \nDuring the year, the group also acquired a controlling interest in ICT solutions company Kinetix, helping GO move closer to achieving its ambition to become a 360 degree ICT powerhouse in Malta. \nThese factors, combined with the continuing strong operational performance of the rest of the group and its investments in Malta’s communications infrastructure, particularly Fibre-to-the-Home, meant that GO was very well placed to look to the future with optimism, he said. \nOperating profit, which amounted to €26.3 million (2015: €27.8 million), represents underlying growth in operating performance if one took into consideration the impact of amortisation of intangible assets created upon the acquisition of Cablenet and Kinetix. Profit before tax amounted to €28.1 million (2015: €34.2 million). \nCash generated from operations amounted to €63.8 million, an increase of €27 million over 2015, as a result of improved cash generation from Malta operations as well as   Cablenet. \nChairman Nizar Bouguila said that GO would continue to pursue its stated objectives of providing the very best in communications, IT and entertainment services to customers, and to being Malta’s leading integrated telecommunications services provider. \n« MCA fine against Melita confirmed on appeal  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:23:55.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
