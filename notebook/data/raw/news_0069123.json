A newly discovered miniature star system is just 39 light years away from the Earth and is known as Trappist-1. Astronomers have reported that people will hear more and more about this system in the coming months and years. These planets have atmospheric conditions similar to Earth. \nWell, 'this is just the beginning' a lot more it to come. Go ahead and read about these planets in the story ahead. NASA Discovers New Solar System With Seven Earth-Like Planets That Could Support Human Life 754 396 Trappist-1 Newly-discoveerd-star-system NASA Astronomers Discover New Solar System Astronomers have discovered star system with planets that could support life just 39 light years away. Seven Earth-like planets have been spotted nearby a dwarf star, Trappist-1 and all of them have a key surviving element, water on their surface. The scientists have claimed that three of the planets are in such a good condition that life may have already evolved on them. Till date, no other star system could discover such a large number of Earth-sized planets. The planets are almost of the same size as of our planet have the rocky composition similar to Earth and surface temperatures between 0-100 degree Celsius. These planets are also suitable for the biological growth as they have vital atmospheric conditions. Check out the complete story behind the scenes. This is really a big news in the corner of our galaxy! The seven planets in the Trappist-1 system.
