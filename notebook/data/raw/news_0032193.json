Ideally, this would avoid blackouts and put money in the pockets of residents.\nYour SaskPower bill is going up — again SaskWind calls it quits, cites lack of support from provincial government The provider could buy renewable energy from a variety of sources such as wind, solar, hydro or even the energy stored in the battery of someone's electric vehicle.\n​ Sadaoui said John McKenzie, director of strategic development for SaskPower, approached her to develop an online auction idea to meet the province's high power demand during peak hours.\nBuying and selling The bidding would see the energy provider buy power from a combination of sellers in 15-minute increments to maximize the amount of energy for the lowest cost.\nSadaoui explained the process is broken down into three phases:\nTrading requirements, as in just how much energy is needed and the set price of the energy. Bidding, which would see the power supplier compete on prices and the amount of energy provided. The winner or winners would be determined in the last phase, where the buyer would buy energy from a combination of sellers. For example, if power was needed for two hours, then it could be purchased from eight different suppliers offering up their 15 minutes of energy.\nSaskPower says solar plan to power up to 12,000 homes by 2021 The specifications would ideally ensure big wind farms couldn't undercut someone looking to make some extra cash from the solar panels on their home, for instance.\nHurdles remaining New regulations and policies would need to be in place before a system such as this could be implemented, Sadaoui said.\nIn addition, smart meters would need to be installed throughout the province.\nThe auction would be held using developed software, such as an app, if it were to go ahead.\n\"On the consumer side, this is a very easy bidding process,\" Sadaoui said.\nA spokesperson for SaskPower said it is something that could be considered in the future. Before that would happen, software rights would need to be acquired.\nWith files from CBC Radio's Morning Edition", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:08:32.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
