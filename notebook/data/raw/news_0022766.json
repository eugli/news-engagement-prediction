That’s more than 2,000 children abducted every single day.\nOne every 40 seconds. In 2010, the Justice Department released the first-ever National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, which aimed to assess the dangers of child pornography, online enticement, and other crimes against children. It found that between 2005 and 2009, there was a 432 percent increase in child pornography movies and files submitted to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which attempts to identify victims.\nChild porn crisis “ Although documenting the precise quantity of child pornography is difficult, it is evident that technological advances have contributed significantly to the overall increase in the child pornography threat, ” the strategy report found. From 2005 through 2009, it said, U.S. Attorneys prosecuted 8,352 child pornography cases, “ and in most instances, the offenders used digital technologies and the Internet to produce, view, store, advertise, or distribute child pornography .”\nThe label “pornography” arguably doesn’t capture the depravity of some of the crimes committed against children. In 2012, a Ganby, Connecticut, police captain was sentenced to 10 years in prison for possessing and trading videos that “ horrifically depicted children being sexually abused by adults, ” according to a U.S. prosecutor. Among the images the former cop sought from fellow traders were those of babies being bound and tortured, officials said.\nAlso in 2014, the former acting director of cyber security at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was convicted for his participation in a child porn ring that included images so violent and disturbing that even veteran investigators said they were shocked by what they saw. A federal prosecutor said the employee used his technical expertise to navigate anonymous computer networks frequented by child porn peddlers.\nUK government implicated in pedo ring Cases of violent child abuse in the United States have mirrored recent revelations from an organized abuse ring in the United Kingdom featuring senior members of the British government. Shocking cases of crimes against children went unreported or covered up for decades. As The Daily Beast reported Friday, the potential key witness in the ring, who was himself allegedly a victim as a schoolboy, fled Britain and now lives in the United States.\nThe international dimensions of child pornography and violence haven’t escaped the FBI, which last week helped to take down an alleged porn kingpin in South Africa. The accused was reportedly arrested at his home in Grahamstown, near the country’s southern coast, and had 16 hard drives, a laptop, and video and still cameras. FBI agents are said to have discovered the network after seven people were arrested in the United States using Web sites designed to coax children into performing sexual acts while surreptitiously being videotaped.\nsource: http://bit.ly/2kkZzza", "external_links": ["https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/ct/Press2012/20120210-1.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Te17kyuezIk", "http://yournewswire.com/trump-pedophiles-deserve-death-penalty/", "http://www.justice.gov/psc/docs/natstrategyreport.pdf", "http://www.alternativenewsnetwork.net/donald-trump-pedophiles-will-get-death-penalty/", "http://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/2015/03/12/cops-nail-kowie-child-porn-kingpin/", "http://bit.ly/2kkZzza", "https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-are-kidnapped-each-day-in-the-US", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-sickening-child-porn-crisis-infecting-u-s-government-agencies.html"], "published": "2017-02-08T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:12:06.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
