Here’s where they stand—miles apart—on key issues: https://t.co/VPUU8xNwPp pic.twitter.com/V1LwnCStlk\n— VICE Canada (@vicecanada) February 13, 2017\nThe meeting comes at a crucial time, as Trump continues to battle to convince a court to reinstate an executive order he signed barring refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations — and the Canadian government faces pointed questions about how it is safeguarding the rights of its citizens. NDP leader Tom Mulcair has urged Trudeau to raise the ban, and its impact on Canadians and permanent residents, with Trump. Meanwhile, headlines about refugees fleeing the U.S. into Canada continued to dominate the news cycle, putting more pressure on Ottawa to answer critics calling on it to scrap a border agreement that automatically prevents asylum seekers from the U.S. from seeking refuge in Canada.\nThe Associated Press reported that the visit will see the two leaders announce a task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. A White House official told the AP that Trudeau’s office had reached out about a joint effort.\nIt is customary for the president of the United States to make his first foreign trip to Canada, but Trump was reportedly warned by Canadian officials that he might be confronted by protesters.\nTrudeau will be joined by a number of key ministers in Washington who will play a big role in ongoing Canada-U.S. relations.\nItinerary 10:50 a.m. Trudeau arrives in Washington and is greeted by President Trump.\n11:10 A “tete-a-tete” between the two leaders unfolds in the Oval Office.\n11:25 An “expanded bilateral meeting” that is closed to the media continues in the Oval Office.\n12:25 Trump and Trudeau participate in a roundtable discussion with women executives in the West Wing of the White House, followed by a luncheon hosted by president.\n2 p.m. Trump and Trudeau hold a media availability session. An hour later, Trudeau will meet with Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, followed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nCover: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Here&#8217;s", "https://t.co/V1LwnCStlk", "https://twitter.com/vicecanada/status/831140887174328324", "https://t.co/VPUU8xNwPp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fheres-your-guide-to-trudeau-and-trumps-first-meeting", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/more-refugees-cross-at-emerson-manitoba-1.3978714"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:02:49.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
