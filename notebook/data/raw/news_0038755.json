Read complete review Upon switching from a regular mic through the PA to my TC Helicon MP-75 mic enhanced with the VoiceLive 2, the first words from my sound techs' mouth were, \"Wow, listen to how clear that is.\"The audience sat up and took notice that my setup made the same crummy-sounding PA system sound much, much better...and that was with no tweaking done to the sound board on the PA itself...nor had any tweaking been done on the VL-2 except for having the TONE, and PITCH buttons on, and set to automatic! Woohooo!Many of the upper grade PA systems like, Mackie, Soundcraft, PreSonus, and Yamaha, have pretty decent effects built into themselves. However, after hearing the TC Helicon VoiceLive 2's smooth, studio-like compression, de-essing, world-class reverb, and delays, every sound man and musician who was there the day I auditioned my TC Helicon VL-2 and MP-75 were just blown into the 21st century of state-of-the-art sound technology. Besides being blessed with a great voice, using the VoiceLive2 along with it's companion MP-75 microphone have given me an advantage over other singers that I never thought I'd ever have. The TC Helicon VL-2 and MP-75 has renewed in me an old self confidence I thought I'd lost a long time ago. I used to enjoy and depend upon that inner-confidence while singing. With my new equipment from TC Helicon, and lots of practice using it, my old self-confidence has begun showing up at my performances and even rehearsals, once again. My audiences are noticing my renewed self-confidence too, and I get more applause than ever. If you can afford a VoiceLive 2, and an MP-75 along with some quality cables, I urge you to go out and invest in yourself, and your equipment. It really can make the difference between sounding like a week end amateur, or a complete professional!VoiceLive 2 gives us professional quality vocal effects in one attractive, durable floor unit. It has 10 foot push buttons on the unit itself (many with more than one function), 6 of those buttons are dedicated to simply turning particular effect blocks on or off (or setting tap tempo). There are foot switches for Harmony, Doubling, microModulation, Reverb, Delay, and FX. VL2 has a shortcut button that is assignable. One thing you can assign to it is the single button looper that can be used to loop voice or guitar, or both. Up to 15 seconds of stereo looping, or 30 of mono looping. A single button control for play, overdub, stop, undo, and erase. If you're using a TC Helicon MP-75, the control button on that mic can be used to trigger and control the looper feature, instead of the temporary button on the VL2! In fact, the control button on the TC Helicon MP-75 can control just about any of the effects found in the VL2. So cool, you have to try it! The VL2 works very hard for any singer/ musician looking to improve their vocal reproduction and sound quality during any live gig or even studio recording session. It's designed specifically for performers to use during live performances, and gives the performing artists themselves more say and control in the final outcome of their voice in the mix. VL2 is packed with today's state-of-the-art vocal effects, and even a few more that you may have never heard of yet. The VL2 has it's own very accurate and easy to see guitar tuner, along with a dedicated guitar effects block section including all your favorite effects. Compression, a multi-band EQ, a modulation section (including chorus, detune and flange), and several high quality reverb to round out the guitar effects section. Phase reversal is also included in the guitar section for possibly reducing feedback. The separate guitar effects block seems to be geared more for acoustic-electric guitars as it has no distortion section, but I've made nice use of these effects with my electric double hum-bucker guitar.The guitar effects are global, and switching to new are not changed when changing presets for vocal songs.The vocal section of the VL2 is crammed with vocal possiblities, and it's chock full with completely professional, adjustable, and programmable vocal effects. Automatic microphone volume adjustment. Phantom power Professional high quaility reverbs with ducking capability, tap-tempo capabable in the echoes and delays section also with ducking capabilities, micro-modulations such a detune, flangers, choruses are offered in the umod section. It features hardtune abilities, also. It's harmony section is extensive and inlcudes a \"HOLD\" feature that is foot-triggerable. One to four harmonies are available in any gender (eight with keyboard or MIDI, also gender adjustable), along with a separate and totally fantastic doubler effect that has many editable parameters (including 1 to 4 doubles, gender adjust for each double). It also features rhythmic and tone sections, Not only that, it has a USB port for future upgrades, or uploading or downloading other users' presets.Downloading presets to computers for future reference and recall has many benefits. The VoiceLive2 has MIDI IN, OUT, and THRU for complete flexibility with computers, keyboards, and other MIDI-oriented equipment. Harmonies within the VL2 can be controlled by a connected GUITAR, MIDI IN, and AUXILIARY IN (such as mp3 or CD's). However, harmony can be derived strictly by using KEY & SCALE mode. In KEY & SCALE mode, the VL2 will ignore the AUTO INPUT SENSE and harmonies will be rendered . I AUTO INPUT SENSE the unit decided which of the guitar in MIDI IN, and AUX IN you are currently playing through so it derives it's harmonies from one of those. Inputs and outputs are very complete, and the unit produces stereo effects.Starting with the upper left finger control buttons on top of the VL2...These are what TC Helicon refers to as their \"live engineer\". It's important to note that these TONE PITCH and GUITAR FX controls are global, that means they have an affect on all the sounds within the VL2, and affect the sounds in all the numbered presets! Although these controls can be used automatically (as designed), they can also be used in manual mode to override the automated engineering aspects of the VL2. In manual mode, there are several more options given for adjusting the equalizer settings, so some people (like sound engineers), may find that useful, however for most of us ordinary users/singers, I urge you to let the automation we pay for in this item to do it's job...it's generally better than we are. After using the VL2 at several personal venues, I've yet to turn the automated features found in it to manual operation. It simply seems to work best in it's automated mode, making it a lot less likely for the sound to get messed up.\"TONE\" button controls, Adaptive Shape EQ, Adaptive Compresssion, De-Ess, & Adaptive Gate.I have never found a reason to turn off the \"Tone\" button, or even take it out of automated mode. It's simply wonderful technology that works hard, and well for me.The compressor is wonderful, and makes my singing sound more musical. The compressor is adjustable if needed. I've yet to find a De-Esser that works better in an all-in-one unit such as this one. The \"Pitch\" button located directly to the right of the \"Tone\" button. Pressing the PITCH button activates auto chromatic pitch correction. It's automatic setting is at 50%, and is usually all that is required. There is no need to set Key or Scale, all notes that you sing in the 12 tone western chromatic scale are corrected to the nearest scale tone. **I've never heard it working when I sing, unless I increase the value above it's normal 50%.I only gave features an 9 because something this expensive and important in a singer/musician equipment package should come standard with a protective storage case. Already, some VL2 users have come up with their own homemade padded and reinforced travel cases to withstand the rigors of traveling. I and many other VoiceLive 2 users have also found a cheap dust cover would have been a nice extra, and many of us have either built our own, or are using cheap plastic shower caps (which seem to work pretty well). I'm looking to TC Helicon to remedy these problems in the future, as they are an excellent company who really listens to their customers.I would also love to see owner/customers/porgrammers program more classis cover songs into the TC Helicon website database for everyone to try.Quality of build, effects, and quality of genius electronic engineering from the people at TC Helicon are either on par with the industry's very best, and an many cases go well beyond the accepted norms for excellence in the industry. TC Helicon sets the new bar for excellence in floor-based, user-controlled voice effects. The units are designed in Canada, but are manufactured in China (so I take off one point for that). I and many other VL2 users have noticed the effects foot switches are a bit loud during operation...making for awkward switching during quiet passages of music during live performance, and can be problematic in studio situations as well. I took off one point from being excellent because of the mechanically noisy switching. The noise is not electronic in nature. However, the switches are very heavy duty, and lighted, and should provide years of trouble-free switching even on dimly lit stage areas. On very loud stage environments these relatively noisy switches should not be a problem given all the other noises in live arenas and stages.To me, even though the VoiceLive 2 MP-75 package seems a bit expensive at the retail level, TC Helicon's VoiceLive 2 makes certain you're getting what you pay for...top quality professional vocal effects (normally only found in the best of studios), placed in a heavy duty stage-ready case with multifunctional lights surrounding the stomp buttons, all in an attractive floor unit designed for use by singers during live performances. Singers, and sound people could pay thousands of dollars more for multi-effect units that don't perform as well, or have near the capabilities of the VoiceLive 2. A singer being able to control their own effects in real-time while performing is a great idea for many.On the downside of value, if TC Helicon wanted to provide a bit more value for their customers who are already shelling out many hundreds of dollars for the VL-2, they should also either provide a custom-built expression pedal with the unit, or list it as an optional extra. I'd really like my expression pedal to cosmetically match my VL-2 and carry the TC Helicon trademark. Also, the whole expensive effects unit is completely worthy of a hard shell case made by TC Helicon and thrown into the the deal from the manufacturer from the get go. ...Not the little soft shell case currently being offered by TC Helicon's website to protect a several of their electronic items...I want one specifically made for the VL2! It's worth it! VS Amazing Quality / Poor UI The control over the harmonies, and lead vocals is amazing.

Read complete review The control over the harmonies, and lead vocals is amazing. Problem is, all modifications and creation of new 'patches' or 'presets' MUST be done through navigation of the onboard buttons and display. This thing will only be on the floor during shows -- otherwise, plan on buying a stand for this thing to be on while you configure it.There were plans to have an Editor created by a third party, but that seems to have fallen through, at present a very basic Editor has been created by someone in the user community.To have gotten it this close, and have no computer-based user interface (such as Line6, who has seemed to have gotten absolutely right with their POD products) is a huge swing and a miss.Bottom line: Pros who are comfortable with detailed navigation of button-based menus, GET THIS!! However, if you are a mid-level user who is expecting a product to shine right out of the box without reading a single page of the user manual, give this one a pass.
