Will he be like Ryan Gosling waltzing through the Milky Way? Or more like me, stumbling about at weddings while praying for the music to stop? \nIn the 21 days since Team Trump assumed power — yes, despite all of the shouting, it’s been only three weeks since President T got the nuclear codes — Donnelly has maintained his balance like a ballerina. He voted to reject Betsy DeVos (Education), Rex Tillerson (State Department) and Jeff Sessions (Justice). He affirmed Nikki Haley (United Nations), James Mattis (Defense), Elaine Chao (Transportation), Mike Pompeo (Central Intelligence Agency) and John Kelly (Homeland Security). \nThat’s a balanced dance card — and one that’s fairly safe for the leading and increasingly lonely Democrat in a deep red state. But there’s a vote coming that could pin Donnelly’s feet to the floor when he seeks re-election next year. \nThe nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court poses a special challenge for Indiana’s senior senator. Liberal special-interest groups have vowed to declare war against any Democrat who votes to plant Trump’s pick on the high court for the next three decades. The threat of a serious primary opponent seems unlikely, but a less-than united party heading into a tough general election against a serious Republican challenger (did someone say Luke Messer?) could be devastating for Donnelly’s second-term chances. \nSo that means the politically safe play for Donnelly is to vote against Gorsuch? \nWell, no. Remember that Trump won Indiana by 19 percentage points. Remember that almost every other Republican on the ballot in November won handily as well. Remember that Evan Bayh — more of a lock to win in August than the Atlanta Falcons in the third quarter — was swamped by 10 percentage points. \nRemember as well that many conservatives pinched their noses and voted for Trump precisely because he pledged to nominate solid conservatives to the court. Gorsuch meets that promise. \nHow would those voters react then if Donnelly were to become a key obstacle to a conservative replacement for Antonin Scalia? Imagine the attack ads come 2018: “Joe Donnelly and Bernie Sanders were evil twins who failed America on the most important vote of their lives!” \nThen what in the name of Richard Lugar is an Indiana moderate to do? \nThis past week, Donnelly issued a nonstatement statement saying that he would “carefully review and consider” Gorsuch’s record and qualifications . (Thanks for clearing that up, Joe). \nBut if the past truly is prologue, then it’s not hard to see where Donnelly is headed with this. The senator’s greatest strength over the years has been his ability to shut out the political noise. He’s upset ideologues on all sides because he’s consistently taken a balanced approach, even with the most contentious of issues, and he’s done so for the most part without appearing to be overly calculating. In other words, Donnelly has put practicality ahead of politics. \nSo I’m going to break my self-imposed rule against making predictions to assert that Donnelly will ultimately vote to affirm Gorsuch. \nIt’s hard to argue that Gorsuch isn’t qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. He’s served admirably for 10 years on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. He’s earned degrees from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. His depth of knowledge, innate intelligence and even his writing style have earned praise. Legal experts, on the left and the right, who know him speak highly of his qualifications. \nGiven those facts, it’s difficult to see how Donnelly, the patron senator of moderation, could justify a no vote once Gorsuch’s nomination makes it to the Senate floor. \nIt’s even harder to see how he could justify that vote when the 2018 campaign kicks in without sacrificing his common-sense Hoosier image. And likely his political future. \nIn this instance, the practical choice and the smart political choice are the same: Vote to confirm Gorsuch. \nSometimes even moderates can’t stick solely to the middle ground. In the case of Neil Gorsuch, expect Joe Donnelly to jig to the right. \nContact Swarens at tim.swarens@indystar.com.
