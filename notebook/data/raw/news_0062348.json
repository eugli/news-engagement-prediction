We’re going to win this one because they’re not trying to win it’.\" \nWessels says that statement immediately struck him as odd. \nWessels then described how he recalls Pakistan, chasing just 215 for victory in another ODI soon thereafter, collapsed from 101/2 to 178 all out after looking well on track for the win. \nIn that collapse, which saw eight wickets fall for just 77 runs, Wessels remembers \"two or three\" run-outs where the ball was hit straight to star fielder, Jonty Rhodes. \nThat match was part of Cronje's first series as Proteas captain.
