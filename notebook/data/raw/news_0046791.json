Credit: RSPCA More than a thousand little chicks have been found dumped in a field in Cambridgeshire.\nMORE PICTURES HERE\nThe RSPCA has launched an investigation after the day-old birds were discovered in Crowland near Peterborough.\nRSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: “I have never seen anything like it, it was just a sea of yellow. And the noise was unbelievable.\n“The chicks are only about a day old and are really tiny and quite delicate. Some of the birds were dead or dying when we arrived so some, sadly, had to be humanely put to sleep.\n“Thankfully, most of the chicks did not appear to be suffering.”\nIt is believed the chicks came from a commercial chick producer nearby and may have been abandoned by a third-party.\nThe producer is fully cooperating and assisting the RSPCA with their investigations.\nAnyone with any information is asked to contact the RSPCA’s inspector appeal line on 0300 123 8018.\nCambridgeshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:21:46.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
