He would sit and watch his the evolution of his older brother during a time when there weren't many outside visitors, and then he'd leave with him for a weekend sleepover. \nNoticing the addition, Oakland coach Greg Kampe finally asked for an explanation. \n“I don’t want him in that environment,” explained Dorsey-Walker, 23, a redshirt senior point guard. “I want him up here.” \nKi'Shawn was among the factors that motivated Dorsey-Walker to leave Iowa State after a year and a half and return home. The former Detroit Pershing standout transferred to Oakland in the middle of the 2014-15 season, and on Tuesday will go through Senior Night festivities when the Golden Grizzlies play host to Youngstown State (7 p.m., Channel 20 in Detroit). \nKi'Shawn has spent most weekends with his brother since the return. \n“He’s done that for three years,” Kampe said. “That’s one of the reasons he came home. \n“We knew we were going to try to get him eligible early. He only sat out a semester. We knew that coming home. I knew what issues he had at home and why he needed to be close to home. A lot of times people magnify those things so the NCAA feels sorry for you. In this case, we didn’t have to magnify anything. He needed to be here for his brothers and sisters.” Taking it on \nDorsey-Walker struggled to find direction when he was young, surrounded by negative influences in his neighborhood on 8 Mile and Russell. \nHe was smart and athletic. But fitting in was more important than standing out. \n“Sherron used to do the same things, hanging out with the bad boys, stealing cars,” his mother, Laurel Walker, said. “Then he changed himself around.” \nSherron Dorsey-Walker holds his nephew Chaz Walker, 1, as his family prepares to leave after Oakland's men's basketball game on Sunday, Feb. 19, 2017.

The burden fell to Dorsey-Walker when he was about 13 years old – after his older brother Charles moved away – and he has remained the leader to three of his younger brothers ever since. \nDorsey-Walker, who still sees his father, was a few years older than Carlos, 18, and Kiron, 15, and more than 12 years older than Ki'Shawn, 9. He has another younger brother, Kerron Dorsey, 19, who attends Morris College in South Carolina, and his sister, Sherronia Doresey-Walker, recently graduated from Michigan State and started a scholarship fund. \nSherron Dorsey-Walker would help his brothers with their homework and prepped them for school. \nHe shopped for groceries, trekking on foot before he was old enough to drive. \n“Basketball was my safe haven,” Dorsey-Walker said. “It took me away from doing a lot of things that was around. Basketball kept me focused.” \nOakland guard Sherron Dorsey-Walker (30).

When he left for school that next summer, they knew the family’s connective tissue was fraying. \n“It took a lot of toll on Carlos and Kiron,” Laurel Walker said. “Charles, my oldest, he had got married, so he had to deal with his wife and their kids. With Sherron leaving, it was like 'both of our big brothers are departing.' ” \nBut she refused to stand in the way of his success. \n“I wanted him to stay in Michigan,” she said. “I said 'just make up your mind.' Like a mom, I didn’t want my kid to leave out of state because I’d be worried. It would be my first child leaving in another state.” Coming home \nDorsey-Walker’s reach was limited when he returned to Michigan in the middle of the 2014-15 season. \nWhile guiding the kids still at home, his older brother Charles was beyond his grasp. \nCharles and an accomplice robbed three banks with guns in Dorsey-Walker’s first four months back in Michigan. The final one, in April 2015, ended in a high-speed chase with the pair being arrested. They were charged, convicted and now Charles, 29, is serving a sentence in the United States Penitentiary (USP) Hazelton in West Virginia until November 2048. \nThere's a lot weighing on Dorsey-Walker. Kiron has made a few trips to juvenile detention and currently is in the Calumet Center in Highland Park until next summer. \n“You’ve got to let some people learn from their mistakes and grow,” Dorsey-Walker said. \nIt intensifies his focus. \nOn Saturday, between the final home games of his college career, Dorsey-Walker was on a three-way call with Kiron and his mother, encouraging his brother and reminding him about life's possibilities. Inside Calumet Center, they’ll occasionally let the kids watch basketball games, trying to use Dorsey-Walker as an inspiration for their futures. \n“They all know it’s Kiron’s brother and they’ve got a goal to be like him,” Laurel Walker said. \nDorsey-Walker’s influence is starting to resonate. Carlos is completing his senior year at Fredrick Douglass Academy and planning for college. Ki'Shawn practically is attached at Dorsey-Walker's hip, playing basketball and trying to mirror Dorsey-Walker’s actions. \n“Me being home has been great for them, so they can see the example I am setting,” Dorsey-Walker said. “That’s been my motivation for a long time. I have younger brothers and younger siblings looking up to me and I feel it’s my duty to show them the way. The right way. It helped me grow and understand life isn’t always perfect. People do something wrong and they need a second chance. \n“Seeing them grow and go through their hard times, it was big on me emotionally but I feel like being a big brother, that’s what it’s all about. You have to support them when they’re at their lowest and when they’re at their highest, so they can find that balance and grow.” \nHis reach has extended beyond his house. \nOne of his closest friends, Martez Walker, was forced to transfer from Texas after legal problems. Martez chose Oakland, partially for his comfort with former Pershing teammates Kay Felder and Dorsey-Walker. \nSince coming to Oakland, Martez has matured with Dorsey-Walker there to aid him. The two share a history few others understand. Senior year \nWhen Kampe takes the microphone for Oakland’s senior ceremony Tuesday night, he’ll steer clear of the personal challenges. \nHe’ll focus on Dorsey-Walker’s successes, instead. \nHe was valedictorian of his class at Pershing, and sustained his academic focus while at Iowa State and Oakland. He carries a 3.36 grade-point average as an integrative studies major, is a three-time Horizon League Academic Honor Roll selection and was one of only two state of Michigan players named to the Division I CoSIDA Academic All-District team. \n“He’s one of the greatest kids that we’ve had come through our program,” Kampe said. “What the world doesn’t know is we do a lot of community service and he’s the best I’ve ever seen at it. It’s usually underprivileged kids and how he interacts with those kids and it makes sense because that’s what he does at home. He walks in the room and everybody just knows.” \nDorsey-Walker has accepted his role on the court, too. \nPlaying last year with superstar Felder, he started the season fast and made major contributions in the non-conference season. His role decreased when Martez Walker became eligible in the middle of the year, but he still remained a starter through the Horizon League tournament because his defense was valuable. \nNow, he's embracing his role as point guard following Felder's early entry into the NBA draft (he was taken by the Atlanta Hawks in the second round and currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers). \n“He’s really matured and having a great senior year,” Kampe said. “He’s worked so hard at it. Good things happen to good people so I always think something good is going to happen to him. He’s played the 1 a lot. For a kid that’s never played it before, in your senior year, especially in our system, it’s not an easy system.” \nThough he knew it would affect how he was viewed by professional teams, Dorsey-Walker never complained. \n“It’s a difficult position in college because you have to know so many players in so many different spots,” he said. “But I think it was good for me because I can guard, I can pass, I can shoot and I can dribble. I feel my skill set allowed me to be in that positon and different positions. That versatility is good for our team. \n“It’s hard for coach to keep you off the floor.” \nDorsey-Walker is averaging 12.6 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.75 assists and 1.25 steals per game this season, helping Oakland sweep first-place Valparaiso and emerge as a contender entering the Horizon League tournament. Winning it would put the Grizzlies in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011. \n“Coming here that’s what I wanted to do,” he said. “I had family problems, but I wanted to come back here and continue the tradition here, put Oakland back on the map. I feel getting back to the NCAA tournament will be the perfect end to my college career. \n“And I feel it would be a great start in the right direction here at Oakland.” \nBut even if Oakland falls short, Kampe will appreciate Dorsey-Walker's impact \n“This year was about seeing Sherron and having him in a great situation and letting him go and play,” Kampe said. “Good things happen to good people. I feel good about the future of this team because we’re led by a class act.” \nContact Mark Snyder: msnyder@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @mark__snyder .
