It was then that he was advised at length about fund management which including investing in small shops. \n\nA police officer who was part of the investigation told this to TOI. Same was confirmed by sources in the MPATS. \n\nBalram Singh, 26 - resident of Suhash Village in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh became part of the cross-border lottery fraud two years ago and was apparently used by Pakistan handlers to transfer money to their 'moles' in India, said sources. \n\nHis named had cropped up during investigations into monitory transactions of two alleged ISI 'spies' caught by security agencies from Jammu last November. Satvinder Singh alias Bittu and Dadu alias Lucky were arrested from Suchetgarh near Shamshan Ghat while found moving around in suspicious circumstances. Investigations revealed they were providing vital security related information to Pakistan through Whatsapp groups. \n\nDuring investigation, police came to know that they were collecting the secret information regarding the \"locations of army, Police and other security forces\" and then supplying the same to Pakistan through Whatsapp groups and the money they got in return was deposited in their bank accounts. \n\nWhen the bank transactions were investigated, it was found that cash was deposited in Satvinder's bank account from Satna district in Madhya Pradesh. \n\n\"And when the deposit slip in Satna was collected, handwriting matched with that of Balram Singh. He was kept under constant monitoring by central intelligence and MPATS since then,\" - said an investigating officer. Balram had deposited payments ranging from Rs 20000 to Rs 40000 in three or four instalments after being asked by someone in Pakistan. \n\nAfter being arrested by the MPATS in coordination with central agencies, Balram confessed to have deposited the money. He said he had never met Satvinder. \"He was given a bank account and asked to deposit in cash. The money he deposited reached Balram from Pakistan through a well knitted Hawala racket,\" said the officer. \n\nHe was a school dropout and was living in a rented house in Satna town for the last three years. His father owns 18 acres of land and was unaware of Balram's conduct and source of income behind his lavish lifestyle. \n\nPolice said Balram had also travelled to Dubai in search of job a few years ago. He had quit studies after failing in class 10th but had a good command over English. Charged with offences like waging war against the country, Balram is presently on remand with MPATS for next seven days and is being grilled for more details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:11:24.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
