Can radioactive waste be immobilized in glass for millions of years? November 3, 2016 \nHow do you handle nuclear waste that will be radioactive for millions of years, keeping it from harming people and the environment? Microbially produced ferrous iron may decrease technetium concentrations in groundwater February 21, 2011 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- The long-lasting radionuclide technetium is transported through the subsurface near former nuclear production and processing sites, moving toward rivers and lakes. But its journey can come to an abrupt end ... Iron-bearing minerals in sediments react with and immobilize contaminants February 28, 2014 \nThe release of wastes associated with nuclear reprocessing from storage facilities into the underlying sediments and groundwater is an important environmental concern at the Hanford Site. This study provides evidence that ... Automated analyzer for complex nuclear waste provides rapid results March 28, 2007 \nIdentifying and quantifying specific alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides in liquid solutions can be challenging and time consuming – typically taking from days to weeks to get results back from an analytical laboratory. ... Plutonium keeps its electrons close to home September 15, 2016 \nFound in nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons, plutonium is an incredibly complex element that has far-ranging energy, security, and environmental effects. To understand plutonium, scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ... Recommended for you Researchers find new clues for nuclear waste cleanup February 23, 2017 \nA Washington State University study of the chemistry of technetium-99 has improved understanding of the challenging nuclear waste and could lead to better cleanup methods. Light-driven reaction converts carbon dioxide into fuel February 23, 2017 \nDuke University researchers have developed tiny nanoparticles that help convert carbon dioxide into methane using only ultraviolet light as an energy source. Computing with biochemical circuits made easy February 23, 2017 \nElectronic circuits are found in almost everything from smartphones to spacecraft and are useful in a variety of computational problems from simple addition to determining the trajectories of interplanetary satellites. At ... Researchers pave the way for ionotronic nanodevices February 23, 2017 \nIonotronic devices rely on charge effects based on ions instead of or in addition to electrons. These devices open new opportunities for creating electrically switchable memories. However, there are still many technical challenges ... B3NO2 ring system serves as a versatile catalyst for amide bond formation February 22, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as graphene, have several potential uses as its π-conjugated structure lends itself to high stability and conductivity. Researchers are interested in exploring polycyclic ... Scientists discover how essential methane catalyst is made February 22, 2017 \nNew ways to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into methane gas for energy use are a step closer after scientists discovered how bacteria make a component that facilitates the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:10:12.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
