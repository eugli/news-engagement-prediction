India's only active volcano in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is erupting once again. The Barren Island volcano, located about 140km northeast of Port Blair, started erupting in 1991 after a dormant phase of over 150 years and has shown intermittent activity since then. A team of scientists led by National Institute Of Oceanography 's Dr Abhay Mudholkar said that the volcano is active and spewing smoke and lava once again. Researchers from the NIO have sampled the sediments and water in the vicinity of the volcano and recovered coal-like black pyroclastic material representing proximal volcanic ejecta. Clouds were seen at the crater mouth where the smoke was bellowing out in an otherwise clear sky. These samples will help in deciphering the nature of the present and past volcanic activity in the region. \"We are seeing the composition of the lava and powdering the black sand to figure out what the components are,\" Mudholkar told TOI.
