(PTI) \nWith the polling at the two states, Goa and Punjab, continues, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal today criticized the Election Commission’s decision to schedule the Goa polls and the Punjab polls at different times. Over a post in his official Twitter handle Kejriwal said, “As per EC notification, polling time in Goa from 7 am to 5 pm but in Punjab, it is from 8 am to 5 pm (one hr less). Why?” \nContinuing his verbal assault on the Centre with polling underway in Goa and Punjab, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asserted that the Election Commission has “surrendered” before Prime Minister Narendra Modi . \nAlso Watch: \n“EC has completely surrendered before Modiji, just like CBI n RBI ,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Chief said in a tweet. Taking on the Prime Minister over demonetisation, Kejriwal further said that the move had not eradicated black money as he had promised, and the evidence was visible in Goa and Punjab where polling is underway. \n“Modi ji had said that the menace of black money will stop after demonetisation. But it has been distributed vigorously in Punjab and Goa. Then what was the benefit of demonetisation?,” the tweet read. \nEarlier today, Kejriwal exuded confidence of his party sweeping to power in Goa and Punjab where polling began Saturday morning. \n“Goa and Punjab will create history today,” Kejriwal tweeted shortly after polling began. \nMeanwhile, voting began in Punjab and Goa on Saturday morning for the 2017 Assembly elections. The two states are the first of the five to go to polling ahead of Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Uttarakhand which are being held simultaneously in the months of February and March. \n(With inputs from agencies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:21:47.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
