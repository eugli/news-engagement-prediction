National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete (top) speaks near South African President Jacob Zuma (down) during a session of questions to the president at the South African Parliament in Cape Town on November 23, 2016. Zuma faced questions about South Africa’s possible downgrading by financial rating agencies, his connection to the Gupta family of businessmen, and student protests in the country. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, who have disrupted several of these Presidential Answer sessions, boycotted this sitting. AFP) – \nIn chaotic scenes, about 30 guards dressed in white shirts forcibly ejected about 25 members from the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party who had prevented the president from speaking for about an hour. \n“We have been patient with you, we have been trying to give you an opportunity to express yourselves but… it is being abused,” Speaker Baleka Mbete told the EFF before the lawmakers were thrown out. \nThe state-of-the-nation address has descended in mayhem for the last three years as the EFF — dressed in their uniform of red workers’ overalls and berets — attempt to prevent Zuma from delivering his speech. \nZuma appeared unbothered by the violence unfolding in the chamber and finally took to podium with his trademark chuckle. \nShortly before the guards moved in, EFF leader Julius Malema described Zuma as “an incorrigible man rotten to the core”. \nMalema also turned his fire on Speaker Mbete telling her: “Your conduct has failed you. You are irrational, impatient, partisan.” \nPolice laid out huge coils of barbed wire around parliament in Cape Town, as singing ANC supporters were bussed in from around the country for a street rally. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:14:09.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
