The situation has apparently gotten so creepy for the budding actress, she had no choice but to file a restraining order. New court docs filed by her legal team reveal some horrifying details that put the superstar singer under a very bad light. \nAccording to TMZ , Karrueche claimed in a sworn statement that Chris sent her numerous death threats and refuses to let her move on with her life. Worst yet, the model claims their relationship was abusive and that a few years back, Chris punched her in the stomach twice, and pushed her down the stairs. This is a scary new revelation about the singer, especially considering that at the time, he was still on probation for assaulting Rihanna back in 2009. The “Fine China” singer certainly didn’t help his case by posting an incriminating video on Instagram proudly bragging about his stalker ways. \nSheesh! This situation between these two gets messier by the minute. \nFrom Issa Rae to Donald Trump to Kanye and Kim, 2016 was full of many highs and lows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:47:33.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
