According to Yashpal Malik himself, the man spearheading the Jat reservation movement in Haryana has a vision beyond agitations and protest marches , and the political ambitions of his contemporary Jat leaders.\n\"Jat reservation is just part of a bigger cause. The political class has lost all restraints and accountability. We need a strong social organization that controls this class and works as a pressure group to drive the nation in the right direction, just like the RSS deals with the BJP. I am sowing the seeds of such an organization. I might not be able to taste the fruits in my lifetime, for it might take long to be established,\" Malik, 55, from Kharar village in Muzaffarnagar, who took voluntary retirement in 1994 as corporal from the Indian Air Force after serving for 10 years.\nSoon after, Malik started work as a building contractor and took the time to read the works of Sir Chhotu Ram, prominent Jat leader and reformer of the early 20th century, and Jai Prakash Narayan. Inspired, Malik began a social reform movement among OBCs. He first joined the Jat Mahasabha, an organization of Jat intellectuals, but found the pace of mobilization too slow for the movement he had in mind. He also found Jat leaders like Ajit Singh had only political ambitions.\nAt social meetings in western UP he mooted the idea of a social organization to unite OBCs. However, at that time the immediate need was to give impetus to the Jat reservation movement. In November 24, 2006 the first meeting was conducted in Ghaziabad in support of reservation and the Akhil Bharatiya Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti (ABJASS) was founded, with Malik as the national president. For the next four years, protests and rallies were conducted in Punjab, UP, Delhi and elsewhere.\nIn 2013, agitators laid siege to the then Union home minister's residence in Delhi. The same year, Jats were mobilized in Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to not vote for Congress. On April 4, 2014 that reservation was given to Jats.\nThe Supreme Court quashed the decision on March 17, 2015. On July 21, the SC dismissed the review petition by the Centre. However, the Jats say that the review petition was deliberately weakened by the government. This led to various agitations headed by Malik. The one held in Haryana in February 2015 turned violent leading to the deaths of 30 people in several districts of the state.\nMalik has left no avenue unexplored to make his demands heard. Just before the UP elections, ABJASS formed teams of Jats from Rajasthan, Delhi and elsewhere, who campaigned against the BJP in 125 seats in western UP.\nHowever, he does not like to be referred to as a political leader. \"Politics destroys causes. A strong social organization has enough power to pressurize governments, provided it remains apolitical. For instance, even the PM used to take Mahinder Singh Tikait seriously but only till he was apolitical,\" says Malik.\nHis ultimate aim, however, is to consolidate all OBCs. \"Almost all regional political parties, like the RLD, SP, Shiv Sena and even the BSP, survive on the OBC vote bank. We have formed the Rashtriya OBC Seva Sangh to consolidate OBCs. Our influence on them will determine the politics of this country.\"\nIn the last year, Malik's stature has outgrown his political contemporaries like Naresh Tikait of Bharatiya Kisan Union and RLD supremo Ajit Singh. ABJASS now has chapters in 13 states with Jat presence.\n\"The main reason for Malik's growing mass appeal is his dedication to the cause and his apolitical stance. Most leaders fall prey to the trappings of political power. It has been 10 years now but this man hasn't,\" said ABJASS UP president Manvender Verma.\n\"He is a man of indomitable will and is trustworthy. This is a big thing in these times,\" said Karnail Bhawda, ABJASS Punjab president.\n\"This government will bend. It's just a matter of time. We have suffered a lot at the hands of these political parties. Now we are mobilizing the community to agitate in Delhi from March 2. The date for a mass movement of tractors on more than two dozen highways, to Delhi, will be announced. The tractor not only symbolizes farmers' power, but is the biggest threat to any government,\" Malik says, smiling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:07:10.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
