They should have \"willingness to travel extensively, including in difficult environments\". \n\nThe position requires a high level of personal commitment to the monitoring team's mandate and to the United Nations. \n\nThe fifteen members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) are on the Sanctions Committee. India is currently not a member of the UNSC and hence also not on the Sanctions Committee. \n\nThe 10-member 'Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team' comprising independent experts assists the Sanctions Committee. \n\nDepending on the vacancies available, India and all other member states can forward nominations of their nationals to serve on the monitoring team. \n\nThe final selection of the team is made by the UN secretariat based on assessment of the individual qualifications of the candidate. \n\nThe monitoring team works in tandem with the UN Secretariat to standardise the format of all United Nations sanctions lists and also assists the Committee in regularly reviewing names on it. \n\nAzhar's JeM, which is said to have links with Taliban and Al-Qaida, has been blacklisted by the UNSC. Ironically, its chief Azhar, who has been behind several major terror strikes in India, has not been banned by the UN.
