I have been in the Premier League 12 years. It's been a wonderful 12 years. \n\"There is no offer on the table but if they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment [in December] I still enjoy working for the Premier League and Uefa. Clattenburg refereed his first Football League game in 2000 Credit: REX \n\"Money has never been a driver as a referee. It's about the drive of doing something different, maybe helping the recruitment,\" \n\"If it didn't happen now I will be looking in the future at that, a bit like Howard Webb has done (in Saudi Arabia) where you are helping another country develop refereeing. \n\"It's important to have the right quality of referee to go with the level of football. China is going to become a huge player in years to come. If they want to be serious about their league they are going to have to have the right setup. Refereeing is a huge part of football.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:34:07.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
