Courtesy Cindy Hamann started her real estate career 22 years ago when a divorce left her as a single mother of three children. The Tomball native began cleaning homes for a relocation company, and worked her way up to become a Realtor. During her first two years in the business, she sold homes during the day and cleaned homes in the evening. Cindy Hamann is the new chair of the Houston Association of Realtors in 2017. Courtesy Eventually, Hamann rose through the ranks to lead Coldwell Banker United Realtors’ office in The Woodlands. Under Hamann’s leadership, The Woodlands office became the brokerage’s top-producing office nationwide. Coldwell Banker United Realtors was acquired by New Jersey-based Realogy Holdings Corp. (NYSE: RLGY) in April 2015. Ultimately, Hamann put her three children through college while maintaining her busy career. Today, Hamann is the new chair of the Houston Association of Realtors . When she is not helping to lead the 36,000-member real estate organization, Hamann is the vice president of sales, performance and recruitment for Heritage Texas Properties, overseeing the Houston-based brokerage’s 17 offices and 300 agents. Houston’s housing market, particularly the luxury segment, has been soft during the oil slump. With oil prices stabilized around $50 a barrel, are you seeing buyers coming back into the market? Yes, buyers are a lot more optimistic. I think everyone was tired of 2016, especially with the election. People want to get on living life. I also think rising interest rates have gotten some buyers off the fence. I’m glad to see the upper end of the housing market is moving. Between August 2015 and October 2016, the upper end was down, a direct correlation with the oil prices. But for the past three consecutive months, luxury has gone up. What kind of buyers are you seeing in the market today? We’re seeing a lot of different buyers: medical, entertainment and even oil and gas. We’re also seeing a lot of new, first-time homebuyers. A lot of Millennials, now that they’re getting married and starting families, are ready to buy. Anything under $200,000 is gone. That starter home inventory is really depleted. We need new construction between $180,000 and $220,000. What about empty nesters? We’re seeing more and more empty-nesters looking to downsize. In fact, Lisa, my life partner, and I are selling our home in Timbergrove after building our farmhouse in Waller County, 60 miles northwest of Houston. Our 40-acre ranch is called Laid Back Acres, and we have some calves, some miniature rescue donkeys and we’re getting a horse. Now that our kids are out of college, we’re looking for a different lifestyle, a stress reliever, out in the country. Lisa grew up on a farm. I grew up in Tomball. Some people want the city, some people love the country. What are Houston buyers looking for in a home? The formal dining room is out. They want an open kitchen concept, lots of yard space and large walk-in closets. They also don’t want a fixer upper. They want a move-in ready home because they don’t want to do all the work. That’s why we’re encouraging our sellers to get new paint, new carpet and renovate. Even minor updates can bring you a lot. Remember, you’re not just purchasing a home or a lifestyle, you’re purchasing a feel. What are your plans for HAR? We’ve seen a pretty sizable increase in our membership, from 31,000 members about two and a half years ago to 36,000 members today. We’ve seen a lot of laid-off energy workers getting into the business, looking for a second career in real estate. That’s why we’re focusing on education to help our Realtors. It’s not an easy job, but it’s really rewarding because every day, we get to help someone have the American Dream.
