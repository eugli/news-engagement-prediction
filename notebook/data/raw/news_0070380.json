This has meddled in our affairs,\" he told reporters after opening the Kelantan Barisan Nasional (BN) Convention in Kota Baru today. \nMustapa said as an ambassador, Kang Chol should not have thrown various allegations at Malaysia and that such an act was an insult to the people of this country. \n\"We have credible institutions, these people are the professionals,\" he said. \nIn Port Dickson, Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the matter involving Malaysia and North Korea should be solved diplomatically . \n\"The statement by the North Korean ambassador was indeed rude, maybe (he) had to, fearing the (possible) reaction by the North Korean leadership. That's why the sentences (words) that they used were not diplomatic enough,\" he said after the passing out parade of the Malaysian Army recruits Series 181-2/16 in Port Dickson today. \nDiplomatic relations between Malaysia and North Korea had been strained since the beginning of the investigation on Jong-nam's death. \nPreviously, Kang Chol was reported as saying Malaysia was trying to hide something and was in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies in the murder case. \nThe Malaysian government rubbished the baseless allegation by the ambassador. \nOn Feb 13, Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was at the KL International Airport 2 (KLIA2) at 8am to catch a flight to Macau when he was attacked by two women who suddenly appeared before him and wiped his face with their hands which contained poisonous liquid. \nJong-nam, who carried a passport bearing the name Kim Chol, died on the way to Putrajaya Hospital. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:03:27.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
