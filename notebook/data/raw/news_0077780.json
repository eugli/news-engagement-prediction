As someone who bridges the gap between rapping and singing on almost every song, \"Lonely\" finds Nav leaning closer to his R&B side. The drug-fuelled tales of the Toronto nightlife should make his close collaborator The Weeknd proud, as should the sticky melody on the hook. Nav even pays homage to his XO kin by interpolating a line from \"The Hills\" on the chorus (yep, the one about drugs).Though the project mostly gives us a look at what Nav is capable of on his own, there are contributions from both Metro Boomin and The Weeknd on two respective tracks.
