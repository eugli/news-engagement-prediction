She has shown interest in venturing into film production soon while simultaneously balancing her acting gigs and has been reading scripts, discussing films with her close director friends as well. If there’s anyone who’ll launch her sister in a big Bollywood production, it’ll be Katrina herself,” revealed the source, adding that the actress has always taken keen interest in understanding the nitty-gritty of the filmmaking process and will soon plan a venture under her own banner,” said the source to a daily.\nWhen Kats was approached for a comment on this, she reportedly said, “Nothing really has crystallised yet.
