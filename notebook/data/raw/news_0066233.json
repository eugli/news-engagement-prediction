Singh was later repatriated to his parent cadre and is at present posted as the additional commissioner (Customs and Excise Department) in Northeast. \nAll four were arrested in Delhi and produced before a designated court which granted them a transit remand till February 23 so that they can be produced before the CBI court in Ahmedabad. \nThe CBI had earlier said in its FIR that “it has been alleged that certain officers of Enforcement Directorate while investigating the cases of money laundering in betting and other such activities have allegedly demanded and accepted huge illegal gratification from the accused and suspect persons in the cases.” \nThe ED’s Ahmedabad unit was probing the Rs 2,000-crore IPL betting scandal, and the Rs 5,000-crore money laundering case against alleged hawala operator Afroz Fatta, in which the suspects allegedly sought favours, official sources said. \nCBI claimed that huge bribe amount was allegedly taken by these officers as quid pro quo for various acts of omission and commission. \nThe case against Singh and others has been registered under the provisions of criminal conspiracy under Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act. \nSources said the ED director had received multiple complaints from various quarters about the alleged demand for bribe by the senior officials of its Ahmedabad unit. The complaints were forwarded to the CBI. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:03.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
