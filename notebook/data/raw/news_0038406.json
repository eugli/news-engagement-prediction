Is Cuban implying that he wants to be the 46th president? We can only recklessly speculate that yes, that is exactly what he is probably insinuating. \nIf Cuban were to earn a seat in the White House, which would have sounded ridiculous a couple years ago but now sounds like even money in Vegas, I'd hope his cabinet would be as fun as I imagine it'd be. \nTyson Chandler would be the obvious choice for Secretary of Defense, while Dirk Nowitzki, with his German ties, would be a great candidate for Secretary of State. Rick Carlisle is smart and capable enough to fill any cabinet position. And of course, J.J. Barea would sneak his way in there, someway, somehow.
