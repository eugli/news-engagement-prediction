Are you prone to anxiety? Do you live with the minimum possible time in bed so you can squeeze more into each day? SLEEP ROUTINE Do you have an erratic and irregular sleep schedule? Do you and your partner have different sleep habits? Do you try to catch up on lost sleep by napping or sleeping in? Do you and your bed partner have different preferences for bedtime? CIRCUMSTANCES Do you have a history of shift work? Do you have young children in the house? Do you have a chronic illness (psychological or physical)? Do you have a stressful job? Are you perimenopausal or menopausal? The more ticks you give, the greater your risk of developing insomnia. You should be thinking about minimising your chances. Before long, as the initial trigger fades into the background, the insomnia itself takes centre stage. It is often fuelled by increasingly complex behaviours you might have adopted in your attempts to snatch more sleep when you can and in your worries about the long-term consequences of perpetual fatigue. That’s why CBT-I (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia) is such a powerful tool for people with long-term sleep problems. ARE YOU GETTING MORE SLEEP THEN YOU THINK? HOW A SPECIALISED THERAPY CAN HELP My sleep plan is based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, which has been specially adapted for insomnia. CBT-I is a trusted method that has been helping people for more than 30 years — and the benefits are long-term. The cognitive element refers to clever ways to help people understand, identify and manage the anxieties they have about sleep. The behavioural side looks at identifying and changing the habits and behaviours that you might not even realise you use to cope with your insomnia, but which could be making things so much worse. You have taken the first step by beginning your sleep diary. Now it’s time to work on behavioural changes. It's essential to establish a strict bedtime and wake-up time to combat insomnia Before you do anything else, the single most important action to start to take control of your insomnia is to establish a strict bedtime and wake-up time. And you must stick to those religiously, on weekdays and weekends, lazy days and holidays. So many poor sleepers worry about ‘sleep debt’ and desperately try to make up their deficit by heading to bed super-early or cancelling their weekend plans so they can have lazy days with long lie-ins. Sound tempting? No! This — along with daytime napping — is the worst possible thing you could do. Poor sleepers often struggle to lose weight because they lose muscle before fat, while good sleepers have stronger willpower when dieting Napping might be a lovely luxury for healthy sleepers, but if you have insomnia, this is one behavioural issue you must change. If you feel you absolutely have to nap, this could be a sign that something else is wrong. My plan may not be right for you and you should visit your GP to investigate. Stretching the time you spend in bed can swiftly change your body’s natural rhythms and turn you into a ‘sleep surfer’, where you can doze for hours, drifting in and out of light, unrefreshing sleep. Such sleep is very vulnerable to being broken by an anxious thought, a hot flush, a noisy neighbour. And because you are effectively diluting your sleep need, you may feel tired, but you’ll still find it very difficult to fall back to sleep. So, set a firm bedtime and wake-up time and stick to them — no matter what. Put an immediate ban on napping to help consolidate your body’s sleep and wake rhythm. As long as you don’t go to bed too early, you should start to enjoy deeper, more refreshing sleep. DON'T EXAGGERATE SLEEP STRUGGLES Many experts apply the 30/30 rule when diagnosing insomnia — if it takes you more than 30 minutes to get to sleep, or if you are unnecessarily awake for more than 30 minutes during the night, then you probably have some form of it. But by the time patients come to me, most of them report their problem to be much, much worse. You may believe it takes you hours to fall asleep at night, that you wake up numerous times and spend long hours awake. But actually, sleep studies have frequently shown that poor sleepers often unconsciously exaggerate the amount of time they spend awake. It is a perfectly natural thing to do. Time flies when you are busy, but it trickles by very, very slowly when you are desperately trying to fall back to sleep. The real problem is the stress this causes — a feeling that inevitably intensifies the insomnia. When you wire up people in a sleep laboratory and observe their nightly patterns, very often you find their sleep problem is not as serious as they’d initially thought. The Herbal remedies that really do work Through proper scientific studies are few and far between, some supplements and herbs have been shown to have a relaxation effect, which means they could help ease anxiety levels and aid sleep. According to Dr Richard Middleton, chairman of the British Herbal Medicine Association, there are a number of herbs that can relieve insomnia caused by anxiety, with evidence for this coming from small scientific and clinical studies. ‘Herbs seem to work on the central nervous system by influencing the various neuro- transmitters that affect stress and anxiety,’ he says. ‘They seem to have a more gentle action than prescribed medicines.’ He warns that herbal remedies may not work as quickly as conventional medicines and that they should be taken regularly for a few weeks to obtain maximum benefit, adding: ‘They should not be taken at the same time as other conventional prescribed or over-the-counter medicines and excessive use of alcohol should be avoided.’ VALERIAN A herb thought to help reduce anxiety and restlessness. One study found it to be as effective as a prescribed sleeping drug for increasing sleep quality, duration of sleep and for waking feeling refreshed, with no effect on daytime alertness or concentration the next day. Dr Middleton says: ‘This herb has been used for centuries as an aid to sleep and it can also act as a calming agent in stressful daytime situations. ‘Research shows that it can help many people to fall asleep more quickly and it also improves the quality of their sleep.’ Try it as a tincture with A. Vogel Dormesan tincture (£4.15, avogel.co.uk); a tea with Health & Heather Organic relaxing night time tea (£2.99, Holland & Barrett); or for a supplement, try Kalms Night (£4.89 for 50 tablets, supermarkets and pharmacies). PASSION FLOWER Passion Flower is used to relieve anxiety This herb is used to relieve anxiety and is often used in combination with valerian to reduce anxiety induced insomnia. Try it in tablet form in Bonuit, which contains valerian and passion flower extract (£8.50 for 30 tablets, Holland & Barrett). MAGNESIUM A mineral that’s necessary for muscle and nerve function. It can help relax muscles and calm the nervous system. Low levels have been associated with sleep disturbance. Some studies have also shown magnesium supplements improve not only the length of time we sleep for, but also decrease the time it takes to fall asleep. Magnesium can reduce the severity of restless leg syndrome. Try Healthspan magnesium (£8.45 for 90 tablets, healthspan.co.uk) or Pharma-Nord Bio- Magnesium (£6.96, health food stores). CHAMOMILE Chamomile is a natural tranquilliser This herb is widely regarded as a mild tranquilliser and sleep-inducer. Its sedative effects may be due to the flavonoid (plant ingredient) called apigenin that binds to receptors in the brain to reduce brain activity and produce an overall calming effect. You can opt for a hot cup of chamomile tea before bed or take it in supplement form. Try Heath & Heather chamomile teabags (£1.65 for 20 teabags, Holland & Barrett) or East Meets West sleep formula capsules, which combine chamomile with a form of asparagus called Shatavari (£17.99 for 60 tablets, Holland & Barrett). 5-HTP This amino acid (hydroxytretophan) is involved in the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Studies have shown it could help improve sleep quality in people who wake frequently at night. Try Healthspan Night Time 5-HTP, which combines 5-HTP with magnesium and vitamins B3, 6 and 12, which aid absorption (£15.95 for 60 tablets, healthspan.co.uk); and Solgar 5-HTP (£11.99 for 30 tablets, from health food stores and local pharmacies). CHERRY EXTRACT Montmorency cherry juice has been shown to help boost melatonin production. Recent studies have found a naturally occurring anti- oxidant called phenolic acid, when concentrated into cherry juice, has considerable blood pressure lowering qualities. Even simply eating more cherries can help. Try Performance Cherry, which comes in a sachet you mix with water (£44.95 for 30 sachets, healthspan.co.uk); or CherryActive, which can be mixed with water or added to smoothies (£8.99 for 210ml bottle, Holland & Barrett). ASHWAGANDHA This herb is often used in traditional Indian medicine as an adaptogen, which means it helps us cope with the effects of stress. Buy it in tablet form in Pukka’s organic Night Time capsules, which combine ashwagandha with the herb gotu kola (which can help restless leg syndrome) and valerian (£7.45 for 30, health food stores). By Louise Atkinson for The Daily Mail Your sleep diary is the key to revealing the true extent of your problem and, with luck, you may find things are not as bad as you’d feared. It is vital to be positive and optimistic in a quest to ease your stress levels and calm the intensity of your insomnia. Try the following simple tests to screen for what specialists call ‘sleep distortion’. They should help you gauge whether you are overestimating the time it takes you to fall asleep, the number of times you wake in the night or how early you wake up in the morning. Even if you suffer from all three of the following problems, pick one at a time and test it for a week (recording the results in your sleep diary). This exercise could help turn down the volume on your sleep problem. It also provides a true starting point, which allows you to measure progress accurately as you work through the course. If it takes you hours to fall asleep... You may believe your biggest problem is falling asleep and worry that you take too long to drop off. To see if this is actually true, try the following exercise. First, estimate how long it normally takes you to fall asleep — for now, let’s say 97 minutes. Try finding out how long it takes you to fall asleep, and if you wake up during the night Then, set an alarm on your phone — just a soft ping loud enough for you to notice if you are awake, but not enough to wake you — for 97 minutes after the time you get into bed. When you get up in the morning, make a note in your sleep diary of whether or not you heard the ping and you’ll know whether or not you were actually awake. If you wake dozens of times in the night... Make a good estimate of how many times you wake up — let’s say six times. One night, keep a pen and paper by your bed and every time you wake up, put a dash on the paper. When you get up in the morning, look at your notes to see how many dashes you scribbled down. Record this in your diary each day to track your progress. If you wake up hours before your alarm... You may think you wake up far earlier than you need most mornings. To find out how frequently this actually happens, try estimating the length of time you typically wake before you need to be up. Let’s say 38 minutes. Then set a quiet alarm on your phone for 38 minutes before you are due to wake up and, in the morning, record in your diary whether or not you heard it go off. WHY YOU COULD BE WORRIED FOR NOTHING Though a newborn baby can snooze for 14 to 17 hours a day, our need for sleep tapers off as we get older. In our teens — when we can seemingly sleep all day if we want to — we need eight to ten hours a night. But in adulthood, we can usually function quite happily on seven hours. However, from the age of 65 our sleep need drops again. So, at this stage of life, even though we might complain that sleep quality is dipping and worry that we need more hours in bed to compensate, the truth is we don’t. I used to wake up ten times a night. Now I've got my life back Verity Cheshire no longer has to dread insomnia after falling asleep Verity Cheshire, 54, is a phlebotomist. She is divorced with three grown-up children and lives in Crewe. Once I started going through the menopause, my sleep became incredibly poor. I had no problem falling asleep — indeed, sometimes I was so tired I went to bed straight after I’d eaten dinner at 6.30pm — but terrible hot flushes would wake me up to ten times a night. I’d be covered in sweat and feeling terribly anxious. The nightmares that accompanied them were awful and I’d feel as if I was on fire. After a couple of months I was exhausted and had chest pain. At one point I ended up in A&E after falling ill at work. I was told I was suffering from anxiety, but I knew it was the stress of being awake in the night. It’s horrible to be awake when everyone else is asleep, knowing that you have to be up for work in a couple of hours. Professor Ellis gave me several suggestions on how to beat my insomnia. I started with keeping a sleep diary. I also tried ear plugs — the first night I wore them I slept for six-and-a-half hours straight through. I still woke at 4.30am, but it was a vast improvement. Professor Ellis said that if I found myself lying there, worrying about not sleeping, I should get up and do something, such as watch television, for half an hour. It seemed counter-intuitive to get up and stimulate my mind with TV — especially as he suggested turning off screens before going to bed. But as I didn’t use television as part of my going-to-sleep routine (rather as a distraction to make myself more tired), it was allowed. And it worked. After half-an-hour of mindless TV, I began to feel tired again. I went back to bed and was asleep within 20 minutes. Another tactic I use is to clear my mind of worries by playing word games. In one, I think of places in the UK and the final letter of one name has to be the first letter of the next — so Newcastle, Epping, Gloucester, etc. I find that it works. The distraction stops me worrying about how little sleep I’m going to have and I gradually drift off. Professor Ellis also gave me a great tip for calming the hot flushes that are unbearable in the night. Instead of flapping the covers off my body to cool down, I stick my feet out of the bottom of the bed, which cools me down just as quickly, but is less disruptive. Now I am getting at least three more hours of sleep every night. I can’t believe the vast improvement and I no longer dread going to sleep. It’s such a relief to have finally found a solution. Adapted by Jill Foster for the Daily Mail Usually six hours of sleep each night is fine. Problems tend to occur only if you dip below five hours on a regular basis. If you find yourself worrying about not getting enough sleep, use this simple test to work out your true sleep need — you may be surprised to find that your body doesn’t need the conventional eight hours you thought it did. Next time you have a free week, make a point of going to bed and getting up at whatever time you want. Minimise all possible interruptions. If your partner snores, wear ear plugs. If you have a pet, make sure they are not in the room. Record how much sleep you get each night. Ignore the results of the first four nights because you will be acclimatising to this new routine and getting rid of any sleep debt or social jet-lag. But the timings of the last three nights, when your body has slipped into its preferred rhythm, are crucial for this experiment. At the end of the week, take an average score of the last three nights (add up the total amount of sleep you got across those nights and divide by three). This result will show you exactly how much sleep your body needs at this time of your life. YOU'RE MORE AT RISK IN MIDDLE AGE Middle age is a common time for chronic insomnia to creep in. If you are aged 50 or over, you may have found yourself ticking quite a few boxes in the previous quiz — much of which is unavoidable. By your 50s and 60s, you are at greater risk of developing some sort of chronic illness that could affect your sleep (such as prostate problems in men, plus bladder problems and various arthritic or painful conditions). Because of this you are more likely to be taking medication that could be interfering with your body’s natural rhythms. Menopause is a factor for women. More generally, the delicate signalling mechanism that triggers falling asleep and waking up (our circadian rhythm) starts to deteriorate with age. With this acting less efficiently, we produce less of the sleep hormone melatonin and can end up with broken sleep during the night. Studies show that older adults tend to spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep, making them more vulnerable to frequent waking. You can add into the mix the unhelpful behavioural habits retirement can instigate: the temptation to go to bed sooner, wake earlier in the morning and the susceptibility to snooze or snatch a nap during the day. Though a good night’s sleep in your youth might have been eight hours of concentrated deep slumber, you could now find yourself ‘sleep surfing’ — spending longer hours in bed but only lightly snoozing. I wouldn’t call this insomnia. It would be more accurately described as a self-imposed adjustment, which doesn’t necessarily make it bad or unhealthy. The only cause for concern might be if this pattern of long and light sleeping becomes conditioned and then turns into chronic insomnia. Either way, you would certainly benefit from some of the advice in this course. Want to snooze? Cut out the booze! Alcohol triggers a dramatic clash of brain patterns when you try to fall asleep Everyone knows you drop off much more smoothly after a few drinks, right? Alcohol is well-known to be a sedative and if heightened stress levels are making you feel a little wired, that evening glass of wine can have huge appeal. In fact, an estimated 45 per cent of people with long-term insomnia drink alcohol to help them sleep. But they could not be more wrong. It actually triggers a dramatic clash of brain patterns. Research has shown that after drinking, the production of adenosine (a sleep-inducing chemical in the brain) is increased and the brain appears to have more delta wave activity (the replenishing of cells and clearing up of fragmented thoughts), which usually happens in deep sleep. But as the night progresses, the alcohol appears to trigger opposing alpha wave activity, which normally occurs only when the brain is awake, but resting. The alpha waves seem to offset the restorative efforts of the delta waves, causing a clash that disturbs your sleep and leaves you feeling exhausted the next day. Researchers noted that clashing brain patterns like this are normally seen only among people with chronic pain conditions. And it takes only a few drinks to aggravate snoring, because alcohol causes your whole body to relax, including the muscles of your throat. This can stop air flowing smoothly — it’s like turning the volume dial to maximum. You are also more likely to be disturbed by needing frequent night-time trips to the loo. Normally your body shuts down messages to and from your bladder at night, putting it into hibernation, but because alcohol acts as a diuretic (it draws fluid from your tissues) you are much more likely to be woken by an urge to go to the loo. And it’s not just the liquid you’ve drunk that you’ll be getting rid of. The diuretic effect means alcohol encourages the body to lose extra fluid though sweat, too, making you dehydrated and thirsty, which could also wake you up. So if you want a quick fix for your sleep problems, try cutting out alcohol for a few days instead and monitor your sleep diary to see if it helps. If that seems too onerous, at the very least you should avoid drinking just before bedtime. It takes the body roughly one hour to metabolise each unit of alcohol, so a glass of wine in the early evening should give your body enough time to process the alcohol before trying to sleep. Allow one hour per unit — that’s around two hours for a standard glass of wine. YOUR SLEEP DIARY'S KEY TO SUCCESS Whether you only occasionally find yourself awake in the middle of the night or are at the end of your tether after years of broken sleep, a comprehensive sleep diary is the most important tool to fight insomnia. In Saturday’s paper, we gave away a free 32-page sleep diary. A sleep diary is so integral to success that, when I am doing therapy (in practice or in research), I will start each session by asking to see the patient’s sleep diary. If there isn’t a diary, there is no therapy that day. The diary is divided into two halves — a morning section you should fill in when you have brushed the sleep from your eyes (around 30 minutes after waking) and an evening session to fill in a few hours before you go to bed. Keep it by your bed with a pen to hand (and your reading glasses if you need them) and make filling in your diary part of your morning and evening ritual — like brushing your teeth. Don’t try to fill the morning section the moment you wake up as you may be dazed and sluggish and likely to be less accurate about your diary recordings. It may seem time-consuming and even a little irritating at first, but I can’t emphasise enough how invaluable it will be. This diary is the key to truly personalising your sleep plan. It is important to be able to gather data that is averaged over a whole week if possible, so that we can account for variability from night to night. Remember that even people with insomnia have the odd good night’s sleep, as well as an abnormally good or bad sleep period (which we all have from time to time). The results you will have gathered in just a few days can help you identify any patterns in your sleep that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. It pulls away the veils of confusion and within just a few days you’ll start to see a much clearer picture of how your insomnia is manifesting. Importantly, over time it will become an excellent marker of your progress. Here’s how to use it . . . While it might seem irritating at first a sleep plan will be essential for curing your insomnia WHAT TO DO IN THE MORNING I went to bed at : Very often when sleep problems have been going on for quite some time, exhaustion drives people to slope off to bed earlier and earlier in the evening. While this logically seems a great way to catch up on lost sleep, and a useful antidote to falling off to sleep on the sofa in front of the TV, it is not always a good idea. One of the paradoxes of chronic insomnia is the longer you spend in bed — whether you are awake or asleep — the lighter and more fitful your sleep is likely to be. An important part of my plan is working to consolidate your sleep to intensify the depth and quality. With this in mind, it is important to write down the time you went to bed to be able to make a note of the amount of time you spend in bed each night. How long it took me to fall asleep: It’s common for someone with chronic insomnia to say that no matter how exhausted they are, they struggle to fall asleep at night. One of the best-known measures of insomnia is when it takes more than 30 minutes from going to bed to falling asleep. I woke up at: Another common sign of insomnia is waking up in the early hours of the morning and being unable to fall asleep again. So, record the time you accepted your night’s sleep was over. I got out of bed at : This is the time you need to get out of bed to get everything done in time to start your day. In the future this will be the time you set your alarm. Number of times I woke during the night: This is another common sign of insomnia and recording it becomes a useful gauge of how the quality of your sleep is improving during the course. The aim is to minimise the disruption of nocturnal awakenings. If you forget to fill in your diary within one hour of waking up, skip your entry for that day - a hazy memory may affect the accuracy Number of minutes I was awake for : I encourage everyone who does my sleep course to remove alarm clocks from the bedroom and to turn their phone face down on the bedside table so they are not tormented by numbers ticking away as they lie awake, serving only to remind them of how little sleep they might have had. This makes an accurate assessment of the time spent awake tricky, but make the best estimate you can. Total sleep time: Simply add the number of minutes between falling asleep at night to waking up (for the final time) in the morning. Then subtract the total number of minutes you estimate you were awake during the night. This figure is important to keep track of. After a few days you should see a pattern starting to emerge. Sleep efficiency: This is a percentage score that quantifies how much of the time you are in bed is spent actually sleeping. You may need a calculator to help figure it out. Take the score from your total sleep time (in minutes) and divide it by the number of minutes you spent in bed (count up from the moment you got into bed and turned out the light to the point where you threw back the covers and got up). One of the paradoxes of insomnia is the longer you spend in bed the lighter your sleep will be Then multiply this number by 100 to get your percentage score. If you sleep badly with frequent interruptions, you may find your sleep efficiency hovers at around 60 per cent. If you follow the recommendations in my plan, by this time next week you should be able to see your sleep efficiency score creep up to a more healthy 85 per cent — or even higher. How well I slept: This is your at-a-glance guide to the sort of night you think you’ve had. How well I feel: This allows you to monitor your tiredness on waking. Your dreams: The two boxes in the morning section are for you to ‘download’ your dreams. If you wake up with a vivid dream still in your head, jot it down in your diary. Then — this is crucial — think how you would like to change the outcome to make it positive, happy or upbeat. The how I’d change my dream section in the diary is there for you to ‘re-frame’ your dream to help alleviate its negative impact. So, if you dreamt you were being chased by a monster, give it big clown shoes; if you felt water levels rising around you, put yourself in a boat. For more insight into your dreams, see Friday’s paper. WHAT TO DO IN THE AFTERNOON This is where you can monitor the daytime habits that may or may not be interfering with your sleep. Did I nap today? Write down whether you had a daytime sleep, what time it was and how long it lasted. I don’t recommend napping for more than 30 minutes and certainly not after 4pm. Last time I exercised: Regular daily exercise is a great way to improve the quality of your sleep, and it forms part of my good sleep behaviour prescription. Numerous studies have shown regular exercise is associated with longer and deeper sleep. Moderate-intensity exercise in the afternoon or early evening is associated with getting off to sleep quicker and increased overall amounts of sleep for people with insomnia. But don’t leave your exercise session too late in the day. If you work out in the two hours before you go to bed, the hike in metabolism could make it more difficult for you to fall asleep. Last time I had a caffeinated drink: Aim for no coffee after lunch and cut back on tea after noon. Caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals before bed are sure to interfere with healthy sleeping Last time I ate: Avoid eating a heavy meal within two hours of bedtime. Eating too late forces your body to achieve two opposing biological processes, digestion and sleep, at the same time. It is equally important not to go to bed hungry (which can wake you up), so a night-time snack is fine. Units of alcohol: Alcohol is a sedative, which sounds appealing if you are having difficulties getting off to sleep, but the effects wear off quite quickly, and typically leads to light, unrefreshing sleep in the second half of the night. As alcohol is a diuretic, you are more likely to be dehydrated which increases sleep fragmentation. So, avoid alcohol close to bedtime and don’t use it as a sleep aid. How tired I feel: This gives you a quick measure of whether you drifted through the day in an exhausted daze or you felt reasonably fresh and perky. As you go through your diary, this will provide a picture of your sleep quality and its capacity to rejuvenate you. Tomorrow’s important tasks: If you are likely to wake up in the night worrying about everything you have to do the next day, this is your chance to jot down your to-do list, getting it out of your head so you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything. What have I done to prepare for tomorrow: Tackle any impending anxiety about your plans for the next day by jotting down the steps you might have taken to prepare for them. Notes such as ‘my smart suit is dry cleaned and ready’ can help ease anxious thoughts about the following day.
