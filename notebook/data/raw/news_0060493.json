A chart from the 'Fashion Spot' Source: The Fashion Spot \nA surprising addition to this list of most diverse shows i s Marc Jacobs, who, after being criticized for putting a mostly white cast in dreadlock wigs in September, had 66% models of color in his show. \nAlso for the first time ever: Six out of the 10 most-booked models this season were models of color, including Dilone, with 13 shows, and Dominican model Ysaunny Brito, with 12. \nHowever, there is a large caveat: This actually wasn't the most racially diverse NYFW. \nAccording to the report, 31.5% of models cast were models of color. That's an uptick from September , but still doesn't trump Fall 2016, which had 31.9% models of colors cast in shows. A chart from the 'Fashion Spot' \nBeyond racial diversity, plus-size models had their biggest year on record, with 26 plus-size model appearances. Compare that to September's 16 and the four from February 2016.

The 26 plus-size model appearances , for example, all appeared in just nine shows. So while the numbers look good, there's still work to do. \n\"This is our sixth season tracking runway diversity at New York Fashion Week and we continue to see progress year over year,\" Jennifer Davidson said in a release. \"Racial diversity had its second-best season, while plus-size models were more visible than ever for Fall 2017. Despite the improvements, it still comes down to a small handful of designers that make true diversity and inclusion a priority each year.\" Like us on Facebook: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:14:32.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
