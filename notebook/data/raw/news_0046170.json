Although local police suspect that an organization was behind the crime (as opposed to a single person), they had not officially stated whether this is the case or whether they consider it to be a hate crime. \nWhat almost certainly counts as hate crimes, though, were the bomb threats phoned into Jewish Community Centers on Monday . These included threats in Albuquerque, New Mexico; New York; Birmingham, Alabama; Buffalo and Amherst, New York; Chicago; Cleveland; Houston; Nashville, Tennessee; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tampa, Florida; and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. \nThe bomb threats occurred one day after Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, called on President Donald Trump to publicly denounce the new wave of anti-Semitism. \n“I think that the president helps set the tone for a country,” Hoenlein said from Jerusalem. “I’m hopeful that what he said about . . . addressing hate and racism of all kinds in American society will be translated into clear action.” \nIvanka Trump, daughter of President Trump and a practicing Jew herself, took to Twitter to denounce the attacks. America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nIt has not been established whether the wave of anti-Semitic incidents are the work of a larger organization, a small group of people, or even a single individual. Similarly, it is unclear whether there is any correlation between Trump’s recent election and the series of incidents.
