On Saturday, the American-led command announced that it had struck a “staging area” for launching drones and a cache of the weapons. Qayyarah West, which was once known as Saddam Airbase and is called Q-West by American soldiers, is a pivotal base for the Mosul offensive. Runways at the air base, captured from the Islamic State in July, have been repaired by American combat engineers, which makes it an important logistics hub and a useful platform for projecting power. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story First Lt. Mary Floyd, a 24-year-old officer who was raised in South Carolina, has been focused on doing exactly that. The commander of a platoon that fires Himars rockets, she helped flatten a five-story building the American military says Islamic State militants were using as a command post shortly before the Iraqis began their offensive to take western Mosul. Over the past week, she said, her platoon launched rockets toward Mosul 10 to 20 times. Military officers have a name for the two platoons of that fire Himars that are deployed at the base: Task Force Thor. Firing rockets into a densely populated city is a tricky proposition. But the rockets’ satellite guidance, perpendicular angle of attack and the fact that they can accommodate a relatively small warhead has led the military to turn to it during previous urban fights, including the 2006 battle for Ramadi and the 2007 struggle for the control of Haifa Street in Baghdad. The United States is not the only nation supporting the Iraqis by firing artillery. French artillery has been active as well. Hamam al-Alil was taken by Iraqi forces in November, and a mass grave of ISIS victims was later uncovered near an agricultural college there. Now, United States Army crews live and even sleep inside their Paladin artillery units, waiting for orders to fire. Captain Ross declined to say precisely how many rounds his soldiers had fired. But he said they are ready to shoot day and night and “can range the entire city.” A version of this article appears in print on February 27, 2017, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Forces Play Crucial Role Against ISIS in Mosul.
