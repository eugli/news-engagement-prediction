The link was strongest in women who had the APOE4 gene, a genetic variation that increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease . If these results hold true in the general population, the study authors say, air pollution could be responsible for about 21% of dementia cases.\n“When we breathe in these tiny particles, it can trigger inflammation throughout the body,” says Richard Isaacson, MD, director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center (who was not involved in the study). “And for certain people, inflammation seems to be a way of pressing the fast-forward button on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”\nPoor sleep\nYou know that missing out on a good night’s sleep can lead to brain fog the next day, but research also suggests that disturbed sleep over time may be linked to a buildup of Alzheimer's-related brain proteins.\nScientists believe that exercise loosens up amyloid proteins in the brain that have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, but that good quality sleep is required to actually dispose of them, says Dr. Isaacson. “Sleep is absolutely essential for taking out the garbage and keeping your brain healthy over time,” he says.\nClick to expand Replay Video Sweet Baby Disapproves of Dad's Singing We're not sure if this baby is unhappy about his dad's singing or because he's reached his first birthday, but it's clear that this is one disgruntled baby!

A 2016 study published in Annals of Neurology found that volunteers who had more trouble identifying scents like menthol, clove, strawberry, and lemon seemed to be at an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.\n“When someone can’t distinguish between different smells, it may absolutely be a signal that Alzheimer’s disease is brewing,” says Dr. Isaacson. (It can also be a sign of Parkinson’s disease and other neurological problems, he adds.) Experts say a scratch-and-sniff test could be an inexpensive, noninvasive way to pinpoint people who might benefit from early treatment or prevention strategies.\nYour eating pattern\nWhen Dr. Isaacson’s patients ask what they can do to reduce their risk of dementia, he recommends eating an early dinner —and then nothing until breakfast the next morning. “Fasting for a minimum of 12 hours, as well as eating fewer calories overall, may be a way to promote brain health as we age,” he says.\nRestricting your eating overnight can trigger the body to burn ketone bodies —a type of brain-healthy fat—rather than carbohydrates, he explains. “It helps you fuel the brain with something that’s not only more efficient from an energy-burning standpoint, but that may have an anti-aging effect as well.”\nRELATED: 25 Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease\n6 Brain Foods That May Prevent Alzheimer's Disease Concussions\nFor people with a family history of Alzheimer’s, a blow to the head might accelerate the cognitive and brain changes associated with the disease. In a recent study in the journal Brain, young to middle-aged adults who’d had at least one concussion and had genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s had less gray matter in parts of the brain associated with dementia, compared to other study participants.\nThose same participants also performed worse on a simple recall test, suggesting that these brain changes could have real consequences on memory functioning. Researchers hope they may be able to use these findings to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s disease at an earlier age.\nLoneliness\nResearch shows that older adults who report feeling socially isolated may be at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease. In a 2016 study from JAMA Psychiatry , senior citizens whose brain scans showed the development of amyloid protein clusters were 7.5 times more likely to be classified as lonely than those whose scans were negative.\nExperts aren’t sure which comes first—if dementia symptoms cause people to feel left out or withdraw from social activities, or if feeling lonely actually promotes the development of dementia—but they suspect the relationship may go both ways.\nRELATED: 7 Ways to Protect Your Memory\nHigh blood pressure\nYou know that high blood pressure is bad for your body and your brain, so the results of a recent study published in Alzheimer's & Dementia may catch you off-guard: When hypertension develops in old age, it appears to actually reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease . “As we get more frail, having a reserve of blood pressure may actually be protective,” Dr. Isaacson explains.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t worry about high blood pressure earlier in life, though. The research is clear that for young and middle-aged adults , untreated hypertension appears to increase the risk of developing dementia later in life. \"Knowing your numbers when it comes to blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index—and talking with your doctor about how you can optimize those numbers—is still one of the most important things you can do,\" says Dr. Isaacson.\nClick to expand Replay Video Sweet Baby Disapproves of Dad's Singing We're not sure if this baby is unhappy about his dad's singing or because he's reached his first birthday, but it's clear that this is one disgruntled baby!
