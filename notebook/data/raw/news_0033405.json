Our athletic director asked who was making the racist comments so he could have them removed, but the Globe fans were unable to point out who it was. As tensions continued to rise, our athletic director made the decision to call the police before things got out of hand,\" Roberts said.\n\"As it turns out, those fans were Native American, but they were singled out for their behavior, not for their race,\" Roberts said.\nMaricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies \"were called to the school for a disturbance during a basketball game that appeared to get a little overcompetitive, especially from a crowd standpoint,\" MCSO spokesman Sgt. Calbert Gillett said in an email.\n\"Sheriff’s deputies did not participate in any sort of activity that segregated anybody,\" he said in the statement.\n\"We were told by school officials that there were some fans from the visiting team sitting on the home team benches that were being disruptive and needed to move over to the visiting team benches. The fans complied with the request and the game continued without incident.\"\nGlobe fans: There's more to the story The academy \"said there were unruly fans — there was nobody unruly. It makes them look good and there was nowhere near that,\" said Fall, who arrived at the academy about 2:30 p.m. to watch all of the day's games since her daughter plays on the JV and varsity teams.\nEarly on, Fall said, she heard people say, \"This isn't jungle ball. Go back to the jungle where you came from,\" about a black athlete, and, \"Go back to the reservation and use your stamps.\"\nThe conflict began later when people arrived just before 7 p.m. to support Globe basketball star Robert \"B.J.\" Burries Jr., who last year set a single-game Division IV state scoring record with 68 points as a freshman .\nAcademy fans harassed Burries' uncle, who arrived wearing a colorful shirt with photos of Burries on it, Fall said. The administrator asked them to move shortly after, about 7 p.m.\nFall said she was not sitting nearby and was unaware of what was happening until an administrator asked her to move. She said she has pieced together what happened by talking to various witnesses.\nPost by chasity.newman.56 . Three of the six families refused to move, in part, because it offended their elders, some of whom have physical disabilities, Fall said.\nThe incident has upset many in the San Carlos Apache Tribe, of which Fall is a member, and has received attention from the tribal council, she said.\n\"Our civil rights, the rights of citizens to political and social freedom and equality, were violated,\" Fall said.\nAcademy executive director Roberts said he has contacted Globe Unified School District Superintendent Jerry Jennex \"and suggested a meeting to discuss future Globe/ALA competitions and what steps we can collectively take to help prevent a future incident.\"\nThe Globe district confirmed in a statement that administrators are working with the academy to investigate the incident, and \"whether any further action will be taken will depend on the results of the investigation.\"\n\"Globe Unified School District takes pride in the diversity of its student body and celebrates the unique aspects that each student contributes. GUSD does not condone discrimination or harassment of any kind,\" district officials said in the statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:04:16.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
