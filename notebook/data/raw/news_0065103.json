(AAP) \nTroubled AFL premiership player Ben Cousins is facing fresh charges related to drugs and family violence in Perth. \nSearch warrants were issued at residences in Melville and Bicton overnight, and Cousins was arrested when he arrived in a car at the Melville home. \nInside the car, police allegedly found some methylamphetamine. \nDuring a second search of the Bicton home, police allegedly found a smoking utensil and more methylamphetamine. \nCousins, 38, has been charged with seven counts of breaching a violence restraining order, aggravated stalking, driving without a licence, and possessing a prohibited drug and smoking utensil. \nThe former West Coast Eagles captain and Brownlow medallist was fined $2600 in December for drug offences and breaching a VRO taken out by his former partner Maylea Tinecheff, with whom he has two young children. \nMagistrate Stephen Wilson warned Cousins at the time that he had to stick with his treatment program and warned a further VRO breach could mean a mandatory prison sentence. \nCousins was last in court in January when a three-hour trial was set for June over a separate meth possession offence. \nHe told reporters outside court at the time that he was doing OK. \nThe drug addict was suspended from the AFL for one year in 2007 for bringing the game into disrepute. \nHe made a comeback with Richmond before retiring in 2010 and his troubles have continued in the public eye.
