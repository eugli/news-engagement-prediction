Vote for them and you may not.\" \nThis time around there are signs the public is more sympathetic to spending on public services, help with extra incomes for the poorest, and extra cash to improve infrastructure - with the Kaikoura earthquakes fresh in mind. \nBefore he quit John Key showed he was alert to the politics on the income side of the equation with his talk of a \"family and tax cut package\" - because tax cuts in themselves could not deliver much to those earning the least. \nStarting soon after he was appointed last year Finance Minister Steven Joyce has been largely playing the same tune. \nIn two key speeches over the past week he has set out his four priorities; better public services, building (more sustainable) infrastructure, reducing the debt burden as a percentage of GDP. and lowering \"the tax burden ...in particular the impact of marginal tax rates on lower and middle income earners\". \nWhen it comes to the tax cut aspect he has been playing from the score composed by his predecessors. \nThe cuts will only come when the Government has the (undefined) room to do so. This year the plan will \"start\" this year or next but there will not be big bikkies in the May 25 Budget. \nAnd he has been making it clear since before Christmas that the focus will be on the thresholds. \nUnder the current regime the tax rates are 10.5 per cent up to $14,000 a year, 17.5 per cent from $14,000 to $48,000, 30 per cent above that until the top 33c rate cuts in at $70,000. \nBut Joyce has repeatedly highlighted the $48,000 threshold, pointing out that the rate makes a big jump at that point, from 17.5 per cent to 30 per cent. \nWhen student loan repayments of 12.5 per cent are added (which are triggered at income of $19,084 - so look for a move there too) the marginal tax rate balloons to 42c in the dollar. \nPoverty researcher Susan St John has pointed out that it can get worse. \nSomeone with children and a student loan, who earns more than $48,000 also faces a loss of 22.5 per cent of their Working for families entitlement, making their effective tax rate as bad as 64.5 per cent. \nEven so, if Joyce is true to his spruiking, wouldn't a move to lift those bottom thresholds meet the promise of helping low and middle income earners. \nWell, yes and no. \nFirst, pushing the $48,000 level up significantly would narrow the gap to the top 33 per cent threshold of $70,000, bringing with it pressures to lift that top threshold too. \nAnd then there is the simple fact that the greatest dollar beneficiaries of a move to the thresholds are the people with earnings above the new threshold. \nSo an increase in the threshold from, say, $48,000 to $60,000 will give all those between those two levels something. \nBut it is those on $60,000 and above who would reap the most; $1500 a year or about $30 a week. \nChanges to other thresholds cascade up in a similar way. \nBut big threshold moves are not cheap. \nLifting the $48,000 threshold to $60,000 would cost a cool $1.5 billion a year out of a pot that Key, before he quit, said should be about $3 billion a year (about $30 a week each) to be meaningful to voters. \nTruth to tell anyone can play the tax-cut shuffle. \nAll you need is Treasury's handy ready reckoner. \nEach $1000 increase in the top threshold (currently $70,000) costs $20m. \nEach $1000 increase in the middle threshold (currently $48,000) costs $125m. \nEach $1000 increase in the bottom threshold (currently $14,000) costs $160m. \nGive yourself a $3 billion pile of coin, and mix and match the options. \nAt least it will be more fun than watching Joyce do the dance of the fiscal veils. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:30:58.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
