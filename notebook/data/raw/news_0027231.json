But the breakthrough came in 2013, when she was studying for a PhD in computer science and started to look into the emerging blockchain technology. \n\"You can think of a blockchain,\" Ms Baker says, \"as a shared data system that everyone can use in order to be able to trust information. What it's allowed us to do is to have a shared system of record that nobody can tamper with and everybody can see.\" \nProvenance uses this technology to log and store every stage of a supply chain in a way that anyone can access. Student project to global ambition Image caption Provenance has staff in four countries around the world \nNow the company, which started as a part-time interest while Ms Baker was studying, has become a full-time business. She has put her PhD on hold, as she's busy running a company with 10 staff based in four countries: the UK, the US, France and Germany. \n\"We have no physical things apart from our laptops,\" Ms Baker points out. \"So we can move the team wherever we want to around the world.\" \nThe company started out working with small brands and, in July 2016, signed its first commercial client, the UK's fifth largest food and grocery retailer, the Co-op. Provenance is now helping the Co-op track fresh products through its supply chains. Image caption Customers can check the supply chain of a product on their phones in a shop using Provenance \n\"We've attracted lots of pioneering food and drinks businesses,\" Ms Baker says. \n\"It's as much about reassuring businesses that they are selling things that are correct and trustworthy as it is about consumers being able to understand that as well.\" Fishy business Image caption Provenance is built to tackle fraudulent claims about the ethical sourcing of products such as fish \nProvenance's first victory for sourcing ethical products came with a humble fish. \nIn early 2016 in Indonesia, Provenance tracked the first fish on the blockchain. \nWorking with a non-governmental organisation to certify a socially sustainable catch of fish, the company in effect created a digital passport for the fish. \nProvenance has now set up partnerships with tagging, DNA scanning and digital imaging companies to strengthen the connections between physical products and their digitised claims. \nAs well as fish, Provenance now tracks other foods, such as eggs and dairy. It says that lots of products, not just food, can be tracked and sourced in this way. Blockchain beginnings Image caption Chris Haley of Nesta says that blockchain technology is still immature \nBut Ms Baker admits that there are still some issues with the scaling up of the technology. \n\"We're on the bleeding edge of a new technology and occasionally having to wait for it to get developed a bit more in order to be able to develop on top of it,\" she says. \nAnother problem is the reputation of blockchains. \n\"The main challenge for Provenance is that it's being built upon a technology that is relatively immature,\" she says. \n\"There are still some risks that are unclear, but we're beginning to see blockchains being used in really quite a wide variety of applications. It is potentially a much simpler way of transacting.\" \nBut Ms Baker has a long-term vision. \n\"We are disruptive and we're trying to disrupt the industry for good.\" she says. \n\"The ultimate goal of Provenance is that one day it will be impossible to buy a product that compromises your health and morals. Businesses that have very opaque supply chains and are not taking active steps to make them transparent should really fear us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:26:04.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
