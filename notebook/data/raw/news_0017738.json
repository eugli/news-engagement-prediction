The stars swept into Leicester Square for the film, the second in the big screen adaptations of E.L. James's bestselling erotic novels. Jamie Dornan looked as if butter wouldn't melt as he posed with his glamorous co-star Dakota Johnson. Despite receiving generally unfavourable reviews, the first instalment became the UK's highest-grossing 18-rated movie. BRIAN VINER takes no prisoners as he gives his verdict on its sequel... The story begins a few weeks after the first film ended, with Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) bruised in more ways than one by Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan, pictured together) Two years ago, the eagerly-awaited screen version of EL James' saucy bestseller Fifty Shades Of Grey was released just in time for Valentine's Day – as if anyone could be hoodwinked into thinking that the story of kinky sex in a defiantly sleepless Seattle had anything to do with love. Now, they've gone and done it again, with a mid-February release for a sequel that far from being 50 shades darker than the original, is even more pale and at times downright limp. It tries to present itself as a sweet romance, with supplementary nipple clamps. But what's the point of making a film about sado-masochism if nobody is prepared to whip it into shape? The story begins a few weeks after the first film ended, with Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) bruised in more ways than one by Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), the world's least charismatic tycoon. She's working in a publishing house now (she just loves Jane Austen, apparently), as assistant to Jack, the lascivious, floppy-haired fiction editor. He is played by Eric Johnson, who I can only assume was cast because he's best-known for playing Flash Gordon. In Christian's world, of course, Flash Gordon might pass as an instruction. Unsurprisingly, the beefy mogul – a muscular Christian indeed – woos Ana back into his bed, but she insists that it must be on her terms. Of course, he's not used to being told what to do. He's so rich that he earns $24,000 every 15 minutes, although we still have no idea how. He's so rich, in fact, that he goes and buys the publishing house Ana works for.
