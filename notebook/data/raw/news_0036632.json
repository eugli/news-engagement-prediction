She told KCRA: 'Well to tell you the truth, I only knew that my husband was a highly decorated war veteran because he had been so private. I didn't know, and still really don't know the extent of the commendations he received. 'I don't know why someone would want to take that away from somebody - take a part of their life away.' Mike Pomeroy (left) and his wife Gaylene (right) shared their devastation at finding that all 23 medals, and a Purple Heart, were stolen from their home Following the robbery, Pomeroy finally shared the hidden part of his life with his family.

'Whoever did it, if there's a way you can return that stuff to my father ... I'm sorry ... it's just not right to do that to a hero,' the couple's son Kevil Pomeroy told Fox 40 . During the evacuation period Yuba City saw a high number of burglaries and theft, with police reporting 10 burglaries in less than 48 hours. A laptop, jewelry, and some cash were also taken from the family, but other high-end items were left. They do not expect to get their things back, but hope whoever took the medals will realize their significance and worth to the person who earned them, and return them. He kept his memories locked inside the black suitcase (pictured) for 50 years before it was found broken open after the evacuation Read more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:29:54.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
