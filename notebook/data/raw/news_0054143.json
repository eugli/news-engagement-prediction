(Getty Images) Marko Pjaca scored his first goal for Juventus and fellow substitute Dani Alves was also on target as they won 2-0 at Porto to take control of their Champions League last-16 tie. Source: Tweet \nFaced with the prospect of playing more than an hour with 10 men after Alex Telles was sent off for two yellow cards in as many minutes, Porto coped well as Juve saw a host of chances go begging. \nThe game appeared set to end a highly frustrating draw for Juve, but Massimiliano Allegri - who dropped centre-back Leonardo Bonucci in the wake of their spat at the end of Friday's win over Palermo - made a pair of inspired changes in bringing on Pjaca and Alves. \n— Enzo G. (@EnzoCalcio) February 22, 2017 \nPjaca finally broke the deadlock in 72nd minute, powering a half-volley into the bottom-left corner to end his wait for a maiden Bianconeri goal. \nAnd just two minutes later Alves put Juve in complete command by converting from Alex Sandro's left-wing delivery to the far post. \nThe hosts never looked like mounting any sort of response and they now have a mountain to climb in the return fixture on March 14. 25': Alex Telles is booked.27': Alex Telles is booked again. \nPorto are down to 10 men against Juventus. pic.twitter.com/V9i7TVcpLf \n— Squawka News (@SquawkaNews) February 22, 2017 \nPorto started brightly and saw Yacine Brahimi go close when he curled a free-kick narrowly over after Giorgio Chiellini was dubiously adjudged to have fouled Andre Silva. \nJuve soon began to dictate play without creating much in front of goal, Paulo Dybala spurning their best chance as he fired over on the stretch from Gonzalo Higuain's flick-on. \nAnd the visitors were handed a huge boost as Telles lost all composure and committed two rash fouls in the space of as many minutes.
