Credit Ian Douglas for The New York Times I do not often blush when sitting in the darkness of an opera house. But when Massenet’s “Werther” opened at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening and the tenor Vittorio Grigolo declared his love for the young, respectable Charlotte, artfully weaving and fervently flinging vocal lines at and around her, I’m not embarrassed to admit I found myself getting flushed. “My entire soul is in these lines,” Werther cries during one of his many fits of passion. When Mr. Grigolo sings the role, you believe it. Both brazen and intimate, his muscular voice crinkling with emotion, he may be the most galvanically convincing singer in the world today. Mr. Grigolo, who sings “Werther” four times, through March 4, does blood and guts, but stylishly. He understands that opera is a careful calibration of explosion and control, and he manipulates that balance to leave you — as you’re left when watching all the best operatic performances — in a state of both satisfied delight and sustained, agonizing tension. As Werther, a sensitive poet who falls for the sweet, responsible Charlotte (Isabel Leonard) even though she has promised to marry another, Mr. Grigolo restlessly stalks the picturesquely askew sets of Richard Eyre’s production. On Thursday both his movements and his arias seemed like sudden, spontaneous decisions, eruptions out of repression. Early on, some soft, hovering phrases felt faked and toneless: The role ideally calls for more evenness and refinement than Mr. Grigolo can summon in the crucial transitional space — called, in French, the “voix mixte,” or mixed voice — between a singer’s high, airy “head voice” and his fuller, brawnier “chest voice.” But if Mr. Grigolo moves through the different parts of his instrument more like a bulldozer than a cat, he is always earnest and involving, his heart on his sleeve and his energy unflagging. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He was matched, effusion for effusion, in the orchestra pit. Massenet’s lush scores can easily wilt, but on Thursday, Edward Gardner led a performance that was sumptuous without ever slogging — not grandly imposing but straightforward and sincere. Lyrical expansion never stinted on forward-moving vigor, right up to the slashing grimaces in the low strings at the very end. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
