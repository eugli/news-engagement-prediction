Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United 's Marouane Fellaini has reinvented himself in the eyes of their fans this season. \nMidfielder Fellaini was criticised after conceding a late penalty at Everton and was even booed by United fans at Old Trafford. But within the space of a few weeks, Fellaini has got the supporters back onside after proving himself an invaluable part of the Jose Mourinho ’s squad. \nNow, the Belgian has revealed his connection with Mourinho was first formed when the Special One called him immediately after taking charge last summer. \nFellaini said: “I’ve always had good relationships with managers. But with Jose I have a great relationship. I respect him, he gives me confidence.

When a manager calls you and says you are part of his plans and that he trusts you, then you will give everything for him.” \nIt is that sort of belief that helped Fellaini earlier in the season, and he is honest enough to hold up his hands to his mistake for bringing down Everton’s Idrissa Gueye as United dropped two points. \nMourinho made a point of bringing Fellaini on in their next Premier League game against Tottenham to show his support while the fans jeered. Our John Cross (left) spoke to Fellaini about his Man United career \nThe manager promised he “would always have his protection.” \nAnd the Belgian has also become Mourinho’s “go-to man” when he needs to send somebody on to try to win a game or see one out. \n“That’s football. Ok, I made a mistake,” said Fellaini. “I’m the first to know that I did. It was a mistake. That’s it, done, next game. \n“There was a problem with the fans booing me after the Everton game, but after that it was done. When I make a mistake I know it, when I do well I know it, when I do bad I know it. \n“I am honest and I don’t need people to tell me. I had a lot of things in my life and my career, so I don’t need to keep thinking about a mistake. It’s part of football.

If the manager tells me something there is a reason so I do it. I am a team player. I know I am not a player who will dribble past five players and score, but I know my quality. \n“I do my job, if the manager is happy that is the most important thing and then my team-mates. There is always someone talking because Manchester United is a big club. \n“I am used to it, so I don’t listen any more. I do my job and when the manager gives me a chance to play, I give everything.” \nFellaini is a contrast to what you see on the pitch.

We haven’t lost for three months in the league. We lost (the EFL Cup semi-final's second leg) against Hull, but we are in the final so it’s good – we have to keep going. \n“When a new manager comes in he has to find his balance, now he has it so we have to keep going, keep fighting and work hard. Everyone wants to show himself. We have a lot of confidence and everyone wants to play, so it’s good for the team.

We try to do that and and now we’e had time it is more intense. It’s shown that we are strong. \n“A club like Manchester United, they have to play Champions League so the minimum is to be top four. At the beginning of the season we wanted to be Champions. That’s normal at this club. \n“But we lost points, we drew a lot. Games like Stoke and Hull and Burnley at home, we should win but we didn’t. Six points is a lot to drop in the Premier League. \n\"We have to win some games now and keep going to the end of the season.” poll loading Man United fans!
