Reflecting on their split, she insisted the couple were still the best of friends and continued to take joint responsibility for their beloved dogs, Harley and Jess. All over: The actress confirmed the estranged couple had ended their marriage a year ago – 12-months after exchanging vows 'I grew out of love and she became more of my best friends,' she explained. 'like we were living as friends, not a married couple. We're still living together, just in separate rooms while the divorce goes through but it's underway.' The actress added that she took the decision to remain quiet about her marriage split for the better part of a year in a bid to avoid awkward questions. The couple first met in 2011 when Michelle was appearing in panto, and Michelle - who was in a six-year relationship at the time - admits she had no idea Rosie was gay, but quickly knew she was The One. Screen success: Michelle is best known for her role as vet Vanessa Woodfield on the ITV soap Speaking shortly after their intimate wedding, during which both brides wore white, Michelle admitted she was cautious to say anything that might curse their marriage. 'I’d better touch wood, but life is lovely at the moment, and I love saying, “This is my wife.,\"' she told The Mirror. 'We were both planning to change our names to Hardwick-Nicholl, but then Rosie decided to take my name. 'I thought she was being romantic, but she’s a freelance music teacher, so she confessed she didn’t want to write out a long surname eight times a day!' MailOnline have contacted Michelle's representatives for further comment.
