(Supplied) \nHowever, the Legal Aid lawyer who represented David Bradford at the bail hearing, Mark Donnelly, said no one could have predicted the tragedy. \nMr Donnelly had argued he should be granted bail and Bradford was released from jail on January 12. \nMr Donnelly said the court's decision to grant bail was entirely appropriate. \nHe said Bradford had been in custody for 44 days and had no criminal history. \nMr Donnelly said his client was penniless, homeless, living on a disability pension and had no driver's licence. \nMs Palaszczuk said the Government would look at all options, but police needed to do a thorough investigation first. \n\"I'm happy that they look at all those circumstances and all of those situations,\" Ms Palaszczuk said. \n\"We will look at all of those options — I'm not going to pre-empt anything at the moment. \n\"I want to let the police do their investigation and I'll have a discussion with the Attorney-General [Yvette D'Ath] and Shannon Fentiman, the Minister for the Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence.\" \nMs Palaszczuk said the Pimpama incident was tragic. \n\"My thoughts and prayers are with those young children at the moment — they've lost their mother and their father,\" she said. \n\"This is an absolute tragedy, and what we are continuing to see — and it's not unique to Queensland but across Australia — is that women are continuing to lose their lives because of domestic and family violence. \n\"Domestic and family violence in our state needs to stop. \n\"My Government has made the prevention of domestic and family violence a priority and we have set up a specialist Domestic and Family Violence Court at Southport … with wrap-around support services.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:41:19.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
