On Wednesday, Steph Curry said he agreed with Plank if you remove the et from that word asset. \nHere’s how The Rock responded on Thursday: A photo posted by therock (@therock) on Feb 9, 2017 at 10:36am PST \nI appreciate and welcome the feedback from people who disagree (and agree) with Kevin Plank’s words on CNBC, but these are neither my words, nor my beliefs. His words were divisive and lacking in perspective. Inadvertently creating a situation where the personal political opinions of UA’s partners and its employees were overshadowed by the comments of its CEO. \nA good company is not solely defined by its CEO. A good company is not defined by the athlete or celebrity who partners with them. A good company is not a single person. A good company is a team, a group of brothers and sisters committed to working together each and every day to provide for their families and one another and the clients they serve. \nWe don’t partner with a brand casually. I partner with brands I trust and with people who share my same values. That means a commitment to diversity, inclusion, community, open-mindedness and some serious hard work. But it doesn’t mean that I or my team will always agree with the opinion of everyone who works there, including its executives. Great leaders inspire and galvanize the masses during turbulent times, they don’t cause people to divide and disband. My responsibility here is not only to the global audience we serve, but also to the thousands of workers who pour blood, sweat, and tears into making Under Armour strong. A diverse group of hardworking men and women who possess integrity, respect and compassion for one another and the world they live in. Debate is healthy. But in a time of widespread disagreement, so is loyalty. I feel an obligation to stand with this diverse team, the American and global workers, who are the beating heart and soul of Under Armour and the reason I chose to partner with them. \nMy commitment is as real as my sweat and callouses that thicken daily. #CommittedToThePeople \nJohnson has never been one to shy away from politics. In November, Johnson said he wouldn’t rule out running for President in 2020. \nAnother Under Armour endorsee, Misty Copeland , also posted on Instagram to express her disagreement with Plank’s statement. A photo posted by Misty Copeland (@mistyonpointe) on Feb 9, 2017 at 10:14am PST \n“I have always appreciated the great support and platform that Under Armour has given me to represent my community, gender, and career on the world stage,” she wrote. “However, I strongly disagree with Kevin Plank’s recent comments in support of Trump as recently reported.” \nNot everyone was angry with Plank though. Kent Bazemore told the Sporting News that he was glad a businessman was elected to the nation’s highest office. More Sports!
