This is how it works Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now How Gary Neville's developments could look Share this video     \nIt’s one of the most controversial developments Manchester city centre has seen for years. \nThe St Michael’s project, off Deansgate, would see two skyscrapers, a massive split-level public plaza, a new synagogue, offices, bars, restaurants and a 5* hotel spring up on Jackson’s Row. \nAn outcry from residents and Historic England – and, probably more to the point, the fact former Manchester United ace Gary Neville is behind the plan – has projected the resulting furore into the national headlines. Read More Gary Neville has changed one big thing about his city centre skyscraper... now they're going to be BRONZE! \nObjectors claim the skyscrapers in particular will dwarf surrounding Victorian and Edwardian streets, wipe out landmarks of historic significance and ruin the city centre skyline. \nBut aside from those now well-rehearsed arguments, there is another interesting dimension to the development which isn’t widely understood in as much detail: the council’s own significant financial interest in it going ahead. How St Michael's will look from Albert Square \nTo most observers the story started three years ago at the 2014 MIPIM property festival in Cannes, at which Neville was the star of the Manchester delegation alongside conference stalwart Sir Howard Bernstein, the city council’s chief executive and prime deal-maker. \nNeville had long been looking to get the redevelopment of Jackson’s Row off the ground but had hit a number of obstacles along the way. \nEqually the council also wanted to see the block, half of which was still owned by the police and had been standing empty for some time, make a contribution to the local economy. \nWhatever discussions were had in Cannes, six months later a report went before the council’s executive detailing plans to enter into a joint development arrangement with Neville’s firm Jackson’s Row Development Company. \nThat was duly signed in the months that followed. \nAt around the same time Manchester council entered into negotiations with the police and crime commissioner over purchasing the vacant Bootle Street police station, which makes up roughly half of the block and had been emptied out when the force moved to new headquarters in Newton Heath.

A decade ago the former Hill Dickinson office on Fountain Street sold for £10m, for example. The old Granada Studios site – admittedly a lot bigger than Bootle Street, but again one at the heart of a planned massive redevelopment – sold for £26.5m in 2013. \nBut the council stresses the site was independently valued, with sources suggesting they paid at the top of the market. The actual Bootle Street building would cost an absolute fortune to maintain, redevelop or demolish, they add, while the site had no planning permission with it, both factors that they say pushed down its value. \nIn a statement, a spokesman said: “The acquisition arrangements were independently verified by independent surveyors to ensure both the Police and Crime Commissioner and the city council were receiving market value at that time (March 2015).” \nRegardless of what was paid back then, GMP – like the council – will stand to gain far more from the site if planning permission is granted in the coming weeks. View gallery \nUnder the terms of its development agreement, Manchester council is now leasing the Bootle Street site to Jackson’s Row Development Company. (The M.E.N. has asked how long the lease lasts and how much the council will earn from it, but it won’t say, citing commercial confidentiality.) \nThen at a later date the town hall intends to sell it on – at a massive profit, in all likelihood running into the tens of millions – and share the proceeds with GMP. \nThe M.E.N. asked at what point the council intends to sell, along with what projections it has made for its eventual financial return. \nIt refused to say, but did say in a statement: “Appropriate arrangements were agreed by both parties to ensure any additional value as a result of development is captured, when development takes place.” Read More Campaigners call for public inquiry into plans for two huge tower blocks next to Castlefield Basin \nSuch deals are not unusual for Manchester council, but the scale, controversy and celebrity profile of this one makes it stand out. \nThe level of anger from Historic England - which has been uncharacteristically vocal about the application, warning that it will ‘aggressively’ harm the setting of nearby treasures such as the town hall and Central Library - has only raised the stakes further. \nUltimately the real test will come when the St Michael’s application finally goes before the council’s own planning committee. \nSenior town hall figures stress the planning process is a completely separate town hall function to its regeneration and economic development departments. Just as the council often has to decide on its own applications - for school extensions, for example - so it does, from time to time, take planning decisions on other ventures in which the authority has an interest. \nThat won’t stop opponents of the plan doubting the committee’s ability to take a clear-eyed decision on something, in this case, that is worth so much to the city purse. \nConsequently the drama will play out at a planning meeting some time in the spring. All eyes, on both sides of the argument, will be on that 14-strong panel of councillors and the reasoning for whatever decision they eventually take. \nWhile for the town hall, GMP and Gary Neville, millions of pounds now ride on them approving St Michael’s, you can be certain its objectors won’t be going down without a fight either.
