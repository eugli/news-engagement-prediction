(HT Photo ) \nAparshakti Khurrana has garnered positive reviews for his performance in Dangal (2016), which is Bollywood’s highest ever grosser. The actor who attempted comedy at the beginning of his career says, “My character certainly had a comic element, but at the same time it was sensitive enough for people to understand that this guy has mixed emotions,” says Aparshakti. \nHe credits Aamir Khan and director Nitesh Tiwari for giving the cast enough time to prepare, and to get into a “comfortable space”. However, ask him if he was ever intimated by Aamir and he says, “You will have jitters when you work with him. But that prep time helped. We had readings at his place. We were blessed to be part of a project where everything was taken care of, and dealt with, in a warm way. Now, after this, it will be difficult to decide what to do next.” Read more Women’s lives are not stopping after marriage or childbirth: Vidya Balan \nHe adds, “I never thought of becoming an actor — like a mainstream actor. Now I have shifted to Mumbai as well.” The multifaceted actor is a law student, an RJ, and has been a voice-over artist in Delhi. He has also done a short stint in theatre, though he was not as deeply involved as his brother Ayushmann Khurrrana. “Bhaiya has done a lot of theatre. I haven’t done as much. But to hone my skills, he suggested that I take it up. That’s when I started doing theatre in Delhi,” says Aparshakti. However, he would like to continue with radio and anchoring, along with acting in movies.

Whatever good scripts come my way, I will take them up. I will not think that I’ve been a part of such a huge film. For me, each and every medium has credibility and respect,” he says. A post shared by Aparshakti Khurana (@aparshakti_khurana) on Jan 9, 2017 at 1:16pm PST \nOn asking him about his brother’s reaction after seeing him on the silver screen, Aparshakti says, “He hugged me and said it was amazing. He said he was proud of me. Otherwise, he is not very expressive. Very seldom does he expresses whole heartedly.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:38.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
