I’ve been so scared to do it thinking it hurts so badly, and it didn’t hurt that badly.” \n“So I’m so grateful, and I’m so excited. I love you Dr. Ourian.” \nShe was pictured leaving the venue in all-black ensemble teamed with bright white sneakers, a leather snakeskin purse and black shades. \nHowever, the night before saw the “Keeping Up With The Kardashian’s” star show her love of furry outwear as she wore a long fur coat for her dinner date with husband Kanye West.
