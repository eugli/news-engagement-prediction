Nicolas Batum (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:50 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:50 p.m. ET \nNicolas Batum wisely didn't offer a money-back pledge to fans when he guaranteed a win for the Hornets in Monday's game. \nThe stoic Batum uncharacteristically said his team would beat the 76ers at home. Well, word definitely got around to Philly, which took control early and won 105-99 . The Sixers led by as many as 14 points in the fourth quarter. \nSixers guard T.J. McConnell had a ready response for Batum, even if he inflated the value of his own squad a little. Philly is digging out of a big early-season hole and is 21-34 for the season. TJ McConnell puts the league on notice! #MadeinPhila pic.twitter.com/HdqhqmP2Dc â€” The Fuzz (@TheFuzzNBA) February 14, 2017 \nBatum's bravado likely was rooted in the Hornets' recent struggles. Charlotte (24-31) has lost 10 of its last 11 after Monday's defeat and fallen out of the top eight in the East. Despite that, the Hornets are still just 1 1/2 games out of the No. 8 spot, behind the Pistons. To show how mediocre the bottom of the East playoff field is, the Sixers are just 4 1/2 back of Detroit. \nBatum finished with 16 points, four assists and a rebound in 38 minutes.
