He was 36. The Tall Persons Club said Mr. Fingleton, who was recognized by Guinness World Records in 2007 as Britain’s tallest man, died on Saturday, but did not say where he died. British news media reports said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Fingleton, who was born in Durham, in northeast England, told the Guinness website in 2006 that he had “always been taller than everyone since I can remember.” His height made him a natural for basketball , and he played college basketball in the United States for the University of North Carolina and the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. He also briefly played professionally in an American minor league and in Europe before beginning his acting career. He appeared in the movies “47 Ronin” and “X-Men: First Class” and on the television shows “Doctor Who” and, most notably, “Game of Thrones.” His “Game of Thrones” character, Mag, was a fearsome giant on the northern side of the great ice wall that was guarded by Lord Commander Jon Snow and the black-clad men of the Night’s Watch. \"Game of Thrones,\" Mag the Mighty Giant death scene, Season 6 Episode 9 Video by Ahmed Helal A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2017, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Neil Fingleton, 36, of ‘Game of Thrones’.
