Alberta murderer serving life sentence granted more freedom \nHis sentence included a mandatory parole eligibility at 25 years. \nHe later successfully applied under the faint hope clause to have his parole eligibility reduced by two years, although he has yet to apply for full parole. \nAccording to documents obtained by News Talk 770, the parole board initially granted 48-hour passes for family contact in September, specifically for his wife. \nREAD MORE: Alberta murderer serving life sentence granted more freedom \nIn a hearing in early January, the parole board heard a request to expand the absences to 72 hours. \nThe board noted no concerns during the first set of passes and believes expanding the scope won’t elevate his risk as he continues his reintegration. \n“You are currently assessed as ‘high’ in terms of your attitude, level of motivation and reintegration potential,” the decision reads. “Psychological and psychiatric assessments view your risk on these absences as manageable.” \nWatch below from September 2016: A man convicted of the first-degree murder of his ex-girlfriend has been given privileges in prison. As Jill Croteau reports, the victim’s family is exposing their private pain, in hopes the parole board will re-consider his freedom. \nWhile in custody, Paetsch had a troublesome first few years with several institutional charges, but appeared to turn things around in 1997. \nHe got himself into hot water after not reporting a relationship he entered into, which landed him back in medium-security prison. \nThat relationship blossomed when the pair got married in 2014. \nThe parole board called it a “positive and supportive relationship,” while she’s said to be a “genuine support.” \nPaetsch became eligible for full parole in March 2014, but has yet to apply. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:43:56.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
