Trial by spin. All the talks of how the ball will fly on Pune's Test debut were put to rest when Australia opted to bat after winning the toss with the pitch already resembling a fifth day surface against India. If there was any doubt left, it was cleared when spinner Ravi Ashwin shared the new ball with seamer Ishant Sharma. And by the eighth over, Ishant was taken out of the attack in favour of another spinner in Jayant Yadav . The ball was turning square, the bounce uneven and roughs were aplenty as far as the first morning of a Test is concerned. Australia, though, put up a good fight before losing David Warner (38) and Matt Renshaw (36; retd hurt) late in the session but still took lunch at a credible 84/1 with Steve Smith (1*) and Shaun Marsh (1*) batting on the first day of the first Test against India on Thursday. \n\nThe pitch was doing the tricks but to the frustration of the hosts spinners, the wickets column still read zero until Umesh Yadav cleaned up Warner off his third delivery of the morning. And then Renshaw immediately retired hurt before Smith could make his way to the the pitch meaning Australia had two new batsmen in captain Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh - their two best bets against the spinners - in the middle. \n\nIt was an eventful morning. Ishant bowled a tight spell lasting four overs. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Jayant kept the batsmen on their toes. A lot of deliveries turned and missed the outside edge. One such from Ashwin prompted India to opt for the DRS against Renshaw for a caught behind decision but the on-field umpire's not out call was upheld. In between, the trio also managed to bowl poor deliveries allowing much needed release for the Australian duo. When Ashwin strayed off the line, Warner tickled the ball to fine leg for a four. A low full toss and a short delivery from Jayant were meted out the same treatments. Soon, Warner and Renshaw had laid a solid platform with an 82-run stand. \n\nTo counter the spin, Warner was standing slightly outside the off stump that exposed a hint of his leg stump. Jayant spotted that and landed one on the middle that bowled the lefty around his legs. But the celebrations were cut short as Jayant had overstepped. \n\nThe cat and mouse chase continued and Australia seemed to winning it. With growing confidence, Renshaw gave Jadeja the charge, hitting him over long on boundary for a six. The session nearing its end, Kohli reintroduced pace in Umesh in the 28th over and he struck immediately with the scalp of Warner as the ball crashed on the stumps after a thick inside edge. The immediate retirement of Renshaw came as bonus and Smith (1*) and Marsh (1*) though safely negotiated the remaining overs, a long day awaits the visitors. \n\nBrief score: Australia 84/1 (Warner 38, Renshaw 36*; Umesh 1/1) vs India", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:30:36.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
