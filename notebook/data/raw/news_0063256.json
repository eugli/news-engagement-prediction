If Scott Walker gets his way, Wisconsin's unemployed would be required to do the same before qualifying for government unemployment assistance.\nSince becoming governor, Walker has been a regular drug test crusader. But for the last eight years, the Obama administration has blocked that effort at every turn. That's about to change.\n\"Now with a new president and a new Congress,\" Walker said triumphantly this morning at the Conservative Political Action Conference, \"we can actually go forward with our plan to ensure that everyone seeking welfare can actually pass a drug test.\"\nWalker insists that the law isn't about fear, loathing or harshing anyone's mellow. \"We want to help out fellow citizens,\" Walker explained, \"but we understand that public assistance should be a trampoline not a hammock.\"\nCongress is already cooking up legislation to make Walker's drug dream possible. Earlier this month House Republicans introduced legislation to roll back an Obama-era labor law barring states from developing their own drug screening requirements.\nWhile the bill empowers states to do testing, terms and conditions apply. Only welfare applicants who either have \"lost their job due to drug use\" or are seeking a job that regularly requires \"employees to pass a drug test\" would be candidates for screening.\nBut opponents describe drug testing as a burn out that only wastes money, and they point to Arizona's example. In 2009 that state tested 87,000 welfare recipients, according to USA Today, and found only a single drug abuser. But Walker is undeterred.\nThe Republican governor describes drug testing as \"a giant step\" toward helping welfare recipients take control of \"their own lives and control their own destiny through the dignity of hard work.\"\nPhilip Wegmann is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Saturday DNC election could go multiple rounds To win, candidates must secure the support of 50 percent plus one of the 442 eligible voting DNC members.\nBy David M.
