06:43 (IST) \nA fascinating statement has been issued by the five filmmakers nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category. They've strongly condemned the culture of 'fanaticism and nationalism we see in the US'. \nThe filmmakers are: \n1. Martin Pieter Zandvliet (Land of Mine) 2. Asghar Farhadi (The Salesman) 3. Maren Ade (Toni Erdmann) \n4. Hannes Holm (A Man called Ove) \n5. Martin Butler and Bentley Dean ( Tanna) \nHere's the full text of statement they've issued: 07:11 (IST) \nHere are a couple more gems from Kimmel: \n\"This telecast is being watched by millions of people in America..and in 225 countries around the world. Who now hate us.\" \nOr this: Ruchika Kher, Fashion Journalist 07:10 (IST) \nHe's a first-time Oscar host but Jimmy Kimmel's in fine form. His opening monologue has already given us this great line: \n\"We have only one breaveheart in the room and even he can't unite us.\" 07:08 (IST) \nJustin Timberlake kicks off the proceedings! \nAnd the 89th Academy Awards have begun, with Justin Timberlake's performance of ' Can't Stop The Feeling ' from Trolls . Quite an all-star sinag-along that turned out to be! Watch a snippet of it here: — ABC Network (@ABCNetwork) February 27, 2017 07:05 (IST) \nAccident at the Dolby Theatre just before Oscars start 07:03 (IST) Ruchika Kher, Fashion Journalist 07:03 (IST) \nThe Oscars 2017 red carpet is definitely turning out to be a family affair. If Emma Stone brought her brother Spencer, and Dev Patel had his mom as his special guest. Andrew Garfield brought his father, and Captain America star Chris Evans brought his sister. Here they are: 06:58 (IST) \nEmma Stone on Best Actress Oscar nomination: 'Inconceivable dream' \nEmma Stone arrived with her brother Spencer on the red carpet, to which she was asked: \"Is he your good luck charm?\" Spencer promptly replied: \"Yes!\" \nIncidentally Stone had created a Power Point presentation called 'Project Hollywood' to convince her parents to let her pursue an acting career. Of her Oscar nomination, she said: \"This is an inconceivable dream.\" 06:55 (IST) \nSupport for the ACLU on the red carpet \nThese Oscars were going to eb a political event — seeing the trend over the award season this year — and sure enough, there were several celebrities who sported blue ribbons on the red carpet in support of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union). \nEven model Karlie Kloss, who is dating Jared Kushner's (that's Trump's son-in-law) brother Josh was wearing one. Blue ACLU ribbons make a statement on the Oscars red carpet https://t.co/LIFSymIJfd pic.twitter.com/lELqMSJOuN \nDenzel Washington hasn't aged in 20 years! He's the Black Wolverine. 06:48 (IST) \nDenzel Washington talks about Fences \"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage,\" was what d irector and actor Denzel Washington had to say bringing Fences to the silver screen from Broadway. He also had a huge vote of support for his co-star Viola Davis, who has a Best Actress nomination. \"This is her time.\" he said. 06:46 (IST) \nOrder in which the Academy Awards will be announced \nIf you were wondering which category would be announced when — here's a complete schedule: The official order of presentation of the 2017 Oscars. Supporting Actor first, then Costume Design. Screenplays at the end. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/yfDA0L3Tfl 06:37 (IST) \nMeryl Streep arrives \nMeryl Streep makes a regal entry at Oscars 2017. And all eyes (and ears) are going to be trained on Streep — who has a Best Actress in a Lead Role nomination for Florence Foster Jenkins — to see if any rousing anti-Donald Trump speeches will be made. — RJ ALOK (@OYERJALOK) February 27, 2017 06:35 (IST) \nCasey Affleck sexual assault allegations in the spotlight \nThe controversy reared its head again, when Casey walked the red carpet. Read an analysis of it here on Firstpost. \nHere's what one Twitter user had to say: This woman just fawned all over Casey Affleck and how he is her favorite. Guess the assaults were ok to her? pic.twitter.com/M5d0cFG6eu — Jennifer Gunter (@DrJenGunter) February 27, 2017 06:32 (IST) Casey Affleck talks Manchester By The Sea Casey Affleck credited the success of Manchester by the Sea to writer/director Kenneth Lonergan. For him, Lonergan was the driving force behind his performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. As for the answer to that all-important question about when he's shaving off the beard, Casey said he is sporting it to get into character for his next role (which is under wraps), and will be keeping it for a few more weeks. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 06:30 (IST) \nA reporter just asked Best Actor in a Lead Role nominee Casey Affleck when he's going to shave his shaggy beard so she can see his \"movie star jaw\". He stuttered through his response. #AskHimMore perhaps? \nHow sweet is it that Dev Patel's brought his mom as his Oscars night date? 06:25 (IST) Ruchika Kher, Fashion Journalist 06:20 (IST) \nPriyanka has chosen the same colour, but it's still a different look. The structural look works great on her. Love that bodice. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 06:19 (IST) \nIs it just me, or does Priyanka Chopra's look seem a little too similar to last year's Zuhair Murad gown? 06:15 (IST) \nEmma Stone shines in gold \nBest Actress in a Lead Role nominee Emma Stone walked the red carpet in a shimmering gold gown that could just be the perfect complement for her golden statuette (if she does get to take it home). Here she is: I want you to see how Emma Stone's dress moves #Oscars pic.twitter.com/FCMuClj6yw \nI call this the Sathya Sai Baba look! 06:10 (IST) \nAnd she's here! Priyanka Chopra — also on-trend in a structured white gown and slicked back hair — has walked the red carpet. And its happening! Looking gorgeous in that pearly white dress! @priyankachopra #PCatOscars #Oscars 😍🔥 pic.twitter.com/3lLAP4nbtm 06:09 (IST) \nTrend-spotting: White is the colour du jour on the Oscars red carpet \nWhite seems to be the colour of choice for several celebrities. We've already seen Isabelle Ruppert, T rudie Styler and Ch rissy T eigen opt for ivory. I'm sure we're going to see much more of this. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 05:58 (IST) \nJanelle Monae has been making waves with every red carpet appearance this awards season, and she's gone all-out for the Oscars in this flouncy, ethereal number. She looks like a modern-day African princess. Janelle Monáe is slaying the #Oscars red carpet right now! pic.twitter.com/IA59dqTvKo — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) February 27, 2017 05:54 (IST) \nA moment between the Hidden Figures stars Taraji P Henson and Janelle Monae: Running into your BFF when you're both looking flawless like: #Oscars pic.twitter.com/HYST8LFIga Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 05:52 (IST) \nI loved the looks of both the Hidden Figures stars who've walked the red carpet so far — Octavia Spencer and Taraji P Henson. Henson, especially, is crushing it in velvet. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 05:50 (IST) \nNina Garcia just said she's \"loving\" Ruth Negga's red Valentino gown. Wonder how many others are going to use the \"Loving\" pun/reference when talking about Negga! Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 05:46 (IST) \nThe last time I saw the Oscars ceremony I was still in my twenties... Obama was still the president, brown people weren't shot on sight and the Oscars weren't a consortium of the Left planning a giant attack on the POTUS. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 05:44 (IST) \nYeah, love Sunny's look! The lace-ups, that swag! He's getting a lot of attention on the red carpet. 05:43 (IST) \nSunny Pawar is looking adorable. Love the confidence, the smile. Some sharp dressing by the little one. 05:41 (IST) \nLoving star and Best Actress in a Lead Role nominee Ruth Negga on the red carpet \nNegga complemented her c ustom Valentino gown with Irene Neuwirth jewels. What do you think of her look? more photos of Ruth on the red carpet #Oscars pic.twitter.com/CaLGr9S08y 05:39 (IST) \nPatel's co-star Sunny Pawar has also made his appearance — in trainers and a tux no less! #Oscars -- The adorable actor who has won huge applause is here! Meet the star of #Lion - Sunny Pawar \nLion Star Dev Patel walks the red carpet. #Oscars nominee Dev Patel has hit the red carpet https://t.co/CE9NWs6paT pic.twitter.com/1RkGIn7t3C 05:36 (IST) \nThe stars begin to arrive \nThe Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles is the scene of what promises to be a very exciting 89th Academy Awards, or the Oscars 2017. The first stars are just beginning to arrive on the red carpet; and Hacksaw Ridge star Andrew Garfield is among the first to walk by. \"I t's an unbelievable story,\" Garfield said, when asked about why he signed up for the role that has earned him a Best Actor in a Lead Role nomination. Load More \nIn the pantheon of award shows that honour cinema the world over, there are few that match up to the Oscars in terms of glamour, hype or scale. \nAnd as the 89th Academy Awards — or the Oscars 2017 — kick off at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles (Sunday night, 26 February, in the US and Monday morning, 27 February for us folks in India), there's plenty of excitement over how the ceremony will play out. \nWill La La Land pull off a landslide sweep across all the major categories it's been nominated in? Will Emma Stone lift the coveted golden statuette as Best Actress? Will it come down to a Denzel Washington vs Casey Affleck fight for the Best Actor in a Leading Role prize? Will Dennis Villeneuve or Damien Chazelle earn the Best Director honour? \nWe've got some desi interest in the proceedings as well. Priyanka Chopra will be walking the red carpet; she announced her presence with an Instagram photo along with Sir Mick Jagger, which really had us wondering if they have some sort of joint performance/presentation at the Oscars 2017 ceremony. Then there's Dev Patel, who has a Best Supporting Actor for his role in Lion . Oscars 2017: Who will take home the coveted golden statuette? \nIf Patel has many expectations riding on his lean shoulders, so too does first-time host Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel follows a tough act in the form of last year's host Chris Rock, who roasted the Academy over the #OscarsSoWhite controversy to great effect. Then there's former host Ellen DeGeneres, who has set the bar pretty high with her pizza-sharing, selfie-snapping ways. Kimmel had a goodish bit of experience with hosting the Emmys this year, which should stand him in good stead on the Oscars stage. \nThat stage could well be the spot where some pretty blistering anti-Donald Trump speeches are made. Meryl Streep set the tone with her Golden Globes acceptance speech, and Stranger Things star David Harbour and a host of other actors followed it up at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. Who will get the loudest applause? \nAnd of course, when talking of applause and approval, we can't leave out the slightly less serious (but no less important) red carpet fashion. There will be some beautiful gowns, natty tuxedos and several bizarre sartorial statements made — there's no doubt. \nAnd we'll be keeping you posted on every little detail, minute-by-minute. \nStay tuned. We're live blogging the 89th Academy Awards, aka the Oscars 2017, right here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:53:16.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
