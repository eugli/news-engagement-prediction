The short teaser doesn't give too much away, but provides an idea of how the film will combine gritty realism with fantasy, showing LAPD officer Will Smith clutching a battered-looking broadsword, alongside a shotgun-toting orc, played by Warrior star Joel Edgerton.\nNetflix spent upwards of $90 million on Bright , helmed by Suicide Squad director David Ayers. That investment that includes $3 million for the script — written by Max Landis — with another $45 million set aside for shooting. The figure represents the streaming service's biggest project so far, and is something of a statement of intent: unlike some of its earlier movie purchases, Bright is a big budget picture with big names attached, and could be a big draw for Netflix over both competing services and traditional movie theaters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:15:24.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
