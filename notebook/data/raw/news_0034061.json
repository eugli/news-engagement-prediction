A chest bump between two men whose chests could never physically meet. Kim needs it. Trump needs it. Let’s rumble …\nNorth Korea shoots missile 500km in 'show of force' to Trump, says South Read more \nBut what exactly is the “it” these two desire? A war between the USA and the DPRK would be short and devastating for the latter. Given both leaders’ propensity to regard nuclear weapons as toys, it would would risk ending the post-1945 nuclear peace. It would add the possibility of annihilation as a tactic in the global race and religious wars that haunt the fantasies of Trump’s advisers.\nYet Kim Jong-un must be deterred. He is creating an unpredictable and unmonitored nuclear arsenal, beyond the influence of any of the world’s big powers, including Nato, Russia and China. And he is developing it fast. The DPRK’s arms trade, carried on in defiance of UN sanctions, supplies near-obsolete weaponry to rogue governments in poor countries . That is only a minor threat to global peace. But its nuclear warhead programme, combined with its ballistic missile programme, is a danger way beyond the 500km flight of the Pukguksong-2, which Kim personally controlled on Saturday.\nThe Pukguksong-2 is a solid fuel missile. That means it doesn’t have to be filled by tanker while sticking out like a sore thumb on an adversary’s radar and satellite screens. Unless its adversary has total air superiority, with bombers circling the area waiting to take the missile out, it can probably get in a first strike. Though it flew only 500km, its claimed range is three or four times that. Its predecessor, the Pukguksong-1, was successfully fired from a submarine. If you combine that with repeated nuclear weapons tests, and repeated boasts that North Korea has miniaturised its nuclear technology to create a missile warhead, it adds up to one of two things: it is either a clear threat or a clear bluff.\nSo the question for the world is: how do we contain the threat and detect the bluff? We’ve been here before, of course, with Saddam Hussein in 2003. Then, the chemical weapons turned out to be a bluff and the biggest threat to world peace emanated from Washington and London. That should make the international community tread carefully, and, above all, act multilaterally. Kim Jong-un – like the commanders of the imperial German navy in 1918 – is quite capable of staging a death-ride for his failing elite. People like Kim want to be remembered for a thousand years. And, as the current outbreak of swastikas on the walls of western cities show, if it’s a phoneix-like rebirth you are after, you don’t have to wait a thousand years.\n“I triggered a nuclear war with the USA and reduced South Korea to a toxic wasteland” would be, for Kim, an epitaph worth dying for. Even better if he could add, “and I destroyed the multilateral global order for ever”.\nThese are the stakes. So the purpose of containment and deterrence must be to deny him any of this. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen. Kim’s finely timed up yours to the world is a gift to Trump. Trump needs an external enemy in order to justify suppressing the rule of law and further eroding constitutional conventions at home. He needs a cause around which to unite with Vladimir Putin, as an excuse to lift sanctions on Russia so the two men can get on with making themselves rich. Trump needs, above all, something to make him look competent and decisive, and unite his flailing National Security Council around something more concrete than a slogan on a mug.\nBy firing a missile towards Japan, in the middle of a US-Japan summit, Kim just offered all this on a plate and more. Because North Korea remains a residual weapons supplier and maintainer for Cuba and Iran – Trump’s other bugbears – he could use escalating tension with Pyongyang to create friction here.\nIf the missile crisis escalates, I have no doubt that by the weekend there will be people on the streets of western capitals chanting “No war with North Korea”. That’s good – but the left has to realise there is no direct read-off from Iraq to the DPRK.\nBritain is a member of the P5: a nuclear-armed power with the duty to enforce international law. Theresa May – adrift in the Brexit crisis – will need no prompting to tag along with friend Donald, grasping his tiny hand if necessary, as he utilises the crisis to launch a pre-emptive, unilateral strike on North Korea. Labour, the Lib Dems, the nationalist parties and the Greens should adopt a policy of multilateral deterrence only. That means tasking the British government to ensure any action taken against Pyongyang is restrained, proportional and done through the UN security council.\nParadoxically, the most effective way of de-escalating the standoff would be to persuade China to play the role of a mature regional power . The Chinese leadership is perplexed by Trump: he threatens to destroy their economic model by dismantling global trade, to defy the One China policy with Taiwan, and members of the Trump team speculate about “war in the South China Sea” – ie between China and Japan.\nThe best thing the left, and peace-inclined centrist governments, can do in the west is to persuade China to dump Kim Jong-un and promote the disarmament and democratisation of the DPRK. But here’s the ultimate problem. What North Korea needs is a democratic revolution. Washington and Seoul promote dissidence north of the demilitarised zone but not revolt. And what the Chinese leadership fears most of all is an uncontrollable mass event.\nThus, for the population of North Korea, there is only one nightmare scenario: to survive under Kim’s dictatorship until the moment he hits the self-destruct button. The global left and liberal centre should insist on a third: democracy in Pyongyang; UN-led disarmament and – above all – an assured firmness with restraint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:54:09.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
