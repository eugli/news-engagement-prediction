Source: News Limited \nBeams won a premiership under the stewardship of Mick Malthouse, then spent three seasons at Collingwood under Nathan Buckley before his move to the Lions, where he was under the instruction of Leppitsch. \nBetween the trio, there’s almost 900 games of coaching experience — a figure that is propped up substantially by Malthouse’s all-time record of 710 games. \nYet Beams suggested Fagan was just as good, if not better, than any of them. \n“He’s got a vested interest in what guys do outside of footy and what makes them tick so I think the guys have responded well to that,” Beams said. \n“Player-coach relationships are really healthy and he is really big on that so I think he’ll have a really long coaching career.” \nBeams was unveiled as Fagan’s first skipper at the Lions on Tuesday. \nA surprise choice given his poor run with injuries, the 27-year-old suggested life outside of footy had shaped him into the right candidate for the job. \n“I’ve had a bit of time over the past few years to think about what I’ve done well and what I haven’t done well, mainly due to injury,” Beams said. \n“I’d rather be out there playing, but you’ve got to take the positives and I’ve been able to work on a few things. I feel like I’m mature enough now and ready to lead this club going forward. \n“At the end of 2015 I got married so that was a big year for myself. Then five months ago we had our first child so there have been things outside of football that have definitely forced me to grow up a little bit quickly. \n“I’m really comfortable with where I sit within the footy club. I feel like I’m the right person to take us forward and I’m confident I have the right people around me to guide me and support me.” \nBeams was adamant he was over his knee tendinitis, saying he was committed to leading his young team on the field. \n“I’m not going into the season thinking, ‘how am I going to captain from the sidelines?’ \n“I’m thinking how I’m going to captain the side out on the ground. That’s the attitude I’ve got to take. If I don’t have that then I’m thinking about everything else.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:00:54.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
