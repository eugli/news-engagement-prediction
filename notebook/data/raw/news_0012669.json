ADVERTISEMENT \nThree were filed by Senator Manny Pacquiao, while the three others were filed separately by Senate Majority Leader Vicente “Tito” Sotto III, Senator Panfilo Lacson and Senator Sherwin Gatchalian. \nUnlike the six measures, Senator Leila de Lima’s bill, Senate Bill No. 368, seeks to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty. \nSo far, at least nine senators have openly expressed their opposition to the bill and they are Senate President Pro Tempore Franklin Drilon, Senators De Lima, Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan, Bam Aquino, Risa Hontiveros and Senator Richard Gordon, all from the majority bloc, and three from the opposition group—Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto and Senators Francis “Chiz” Escudero and Antonio Trillanes IV. \nAside from the four authors of the death penalty bills—Pacquiao, Sotto, Lacson, and Gatchalian, three others were either supportive or “open” and they are Senators Joseph Victor Ejercito, Joel Villanueva and Sonny Angara.
