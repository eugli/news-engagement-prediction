Facebook ‘is down’ for many users as News Feed stops working – and people aren’t happy \nAged between 19 and 34, the men believed that their worst symptoms would be a headache or even a batch of nausea. \nHowever, soon after receiving the drug, six were left vomiting and screaming in agony – with several having to have body parts amputated. \nNow, a BBC documentary has revisited the dramatic events that left the human guinea pigs fighting for their lives in a private unit at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London run by Parexel, a US company.

The ‘ketchup problem’ could be solved as scientists unveil ‘magic’ bottle \nThe incident quickly transformed into one of Britain’s most infamous medical emergencies. \nFortunately, doctors were able to save the lives of all of the young men – and a few weeks later, five of the men were able to leave hospital. \nRyan Wilson, the sixth and youngest participant aged 21, spent the next four months being treated for heart, liver and kidney failure. \nSections of his feet were amputated and his fingertips also fell off. \nIt was later revealed that two of the participants were given a placebo, and did not suffer the effects. Participant David Oakley was in the trial (Picture: BBC/Raw TV) All of the men had their lives saved (Picture: BBC) \nIn the documentary, The Drugs Trial, which aired last night, doctors speak about the struggles they faced while attempting to bring the ‘mysterious’ situation under control. \nInvestigators also reveal that they were sent in and tasked with finding out what went wrong at the trial on March 13, 2006. \nParticipant Raste Khan, who was 23 at the time and had been given a placebo, said: ‘Medical trials were like a get-rich-quick-scheme. It was a no brainer. Evacuation after unexploded 500lb WWII bomb is found at bottom of harbour \n‘It was all manic, everything was happening all at once. They were vomiting, they were screaming in pain, people were fainting, they couldn’t control their bowels… it was like a horror movie.’ \nIn the documentary, it was revealed that families were told to say goodbye to their loved ones as they may be about to die. \nSince the disaster, some of the participants have received compensation from Parexel. \nA report published by The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in April 2006 had 22 recommendations to improve the safety of future Phase 1 trials.
