"time to change Arsenal should ditch Mesut Ozil, get tough with Arsene Wenger and behave like a big club \nGunners need to do five things if they are to finally deliver Premier League and European success to the fans Comment Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments ARSENAL have kissed goodbye to their Premier League title dreams for another season and once again sold their supporters short. \nThe club which charges more than anyone else to watch matches have let fans down by an inability to produce a squad capable of fighting for the title. EPA 6 Arsenal’s defeat at Chelsea leaves the club facing the real possibility of falling out of the top four in the Premier League \nBut more than that, there are now serious doubts over Arsenal’s future at the top table of football as they risk being swamped and overtaken by all their rivals both at home and in Europe. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Arsenal news , gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nThe wheels are falling off at the Emirates Stadium and it is time the club took a serious look at themselves and face up to some tough questions, because if they don’t they will be left behind. EPA 6 The problems are mounting for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger \nThe problems are not just limited to the quality of the playing staff – there needs to be a major shift in attitude amongst the board if the Gunners are to remain competitive at the highest level. \nSo what exactly needs to happen for Arsenal to be challenging Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs? They could start with this five-point plan. Grow a pair when it comes to Arsene Wenger \nNo person should be bigger than a football club, but Arsene Wenger has been allowed to become bigger than Arsenal Football Club . \nNo-one in authority does anything to challenge the Frenchman whether it is about lack of success, progression or his own future at the Emirates. \nArsenal have allowed themselves to be put in a position where they are completely at the mercy of Wenger and what he wants to do, seemingly unaccountable to anything that is going on at the club. \nIf the manager wants to stay, a fresh deal is simply put on the table for him to sign, no questions asked. \nWorse than that, it is Wenger who decides when and if he stays. He knows the club won’t sack him, or even put any pressure on him to make up his mind or deliver success. Getty Images 6 The Arsenal board seem too much awe of Arsene Wenger and need to start standing up and questioning him \nIt could be Stan Kroenke, or Ivan Gazidis – it doesn’t really matter who – but somebody, somewhere needs to put their head above the parapet and call the manager to account. \nSit him down, ask serious questions about whether he really wants it any more, what is he going to do to improve the squad, and give him a deadline to make up his mind. \nArsenal cannot be left in a state of limbo – they need to give Wenger targets, they need to be out scouring the world for his replacement, and they need to be telling the manager he is no longer bigger than the club. Start behaving like a big club \nBig clubs don’t settle, they strive to become better. \nIf Chelsea, Manchester United or Manchester City don’t win the Premier League there are strong questions asked, and usually changes made. \nNot so at Arsenal where the powers that be genuinely believe their supporters have never had it so good. \nThey sit happily coining in the cash from the £1billion television deal, lucrative shirt and sponsorship deals and a corporate fan base that pays well over the odds for season tickets. \nAnd they settle for the Gunners time and again coming up short on the pitch, and in the transfer market. Reuters 6 Arsenal could have signed N’Gole Kante in the summer bout wouldn’t pay the market rate for his wages \nIt is an attitude that is growing increasingly unpopular amongst the supporters who rightly ask if there is anyone in power at the club who is willing to go the extra mile to match success on the pitch with the flourishing balance sheet. \nIf ever there were an example of this lax approach, look at N’Golo Kante. \nThe French midfielder was more than interested in a move to Arsenal after playing a pivotal role in helping Leicester win the Premier League, but the Gunners didn’t want to move heaven and earth to get him. \nThey wouldn’t pay the £110,000-a-week to get their man. Chelsea did, and now they are on course to win the title. Arsene Wenger talks Chelsea and the retirement of Frank Lampard \nTo the rank and file, such wages are extortionate. But in the rarefied atmosphere of top level football they are just the going rate. In fact, they could be seen as cheap compared to some of the figures being paid out. \nThe Gunners missed out because they wouldn't pay the wages big clubs do. They missed out on a player who could have served them the Premier League title the fans craved. \nAnd they fell another step further behind one of their rivals because, deep down, they didn't want to behave like a big club. Ditch Mesut Ozil \nArsenal have paid the price in the past for not keeping hold of their best players, but it is time they off-loaded the German for the good of their team. \nOzil and Alexis Sanchez have been playing hard-ball this season when it comes to their wage demands before they agree to sign new deals. Reuters 6 Mesut Ozil flatters to deceive and should be moved on by Arsenal this summer \nBut while Sanchez is a player the Gunners should do everything in their power to keep, Ozil is not. He just doesn't produce consistently enough. \nHis signing was something of a statement when they forked out £40m to Real Madrid for his services, but because he was the first 'world' star they had purchased it appears he has been afforded too much slack. \nArsenal should stop being thankful to Ozil for playing for them, keeping him in the side when his form doesn't warrant it. \nInstead they should tell him he doesn't deserve top billing, and move him on in the summer. The squad would be better as result. Sign a world class striker \nArsenal fans will be sick of reading the club being linked with this forward and that, only for the club to fail to deliver a marquee signing. \nBut it is more than that, the Gunners do not possess a genuine top draw striker who can striker fear into the hearts of opponents and make a real difference in games. \nAlexis Sanchex is an exceptional player, but he is an attacking midfielder more than an out-and-out front man - and while Olivier Giroud is decent, he is short of being world class. \nAll their rivals have a clear star up front, except Liverpool who themselves are being punished as a result. Chelsea 3-1 Arsenal : Blues place one hand on Premier League trophy with easy win against Gunners \nThe Gunners create chance after chance but too often they go begging. And until they bite the bullet and sign a proven hit-man they will again be at a disadvantage domestically and in Europe. \nCould you really imagine Giroud and Theo Walcott being the striking options at Chelsea, City or United? Time to beef up \nThose great Arsenal sides Arsene Wenger produced all had one thing in common - as well as quality footballers they were physically imposing. \nThe likes of Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, and Gilberto Silva were not just gifted, they were powerhouses who could mix it with the best of the hard men. \nBut Arsenal now are a powder-puff of a squad, too often falling short physically in matches. Times Newspapers Ltd 6 The great Arsenal sides Wenger produced were physically imposing as well as highly talented \nThe lack of height can be exposed at set-pieces, but it is in open play where the team suffers just as much as players are brushed aside too easily by their opponents. \nThere is nothing in this Gunners squad to intimidate opponents, no aura about them, and that has to be addressed. \nNo-one is asking Wenger or the club to change style and go route-one, but they do need to match up physically much better than they currently manage.
