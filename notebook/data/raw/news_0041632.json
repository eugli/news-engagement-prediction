File: Lionel Messi \nIt is our understanding that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner wants Guardiola to come back in the summer. \nMessi has personally called Guardiola and asked him to consider a return to the Nou Camp. \nHe insists Enrique has created a rift so huge within the Barcelona camp that only the current City boss can repair. \nA managerial change in the summer seems inevitable as Barcelona are in freefall with both the league and Champions League seemingly out of reach. \nErnesto Valverde, who has done an impressive job with Athletic Bilbao — and spent two years as a player at the Nou Camp — is the board’s first choice. \nWhile, 1992 European Cup-winning hero, Ronald Koeman, is another candidate. \nHowever, Messi has told the club’s hierarchy he wants Guardiola, as they negotiate a new deal. \nIt is understood the striker has been asked his opinion before every managerial appointment — including that of the former captain back in 2008. \nGuardiola gave Messi the platform to become the best player on the planet by giving him centre stage with the sale of Ronaldinho. \nHowever, following a difficult spell in the Premier League, he may be tempted to return “home”. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:57:19.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
