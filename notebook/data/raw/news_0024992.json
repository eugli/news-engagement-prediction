A pair of stray dogs in Plano on the loose eight months after they attacked a jogger. (Gabriel Roxas/Twitter) \nThe stray dogs, nicknamed “Bonnie and Clyde,” have eluded officers for several months while residents have reported receiving bites from the dogs. \nAnimal Services said they received a call from a resident who reported the dogs were laying down in between houses. \nJamey Cantrell, director of Animal Services, along with several officers approached the dogs and were successful in using a net gun to capture one of the dogs, an Australian Cattle dog. \nAnimal services said the Australian Cattle dog’s capture was top priority because it was the one responsible for the reported bites. \nThe other dog, a white labrador mix, ran off and was not captured. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:54:36.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
