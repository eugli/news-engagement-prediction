(Andrew Harnik/AP)  18 PM \nPresident Trump is polling for real data on the so-called fake news media. \nOn the heels of a combative 77-minute press conference Thursday in which he scorched the press, Trump emailed supporters a “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey” rife with leading questions (“On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans?”) and a fundraising plug. \n“Do you believe that the media has been far too quick to spread false stories about our movement?” the 25-item questionnaire asks. “Do you believe that the media uses slurs rather than facts to attack conservative stances on issues like border control, religious liberties, and ObamaCare?” \nQuestion no. 14, saddled with a double negative, is downright confusing: “Do you believe that contrary to what the media says, raising taxes does not create jobs?” — Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) February 16, 2017 \nThe last question asks whether “our Party should spend more time and resources holding the mainstream media accountable.” \nUpon completion, the survey — paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee — collects respondents’ names, email addresses and zip codes. It then directs to a page urging users to “go the extra mile” with a donation. \nA Trump campaign text on Friday also fired off the media survey link to subscribers, urging them to “tell me which one you think is the worst.” A question from the “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey” issued by the President on Thursday. (gop.com) \nTwitter users circulated the link far and wide — with several sharing screenshots of their answers bolstering mainstream outlets like CNN, writing in support of the “failing New York Times,” or simply using blank survey fields to lob insults at the new administration. \n“Trump has a survey on his website about media bias. It would TERRIBLE if we all took it to balance out the results!” tweeted user Jordan Uhl. \nBy Friday afternoon, the Trump team emailed supporters asking for their “IMMEDIATE help” in rectifying the results. Trump is mad that Americans besides his supporters took that survey about the media pic.twitter.com/ZvgXvWThKL — mikayla dreyer ✨ (@mikayladreyer) February 17, 2017 \n“The President emailed you to take the urgent Mainstream Media Accountability Survey,” the message read. “Since then, mainstream media outlets have viciously attacked it… and thousands of Democrats have taken it to try to sabotage the results.” \nThe POTUS continued his tirade against the fourth estate on Friday, this time downgrading reporters to “enemy” status. \n“The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” Trump wrote.
