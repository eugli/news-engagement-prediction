(That didn't stop bank stocks from perking up on the news, however.) \nWhile it's unclear how Trump's Dodd-Frank order will play out in the specifics, a second order he signed puts in stark relief his administration's unique focus on ensuring that the financial sector can scam working Americans. \nFirst, some background. The Obama administration's Labor Department sought to implement a rule to ensure that retirement account advisers work only in the best interests of their clients, operating under what's known as a fiduciary standard. Without the rule, advisers are allowed to steer clients into riskier products that they don't necessarily need, but that will drive up the fees they have to pay. \nThe Obama White House estimated that such conflicts of interest cost Americans some $17 billion annually in unnecessary payments and other nonsense. But if there's one thing that's for certain, it's that Trump and his team care not a whit about conflicts of interest, so his second order directs his as-yet-unconfirmed labor secretary to delay and review (i.e. scrap) the new rule. \nIn this, it's evident once again what a sham Trump's populism is. These moves are dogmatic Republican ones that would look exactly the same coming from a Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney-led administration. And remember how this sort of deregulatory thinking worked out last time: with the world brought to the brink of financial implosion, necessitating huge, costly bailouts for Wall Street's worst actors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:04:54.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
