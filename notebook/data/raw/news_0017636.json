(ABC News: Nick Haggarty) \nCoalition ministers have turned on Senator Bernardi, describing his actions as \"a betrayal\", with some calling on him to resign from politics. \nThe ABC understands Mr Turnbull told the partyroom he asked Senator Bernardi why he was leaving so soon after the election, describing his response as \"not satisfactory\". \nAttorney-General George Brandis said Senator Bernardi had not acted like a conservative and had broken a promise to his electorate by leaving the party. \n\"Breaking faith with the electorate, breaking faith with the people who voted for you, breaking faith with the people who have supported you through thick and thin for years, is not a conservative thing to do,\" he said. The outspoken conservative senator has controversial views on issues like gay marriage, Islam and immigration. See where he stands here. \nDefence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne called on Senator Bernardi to resign and recontest as an independent. \nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said volunteers who worked for Senator Bernardi during the election campaign should be upset with his decision to leave the party. \n\"All the people who are in the Liberal Party who handed out his how-to-vote cards will ring him up and say, 'I handed out for the Liberal Party, I didn't hand out for the Cory Bernardi party,'\" he said. \n\"It's not your ticket to really hand over, it's sort of ours.\" \nWhen asked this morning what advice he had for Senator Bernardi, Mr Joyce said he should \"pray, pray hard\". Party members, voters 'rightly disappointed' \nIn a statement, former prime minister Tony Abbott said he was disappointed at Senator Bernardi's decision and said more should have been done to keep him in the Liberal Party. \n\"While Cory and I have sometimes disagreed, I'm disappointed that more effort has not been made to keep our party united,\" he said in a statement. \n\"Cory Bernardi has made an important contribution to our public life and I deeply regret his decision to leave the Liberal Party.\" \nLiberal MP Andrew Hastie said he considered Senator Bernardi \"a good friend\" but was disappointed he did not attend the party conference on Tuesday morning. \n\"I wish that he had attended the Liberal partyroom meeting this morning, looked us all in the eye and explained his reasons,\" he said. \n\"He was elected as a Liberal Party senator and owes his colleagues an explanation. Party members and voters will be rightly disappointed.\" More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:40:58.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
