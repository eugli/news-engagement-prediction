We have sent it to the higher officials for review. The degree of punishment will be decided on the basis of the extent of guilt,\" he said. \nHe claimed police do not forgive or shield indiscipline among them. He said compared with other years, 2016 saw fewer indisciplined activities from police.\nA total of 400 police personnel from various ranks were brought to book through departmental disciplinary measures last year, according to him. \nTwo ATN newsmen were injured after being beaten by police when they went to cover the anti-Rampal protests on Jan 26. \n\"Covering up of a crime is no solution to it. We do a lot of good deeds too. The one or two misdeeds can be overcome by counselling, changing of mindset and most importantly, by responsible behaviour,\" he said. He asked his colleagues to behave and urged the people to understand the pressure that a member of police has to cope with.\nAhead of Bangladesh Police's founding anniversary on Thursday, police officials distributed a letter from the DMP commissioner, flowers and chocolates among the people in several places of the capital on Wednesday. \nAsaduzzaman spoke to the media while distributing those at Shahbagh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:46:22.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
