Among the usual red and pink, hearts and doilies, glitter and paint, were messages in Arabic.\nMore than 150 adults and children showed up for “To Islam, With Love,” a card-making marathon at the school’s Design and Media Center.\nAdvertisement\nThe handmade pieces will be delivered to the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center in Roxbury around Valentine’s Day, along with others mailed in by people who couldn’t attend, said Tanya Nixon-Silberg, co-founder of Wee the People, which organized the event.\n“On a very visceral level, kids understand when someone’s not being nice to someone,” said Nixon-Silberg. “If kids can understand fairness, they can understand unfairness, which means they can understand injustice.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

That morning, she said, they had called the office of Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona.\nIt took a few tries, but 3-year-old Noren carefully used a clothespin to attach his card to the display. Scrawled in marker upon the red heart glued to the white doily, he explained, was a drawing of “a machine for when monkeys get hot.”\nRenato Milone and his wife, Monica Cohen, smiled as their 1 1/2-year-old daughter climbed around his shoulders like a jungle gym, blue paint smeared on her face and hands.\n“This is beautiful,” he said. “With or without Donald Trump, this should happen every day.”\nRelated Trump supporters voice their approval Boston-area Muslims absorb week of anguish, reassurance Trump blasts ruling that blocks immigration order\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fkids-make-valentines-islam-with-love%2FZJZhXeBcYU8VKofN9mO2kN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Kids", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fkids-make-valentines-islam-with-love%2FZJZhXeBcYU8VKofN9mO2kN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Kids", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fkids-make-valentines-islam-with-love%2FZJZhXeBcYU8VKofN9mO2kN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kids", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fkids-make-valentines-islam-with-love%2FZJZhXeBcYU8VKofN9mO2kN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tKids"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:45:47.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
