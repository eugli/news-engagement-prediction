Trail Blazers center Mason Plumlee guards Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:50  50 p.m. ET \nThe Nuggets and Trail Blazers are battling for the final seed in the Western Conference playoffs, but that didn’t stop them from consummating a trade on Sunday . According to The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Nuggets will trade Jusuf Nurkic and the Grizzlies’ 2017 first-round pick they owed to Portland for Mason Plumlee and a 2018 second-round pick. It’s an interesting trade that seemingly came out of nowhere for Portland — given Plumlee’s relative importance to their offense — but also seemed inevitable for the Nuggets on some level given Nurkic’s reported unhappiness levels in the Mile High City. \nHere, we’ll break down both the short and long-term implications for each team, then give a final grade for each. \nTRADE RUMORS: These 12 big men could be on the block Short-term implications, Denver \nThe Nuggets are now operating under different rules than they were before the season began. As Nikola Jokic continues to develop into a budding star and legitimate top-30 player in the league at just 21 years old, the team now must make decisions to build a contender around him. \nIn that vein, this deal makes sense. Jokic and Plumlee play relatively similar games on both ends of the floor — both for good and bad. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine the Nuggets finding a better backup center for Jokic than Plumlee if the goal was to keep things consistent on the offensive end for all 48 minutes. Jokic is currently second in the NBA in assist rate among centers at 24.4. Plumlee is fifth at 19.8. Jokic is eighth among centers in elbow touches per 36 minutes. Plumlee is 10th. Each player succeeds at operating high up the floor and fostering ball movement. \nWhile Plumlee won’t be nearly as successful at creating his own offense as Jokic is, what he can do is help to foster the development of the team’s young guards when Jokic heads to the bench. One only has to look at the impact Jokic’s presence has on Emmanuel Mudiay to tell that story. With Jokic on the floor, Mudiay’s shooting percentage at the rim goes up 13 percent (54.2 percent with Jokic to 41.5 percent without him), his true-shooting percentage jumps by 10 points (52.4 with Jokic to 42.8 without him) and his net rating goes from plus-4.3 to negative-17. Plumlee won’t have that kind of effect on his youthful teammates, but his varied skill set will enable him to act as a connector on the second unit. Plumlee is fifth in the NBA in screen assists per game at 4.8, plus he can handle the ball, move it and stay out of the paint. That’s basically the opposite of what Nurkic was doing, and it should help the slashing guards tremendously. \nMORE: Jahlil Okafor trade talks are heating up \nDefensively, it’s hard to see how this move improves Denver. Plumlee has limitations in terms of protecting the rim and moving on the perimeter. Portland sheltered him in a conservative defensive scheme that saw them mostly feed players toward the midrange and allow for contested paint-and-midrange looks. Still, it’s tough not to notice that the Blazers' defense improved by around six points per 100 possessions when he left the floor. \nBut that’s a problem the Nuggets had anyway. Nurkic wasn’t giving the team much on that end, and his open frustration with his role had to be rubbing some people the wrong way. Basically, the Nuggets are getting a better player who is also a better fit for their rotation. For Plumlee, it should be a seamless adjustment to what they want him to do. They were already the favorite to get the No. 8 seed, and this trade makes them a better team this season. Long-term implications, Denver \nThis is more questionable. The Nuggets gave up an awful lot of long-term value to trade for Plumlee, someone who profiles as a backup in the future due to the aforementioned presence of Jokic. Even if Nurkic wasn’t the right fit for them long-term and needed to be moved sooner rather than later, he is still a 22-year-old potential starting center elsewhere who could easily end up providing more surplus value than Plumlee alone in the next four years. \nThat has value around the league, and one has to wonder if the team couldn’t have gotten better value elsewhere. Even if they wouldn’t have gotten a \"better\" player, the opportunity cost of picking up a \"different\" player comes into play with asset management. Two-way or defensive wings are currently among the most valued commodities around the league due to their scarcity and the utility they can bring in terms of lineup versatility. Thus, they are difficult to acquire. With Jokic being limited defensively, they are going to become vital to the Nuggets going forward. With the center spot locked up, one has to wonder if the team could have waited and used the \"Nurkic and a first\" asset combination to see if a wing came available either before the deadline or in the offseason to set themselves up better for the future. \nPlumlee’s contract situation also raises questions for the Nuggets. The former All-American at Duke is a restricted free agent this summer. That means the Nuggets will have the ability to match any contract he’s offered, but that Plumlee also might get expensive quickly. It’s difficult to compare this season’s free agency market to last year’s if only because the number of teams that will have large amounts of cap space dwindles. But at the same time, Plumlee is a younger, better player than guys like Ian Mahinmi, Timofey Mozgov, Gorgui Dieng and his Mason's own brother, Miles Plumlee — all of whom signed deals for at least an average annual value of $13 million within the last year. \nDEVENEY: Winning ways suddenly turn Heat into deadline buyers \nIt’s easy to envision a scenario where his agent anchors a negotiation at $18 million to start for the Nuggets, then goes out and tries to solicit offers from other teams. With organizations like New Orleans and Chicago in the market for a center, as well as Brooklyn being aggressive on the restricted free agency market, it’s hard to see how Plumlee doesn’t at least command a $15 million average annual value next offseason for at least three guaranteed years. After giving up this much value, the Nuggets will have to match a deal of that nature. \nIn today’s ecosystem, with the NBA modernizing and center becoming the deepest position in the league, it doesn't make much fiscal sense for the Nuggets to pay that kind of money to a player who, under the best case scenario, profiles at 18 to 22 minutes per game behind a star in Jokic. It’s worth pointing out that the Nuggets do have a clean cap sheet, with just $58 million on the books for 2017-18 and only $13 million for 2018-19. They can afford a deal of this nature, even if they decide to pay free agent Danilo Gallinari in the offseason. \nAnd with Jokic having one more year on his deal at a paltry $1.4 million before the team will decline his fourth-year option, make him a restricted free agent and hopefully sign him to a maximum deal, the team won’t have a ton of money tied up in center next season. But that will change in 2018-19. Plumlee could be a tradeable chip depending on his salary — it’ll be a deal for his prime years of 27 through 30 — but will this team want to have upwards of $35 million tied up in defensively-questionable players at the center position starting in 2018? The Nuggets aren’t exactly a free agent destination, but opportunity cost of the use of trade assets comes into play here. It’s easier to move cheap assets than expensive ones, and again, it's fair to ask if this was the best allocation of Nurkic. \nMORE: If you want your team to trade for DeMarcus Cousins, we've got bad news... \nThe pick is also worth pointing out. The Grizzlies are currently projected to have the No. 21 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. That’s not a nothing asset, but it’s also one that has less value to the Nuggets than most teams in the league. The organization has six high-level players on rookie deals, all of its future first-round picks and a surplus of future second-rounders. The Nuggets have drafted well under Tim Connelly, and those players have often turned into successful pieces, but there are only so many rookies you can have on a playoff team. Still, the opportunity cost of moving this pick for a long-term backup center again comes into play, and you have to wonder if this pick could have been moved for something other than a soon-to-be expensive backup center. \nIn the grand scheme, I’m skeptical of a team fighting for the 8th seed with little chance of improving beyond a date with Golden State in the playoffs making a move like this, even if Plumlee will likely be in Denver for a while. I’m not sure he provides enough short-term value due to the low number of minutes he’ll be playing, and it seems even less likely he’ll provide surplus long-term value as he ages on a more expensive deal. It’s a small short-term win with the potential for a lot of long-term headaches. Overall Grade: C- Short-term implications, Portland \nThe Blazers are only one game out of the playoffs and still have one of the best backcourts in the NBA in C.J. McCollum and Damian Lillard. With those kind of singular talents, the team could make a run and get that No. 8 seed. However, it’s hard to see how this move won’t make the team worse in the immediate future. \nNurkic and Plumlee are different players, with the former Nugget being a back-to-the-basket, post-up center. Plumlee acted as a connector up the floor for the high-usage, score-first McCollum and Lillard due to the skills mentioned above. Nurkic has underrated vision as a passer, but he’s not as strong of a screener and not as mobile. He won't be as effective in a similar role. A move like this will either require coach Terry Stotts to retool the way his offense works, which will take time for the team to learn, or it will force Nurkic into a role that he hasn’t played before, which will also take time. Unlike Plumlee in Denver, this is more of a problematic short-term fit. \nMORE: Jimmy Butler would welcome Carmelo in Chicago \nScheme-wise defensively, this is a better fit for Nurkic than Denver was. As a big-bodied player with good feet but limited lateral mobility, it’s easier to see him having success inside in a conservative set up like Stotts prefers. Statistically, Nurkic has always been a disappointing rim protector — posting back-to-back 56 percent-plus defensive field goal percentages at the rim in 2015-16 and so far in 2016-17 — but he has the tools to improve. He’ll need to become better about not fouling, but with limited responsibilities on that end, it could help him take the next step. He has a near 9-foot-2 standing reach, and his girth helps to just take up space and make it more difficult for players to finish inside. Still, it will take time for him to learn the scheme and become comfortable with how his teammates operate around him. \nIf Portland’s only goal this season is to make the playoffs, it’s tough to see how this helps. My guess, though, is that the team is looking further out. Long-term implications, Portland \nA move like this is upside all the way for Portland, with the added benefit of cost savings. Nurkic is a worse player than Plumlee right now, but he could provide more value to Portland going forward than Plumlee will to Denver. As mentioned above, he gives the team a different look on defense, the side of the floor that will be essential for a team built around McCollum and Lillard going forward. The Blazers have been better since Al-Farouq Aminu returned, posting the 10th-best defensive rating in the NBA since the calendar turned to 2017. The problem has been meshing both offense and defense together, as the Blazers have just the 18th-best offense in that time. \nNurkic has potential to provide two-way play if he fits into the Blazers’ scheme well. We’ve already talked about the potential defensive fit above, but what about the offense? That’s the side of the floor where Nurkic is seen as an upside play with the potential to turn into a starter. \nFor the Blazers, he could give the team the kind of post threat it hasn’t had since LaMarcus Aldridge left for the Spurs. With natural strength, good feet and solid touch around the basket, Nurkic might become one of the best low-post players in the league at his peak. He’s also a tremendous offensive rebounder. He’s not nearly that efficient yet, but in Portland he should have a lot of room to operate due to the spacing provided by Lillard and McCollum. Whereas Plumlee succeeded in bringing his man away from the basket and screening, it’s easy to envision Nurkic at his peak commanding post double teams and allowing more space for elite perimeter jump shooters. \nMORE: Ranking the greatest players to switch teams mid-prime \nIt’s the difference between creating your own shot and forcing defensive coverages onto you rather than being a role player on offense who is reliant on other players. Nurkic is the former who also has the potential to pass and create for others, whereas Plumlee is the latter with the ability to fit into just about any scheme. Both player types have value, but creators are more difficult to find. It’s easy to see why the Blazers would take a swing on getting a true post player with question marks whose skills could work in concert with the team’s ability to shoot from the perimeter. He’s not quite as impactful as Plumlee is yet, but he’s also not far off. \nI just used a lot of words like \"could,\" \"might\" and \"potential\" when talking about Nurkic. That’s a key here. None of this is a certainty. People who have scouted Nurkic from his days in the Adriatic League, including Jon Givony of DraftExpress, have discussed how mentality and approach have always been concerns. Those haven’t gone away in Denver. In Portland, he figures to have the center position to himself, so the playing time concerns should go away. It’s on him to make off-the-floor stuff go away with it, and become the best player he can be. If he does that, this is a clear win for Portland. But the downside should be considered — he might not ever be as good as Plumlee is right now. \nThose questions are why it cost Denver a first-round pick with Nurkic to get Plumlee and a second-rounder. Portland has loaded up within this draft class and is projected to have the 11th, 21st and 27th overall picks in a strong 2017 NBA Draft. It’s always difficult to tell how deep a draft will be in February due to the potential for players staying in school. But those picks could be an important infusion of cheap talent into a team that looks to have some salary cap issues going forward. \nNBA DRAFT: Who goes No. 1 in SN's latest prospect rankings? \nAnd indeed, the cap sheet is the final key to this deal for Portland. The Blazers currently have $132 million on their cap sheet for 12 guaranteed players in the 2017-18 season. With the league informing teams that the salary cap will be around $102 million and the luxury tax threshold around $122 million, the team is about $10 million into the luxury tax for next season. Given that Portland is eight games under .500 this year, paying Plumlee around $15 million per season to push them $20 million over the tax line was a non-starter without corresponding moves. \nPlumlee’s status with the team was a headache it was going to have to figure out at some point in the next six months, either by trading him for a center or by trading other pieces and keeping him around. In trading him for Nurkic, who is under contract next season at slightly under $3 million before becoming a restricted free agent, the Blazers have found a partial antidote — a potential starting center that is considerably cheaper. Eventually they’ll have to pay Nurkic if he succeeds, but this move pushes that one year into the future and gives them time to figure out options. It's likely the team will want to find a way to move under the tax line, and this was the first step. \nOverall, it’s hard to come away feeling bad about this deal from Portland’s perspective. Given the team’s position — like the Nuggets, unlikely to move beyond the No. 8 seed and a date with an incomprehensibly good Golden State team — making a move for future value is the smart play. The downside is that Nurkic may never improve beyond his skill level at 22 years old, but his upside is also greater than that of a soon-to-be-27-year-old Plumlee. It’s a shake-up trade for the team that has the added value of bringing in a higher ceiling for the organization. \nThrow in the first-round pick and salary cap relief, and this deal is a winner for Portland. The grade is tempered by the fact that the Trail Blazers are worse today, but it’s a smart deal for them to make.
