(NYSE: UPS) has started to roll out Saturday delivery to the nation’s largest metros, the package delivery giant reported Monday at in investors conference in New York. Atlanta-based UPS will expand its U.S. delivery and pickup schedule to include six days for ground shipments. 7 photos UPS announced it tested successfully a drone that launches from the top of a UPS package… more UPS also reported it plans to boost investment in its next-generation “Smart Logistics Network,” invest aggressively in automation to drive improved performance and increase its capabilities in developed and emerging markets. “Over the next several years, you will see the most sweeping transformation of our network in its history,” said UPS Chairman and CEO David Abney , said at the conference. “We are adding more flexible capacity, more technology, more capabilities and becoming more efficient, ultimately to improve customer and shareowner value.” Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz provided the company’s 2017 outlook and updated the 2018 and 2019 financial objectives. Highlights for the 2018 and 2019 long-term financial targets Revenue growth 4 percent to 6 percent over the period Adjusted diluted earnings per share up 5 percent to 10 percent Planning $1 billion to $1.8 billion in annual share repurchases Peretz also outlined plans for capital investments of up 7 percent of revenue annually. “The strong financial hallmarks of UPS remain unchanged,” Peretz said. “We are great stewards of capital, generate strong cash from operations and have a generous shareowner distribution policy. We continue to deliver the highest operating margins in the industry. This legacy combined with our future growth prospects makes UPS a high-quality investment today, and for years to come as we build the smart logistics network.” Separately, UPS announced it tested successfully a drone that launches from the top of a UPS package car , autonomously delivers a package to a home and then returns to the vehicle while the delivery driver continues along the route to make a separate delivery. UPS conducted the test on Monday in Lithia, Fla., with Workhorse Group (NASDAQ: WKHS), an Ohio-based battery-electric truck and drone developer. Workhorse built the drone and the electric UPS package car used in the test. “This test is different than anything we’ve done with drones so far. It has implications for future deliveries, especially in rural locations where our package cars often have to travel miles to make a single delivery,” said Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering and sustainability. “Imagine a triangular delivery route where the stops are miles apart by road. Sending a drone from a package car to make just one of those deliveries can reduce costly miles driven. This is a big step toward bolstering efficiency in our network and reducing our emissions at the same time.” With ORION, UPS’s On-Road Integrated Optimization Navigation routing software, a reduction of just one mile per driver per day over one year can save UPS up to $50 million.
