But the top court had also let them off by asking the brothers to pay Rs 30 crore each, coupled with the sentence they have already undergone. \nThe verdict created uproar as Ansal brothers had individually undergone just five to six months imprisonment each. \nThey were awarded two years sentence by the trial court but the Delhi High Court by its December 19, 2008, verdict had reduced the sentence to one year. \n59 people had died of asphyxia when a fire broke out during the screening of Bollywood movie 'Border' in Uphaar theatre in Green Park area of South Delhi on June 13, 1997. \nOver 100 were also injured in the subsequent stampede.
