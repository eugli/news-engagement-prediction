There were no awkward moments on the first day where you don’t know anyone,” he says. \nLittlejohn and Naiqama have started a carpentry course at Randwick TAFE, where they spend two nights a week learning the trade as they prepare for life after footy. \nNot that working the tools is a foreign thing for the Wagga Wagga product. Jack Littlejohn is doing carpentry at TAFE.

Kevin Naiqama is attending TAFE with Jack Littlejohn. Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia \nGiven his background in the trade, Littlejohn says he has a bit of a head start at TAFE when it comes to working the tools, but the mathematical side of the course is mostly new. \n“Mondays is a lot of theory, a lot of maths, measurements and algebra,” he says. \n“On Tuesdays we’re on the tools, learning how to use the hand tools, building the little projects they set us and getting assessed.” \nWe are excited to launch our new SuperCoach NRL Diploma powered by OTEN TAFE NSW.
