Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted,\" a statement said. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mrs Trump's lawyers say the Daily Mail article caused her \"significant humiliation\" \nThe new version of the complaint, filled in New York on Friday, focused on the emotional distress of the Daily Mail report. \n\"[The] false and defamatory statements about [Mrs Trump] have caused tremendous harm to [her] personal and professional reputation and prospective economic opportunities, as well as causing her significant humiliation and emotional distress,\" it said. \nIn its retraction of the 20 August article, the Daily Mail had said it \"did not intend to state or suggest that these allegations are true, nor did it intend to state or suggest that Mrs Trump ever worked as an 'escort' or in the 'sex business'.\" \nMrs Trump had also sued a US blogger, Wester Tarpley, for making similar allegations to the Daily Mail. The case was settled after he issued an apology and agreed to pay a \"substantial sum as a settlement\", her lawyers said. \nEarlier this month, a reporter from the New York Times was reprimanded by the paper for referring to Mrs Trump as a \"hooker\". He later apologised, saying the remark was based on \"unfounded rumours\".
