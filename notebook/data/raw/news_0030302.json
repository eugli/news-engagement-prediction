She had some great workouts where we felt like it was coming, but it’s always something else when you come and do it.” Buy Photo \nThe Carmel Girls Swim Team is presented a trophy for winning the IHSAA girls swimming state finals, held at IUPUI Natatorium, Feb. 11, 2017. (Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star) \nBurchill could feel the déjà vu taking over as she streamlined out of her flip turn on the backstroke leg of Saturday’s race, catching a glimpse of Crown Point’s Hannah Kukurugya, whom she upset in the 2016 championship race. \nBut as Burchill entered her final 25 yards, the contest was no longer between her and Kukurugya. It was between her and a nearly decade-old record set by Center Grove's Michelle McKeehan in 2008 — McKeehan herself a Georgia Bulldog. \nAnd Burchill got it, by one-fifth of a second, with a time of 1 minute, 56.67 seconds. A new state record-holder. Just like her sister, Veronica, who set the new 100 butterfly record last year for Carmel before heading to Georgia as well.

Wilson (@Wilsonable07) February 11, 2017 \n“It was a little strange, I’ll admit that,” Burchill said of swimming without her sister cheering her on. “But I know she was there, texting me, FaceTiming me, all last night and today. I knew she was here in spirit and she was definitely watching, but having her not on deck, that was a first for me.” Here's the ceremonial team pool jump for @carmelathletics after extending their national streak of consecutive state titles to 31. pic.twitter.com/TtIas8zj7d — Jordan J. Wilson (@Wilsonable07) February 11, 2017 \nThe post-meet plunge with her Carmel teammates, however, was nothing new for Burchill. The Greyhounds pushed their unprecedented national-record streak to 31 straight state titles, winning eight of 11 championship races and finishing with 386.50 points. Chesterton was second with 189. \nBurchill finished a runner-up in the 100 backstroke back and contributed to relay titles in the 200 medley and 400 freestyle. Meanwhile, Emma Nordin won her third-straight state title in the 500 freestyle and touched the wall almost half a pool length ahead of the rest of the competition. \nThere was some disappointment, though, for Nordin, who also had her sights set on breaking a record — her own, set in the 2015 state preliminaries. She clocked a 4:45.32, less than one-fifth of a second off her previous record. \nNordin also won her second consecutive 200 freestyle title in addition to helping the Greyhounds to wins in both the 400 and 200 free relays, anchoring the latter. \n“It’s my senior year,” said Nordin, who is committed to Arizona State. “It’s just exciting to be closing it off like this.” \nCarmel junior Trude Rothrock, who finished second behind Nordin in the 200 free, won the 100 butterfly (52.97) while sophomore Kelly Pash won the 100 freestyle (49.41) \nThe only non-Carmel local individual winner was Hamilton Heights senior diver Ivy Houser, who won the 1-meter diving championship, beating out Homestead, Northridge and Fishers divers.

(Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star) \nIt’s not every day someone wins a state title. But even less often can the winners say they trumped the time of an Olympic gold medalist. \nNevertheless, 15-year-old Emily Weiss of Yorktown managed to do both when she clocked a 59.37 in the 100 breaststroke and broke Lilly King’s record set two years earlier in the 2015 preliminaries. Weiss, a sophomore, is now a two-time title winner in the event, and seems poised for more in the years to come. \nIU’s King tweeted about Weiss’ swim shortly after the news circulated around Twitter and said she “wouldn’t expect anyone else to break (her) record.” Killer swim @Swimmin_weiss2 ! Wouldn't expect anyone else to break that record😏 #shebreaksmyrecords #always https://t.co/hEyh0v8br4 — Lilly King (@_king_lil) February 11, 2017 Fishers' Parrish wins Mental Attitude Award \nFishers swimmer Lauryn Parrish, who finished third in the 200 freestyle, was named the Mental Attitude Award winner.
