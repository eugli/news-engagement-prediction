It’s time for the United States to restore dignity in its relationship with Pakistan,” he said in the opinion piece published in The Hill. \n“The United States should be prepared to add more penalties if necessary,” he said. \n“These actions will not compel Pakistan to turn against the Afghan Taliban,” he added. \nKolenda is currently an adjunct senior fellow at CNAS and a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy.

This way, no regional actor controls Afghanistan, and Afghan officials are less prone to play regional powers against the one another,” he argued. \nThe former Pentagon official recommended that America should also consider a “peace dividend” for Pakistan once Afghanistan achieves sustainable peace. \n“This could include resumption of aid and assistance and consideration for a civil-nuclear agreement,” Kolenda said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:54:39.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
