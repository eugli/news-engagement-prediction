While at Swift’s star-studded Fourth of July party , Hiddleston was photographed wearing a white tank top emblazoned with the words “I ❤️ T.S.” \n“The truth is, it was the Fourth of July and a public holiday and we were playing a game and I slipped and hurt my back. And I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, ‘Does anyone have a T-shirt?’ And one of her friends said, “I’ve got this,'” Hiddleston told GQ. \nHe also admitted that, though the shirt was just “a joke among friends,” he was still surprised to see the validity of his relationship with Swift being questioned. \n“I have to be so psychologically strong about not letting other people’s interpretations about my life affect my life. A relationship exists between two people. We will always know what it was,” he said. \nHiddleston added, “The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context. Nobody had the context for that story. And I’m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding. So the hardest thing is that that was a joke among friends on the Fourth of July.” Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:50:59.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
