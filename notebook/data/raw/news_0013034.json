Other major firms include Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Twitter and Microsoft. \n“Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists and philanthropists,” the letter states. “The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children — to pursue the ‘American Dream’ — are woven throughout the social political and economic fabric of the Nation.” \nThe legal brief supports a lawsuit filed by Washington state and joined by Minnesota last Friday, which on Friday won a temporary nationwide restraining order against Trump’s executive order. \nOver the weekend, Trump repeatedly took to Twitter to blast the judge who issued the order, calling it “ ridiculous .” Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \nMusk, one of nearly 20 business leaders advising Trump, voiced immediate opposition to the order targeting Muslims , as HuffPost previously reported. The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 \nOver the weekend, Musk took to Twitter to defend both the U.S. legal system and those engaging with Trump on important issues. Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2017 Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good? \nIn addition to the tech community, national security veterans and several state governments have spoken out against the ban, which has triggered protests across the nation . \nCristian Farias and Mary Papenfuss contributed reporting.
