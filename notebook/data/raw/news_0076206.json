futuristic new headquarters referred to as the 'flying spaceship' (Photo: Getty) However, the wording of the WSJ report suggests that USB-C will be included in the phone's charging cables rather than in the actual handset.\nThis would involve swapping the USB-A connector of the end of the iPhone's charging cable with a USB-C connector, as Apple has already done on its latest MacBooks.\n\"This would make sense, allowing users who buy the new iPhone to charge it from their new MacBook using the cable that comes in the box,\" says James Vincent, reporting for The Verge .\nRead More Mobile World Congress 2017: The biggest announcements from this year's smartphone mega-show A visitor tries out an Apple iPhone 7 (Photo: Getty) The WSJ report also states that there will be three new iPhones this year, including a premium model designed to celebration the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.\nBacking up several rumours that have previously circulated about the incoming handsets, the report also says that one of the phones will sport a curved screen, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\nIt was also reported that Apple will ditch the physical home button on one of the three expected devices in favour of a 'function area' beneath the display.\nThe iPhone 8 , iPhone 8 Plus and a special edition handset are expected to be announced in September.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next Apple bring a 30 year old Mac SE back to life Watch this video again Watch Next The one mistake everyone makes when trying to cle 0:41 Gorgeous Emma Watson stars on cover of Vanity fai 4:47 Tragic scenes at Gulf Shores Mardis Gras as car p 1:02 Dad dangles son over huge ravine 'to teach him ma 0:49 Families of the Tunisia terror attack victims say 1:51 GMB: Piers has yet another dig at 'incredibly irr 0:38 Edelmira Barreira, Spain's 'SEX TSAR' talks of de 0:44 Kate Middleton sparkles in shawl as Queen celebra 0:35 HAS IAN BRADY'S SHOTGUN JUST BEEN FOUND ON SADDLE 1:19 Pair jailed for waving confederate flags at black 0:37 Chrissy Teigen teases John Legend over lack of Os 0:19 Video will play in Here's how to access the iPhone's hidden magnifying glass feature Share this video Watch Next @MirrorTech Apple MacBook iPhone iPhone 8 iPhone 7", "external_links": ["http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14760400/iphone-8-2017-rumors-usb-c-lightning", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2374/4221396001_5340867575001_5340858320001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3710/4221396001_5341422792001_5341397319001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3190/4221396001_5341473463001_5341467442001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/34/4221396001_5325392691001_5325390451001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/718/4221396001_5339914341001_5339860285001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/648/4221396001_5331307838001_5331288312001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1818/4221396001_5339739463001_5339735084001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/914/4221396001_5339796191001_5339788241001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorTech", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2670/4221396001_5341378148001_5341373701001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/1712/4221396001_5296446345001_5296452732001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-next-iphone-will-have-a-curved-screen-1488260583", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3854/4221396001_5341589176001_5341534677001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2682/4221396001_5339820055001_5339820208001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1426/4221396001_5339933131001_5339894197001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-28T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:30:30.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
