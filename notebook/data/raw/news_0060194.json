The four band members went their separate ways — none of them even lives in Chicago anymore. But here they are back again, getting ready to play their first show in 24 years at Metro.\n\"We'd been asked to play reunions over the years, but we always said 'no,'\" says Lilacs co-founder Ken Kurson, now considerably more well-known in his second life as a conservative political consultant and journalist who is editor of the Observer, the New York weekly formerly owned by Donald Trump 's son-in-law, Jared Kushner . Kurson thought he left the rock life behind for good, but got drawn back into it after a recent divorce.\n\"I realized that whatever I was doing in my life wasn't working, so I started saying 'yes' to things I used to say 'no' to,\" he says. When Metro called about doing a 25th anniversary show to mark the release of the quartet's sole album, the Brad Wood-produced \"The Lilacs Rise Above the Filth,\" Kurson reached out to his old bandmates, who were now scattered around the country: guitarist David Levinsky, bassist Tom Whalen and drummer Art Kim.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\n\"We weren't a band put together with an ad in the Reader looking for random jerk----,\" Kurson says. \"We were a band of friends, and so it had to be total buy-in (for the reunion) from the whole gang. None of them are working as a musician anymore. They have families and lives of their own. But as soon I emailed them, they were 100 percent in.\"\nKurson was among the musicians who made Chicago indie rock such a vibrant and fractious world in the late '80s and early '90s. As the teenage bassist in Green, Kurson collaborated with one of the city's most gifted artists, Jeff Lescher. Kurson was frustrated that Lescher never got his due as a singer and songwriter, and was disappointed that the band couldn't match the brilliance of its recordings (\"Elaine McKenzie,\" \"White Soul\") on stage. With the Lilacs, he vowed to cut against the grain of what he saw as Chicago indie-rock's self-imposed insularity.\n\"I hated what I saw happening in Chicago, the embryonic Wicker Park a--hole,\" he says. \"Guys who come from Arlington Heights with their angry looks and greasy hair, looking tough. Give me a break. I hated the bull---- pretense. I value bands like the Beach Boys and Ramones, bands that celebrated the simplicity and joy of music, instead of being depressed.\"\nIn three short years, the Lilacs made some inroads with their melodic, buzzing pop-rock songs and were starting to draw interest from major labels. But the then-23-year-old Kurson felt like life was passing him by.\n\"I felt an ambition and drive to make a name for myself in the adult world,\" he says. On the eve of a headlining show at a North Side club in 1993 he called Levinsky and said he was leaving for New York. \"When?\" Levinsky asked. \"Now,\" Kurson replied before hopping into a borrowed Honda with all his belongings.\nKurson aspired to become a writer and journalist. He started from scratch in New York, and went on to co-author former Mayor Rudy Giuliani's best-selling autobiography. His tenure as editor of the Observer has not been without controversy. \"When I got the editor's job I got the same feeling when Jeff Lescher called me to join Green,\" he says. \"It's been an exceptionally weird and challenging year to be running a paper (formerly) owned by the son-in-law of this divisive candidate.\"\nKurson acknowledges that his support of Trump makes him somewhat of a lone wolf among his past and present indie-rock brethren, but he's not apologizing for it. \"I feel it's almost exactly how I felt in the Chicago rock scene,\" he says. \"I wanted to do these really open-wound, vulnerable pop masterpieces at a time when grunge and total heaviosity was the thing. I always liked to be doing something that gives smart people fits. On those rare occasions when I'm feeling the same way the mainstream culture is thinking, I get scared.\"\nBecause of his other responsibilities, Kurson says the Lilacs reunion will likely be a one-off. But he's not shutting the door on future projects because the music he and his bandmates played a quarter-century ago still resonates.\n\"Every song of mine on our album was about this brutal breakup I had gone through with my first love,\" he says. \"So now returning to Chicago after this wrenching divorce I just had, these songs make a lot of sense. Five years ago, I wouldn't have related as much to this guy who was in such pain, who wrote 'Hop in the Stanza' or 'I Won't Forget.' I'm a dad now, a divorced dude with big-league responsibilities. I have a highly scrutinized life, but the elemental pain of falling out of love and having someone fall out of love with you, that's still real for me. … These songs have been there for me when I needed them.\"\nGreg Kot co-hosts \"Sound Opinions\" at 8 p.m. Friday and 2 and 11 p.m. Saturday on WBEZ-FM 91.5.\nGreg Kot is a Tribune critic.\ngreg@gregkot.com\nTwitter @gregkot\nWhen : 6 p.m. March 4\nWhere : Metro, 3730 N.
