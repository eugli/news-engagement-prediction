Just look at the last 24 hours: Trump appeared to criticize the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel hearing the dispute over his travel ban: \"I don't want to ever call a court biased, so I won't and we haven't had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would read a statement to do what's right.\" He went after Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's clothing line: \"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\" He -- once again -- attacked the news media: \"[The American people] have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent. And don't let anyone ever tell you different,\" Trump told an audience of police chiefs and sheriffs. \"Don't let the dishonest media try and convince you that it's different than that, because it's not.\" His press secretary took a shot at John McCain for calling the U.S. military raid in Yemen unsuccessful: \"Anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and a disservice to the life of Chief Owens.\" When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker if that was the same message to McCain, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded, \"That's my message to anybody who says that.\" And this morning, Trump went after Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) for relaying that Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch said Trump's attacks on the judiciary were \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing\": \"Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" (In fact, per NBC's Frank Thorp, a spokesman for Gorsuch said he did use the words \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\") \nBut where's the governing? \nYet as Trump picks fights with these different entities -- Democrats, Republicans, businesses -- it's worth reminding everyone what his administration HAS NOT accomplished. New Attorney General Jeff Sessions became just the eighth member of Trump's team to win Senate confirmation, versus 26 for Barack Obama at this same point in time in 2009. More importantly, outside of his executive actions, Trump hasn't made progress on his big-ticket agenda items (Obamacare repeal and replace, tax relief, paying for that border wall). By contrast, Congress passed Obama's economic stimulus on Feb. 13, 2009, and he also signed the Lilly Ledbetter bill on Jan. 29 and SCHIP expansion on Feb. 4. George W. Bush sent his tax-cut proposal to Capitol Hill on Feb. 8, 2001. Bill Clinton gave his address on health-care reform (and named his wife's controversial role on it) on Jan. 25, 1993. George H.W. Bush formally sent his budget to Congress on Feb. 9, 1989. And Ronald Reagan signed his first legislation -- to raise the debt limit, of all things! -- on Feb. 7, 1981. Just asking, but if Trump simply stopped tweeting, you could make a case that his approval ratings would be closer to 50% than 40%. \n\"There no consensus\" on GOP efforts to replace Obamacare \nAs for the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Politico writes that Republicans are struggling with several different health-care fixes. \"Republican leaders want to get their Obamacare repeal effort back on track. There's a big problem, though: They're neck-deep in competing plans to replace the law. Nearly a half-dozen plans have been introduced or are coming â€” none with the broad support needed to get through Congress and win over the public. And that's making it far more difficult to repeal a law the GOP has spent six years trying to kill. 'There's no consensus,' said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). From my vantage point, there isn't a consolidation around a particular thought yet.' There's no agreement on how much of Obamacare can be replaced through the budget reconciliation process in the Senate and only the murkiest of timelines when it comes to scrapping the law. The GOP wants to find a proposal that the whole party can get behind, but for now there are merely disparate ideas and warring factions fighting for attention.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:15:57.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
