Rutgers Presbyterian’s refugee task force put a typical New York spin on the crisis, turning to its high-placed contacts and deep pocket of donations to see if it could bring the family into the country despite the ban on refugees.

Someone had a number for Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, but then learned that to go to Canada, the family would have to start the three-year application process again. “They are so tenacious,” said Kate Rice, a member of B’nai Jeshurun synagogue on the Upper West Side, who joined the Rutgers multifaith coalition. “Behind this mild-mannered facade, they’re a bunch of wild and crazy Presbyterians,” she added, laughing. Ultimately, their furious scrambling did not reopen the window for the family to arrive. The federal courts did. Even then, it was a precariously narrow window. Since last spring, when Rutgers Presbyterian brought over its first Syrian family without a hitch, the church had been wanting to sponsor another with Church World Service , which is one of the nine resettlement agencies working with the State Department. Motivated by Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to limit the flow of refugees, the church’s task force grew to more than 40 people and raised more than $50,000. On Jan. 6, the volunteers were given the family’s name and original arrival date: Jan. 30. Church World Service’s office in Jersey City arranged to rent an apartment. Typically, it administers the expenses allocated for each family member by the State Department’s refugee resettlement office, and is responsible for making social services appointments.

This refugee cause seemed different. It had a deadline. On Jan. 22, about a dozen volunteers cleaned the apartment that the agency had rented for the family in Union City, N.J. “The first Saturday we were elated, so excited this was happening,” said Nancy Muirhead, the chairwoman of the church’s Refugee Task Force. Ms. Muirhead’s 94-year-old mother, Connie, scrubbed the sink and the stove. “We knew that an executive order would be coming and we thought we’d get the family in under the wire,” said Dave Mammen, the church administrator coordinating the refugee task force. Not quite: Five days later came Mr. Trump’s order. Needing to keep busy, 13 task force members went to the apartment anyway to unpack dishes and set up beds. The church’s handyman came to fix closet doors and hang a coat rack. On Monday, the day the family was supposed to arrive, Mr. Mammen went to the apartment to sign for the last item to be delivered: a mattress for a twin bed.

The kitchen was stocked with utensils, towels and crockpots, as well as the dishes; the living room was decorated with small paintings; and the dresser drawers were full of socks and shirts. Mr. Mammen was overcome by an abundance of emptiness. “It was very lonely and desolate,” he said. Still, he said, “We also felt that our emotions were not important — it was how the family was dealing with it.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
