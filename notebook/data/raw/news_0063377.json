On Tuesday, Tarek appeared on The Today Show to give his account on what happened last May when he left the couple’s California home with a gun, leading 11 police cars and a helicopter to show up. “There’s mountain lions, bobcats, and rattlesnakes, and big wildlife, I went out for a hike to scout some trails, it wasn’t even a big deal, I didn’t understand, it got really blown out of proportion,” he tells Today , adding that contrary to reports of a suicide attempt, he was not suicidal that day. “No, no, never. Absolutely never.”\nOn #set today with my #loves!!:I love creating #memories on camera together.. many many #years from now we will sit with our #grandkids and binge watch #fliporflop!! So #lucky to do what we do! Just LOVE them❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\nA post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:11pm PST\n© Getty Tarek also revealed for the first time that weeks after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2013 (after a viewer noticed a lump on a Flip or Flop episode), he also learned he had testicular cancer. “I literally thought I was going to die,” he said on Tuesday morning. Both cancers are now in remission, and Tarek says he’s only coming forward with his testicular cancer diagnosis because his stepfather currently has it and he wants to raise awareness. “I know that when I came out with thyroid cancer, a lot of people also found out they had thyroid cancer. I felt like it’s something I had to do.”\nWATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Christina El Moussa, for the first time, speaks out LIVE about her life, her show and what lies ahead pic.twitter.com/Mqnq20irbN\n- Good Morning America (@GMA) February 21, 2017 Meanwhile, Christina opened up to Good Morning America about her current relationship with Tarek and how their divorce will affect the future of Flip or Flop . HGTV fans should rest easy: everything on the show is business as usual. “Tarek and I are filming season seven. We film three or four days a week, we have a great crew, we have so much fun on the set,” she told Michael Strahan. “We look forward to continuing with the show.” Things are also far from awkward on set, she explained, since the former couple met through work. “It’s our normal. We also run a seminar company together - Success Path - and every five weeks we go to Vegas together. We’re on stage. We have a great time. We’ll always be working together.”\nI've never met a group of more positive, fun-loving, funny... all around amazing guys... filming 7 seasons of #FlipOrFlop has been a breeze because of them. I ❤️ each and every one of you. @hgtv\nA post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Feb 15, 2017 at 2:56pm PST\nChristina also spoke to People for a cover story in its latest issue, out Friday. According to the HGTV star, Tarek’s thyroid cancer battle, Christina’s 2014 miscarriage and the pressures to return to work after welcoming their second child Brayden in 2015 became too much for the couple. “I was overwhelmed. The tension between me and Tarek was high… We weren’t able to properly communicate anymore,” she tells the magazine, adding that they eventually reached a point where they couldn’t even drive to the Flip or Flop set in the same car.\nChristina and Tarek announced their split on Dec. 12 after seven years of marriage. According to Christina, the couple’s separation process began “long before people actually separate.” She tells People that by the time they made things official, “weight was lifted off me.” Tarek filed for divorce on Jan. 9.\n8 Silent Signs of Testicular Cancer You Should Never Ignore Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://people.com/tv/flip-or-flop-christina-el-moussa-divorce/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA86h7b.img", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQoQYVkgg-w/", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f05%2fen-us%2fAAnbugt%3focid%3dsl&title=%E2%80%98Flip+or+Flop%E2%80%99+Star+Shares+His+Battle+With+Testicular+Cancer&source=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f05%2fen-us%2fAAnbugt%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1u9eh.img", "https://t.co/Mqnq20irbN", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/e26aed15-9aa2-4ff9-8e08-a3100a4302e9/410fecf6-c340-46a5-955a-284952b7df2b.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbugt?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbugt?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "https://twitter.com/GMA/status/834031359530201088", "http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/flip-flop-star-christina-el-moussa-speaks-split/story?id=45617708", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbugt?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://www.today.com/video/-flip-or-flop-star-tarek-el-moussa-speaks-about-his-split-from-wife-881525827680", "http://api.wochit.com/api/?partnerID=f421a246974545c6e1fb724595053584efa8cc05492e9685c8c2ea4e90f3768d&action=MRSS&topicName=General&descendants=true&quot;}", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a8490807/flip-or-flop-tarek-christina-el-moussa-split/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;‘Flip", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbugt?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbugt?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/e26aed15-", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQjL7srhnBg/", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnbrDG.img&quot;}}", "http://www.rd.com/health/conditions/signs-cancer-men/1/&quot;", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBhb5Hu.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f05%2fen-us%2fAAnbugt%3focid%3dst&text=%E2%80%98Flip+or+Flop%E2%80%99+Star+Shares+His+Battle+With+Testicular+Cancer&original_referer=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f05%2fen-us%2fAAnbugt%3focid%3dst", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f05%2fen-us%2fAAnbugt&lang=en-us&flow_id=39814af4-566f-48d7-8a37-615420858f6c"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:15:10.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
