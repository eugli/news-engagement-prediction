Outside of a rough 2013, Hamlin has finished 12 th or better in the points standings in every season with four top-five finishes. \nCheck out what Hamlin needs to do in 2017 to finally close the deal with a championship: Getty Images Getty Images 5 Do what you do, Denny \nFor 90 percent of the season, Hamlin has it figured out. He’s made deep runs in the playoffs consistently but hasn’t closed it out yet in his 11-year Cup career. \nThe first goal is to take care of the opening part of the season, get some good finishes, visit Victory Lane a few times and start to set up for a championship push. Getty Images Matt Sullivan 4 Slow down in the pits \nEvery three weeks last year Denny Hamlin told someone he was going to stop speeding on pit road and then he got another speeding penalty. The last thing Hamlin fans want to hear in 2017 is Mike Joy say, “No. 11 car, too fast on pit road”. \nIf you can’t completely eliminate the pit road penalties, let’s at least keep it in single digits in 2017, Denny. Getty Images Tom Pennington 3 Rack up playoff points \nThe best way for Hamlin to change his so-called “bad luck” in the playoffs will be to build an insurmountable lead that will essentially lock him into the Championship 4 at Homestead. With two buckets to fill for the season, Hamlin needs to focus on that playoff bucket by winning stages and races, then getting the highest points finish he can for a nice bonus heading into the playoffs. 2 Be the best at JGR \nOutside of seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson, Hamlin’s stiffest competition likely comes from his fellow Toyota teammates at Joe Gibbs Racing. If Hamlin can prove to be the best car in the Toyota camp, then he’ll take a big step toward winning his first Monster Energy Cup Series championship. Getty Images Jonathan Ferrey 1 Homestead or bust \nIt’s all about a championship in 2017 for Hamlin. He’s come so close year after year since his spectacular rookie season in 2006. He’s only a few years away from cementing his case over Mark Martin as the best driver to never win a championship. \nIf Hamlin doesn’t get a championship soon, the door will likely close. It isn’t his fault that Jimmie Johnson made history during his career and other dominant drivers like Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski have been the guys to grab the title when Johnson doesn’t. \nAnother fourth-place points finish doesn’t add anything to Hamlin’s legacy. It’s championship or bust for the driver of the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota in 2017.
