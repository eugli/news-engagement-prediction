Here's how the 2017 classes shook out. \nNational Signing Day is wrapping up for 2017, so it's time to look at superlatives across the Southeastern Conference. Best Class \nTypically this would be a fill-in-the-blank style paragraph. Just pull up the blurb from the previous six years and change the names and you've got Alabama: the nth straight No. 1 recruiting class under Nick Saban . This year n=7. But this isn't just another recruiting class. It's Nick Saban's best. Amid all those freakish classes that went on to contend for national titles and fill up NFL draft boards, none had a higher team ranking than this group. It's loaded at wide receiver, it has a franchise quarterback, it has maybe the best running back Saban has ever recruited and it's typically loaded on both sides of the line of scrimmage. This Tide keeps rolling. Surprise Class \nAnyone that follows Will Muschamp's career shouldn't be surprised at his success in his first full cycle as South Carolina's head coach. Anyone that paid attention to his assistant coaching hires shouldn't be surprised, either. Muschamp and his boys can recruit. But because the Gamecocks finished 6-7 in a weak SEC East and are about to finish the 2017 cycle as a Top 25 recruiting class, we'll qualify this one as a surprise. Sleeper Class \nSigning Day came and went and I barely breathed a word about Texas A&M. That's because there wasn't any drama, wasn't much news but when the dust settled, Kevin Sumlin has the No. 12 class in the country. It loses a bunch of wide receivers and has landed a bunch of receivers that are instant impact guys. It's got a quarterback that can compete to play. It's a class with depth across several positions. This is a good enough of a crew to keep A&M in contention in the West. Best Recruiting Win: K'Lavon Chaisson, LSU \nLSU will get beaten up some because Alabama had a lot of success in Louisiana this cycle but Ed Orgeron can pound his chest about what he's done in some other hostile territories and none were bigger than Chaisson. He's an Arden Key clone and he was the crown jewel of Texas' class even to the extent that he was rumored to be a silent commit just weeks ago. LSU closed on him though and gets the nation's fastest edge rusher. Best recruit: Trey Smith \nWe've got guys ranked higher than Smith at 247Sports but I'm going to roll with him in this spot because of how impactful he can be in Knoxville. Smith is physically ready to be a true freshman starter. He appears to be emotionally ready and has the right maturity level to be that guy as well. Smith will fight you on the inside but has the athleticism to protect the edge. He's the bell cow of this Tennessee recruiting class and should help that locker room immediately. Sleeper Recruit: Lynn Bowden , Kentucky \nThis kid just might be the best player in the SEC before his career is over. That's the kind of upside we're talking about with Bowden. He had a relatively low profile recruitment for a kid of his talent level but now that he's at Kentucky, the rest of the SEC is about to know his name really quickly. He could play wildcat quarterback, running back, receiver or defensive back. I wouldn't be surprised if he plays a little bit of all of them. Bowden may be the best player in the Bluegrass since Randall Cobb .
