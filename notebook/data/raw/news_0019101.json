If I understand correctly,\" Peskov said. \"As for the rest, the information is incorrect,\" he added. Eavesdropping Read More Law enforcement and intelligence officials told CNN last month that calls between Flynn and Kislyak were being scrutinized by investigators as part of a broader counterintelligence investigation of Russian activities in the US.
