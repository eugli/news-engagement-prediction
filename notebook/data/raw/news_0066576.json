President Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, left, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus prepare to speak Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. (Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA) Greg Miller, Adam Entous The Washington Post \nThe Trump administration has enlisted senior members of the intelligence community and Congress in efforts to counter news stories about Trump associates' ties to Russia, a politically charged issue that has been under investigation by the FBI as well as lawmakers now defending the White House. \nActing at the behest of the White House, the officials made calls to news organizations last week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives, U.S. officials said. \nThe calls were orchestrated by the White House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories on the alleged contacts with Russia. \nThe White House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not - participate in White House-arranged calls with news organizations, including The Washington Post. \nThe White House insisted the officials speak on the condition of anonymity - a practice President Trump has condemned. \nThe officials broadly dismissed Trump associates' contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential. But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue, and their comments were not published by The Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhere. \nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe decision to involve those officials could be perceived as threatening the independence of U.S. spy agencies that are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues, as well as undercutting the credibility of ongoing congressional probes. Those officials saw their involvement as an attempt to correct coverage they believed to be erroneous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:37:05.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
