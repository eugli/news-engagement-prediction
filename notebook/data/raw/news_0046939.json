The chemical, called phenanthrene, is found in crude oil and enters the environment through car engine combustion as well as oil spills. Scientists from the University of Manchester and Stanford University studied the heart cells of pelagic fish, such as tuna and mackerel, that live in the Gulf of Mexico. Fish affected by the oil spill suffer from a range of physiological abnormalities. A normal yellowfin tuna larva not long after hatching (top) and a larva exposed to Deepwater Horizon crude oil during embryonic development (bottom) DEEPWATER HORIZON The rig blew on April 20, 2010, and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf through the summer. Scientists are still trying to figure where all the oil went and what effects it had. BP was suspended from performing any new government work in America in November 2012, after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a $4.5billion fine (Â£2.8billion) for criminal charges over the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The team discovered traces of phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that is released from oil. Phenanthrene is known to negatively affect the strength and rhythm of the heart in all vertebrates, including humans. The use of oil and its derivatives, in particular in car engine combustion, has been a cause of concern for some time, with high levels of air pollutants measured in urban areas around the world, including in the UK. Dr Shiels said: 'Very little information to date has been available on individual PAH chemical toxicity beyond developmental and carcinogen effects. 'As a result we hope that this study will raise global interest in this important pollutant, given the prevalence of petroleum and PAHs in our environment.' The research was published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.
