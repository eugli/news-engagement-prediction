The videos, pictures submitted by residents all show red junglefowl. There was a documentary on the Sin Ming red junglefowl. \nCommon sense tells us that a desk bound white collar civil servant isn't going to go catch chickens and kill them. The contractor they hired probably can't tell the difference between a junglefowl and a chicken. Somebody needs to be held responsible. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
