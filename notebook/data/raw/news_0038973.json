Sarah Lyall recently wrote in The Times: Photo \n“Norse Mythology” is a playful retelling of ancient northern stories about the creation of the world and other pressing matters featuring Odin; Thor, the not-so-bright god with the hammer; and Loki, the god who makes all the trouble. \nIt’s of a piece with what Mr. Gaiman likes to do: find something he thinks is interesting and see where it leads him. His work reflects his restless spirit, encompassing science fiction, fantasy, fairy tales, children’s books, adult books, comic books, screenplays, short stories, essays and poetry. His best-known books include “Neverwhere,” an urban fantasy about a place beneath London for those who fall through the cracks of the regular city; and the deliciously creepy “Coraline,” a children’s book about a girl who stumbles upon what seems to be, but is not, an ideal alternative family. On this week’s podcast, Gaiman discusses “Norse Mythology”; Sarah Lyall talks about Ali Smith’s “Autumn” ; Nick Bilton on two new books about Silicon Valley ; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Gregory Cowles and John Williams on what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host. Here are the books mentioned in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:01:52.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
