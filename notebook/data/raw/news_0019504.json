From Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Batman and Terms of Endearment , the man has left an impressive mark on the movie world over his six decade-long acting career. However, since 2010, Nicholson hasn't appeared in a single movie, lastbeing seen in 2010's How Do You Know . Fortunately for fans of the actor , that hiatus is about to come to an end, as Nicholson has just boarded an upcoming remake of a foreign film that's been earning a lot of accolades in recent months. \nAccording to Variety , Jack Nicholson has been cast in the English-language remake of the German comedy-drama Toni Erdmann . Paramount has apparently secured the rights to the movie, and Nicholson will play the lead character in this new version, while Kristen Wiig has reportedly been cast as the man's daughter. The studio is still looking for a director and writer, but there already a lot of producers attached, including The Big Short 's Adam McKay, Will Ferrell and original Toni Erdmann writer and director Maren Ade. \nFirst shown at least year's Cannes Film Festival and later released in Germany last July, Toni Erdmann followed an older man named Winfried Conradi, who has a penchant for practical jokes and creating weird alternate personas, trying to reconnect with his daughter, Ines, who has moved to Bucharest, Romania to pursue a business consulting career. In order to get close to her, Winfried creates a new alter-ego: Toni Erdmann, who becomes a life coach for Ines' CEO. Now screening in certain areas of the United States, Toni Erdmann has earned and been nominated for numerous awards, which includes winning five European Film Awards, as well as being nominated for a BAFTA and Golden Globe. Later this month, it will go up against Land of Mine , A Man Called Ove , The Salesman and Tanna in this year's Academy Awards ' Best Foreign Language Film category. \nFor most of his acting career, Jack Nicholson has kept himself busy, but after co-starring alongside Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon in How Do You Know , Nicholson hasn't appeared in a movie since then. While there were reports indicating that he had retired from acting due to memory issues , he later said in 2013 that he simply wasn't as interested in taking projects anymore. Fortunately, he's finally found something that's piqued his interest, as the Variety report said that Nicholson approached Paramount's Brad Grey with the idea for a remake after enjoying the original. It's worth noting that Nicholson hasn't been entirely absent from public life, as he co-presented the 2013 Academy Award for Best Picture with First Lady Michelle Obama and appeared during Saturday Night Live 's 40th anniversary special in 2015. \nWe'll be sure to keep you updated on Jack Nicholson's Toni Erdmann remake as more news comes in, but let us know how you feel about the actor's return in the comments below.
