An unfortunate incident “like Americans shooting down some Russian plane in Syria” or vice-versa, Trump will inevitably be dragged into what Szamuely called a continuation of the “Bush-Obama cold war” with Russia. Read more ‘When Trump won, Ukraine’s Poroshenko put himself in pretty bad position’ \n“It will be hard for him to resist an essentially new continuation of the Bush-Obama cold war,” Szamuely theorizes, taking into account the belligerent rhetoric of some of the GOP senior members, notably Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham. \n“The Republican party, it’s in its DNA, a kind of rabid Russophobia, a deep anxiety about Russia and an eagerness to start some kind of a confrontation with Russia,” the researcher said, pointing out that the recent escalation of the situation in Ukraine “directly flows from the visit made by McCain, by Lindsey Graham over the New Year in which they pretty much encouraged Ukraine to launch an offensive.” \nWhile Trump is not eager to inflame tension with Russia, Szamuely suggests he “clearly does not want to do anything that would seem that he is doing Russia’s bidding,” giving the amount of speculation around his alleged ties to Putin and his portrayal in the mainstream media as a “Russian agent.” \n“He is just hoping that somehow things blow over and he could maybe start carving out his own distinctive foreign policy,” the researcher said.
