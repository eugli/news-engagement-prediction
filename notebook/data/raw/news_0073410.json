Both these banks recorded outstanding growths in their advances, net interest income (NII) and earnings over the next six years, clocking in compounded growth rate anywhere between 34% and 46% for these parameters. \n\n\nIn its business strategy called 'RBL Vision 2020', RBL Bank has laid down some impressive milestones it would like to achieve in the period including 30-35% CAGR for advances, 3% to 4% improvement in CASA (current account and savings account) ratio, better operational efficiency with cost to income ratio in the range of 51-52%, and return on asset of about 1.5%. \n\nThe 'old' private bank is already on track to achieve some of these targets with cost to income ratio and CASA ratio standing at 53.3% and 23.2% as of the December quarter. While it is reporting a strong loan book growth of more than 40% in the last three quarters albeit on a small base, given the opportunities it is chasing in its five business verticals across wholesale and non-wholesale businesses, it is likely to maintain a 30%-plus growth trajectory in the loan book. \n\nIts retail business strategy is different with focus on agriculture, micro finance, and secured small business loans instead of traditional home or vehicle finance retail products. While with this strategy it avoids a direct competition with some of the established private sector banks, micro finance players and small finance banks are the direct competitors. \n\nIts branch light model -the bank also relies on analytics and technology to expand through business correspondents (BC) and customer service points (CMPs) -while augments its reach, could af fect its growth trajectory in case of an execution mistake. \n\nThe bank will also have to maintain its focus on improving its geographical reach with 40% of the current business coming from the Western region. \n\nDespite the strong growth trajectory, while the bank has maintained strong asset quality over the last four financial years, investors need to closely watch some of the asset quality pointers. There has been a steady increase in the gross NPA in the commercial business segment in FY17 and at 3.29% the GNPA ratio remains relatively higher than other segments. \n\nThe concentration towards generally troubled construction and real estate sectors (11% of total exposure) is also a risk although, as per RBL, these are below the internally set sectoral limits and thus comfortable levels. \n\nWhile closet to 30% of its rated exposure is below investment grade, the management is confident of its underwritings standards and is satisfied with the credit cost of its wholesale segment through which it provides working capital loans and trade and transaction services to corporates.
