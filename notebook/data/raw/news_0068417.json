'World will carry on' \nMs Espinosa said it would be more damaging for the US to leave the on-going climate talks process altogether than to stop funding the clean energy programme.

That’s why I’m looking forwards to engaging with the US as a partner.” \nShe did not explain how the US would be able to remain within the Paris framework whilst scrapping action on its own emissions strategy that helps underpin that process. Embracing green action \nBut she drew hope from the vast number of firms and cities looking towards a low-carbon future – in the US and round the world: \"A lot of US businesses are really going into the agenda of sustainability and some are making their own commitments in emissions reductions in their own operations.\" \n“An incredible amount of cities have embarked on ambitious goals; some states like California have been for many years in the forefront of this agenda. \n“In International Petroleum Week, I was very encouraged to hear how much some of the oil and gas companies are realising that the future of their industries is in a transformation into clean energy companies - and they have embraced this in their own interest. \n“The transformation has started. I think it’s unstoppable.” \nMs Espinosa smiled at the irony of dealing with Mr Trump as a Mexican, a woman, and someone who works in climate change. \nShe said her trip to the US would include meeting businesses and civil society groups and - hopefully - a senior member of the administration. She is anticipating a meeting with the new secretary of state Rex Tillerson. \nThe former CEO of the oil giant Exxon Mobil warned recently that climate change is a genuine risk, and said the US should stay at the table of UN talks. \nOther nations have responded differently to the new situation presented by Mr Trump. China has offered to lead and India has surprised many with its new level of ambition . \nSaudi Arabia has expressed support for a slower rate of decarbonisation and Russia - the fifth largest emitter - has not yet ratified the climate deal from Paris. \nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin .
