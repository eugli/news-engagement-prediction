The Washington State Attorney General and former chess champion filed the challenge to Mr Trump’s travel ban from Seattle last Monday, after the ban triggered protests across the US. On Friday, that complaint saw a federal judge freeze the implementation of the President’s executive order — meaning thousands of previously “banned” people are able to travel and from the country. Mr Ferguson, left, with Solicitor General Noah Purcell, is suing the President over his “unlawful and unconstitutional” travel ban. Picture: Karen Ducey/Getty Images/AFP Source: AFP The President was understandably furious, saying the “so-called judge” had “taken law enforcement away” from the country, and insisting his “ridiculous” decision would be overturned. But a federal appeals court turned down the White House’s emergency request to resume the order, which stops citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US. Mr Ferguson, a keen mountain climber and birdwatcher, has become the first person to get results by suing the President, in a daring strategy to rein in the billionaire businessman. The Washington State AG decided Mr Trump’s immigration ban was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and unfairly targeted Muslims. But the 51-year-old hit upon a different and bolder approach to the problem to that used by other predominantly Democratic states. Instead of using individual cases to challenge the order, he drafted a complaint arguing that the ban would damage the whole of Washington State. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 BOB’S TRUMP CARD In an ingenious move, Mr Ferguson enlisted the help of tech giants Expedia and Amazon, while Microsoft said it was also willing to testify if necessary. “Our employees come to us from every corner of the United States and every corner of the world,” Amazon, which employs 40,000 people in the state, said in a statement. “We believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great — a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.” The retailer said the order had “immediately — and negatively — impacted employees, dependants of employees, and candidates for employment with Amazon”. It said 49 employees were born in the countries in question, and two do not have citizenship in any other country. Seven more candidates born in Iraq have been offered jobs with Amazon and the company is now looking at other countries in which they could be placed. A senior Amazon lawyer who was born in Libya but is a citizen of the UK was told to cancel a visit to the US planned for this month, and an Iranian director whose film, distributed by Amazon Studios, has an Oscar nomination is unable to go to the ceremony. Donald Trump is furious at the temporary freeze on his executive order, attacking the judge who implemented it on Twitter. Picture: Susan Walsh/AP Photo Source: AP Travel booking firm Expedia, which employs 3500 people in Washington, said it was “crucial that Expedia hire talent from around the world to provide a broad spectrum of insights, ideas and perspective to the travel services and destinations that it offers” and that at least two employees in Washington were now at risk if they travelled. It said 1000 customers holding passports from the seven countries had already booked flights to, from or through the US and the company was being forced to spend money researching and assisting them. “Expedia believes that the Executive Order jeopardises its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader US and global travel and tourism industry,” it wrote. ‘I BELIEVE IN CALCULATED RISK’ The Attorney General’s legal strategy was largely untested, but he told the New York Times : “I am someone who believes in calculated risk ... And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I’m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf.” His 14-page complaint quotes some of Mr Trump’s campaign statements, including his pledge of “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”, as evidence the order was motivated “by animus and a desire to harm a particular group.” It said 7279 non-citizen immigrants in Washington state are from the targeted countries. Washington State Governor Jay Inslee said he backed Mr Ferguson all the way, and that the President’s order was a unique threat to the state’s economy, which depends heavily on international trade and a diverse population. Federal district judge James Robart on Friday ordered the temporary nationwide suspension of the President’s order until the merits of the complaint ares studied by the court. “The Constitution prevailed today,” said Mr Ferguson. “No one is above the law — not even the President.” He invited other states to join the lawsuit, with Lori Swanson of Minnesota the first to take up the offer, and federal judges in California, Viriginia, Massachusetts and New York also challenging the executive order, although Judge Robart’s ruling was the most dramatic. Former chess champion Mr Ferguson is the first to win a battle with the President, and others may now try to follow his lead. Picture: Ted S. Warren/AP Photo Source: AP On Saturday, a State Department spokesperson announced that “individuals with visas that were not physically cancelled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid.” The Department of Homeland Security, which has authority over border police, said it was reverting to “standard policy and procedure.” Late the same day, the Justice Department officially challenged the ruling. The Trump administration filed an emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals saying that suspending the ban was causing “irreparable harm” to the American public. It argued that Judge Robart had run afoul of constitutional separation of powers, and “second-guesses the president’s national security judgment.” The appeals court rejected the request for an emergency stay, and asked both sides to present additional documents by late Monday. Vice President Mike Pence called the decision “frustrating”, but it is nothing new. Barack Obama also had an order regarding immgrants — in his case, deferring deportation — blocked by the courts, with the Republicans accusing him of an abuse of power. The case could go to the Supreme Court, and will take days to resolve. Mr Trump’s open attack on Robart may have been a mistake, undermining judicial independence and potentially encouraging further defiance. “It’s not exactly contempt of court, but it certainly is contemptuous, and it conveys a lack of respect for the independent judiciary,” said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar and Harvard Law professor. Mr Ferguson is the first to win a battle with the President, and others may be inspired to follow in his footsteps. One thing is certain, the war is far from over. — With AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:15:37.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
