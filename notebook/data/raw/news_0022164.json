What school? There were plenty of young faces in the crowd lining the route of the Patriots victory parade on Tuesday.\nA large contingent of Franklin High School students staked out spots, carrying signs proclaiming that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell likes Nickelback, sits when he pees, and is “#NotMyCommissioner.”\nAdvertisement\nAlison Tammaro of Dedham, whose parents had never let her miss a day of school even when she was sick, brought her boys because — as 9-year-old Jaden interjected — “We won! It’s history!”\nJaden and his younger brother, 5-year-old Darius, never lost faith Sunday night, they said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here “I still believed!” Jaden said.\nThey’d still made sure to swap seats and jerseys for good luck, they said. One can never be too careful.\nThe Patriots have won five Super Bowls since 2002, so grownups might be excused for being a little blase about the thing. But the young could enjoy it all with new eyes.\nAdvertisement\nEight-year-old Sophie Malone, who along with her 12-year-old sister Molly was missing school in Walpole to watch their first parade, had employed her stuffed unicorn, appropriately named Magic, to ensure a Patriots victory.\nThe girls had thought their team would lose, they admitted. But now they were braving the wet snow with “probably a lot” of their classmates, Molly said.\n“It’s special,” said their mom, Gia Malone. “I think it’s something kids should experience.”\nThe Pelletier family had come in from Andover because 7-year old Johnny is wild about the Patriots, and desperate to lay eyes on Tom Brady.\nHe’d stayed up as late as he could muster watching the game Sunday night, wearing a lucky Patriots shirt. His little sister, 3-year-old Scarlet, had believed they would be spending Tuesday at Tom Brady’s house, and when her mom asked Tuesday where she’d rather be, she revealed that she hadn’t give up hope.\n“Wish Tom Brady’s house,” she said quietly with a smile.\nThe last-minute nature of the win had rattled many of who lined the parade route, and stoked their fervor to attend the parade.\n“It was a really great teaching moment,” said Matthew Weiner, who had brought his girls from Newton to see “the goat on the boat.”\n“It’s not over till it’s over,” chimed in Cynthia Popp of Natick.\nPopp’s son, 12-year-old Anthony, admitted to briefly losing faith. But for good luck, he’d outfitted his yellow Lab Lola in a Brady jersey. She didn’t love it, he said, but she “did her job.”\nThe win meant Tuesday was a holiday, said Anthony, and on holidays, you miss school.\n“And you never know,” said an older and wise Matthew Weiner, “if this is the last one.”\nEven for students who didn’t attend the parade, the festivities threatened to affect afternoon bus times in Boston.\nBoston Public Schools sent out a robo-call to families this afternoon, warning that bus routes may face delays because the parade lasted longer than expected.\nRelated Watch live: Patriots Super Bowl victory parade\nEvan Allen can be reached at evan.allen@globe.com .
