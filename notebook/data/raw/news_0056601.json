A monument company will determine which headstones need to be reset and which need to be replaced, according to the Post-Dispatch . \nThe fundraising campaign was organized by activists Linda Sarsour and Tarek El-Messidi, who wrote that “Muslim Americans stand in solidarity with the Jewish-American community to condemn this horrific act of desecration against the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery.” 1500 donors & more than $40k in less than 9 hours in solidarity with our Jewish sisters and brothers. #RestInPeace https://t.co/T7IFEfEKSD pic.twitter.com/56JHLlKzXJ \n— Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) February 22, 2017 \n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
