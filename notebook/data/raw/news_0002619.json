If he's convicted, Gasser could face life in prison at hard labor without parole.\nMcKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California and onetime Pro Bowler during a four-year NFL career, was shot and killed Dec. 1 after Gasser pursued McKnight for almost 6 miles to the New Orleans suburb of Terrytown, authorities said.\nDetectives said a witness told them that McKnight may have cut off Gasser, who began following McKnight in anger. McKnight had gotten out of his car and was standing at the passenger-side door of Gasser's car when he was shot three times, authorities said.\nGasser initially was released without charge, even though investigators said he admitted having shot McKnight .
