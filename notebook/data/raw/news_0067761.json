However, before the current study, it was not clear how the virus affected the testes, which produce testosterone and sperm, researchers said. \nResearchers uncover how Zika causes foetus microcephaly \nTo examine the issue, researchers led by Erol Fikrig, Professor of Medicine at Yale University in the US, studied mice models infected with a non-lethal strain of the Zika virus. \nThe mice used in this study were genetically modified so the researchers could observe viral replication over an extended period of time. \nThe researchers found that the virus continued to replicate in testicular cells even after it was cleared from the blood. \nThey also discovered that 21 days after infection, the testes of infected mice were significantly smaller than those of control mice. \n\"This study shows how the Zika virus replicates in and damages testes,\" said first author Ryuta Uraki. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 16:23 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:26:35.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
