Stephen J. Beard / IndyStar It’s not yet clear which Republicans will run for the U.S. Senate next year. But the GOP is already taking political shots at Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. Those shots are misfiring badly.

But politics is a greedy and relentless game, and that one United States Senate seat, the one occupied by Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, is sitting out there like the final and perhaps most desirable piece of a partisan puzzle. \nRepublicans don’t yet have a serious Senate candidate. But the lack of a field of candidates 14 months before the 2018 primary hasn’t stopped the party itself from aiming its focus at Donnelly, the lone Democrat at the highest levels of Indiana politics. \nSo far, the GOP’s line of attack against the first-term senator has been somewhat absurd. You’ve heard it before: He’s a liberal pawn of liberal D.C. bosses and says one thing back home while doing another in Washington. \nIt’s pure baloney. \nTake a recent alarmist news release from the GOP’s Senate campaign committee: “Donnelly stands with far left environmentalists,” it said, referring to his understandable opposition of Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Now anyone who has followed Donnelly’s career would laugh hysterically at the notion that he stands anywhere near “far left environmentalists.” In fact, he has routinely cast votes that frustrate even moderate environmentalists. And while the GOP says he “ignored” Hoosiers with his position, he tied his opposition to a concern that Pruitt’s policies would hurt Indiana farmers. \nBut, hey, get ready for more such over-the-top, clichéd silliness from the political parties (both of them) as this race heats up like a certain planet we all enjoy. The potential stakes — control of the Senate — are apparently too high for the parties to offer anything close to rational, accurate critiques of the candidates they are opposing. \nAnd, so, Republicans are shooting out statements that are as laughable as they are telling of things to come. The party went to Facebook the other day to accuse Donnelly, perhaps the nation’s most stubbornly moderate senator, of “giving his pals Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren big bear hugs.” \nGive me a break. \nLook at Donnelly’s record — his votes against abortion and environmental regulations, and for gun rights and spending restraint — and then tell me how popular he is with the liberal crowd. Look deeper at his record and you’ll see that he has spent most of his energy in the Senate on the opioid epidemic and the health of military members and veterans. He has very openly offered to work with the Trump administration on the issue of job outsourcing. \nREAD MORE: Buttigieg has most support from past DNC chairs \nNonetheless, Republicans are seeking to portray Donnelly as some sort of leftist menace, a man out of touch with his red state. They are trying to make life uncomfortable for a politician who, yes, will likely cast his share of votes against a president who won Indiana in a landslide, as if being a check against this unstable administration is not the Senate’s role. They will play from the same playbook they used to defeat former Sen. Evan Bayh last year, forgetting that Donnelly does not have Bayh’s baggage, has always kept his focus on and his residence in Indiana and has routinely bucked his own party. \nIn any sane political era, Republicans would look at Donnelly as someone they could work with to address all sorts of issues. Sure, the party would oppose him during a political campaign. That’s fair. But they’d welcome the chance to have a moderate on the other side of the aisle who is willing to reach out to get things done. \nThe Indiana Republican Party instead recently accused Donnelly of being a hypocrite who “is in lock-step with his Democratic friends in Washington.” Why? Because he has opposed some particularly troublesome Trump nominations. They seem to have missed the fact that he voted for the president’s nominees to the United Nations, CIA, Homeland Security, defense, and transportation. \nThe Republican Party recently sent out a fundraising appeal urging backers to support its new “Defeat Donnelly” campaign. Money raised, the party said, would help elect “a reliable conservative voice who will respect the will of Hoosier voters.” They seem to forget that Donnelly was elected in 2012 in large part because his raging moderation, and not the GOP’s far-right nominee, appealed to so many voters. \nIn recent days, Republicans have pressured Donnelly to support Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch . Donnelly met with Gorsuch this week, and most observers expect him to support the nomination. Still, Republicans, who blocked former President Barack Obama’s court nominee for most of 2016, have bashed Donnelly for not immediately announcing how he would vote on the lifetime appointment. They even knocked him in a news release for telling a news outlet that he was going to “carefully review Judge Gorsuch’s record and qualifications in the coming weeks.” \n“Donnelly’s days of waiting are turning into weeks,” the party said in a statement, less than two weeks after Gorsuch was nominated. The overheated statement asked whether Donnelly “will continue to obstruct” the wishes of Indiana voters “and side with Democratic leadership.” \nNow, I don’t know about you, but I suspect most people appreciate a senator who takes a bit of time to review a Supreme Court nominee’s record. And here’s the bottom line: Regardless of how Donnelly votes on the Gorsuch nomination, the Republican Party and Super PACs friendly to it will spend 2018 obliterating him in gloomy campaign ads. They will portray him as a hypocritical pawn of liberal Democratic bosses in Washington. \nAt best. \nThat reality provides Donnelly with a kind of freedom. If the opposition is going to spend millions of dollars trashing you next year, regardless of how you vote this year, then you might as well do whatever you think is best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:35:10.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
