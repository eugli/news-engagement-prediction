ADVERTISEMENT \n“This is diversionary tactic to deflect the seriousness of the crimes committed by De Lima,” Aguirre said. \nHe added that with calls on people to hold protest action against the Duterte administration on the EDSA People Power anniversary, Aguirre said “this is calculated to orchestrate their call for warm bodies to attend the EDSA Anniversary.” RAM \nRELATED VIDEOS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:05:49.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
