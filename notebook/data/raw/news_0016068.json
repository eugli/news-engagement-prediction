One of those prospects is Tennessee wide receiver Parker Bullion. After catching the eye of several schools on the camp circuit last offseason, Bullion said he thinks offers could be coming his way soon. Rivals.com caught up him to discuss his recruitment.\nIn His Words: “One of the schools that’s showing a lot of interest right now is Middle Tennessee State (MTSU). I want to stay close to home and obviously that fits the bill. Their facilities really impressed me when I went there for a visit. I honestly didn’t think it was going to be that nice of a school. I was just going to see what it was like and I was really impressed with their facilities and their coaches. The coaches have been watching me since the summer and they like my size and my hands. I’m working on my speed and I think I’ll probably have to camp at some places to earn offers this offseason but I’m fine with that.”\nOn fit in MTSU’s offense: “That’s what I’m looking for, to go some place where they throw the ball around. I’m a wide receiver so obviously I love to play in that scheme and that’s what I’m targeting when I look at schools.”\nRivals Reaction: At 6-foot-4 and 190 pounds, Bullion already has ideal college size so it’s easy to see why several FBS programs are taking a look. In addition to the Blue Raiders, schools like Vanderbilt, Toledo and others are also showing interest. With a good offseason on the camp circuit, Bullion should head into his senior season with several options.\nEdit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:00:53.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
