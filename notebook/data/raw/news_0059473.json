Related Angela Merkel disowns plan by her party to stop migrants ’ children from holding two passports \nBut they are likely to prove controversial amid warnings that asylum seekers’ safety cannot be guaranteed in countries suffering from their own internal conflicts — such as Libya. \nEU member states are currently debating reforms to the bloc’s asylum system so it can cope with any repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. \nA policy document put forward by Germany calls for a “crisis mechanism” that would “only spring into action in the event of a mass influx.” \nFrance denied reports that French officials also worked on the paper. The mechanism would be modelled on the migrant deal with Turkey.
