(Feb. 24) AP Caitlyn Jenner (Photo: AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON (AP) â€” Caitlyn Jenner is taking President Donald Trump to task for his administration's reversal of a directive on transgender access to public school bathrooms. \nJenner addresses Trump in a video posted Thursday night on Twitter. She says, \"From one Republican to another, this is a disaster.\" \nThe Trump White House has ended a directive issued during Barack Obama's presidency that told public schools to let transgender students use bathrooms and locker rooms of their chosen gender. \nJenner is particularly critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying, \"Apparently even becoming attorney general isn't enough to cure some people of their insecurities.\" \nAddressing Trump, the former Olympic champion says: \"You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\" \nJenner came out as a transgender woman in 2015. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
