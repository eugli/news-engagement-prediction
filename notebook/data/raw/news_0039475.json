He had the world at his feet … such a role model to so many kids … and now no one knows what’s going to happen. It doesn’t look encouraging.

He’s a danger to himself, he’s a danger to the community, and poor Mum and Dad have tried to look after him so much. I’m concerned for their welfare.” \nThe Daily Telegraph can also reveal a family member ­recently sought out a court order against Hackett that expires in January 2019, requiring him to be of “good behaviour” until then. \nHackett’s father Neville said yesterday Hackett “had a mental breakdown” after drinking heavily. Hackett was arrested yesterday after police were called to his family home shortly before midday following reports he flew into a violent rage in the latest in a spate of meltdowns. Eight officers had to be called to Hackett’s home. Picture: Jerad Williams Source: News Corp Australia \nThere were varying reports about the exact nature of that disturbance, with some suggesting that Hackett had stabbed a knife into a chopping block. Eight police officers ­arrived at the Hacketts’ home at Mermaid Waters and took him into custody in handcuffs. \nHe was kept in Southport watch-house for several hours before being released without charge, and was later believed to have been taken to a Gold Coast private hospital. \nNews of Hackett’s arrest has shaken the Australian sporting community right up to its top echelons. Hackett handcuffed in the back of a police car after allegedly flying into a fit of uncontrollable rage” that forced his parents to call the police.

I am very worried for him and his family. \n“He is one of ours. He’s an Olympian, and one of our greatest Olympians. We’ll give him whatever support we can.” \nThe seriousness of the incident was not played down by his clearly emotional brother yesterday. \n“The Grant Hackett that Australia fell in love with … this is not Grant Hackett,” Craig said. “This is a completely different person. I don’t know this person, my mum and dad don’t know this person. Craig Hackett, brother of Grant Hackett, says the fallen champion is a danger to himself and the community. Source: AAP \n“He’s there in person — but he’s not there in mind, soul or spirit.” \nProbed on the incident, Hackett’s father said: “He just became abusive and aggressive. When I say aggressive, (I mean) aggressive verbally, and didn’t make any sense. And it was obvious that something was wrong, and I phoned the police.” Nev Hackett 'We will do anything to help him' 1:21 \nGrant Hackett's father Nev talks to reporters following the Olympian's arrest at their Gold Coast family home.

Hackett was kept at a Gold Coast watch-house for several hours before being released without charge.

Hackett ­entered rehab in 2012 for ­addiction to the powerful prescription drug Stilnox, and underwent treatment again in 2014 after he was found wandering semi-naked around Melbourne’s Crown Casino claiming to have lost his son.

Last April he was involved in a mid-air scandal when he allegedly “forcefully” tweaked the nipple of a fellow passenger on board a Virgin flight. \nAfter that incident, Hackett — who has worked as a senior banker with Westpac and as a Channel 9 commentator after retiring from swimming — said “binge drinking is an issue that I need to address and something I will address”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:35:07.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
