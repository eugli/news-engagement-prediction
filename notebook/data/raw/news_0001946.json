I told him anything is possible if he just dreams big and reaches for the stars. And also, if he stops with the uncomfortable close talking and weird laughter and sniffing his fingers all the time.\" \nAnd earlier today, Gunn posted his retort. \"Great picture of me fake smiling as Chris Pratt goes on excitedly about his Matchbox 20 fan art (lately he's mostly using pastels; he uses a glue stick for all the glitter at the very end; Brian, the bass player, has hard hands to draw.)\" he explained . \"Our stunt coordinator Tom Harper looks on, uncomfortable.\" \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes’ aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither). The film marks the return of the original Guardians, including Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Into Darkness) as Gamora; Dave Bautista ( Spectre ) as Drax; Vin Diesel ( Furious 7 ) as the voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper ( American Sniper ) as the voice of Rocket; Michael Rooker ( Jumper ) as Yondu; Karen Gillan ( The Big Short ) as Nebula; and Sean Gunn ( Gilmore Girls ) as Kraglin.
