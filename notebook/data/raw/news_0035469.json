Yep, it looks like the Keating kids are about to factionalize even more than they already have because Connor has a dirty, dirty secret to hide. Let’s walk through what we learned on tonight’s penultimate episode of How to Get Away with Murder ‘s third season. \nFirst of all, Annalise is looking rough. Her idea to provoke her way into a beat-down in country jail did give Bonnie some extra talking points for her bail plea, but now she’s hurting — enough to be eyeballing the you-know-what out of a bottle of pills in her medicine cabinet. \nShe meets with Nate after her release, and he’s got a bit of bad news: He sniffed around these crime materials enough that his signature has now miraculously been affixed to a transfer order for Wes’ body, which was only discovered by happenstance when Laurel decided she wanted to take a peek for morbid grief stuff’s sake. A missing body reeks of conspiracy on the DA’s office’s part, but with Nate’s John Hancock on the dotted line, well, it’s a lot harder to implicate Denver and Atwood in the matter. \nBy the way, we can probably go ahead and mark Nate off the list of potential perps here. Last week, we learned that he was there at the house the night Wes was killed, because this show just loves to land on a cliffhanger that ultimately means very little (and, frankly, it might have pulled another one on us tonight. TBD). But Nate’s convincing enough with his account of leaving Wes at the house unharmed long before the blazes began. \nMeanwhile, Annalise’s student crew is obviously in a state of shock over the brutal demise of one of their own, and they don’t exactly welcome her home with warmth and hugs. Laurel’s especially put off by Annalise’s unease about looking into the Mahoney family’s involvement in this — and Annalise’s confession that they had a hand in the accident that killed her baby doesn’t mollify Laurel’s need for justice either. She takes the upper hand and tells Annalise she’s looking weak and “victim-y” right now and that she’s had enough. \nThose words will later resonate with Annalise as she decides her next move because if there’s one thing in this world this woman is consistent about, it’s preserving her sense of pride. Laurel’s biting words won’t inspire her to take drastic actions to find out Wes’ killer just yet, oh no. Annalise still has No. 1 to look out for first, so she turns her focus towards dismantling the DA’s case against her. Thankfully, Laurel has deep enough pockets to invest in a private investigator who can do all the digging she needs on these “dangerous” people that Annalise is so afraid of, so she’s not exactly twiddling her thumbs as Annalise decides to wage war on the DA’s office by requesting a grand jury investigation into conspiracy and prosecutorial misconduct on Denver and Atwood’s parts. \nThe Attorney General isn’t happy about the tacit threat that bad exposure on this matter would threaten her future judgeship opportunities, but she agrees to look into it. Nate’s also not too keen on having his nose put even further to the grind on this matter because he thinks Annalise has just roped him into a lose-lose situation by taking up arms against the entire state. She doesn’t have the presence and power that she used to with them, he warns. “They think you’re a joke now.” \nWell, that ‘s not a good way to get Annalise to slow her roll, then, is it? \nOver at Connor and Oliver’s, Oliver is ready to hack into the phone and see what he can find. Connor’s all but convinced that Annalise had a hand in Wes’ murder, and besides, there’s a reason she asked him to wipe it for her that night. But Connor starts to fidget a bit when Oliver uncovers that Annalise called him that night. He shrugs it off, saying she left a voicemail but he didn’t get it ’til the next morning, but Asher and Michaela are starting to raise eyebrows over his constant insistence around them that Annalise is the woman behind the Oz mask here. \nFrank’s starting to sing a different tune about his involvement in Wes’ death. We all kinda have to figure he didn’t do it at this point, but he confirms the same in a chat with Bonnie anyway. Wes wasn’t at the house when he was there, he insists. But now that he’s basically set himself up for a conviction by full-on confessing to the crime, now what? First order of business for him is to fire his lawyer and start leaning on Bonnie for assistance. He’s doing all of this to make nice with her other client, Annalise, anyhow, so this way is better to serve her needs more directly somehow. \nMichaela’s also vying for Annalise’s MVP helper right now because she’s doing her best to shepherd the boys, Asher and especially Connor, from wandering aimlessly with their wild theories about Annalise’s actions on the night of Wes’ death. Annalise asks if she should be worried about anyone in their “family,” but Michaela says she’s got this under control. “I’ve been cleaning up your mess while you’ve been in jail,” she snaps. \nNEXT: But Connor’s got a secret … Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:27:43.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
