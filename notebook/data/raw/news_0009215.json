(ABC Radio Melbourne) \nRough sleepers have been offered three nights accommodation at a motel in the city's northern suburbs, however the protesters said they wanted a more permanent option. \nEarlier, Housing Minister Martin Foley said 15 people from the camp had already moved on, and four had gone into rehabilitation. \n\"There's a pathway out for the genuinely homeless and we would urge those protestors who have flocked to this in more recent days to cooperate with police let the workers get about their business and let's start restoring our fantastic Flinders Street railway station,\" he said. \nThe State Government last week announced a $9.8 million package to help clean up homelessness on the streets of Melbourne and move people into transitional housing. \nUnder the plan, 40 people would be given immediate transitional housing while new housing is built, and 30 new permanent modular homes would be built on public land by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:43:31.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
