Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Sneaks (Eva Moolchan), \"Hair Slick Back\" \nEva Moolchan—who performs as Sneaks —knows that size doesn't matter. Her new album clocks in at a mere 18 minutes spread out over 10 tracks, and she makes each of those 18 minutes count. Moolchan teamed up with Ex Hex and Helium frontwoman Mary Timony to craft a diminutive album of meditative art rock, jam-packed with an undeniable minimalist ferocity. On the hypnotic \"Hair Slick Back,\" which we are premiering today, Moolchan lets loose with a sparse post-punk beat that cuts short just as the listener starts to lose themselves in the music. That's just the way it is with Sneaks, whose exuberant, mesmerizing songs always leave you wanting more, more, more. Sneaks' It's a Myth is out March 31 on Merge. Sera Cahoone, \"Better Woman\" \nIt should be no surprise that the daughter of a dynamite salesman grew up to make music that plainly explodes with emotion. The talented drummer, who played with Band of Horses, is even better with a guitar in hand and a twang in her voice. The singer-songwriter writes intimate tunes full of a lulling melodies and complicated grace, as heard in \"Better Woman,\" which we are premiering today. Her homespun songs are ambling, laconic sweetness perfect for Sunday mornings or any time you find yourself in a hammock. Her new album, From Where I Started , is out March 24. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Goldfrapp, \"Anymore\" \nFor some reason, the idea of \"letting yourself go\" is generally frowned upon in our culture, but there's no reason to hold back while listening to Goldfrapp's heady pop electronica. The duo of Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory have been working together for almost two decades, and they are pros at getting listeners to let loose. On \"Anymore,\" Goldfrapp begs for connection, a sentiment that might particularly resonate in this anxiety-filled modern world. Their seventh studio album, Silver Eye, is out 31 March on Mute . The Shins, \"Mildenhall\" \nThe Shins helped us through the new year by announcing that they were releasing their first new album in five years this March. Heartworms will be out on March 10 and sees frontman James Mercer doing something he hasn't done since 2001's Oh, Inverted World— self-producing almost every track on the album. Considering how much we loved that record, we're super excited (even if Natalie Portman isn't playing it for us on her headphones à la Garden State ). On \"Mildenhall,\" Mercer blends his indie-rock charm with country chops, crafting an instant classic of Americana along the way. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Raekwon, \"Purple Brick Road (feat. G-Eazy)\" \nThis Wu-Tang Clan member knows how to make an old-school beat sound downright innovative. On his forthcoming album, The Wild , out on March 24, Raekwon teams up with collaborators like Andra Day, Cee-Lo Green, and Lil Wayne for a diverse group of songs that are still unmistakably his own. On \"Purple Brick Road,\" he teams up with G-Eazy and producers J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League for a song that manages to sound both comfortingly nostalgic and totally fresh. Tei Shi, \"How Far\" \nTei Shi, the moniker of singer/songwriter and producer Valerie Teicher, has been making musical waves for years, earning spots at Coachella and fans like Grimes, so it's hard to believe that the Colombia-via-Argentina New Yorker hasn't actually put out an album yet. That will be rectified on March 31st when her debut LP Crawl Space comes out on Downtown/Interscope. She makes music that blends pop with R&B, then sprinkles it with equal parts rock n' roll and shoe gaze electronica. It's unique and utterly irresistible. \"How Far\" is a breathlessly ticked-off seduction—think flipping through Tinder while your on-again-off-again fling is on the couch next to you.

Jenny Hval)\" \nTechno has always been a bit of a boys' club, but 28-year-old musician and producer Kelly Lee Owens is looking to knock down the walls of the clubhouse with her elegant songs, tantalizing hooks, lush synths, and pulsing beats. On \"Anxi,\" she teams up with Norwegian singer Jenny Hval for an edgy yet laconic groove paired with Hval's ghostly vocals. Her debut EP, Oleic , got a lot of well-deserved critical buzz, and she's looking to repeat the feat with her new self-titled LP , out on March 24. Tennis, \"Modern Woman\" \nIndie pop duo Tennis , a.k.a. Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore, has a thing for the 1970s—you can tell by watching the video for their quixotic new track \"Modern Woman.\" Doesn't it just look like a Virginia Slims ad written by Betty Friedan? The track is a spot-on preview of the married couple's forthcoming album, Yours Conditionally, due out March 10. The songs on the LP are full of a dreamy sincerity and lulling rhythms, which makes sense considering they wrote half of the album while sailing through the Gulf of Mexico.

Hames has a retro Americana sound that is a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll, and fully Nashville—members of The Raconteurs, The Whigs, and Jack White's backing band all help out on the album. \"When You Say Goodbye\" is straight out of the Dusty Springfield songbook—never a bad thing. Turn it up if you're feeling even the least bit lovelorn or life weary. Depeche Mode, \"Where's the Revolution\" \nSynth-rock legends Depeche Mode have a question for the kids of today: Where's the revolution? Dave Gahan shows just how disappointed he is in the band's new single, singing: \"Come on people, you're letting me down.\" Who wants to let Depeche Mode down? Not us. Their approximately 247th studio album (okay, it's their 14th) Spirit is out on March 17 and will see the electronic music icons team up with Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford, who helped craft albums for Florence + the Machine and Arctic Monkeys. Add the track to your protest playlist and start the revolution already.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:23:06.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
