The schools have been directed to implement the necessary security measures, in accordance to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued, he added. \nGovt orders security audit of educational institutions \nThe schools will remain closed for a period of five days, while the management installs the required security mechanism. The 46 schools include 15 in the city, 10 in Parwa Tehsil, nine in Tehsil Kolachi and 12 in Paharpur tehsil. \nAfter a string of bombings across the country, private schools in Lahore put in a request to the government last week to ensure adequate security for students. \n“Pakistan is experiencing a fresh spell of violence and terrorism, and if continued, it will shake the painstakingly restored confidence of common Pakistanis,” said a statement issued by the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) on Friday. “According to Articles 9 and 25 of the Constitution, it is the constitutional duty of the state and government to provide security to every citizen of Pakistan.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:48:03.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
