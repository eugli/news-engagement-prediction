A bunch of tourists were brought into the Oscars for some reason \nThe filmmaker – who won the award for a second time on Sunday night – did not attend the ceremony after saying that the conditions which would be attached to a potential visa entry to the US were unacceptable. \nHowever he did send a representative to collect his Oscar – who gave an acceptance speech on his behalf in which he criticised the ban. The director criticised Donald Trump’s travel ban in his speech (Picture: ABC) \n‘I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight,’ Farhadi said in the speech. \n‘My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. The director did not attend the ceremony in the wake of the travel ban (Picture: Rex Shutterstock) \n‘Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war. Asghar Farhadi's acceptance speech in full \nI will be reading a statement by Mr. Farhadi. It’s a great honor to be receiving this valuable award for the second time. I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran, my producer Alexandre Mallet-Guy, Cohen Media, Amazon and my fellow nominees in the foreign film category. \nI’m sorry I’m not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. \nDividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war. \nThese wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. \nFilmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever. Thank you on behalf of Mr. Farhadi. \nThe speech went on: ‘Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war. \n‘These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:16:36.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
