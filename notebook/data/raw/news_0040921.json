Garrett walked away from the band to enter politics. He served as a Labor government minister during the tumultuous Kevin Rudd-Julia Gillard years. \n\"I had a really different experience being a politician. It's one I value greatly for all its ups and downs,\" he says. \nHis former band mates watched on at times with some concern. \n\"I guess we were worried how he'd get through it really because I don't know you'd think that rock 'n' roll would prepare you for anything,\" drummer Rob Hirst says. \n\"Not for Kevin Rudd!\" Garrett laughs. \nA lot has happened during those lost political years. \nThe politics today is the politics of Donald Trump and Pauline Hanson. The band railed against the One Nation leader, inspiring the song Redneck Wonderland. \n\"I haven't thought about Pauline Hanson for a really long time,\" bass player 'Bones' Hillman says. \n\"There's a challenge there for all of us to not only speak out about it but also talk about what we'd like to see happen.\" External Link: Redneck Wonderland - Midnight Oil \nGarrett says: \"I mean, healthy democracies only work well when there's a heap of participation by everybody, and work poorly when you operate out of the ring and elect clowns, and that's what we've done with her.\" \nMidnight Oil was always a mix of pile-driving music and politics. They campaigned for the environment and Indigenous rights. \nThese issues sit at the heart of the band's recently announced world tour. They are calling it The Great Circle and will start in Brazil in April, and take them all the way back home at the end of the year. 'People fall asleep, things creep in' \nThe band says the political climate is right for their message. \n\"We're part of the pushback and we are not alone. There's a whole bunch of people here, and throughout Europe and other places that we're touring, who feel the same way,\" Hirst says. \n\"This is one of those tiny moments in history that will disappear as quickly as it came, and we will just be out there singing the same songs which perhaps have a new relevance.\" \nMidnight Oil nominates songs like Short Memory — a warning of the dangers of historical complacency — or Read About It, a lament for the freedom of the press as especially salient now in the era of Mr Trump. External Link: Short Memory - Midnight Oil \n\"What we're talking about with the Trump thing, well it's a whole other world. Something like Short Memory is a classic,\" guitarist Jim Moginie says. \n\"It could have been the rise of Hitler in the 1930s in Germany, it's the same thing now. People just fall asleep and these things creep in.\" \nAmerica is a different place to when they last toured. Then, the Oils stopped New York traffic in a protest against oil company Exxon Mobil. \nThe CEO was Rex Tillerson. Today he is the Secretary of State in the Trump administration. \nIf the rage had dimmed, that alone is enough to fire these rabble rousers one more time.
