Margaret McCulloch's experience: In 2007, I had a relatively routine operation and ended up with nerve pain. It was a terrible shock when I realised the damage done was permanent. I wasn't told about the risks and received no support from my specialist, who simply told me he doesn't deal with pain. I had a constant searing burning sensation in my right knee and lower leg, with the feeling of electric shock waves going up my toes.Eventually I decided it wouldn't beat me. I had to take charge of the pain.I found some great professional help and learned about chronic pain. Over time I trained my brain to focus on things other than the pain, things I'm busy with or like to do. Today my pain is cyclical. One day is good, the next day not so good. It's like clockwork. In 2010, I started Pain Support ACT. I wanted to help others get out of that dark place and I wanted to stand up for a better deal for all people living with pain. \n\"I guess after the surgery I knew something was wrong, I started getting some numbness in my toes,\" she said. \n\"Virtually overnight ... I just felt like my legs were on fire. It felt like a current of electricity running up my toes. It was horrific.\" \nMs McCulloch struggled to find the help she needed, turning to multiple doctors before eventually having her chronic pain diagnosed. \n\"He said don't worry Margaret, we'll work on this together and together we'll fix it,\" she said. \n\"I was so relieved, because no-one had ever said anything like that.\" \nIn the years since, Ms McCulloch has turned to a combination of medication, hydrotherapy and meditation to manage the pain. \n\"Now I can quite happily set off on a hike for a couple of kilometres, which I never would have thought possible in the early days.\" Complications don't always signal sign of botched surgery \nPain awareness advocates across the world are banding together through 2017 under the banner of a Global Year Against Pain After Surgery. \nPain Australia chief Lesley Brydon said most people do not understand the risks associated with even minor operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:45:36.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
