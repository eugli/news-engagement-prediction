He devoted his whole life to defending the interests of Russia and was to be found on the very front lines and in the most stressful posts.\"\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook: \"Great diplomat. Extraordinary personality. Colorful man.\"\nChurkin was a pugnacious defender of Russian policy, notably its intensive bombing of the Syrian city of Aleppo last year to crush rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.\nÂ© AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File In this Thursday, March 27, 2014, file photo, Russian ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin returns to his seat after speaking at United Nations headquarters. Russian officials said Churkin died suddenly in New York City on Monday, Feb. 20, 2017. MOTHER THERESA\nWhen then-U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Syria, Russia and Iran last year of bearing responsibility for atrocities there, Churkin said she was forgetting the United States' own track record in the Middle East.\n\"The weirdest speech to me was the one by the U.S. representative who built her statement as if she is Mother Teresa herself. Please, remember which country you represent. Please, remember the track record of your country,\" he said.\nFarhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general's office, said: \"He has been such a regular presence here that I am actually quite stunned. Our thoughts go to his family, to his friends and to his government.\"\nChurkin first came to prominence as foreign ministry spokesman for the Soviet Union from 1990 until the collapse of the superpower the following year. Despite the pressure of events, he appeared to revel in the attention of the Western correspondents who mobbed him at briefings, and was happy to respond to them at length in fluent English.\nHe went on to serve as deputy Russian foreign minister and ambassador to Belgium and then to Canada, eventually moving to the U.N. in 2006.\n(Reporting by Jack Stubbs and Ned Parker; writing by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Gareth Jones)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn8Tif&lang=en-us&flow_id=41047366-79d7-4c88-a41e-1843d266b8c3", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8Tif?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8Tif?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn8Tif%3focid%3dst&text=Russia%27s+UN+Ambassador+Dies+In+NYC&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn8Tif%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8Tif?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8Tif?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/de7f30f6-", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/de7f30f6-8345-4c7d-a57b-0cd3b1e515ab/a5367694-0a46-4147-b8fb-1fd3148a3124.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn8Tif%3focid%3dsl&title=Russia%27s+UN+Ambassador+Dies+In+NYC&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn8Tif%3focid%3dsl", "http://api.wochit.com/api/?partnerID=f421a246974545c6e1fb724595053584efa8cc05492e9685c8c2ea4e90f3768d&action=MRSS&topicName=General&descendants=true&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8XPS.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Russia&#39;s", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn8Tif?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:43:40.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
