Photo: JONATHAN HAYWARD, AP Poll: Americans agree, we all hate the Patriots 1 / 27 Back to Gallery \nAmericans either love or hate Donald Trump, Spam and Polka music. The divides are deep. \nBut, a new poll shows one thing nearly everyone agrees on: A hatred of the New England Patriots. \nA Public Policy Polling survey released Tuesday shows that 53 percent of people are rooting for the Atlanta Falcons to win on Sunday, compared to only 27% who are pulling for the Patriots in Super Bowl LI in Houston on Sunday. \nThe dislike of the Patriots even crosses party lines - not an easy feat these days. \nSTEER CLEAR: Places in Houston to avoid during Super Bowl weekend \nBy a 58-23 percent margin Republicans threw their support behind the Falcons. Democrats posted similar numbers 54-27 percent, and independents went for the NFC champs 47-31 percent. \nAs far as being the most hated, the Patriots have overtaken the Dallas Cowboys for that, um, honor. In the poll, 21 percent of respondents cited New England, where long-time champ Dallas took 19 percent. \nWhen it comes to New England quarterback Tom Brady, things get weird. \nNFL Field Director Ed Mangan talks about the turf and art that transforms the home of the Houston Texans into a neutral Super Bowl field. Video by Karen Warren/ Houston Chronicle Media: MediaOS Video \nHe's the favorite quarterback of those surveyed with 22 percent of people naming him. He's also the most hated quarterback of people surveyed, with 24 percent naming him. \nPOLITICAL FLIPPER: Former President George H.W. Bush to attend Super Bowl coin toss \nPublic Policy Polling, which has a history of asking oddball questions about belief in Santa Claus and how Charlie Sheen stacked up against prospective GOP Presidential candidates, asked a plethora of NFL-related queries. The results can be found here. \nOh, and take note, Houston Texans fans, of all the quarterbacks named as either a favorite or least favorite, the local guy, Brock Osweiler, didn't register in the poll. \n>>>Click through the above gallery to see a sampling of the PPP survey results.
