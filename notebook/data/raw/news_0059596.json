But it’s a step forward for a project that began in April 2016, when the Times tasked a two-person team with optimizing its headlines, a practice that’s become standard operating procedure in digital media over the past several years. \nWhile headlines have always been important to publishers, the emphasis on testing them has grown as publishers have grown more reliant on social distribution for traffic. The right headline can drive exponentially higher traffic to a story, which is why publishers big and small are optimizing their headlines not just on social media or their owned and operated properties but inside third-party recommendation widgets like Taboola too. \nWhat’s less common is optimizing by device. While some publishers have toyed with using different headlines inside their mobile apps, fewer are showing headlines to mobile readers that differ from the headlines shown to readers accessing their sites from desktop computers, or from the ones that appear in newsletters, which are getting more important all the time. Most haven’t taken the step because muddling through reader data on that level requires dedicated analytics and support for the work. \nBut sweating those details will become necessary as publishers get increasingly serious about personalization. A growing number of them are intrigued by the concept but lack good data and clear incentives to pursue it fully. They have taken baby steps toward correcting those problems, now that most publishers and their newsrooms have gotten past the idea that optimization is the first step down the road to clickbait.
