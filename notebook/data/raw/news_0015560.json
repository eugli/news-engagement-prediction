The VVIC room can fit up to 10 adult cats (or one mother cat and her kittens) and comes with three “king”-sized beds, a mini-playground, and a separate toilet. \nThe other rooms, which can accommodate between three and seven cats, come with either a “queen”, “double” or “single” bed and up to three feeding and cleaning sessions per day. Some have a shower facility and, weirdly, Wi-Fi, while all rooms come with air-conditioning.

They always prefer to be treated as a boss. It means the environment must be felt like home, always being cuddled and hugged, and most importantly they don't want to feel lonely,\" the hotel claims on its website.

While guests at the Four Seasons can order breakfast in bed, have a massage or take a swim in the pool, pets staying at the Barkley can do the same and more. Guest suites for dogs at the Barkley provide individual climate and lighting control, soothing music and frequently freshened air. Cats have smaller suites but are entertained by television screens featuring birds in flight and tropical fish swimming in a tank.

There's ahi tuna sushi for the cats that don't like their dinner from a tin. \nThe Barkley also offers pet hotels in Mumbai, India and Cleveland, Ohio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:46:08.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
