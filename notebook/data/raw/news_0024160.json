The old uncle wheeled himself against oncoming traffic to talk to the taxi driver while gesturing to passerby. \nThis uncle is a common sight near Farrer MRT and has been pulling this stunt multiple times. He will ask for money from passerby in a fierce way and shout or scold people who reject him. If people give him too little money, he will give snide comments and say they are stingy. \nHe put his life and other motorist at risk when he rush onto the roads just to beg for money from the drivers. This is really too much. \nVernon A.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
