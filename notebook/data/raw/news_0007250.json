Priscilla has been invoiced for the cost of the care she and her babies have received but is understood to have admitted she has no means to pay. \nThe cost to taxpayers of failing to recoup money in such cases is between £200million and £2billion a year, Whitehall research claims. \nEven at the lower end, the estimated shortfall would pay for around 9,500 extra nurses. Read More Health tourism is NOT bad - but what you're being told about it is The money lost treating foreign patients who can't pay is at least £200m a year (Photo: Getty) \nThe Government aims to raise £500million a year from foreign patients by 2017/18. But it is only on track to generate £346million, according to a Public Accounts Committee report. \nWith the NHS increasingly cash-starved, this is an issue which raises many questions... Who must pay for NHS treatment? \nAnyone who is not ordinarily resident in the UK, which usually means living here for at least six months. \nThis includes short-term mig­­rants, tourists and students. \nGP services and A&E are free for everyone. Only services provided in or linked to a hospital – excluding A&E and walk-in centres – are required to charge foreign patients. Read More Jeremy Hunt fails to get NHS to recover £150MILLION owed from foreign nationals treated in UK hospitals \nThe NHS will always provide immediately necessary and urgent care for any patient who needs it. \nBut trusts have a statutory duty to recover the cost of treating foreign patients not eligible for free care, under rules introduced in 1982. When should patients pay? \nIdeally, before they receive treatment. Doctors and nurses should ask for payment with chip and pin machines before surgery or a consultation. But few do and hospitals often have to hire debt recovery agencies to chase people after they have been discharged. Read More \nMany of those patients then leave the country and the NHS has little chance of clawing back the cash. \nThe Public Accounts Committee report found UK systems for cost recovery are “chaotic”. \nMPs said they were not convinced that enough is being done to identify and charge foreign patients. Who checks if a patient should pay? \nEvery medical professional who sees a patient for the first time should ask for ID. This includes receptionists. GPs should flag up suspect patients referred to hospital. \nPeterborough City Hospital asks people to show a passport and utility bills before treatment. St George’s Hospital in South London asks pregnant women for a passport and proof of address. \nChris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, suggested a similar approach could be used nationwide. Why are doctors reluctant to perform checks? \nThey say it is not their duty to act as border guards but to treat the patient, wherever they are from, and whether or not they can pay. They say that not doing so would contradict their profession’s Hippocratic Oath. What happens if the foreign patient cannot pay? \nThe NHS can write to them offering a payment plan, or use a debt ­collection agency to chase payment overseas. \nIt can also report to the Home Office the non-payment for any patient who owes £500 or more. \nThis triggers a red flag on their immigration records and they will not be allowed back into the UK until the bill is paid. \nBut none of these measures will help recoup money from a foreign patient who has no means to pay. What about patients from Europe? \nCharges for those from countries in the European Economic Area should be claimed back by the NHS from their country of residence. \nIn return, the UK must pay that relevant member state whenever a UK citizen receives treatment in their healthcare system. \nBut the UK’s enforcement of these regulations is poor, the Public Accounts Committee found. It said 22 NHS trusts did not bill governments through the European health insurance card scheme. \nThe UK paid European governments £565million last year for treating UK citizens abroad, while reclaiming just £56million for European citizens treated here. What about patients from outside Europe? \nThey must pay for their own care. A significant proportion using the NHS come from Nigeria. Others come from India, Pakistan and Ghana – many for cataract surgery and kidney dialysis. \nIn these cases, the costs should be recouped directly from the patient. \nPeople who live outside the EEA, including former UK residents, should make sure they are covered by personal health insurance, unless an exemption applies to them. \nAnyone who does not have insurance can be charged at 150% of the NHS national tariff for any care. Who is exempt from charges? \nForeign patients who have been subjected to torture, female genital mutilation, domestic violence, and sexual violence are not charged for treatment or services for any condition caused by that violence, in recognition of the particularly vulnerable position they may be in. \nThe exemption applies wherever the violence has been experienced, provided that the foreign patient has not travelled to the UK for the purpose of seeking that treatment. Pay on the spot for routine treatment \nSays Dr Mike Smith, The Patients Association \nThe NHS must get much better at recouping money for treatment from patients not eligible for free care. \nIf everyone in the health service followed the correct procedures, it has been estimated that in an average year, the currently much cash-strapped NHS, at the very least, would be better off by some £200million. \nThat money is urgently needed to treat UK patients. Read More Jeremy Corbyn accuses Tories of putting families at risk as brutal cuts leave NHS on \"brink of meltdown\" \nIn a life-threatening emergency, whatever needs to be done should so be done and without delay - no matter where the patient is from. \nEveryone agrees with that principle because we have a duty to treat people whose life is at risk. \nBut for someone seeking routine, non-urgent, NHS care when away from home, patients should be asked for their personal details, such as their GP’s name, their address and, if in doubt, the proof of their identity. \nFor those patients from outside the UK, it should be explained that an appropriate fee is required and should be paid either in cash, credit or preferably by debit card. \nIf this is not obtained, then the patient should be advised to seek the help they need when back in their own country. Real problem is a lack of investment \nBy Dr Mark Porter, British Medical Association \nAs a doctor I understand that it is important that we recover the costs for treating overseas visitors. \nBut the systems to do this need to be practical, economic and efficient and must not jeopardise access to healthcare for those who need it. \nProposals that have been floated, including that people show a passport or another form of identification before they receive any treatment from the health service, will unfortunately not solve the huge funding crisis in the NHS. Read More Some believe foreign patients should pay on the spot for routine treatment (Photo: Getty Images) \nThose accessing the NHS must be eligible to do so. \nBut any charging systems should not prevent sick and vulnerable patients receiving necessary care, otherwise there may be serious consequences for their health and that of the public in general. \nThe National Audit Office estimates that the uncollected fees are £200million a year, but we have an NHS with a deficit approaching 100 times that amount opening up over the course of this parliament. \nThe fact is our health service has been deliberately starved of the investment necessary to treat people. \nOur hospitals are in the red, patients are suffering and staff are working under impossible conditions. \nThe government must address the £30billion funding shortfall that is undermining the NHS, and produce a long-term strategy that addresses the fundamental workload and financial challenges that are currently overwhelming the health service.
