Read more \nZeniMax sued Oculus in May 2014, months after it was acquired by Facebook , alleging that the VR startup improperly used code from ZeniMax to build the Rift VR headset.\nZeniMax is the parent company of ID Software, maker of Doom and Quake games, whose co-founder John Carmack is now the chief technology officer of Oculus . Luckey exchanged emails with Carmack, who was still at ID Software, when he was developing a prototype of the company’s flagship headset.\nOculus plans to appeal the decision and said that the company is committed to the “long-term success of VR”.\nThe news came as Facebook announced a 51% jump in its fourth-quarter revenue , driven by its mobile advertising business, which accounted for 84% of revenues. Bad publicity over fake news failed to leave any mark on the quarter, which ended 31 December. Revenues rose to $8.81bn and Facebook’s quarterly profit more than doubled to $3.57bn from $1.56bn a year earlier. Some 1.86 billion people were active on Facebook at the end of December, up 17% from a year earlier.\nIn short, Facebook can afford the $500m.\nDuring closing arguments, ZeniMax’s attorney called for a much larger award – $2bn in compensation and $2bn in damages. Oculus’s attorney, Beth Wilkinson, argued the lawsuit was driven by jealousy and anger, not facts. \nDuring the three-week trial, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg , testified, characterizing the plaintiffs as opportunists. \n“It’s pretty common when you announce a big deal that people just come out of the woodwork and claim they own some part of the deal,” he said. \nThe case was tried in a district court in the north district of Texas. Of the $500m , Luckey will have to pay $50m in the lawsuit, while former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe has been ordered to pay $150m – both for false designation. The company must also pay $200m for NDA violation, $50m for copyright infringement and $50m for false designation. The jury decided that Oculus didn’t steal trade secrets, as alleged by ZeniMax.\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:49:21.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
