On Monday's show he brought out a chart that reveals the standings for \"Who is the real president?\" as the \"Daily Show\" sees them. Trump is only at No. 5, and the real president in the show's eyes at the moment is chief strategist Steve Bannon. \n\"Can I be honest with you?\" Noah said. \"This tally wasnâ€™t even close because in the past week we have learned so much about the power and influence Bannon has in the White House.\" \nReports in the past week reveal that Bannon was a key player in the drafting of the \"extreme vetting\" executive order that temporarily banned immigration and refugees from several countries, and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. \nBannon also got a seat on the National Security Council, an unprecedented move for someone in Bannon's position. That was made possible by Trump signing an executive order, but reporting suggests Trump didn't know that he was giving Bannon that power in the order he signed. \n\"This is crazy.
