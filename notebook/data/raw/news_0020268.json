It is more sophisticated, more readily available and harder to detect,\" he said in the statement. \n\"There are people willing to push the boundaries with experimental substances and methods which have not been clinically tested or approved for human use. \n\"The 'win at all costs' mentality harms athletes, destroys fair play and equitable competition and does irreparable damage to the credibility of sport. ASADA is trying its best to protect clean athletes and their right to compete on a level playing field. \n\"During my tenure, I am proud to have overseen a number of positive changes for ASADA and more broadly sport in Australia, including the redevelopment of ASADA's Operating Model and the enhancement of our intelligence and investigative capabilities, enabling us to better target those high-risk sports and individuals.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:40:45.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
