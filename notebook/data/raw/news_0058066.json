(AAP) \n\"In the Northern Territory, [constitutional recognition] would address land rights, it would address statehood, it would address us having our own organisations and probably a body that would be able to have a financial package that helps us to be more self-determining and run our own services,\" she said. \n\"Because at the moment it's basically done by a non-Aboriginal industry and very little of the Aboriginal dollar gets to the ground on the communities.\" \nMs Crawshaw said there were strong views among the group on a treaty and it could emerge that constitutional recognition could set up a treaty process and the establishment of a treaty commission. \n\"But there's also strong views about having representation in designated seats in Parliament, there's also strong views about having a body that is enshrined in constitution that can't be closed down like ATSIC and other bodies that have gone before that,\" she said. \nMs Anderson said there was a push in the dialogues for the survival of Aboriginal languages, for Aboriginal Studies to be taught in schools around the country, and the maintenance of culture and spirituality. \nShe said these issues could be addressed if constitutional recognition were to occur. \n\"We'll have some power to influence what happens in schools and what have you, otherwise we wouldn't be doing this if we weren't going to have any influence,\" she said. \nThe Referendum Council will continue to hold dialogues around the country with an aim to reach consensus on the issues. \nThere will then be a National Indigenous Constitutional Convention at Uluru in May, where a recommendation will be made for a report to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. \n\"We are eternally optimistic that governments will act on what it is we are proposing, history has shown us it is very difficult to get governments to act on what we want,\" Mr Christopherson said. \n\"There is nice words and a lot of things that are said but we need something to be done, not waffle about what they think is something that should be done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:07:27.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
