No one, even in Cameroon, gave them much of a chance even at this most open of Africa Cups of Nations. Yet they have reached the semi-finals for the first time since 2008 and will face Ghana on Thursday dreaming of a fifth Cup of Nations title and a first since 2002. They defended with great discipline in the quarter-final against Senegal and in the young goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa have had one of the players of the tournament – although before anyone gets too carried away, it should be noted the only team Cameroon have beaten inside 90 minutes is Guinea-Bissau .\nStill, given expectations and the buildup, this is a remarkable achievement. Eight players – Liverpool’s Joël Matip, West Brom’s Alan Nyom, Schalke’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, Nancy’s Guy N’Dy Assembé, Bordeaux’s Maxime Poundjé, Ajax’s Andre Onana, Marseille’s André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Lille’s Ibrahim Amadou – made themselves unavailable for selection before the tournament.\nVeteran keeper El Hadary the shootout hero as Egypt reach Afcon final Read more \nNot surprisingly, figures around the Cameroon team have hit out at the absentees. “When Matip and all these other players see how well the other players have done here by reaching the semi-finals,” said the former Cameroon striker Roger Milla, now a roving ambassador for the country, “I think that they now have regrets.”\nTheir Belgian coach, Hugo Broos, is 64 and had never managed an international side before. He had been successful in Belgian club football, winning three league titles in stints with Club Brugge and Anderlecht, but for the last decade his has been an itinerant career that has taken him to Greece, Turkey, Abu Dhabi and Algeria. He applied for the Cameroon job only after seeing it advertised online, having been out of work for a year after leaving the Algerian side NA Hussein Dey, and reportedly was not even on the Cameroonian federation’s initial five-man shortlist.\nFar from being weakened by the withdrawals, though, Broos has been gifted an inexperienced, dynamic and seemingly biddable squad devoid of any of the clashing egos that have so often undermined Cameroon in the past (although there have been murmurings about bonus payments this week).\nThere was a brightness and a panache to Cameroon as they drew against Burkina Faso in their opener and then having gone behind to Piqueti’s wonder goal for Guinea-Bissau, they had the wherewithal to come back with two excellent goals of their own in the final 20 minutes.\nFrom there, it has been a return to the more traditional Cameroonian virtues of resistance, a goalless draw against Gabon seeing them top the group as the hosts slipped out, before they weathered an early Senegal storm in the quarter-final, wearing them down before winning on penalties. “We have the possibility to write a beautiful page in our history and we do not want to stop here,” said the captain Benjamin Moukandjo, who plays for Lorient.\nMoukandjo, who scored a stunning free-kick in the draw with Burkina Faso, offers a dash of flair in the centre, the right-winger Christian Bassogog has impressed and Ondoa has made a number of spectacular – if not always orthodox – blocks, but there’s no doubting that it is defensive organisation that has carried Cameroon to this point.\nCameroon through to semi-finals after Senegal’s Sadio Mané misses penalty Read more \n“When I arrived,” Broos said, “I brought in some new players as 10 had just left the squad. I set some internal rules and disciplinary guidelines. We changed the mentality – the players are now highly motivated and proud to represent this country. We now have a solid group that works and acts as a team, and that’s had a positive impact on our results.”\nIt was also Ghana that Cameroon met in the semi-final nine years ago , a feisty game in Accra won 1-0 by Cameroon but best remembered for their defender André Bikey shoving over a paramedic . Ghana have been in every semi-final since but have still to add to the fourth Cup of Nations they won in 1982.\n“When you see sides like Algeria and Ivory Coast get knocked out,” Broos said, “predicting the future becomes quite difficult. The favourites don’t always win and that’s especially true here.” For Ghana, winning the Cup of Nations has become a burning need, particularly given this squad is still based around the side that won the Under-20 World Cup in 2009. Cameroon may be starting to feel the hurt of a 15-year dearth but for this unfancied squad, even a semi-final is a bonus.\n“We are not the favourites because we have a young team,” Milla said. “We came here to prepare the team for 2018 and 2019. Now that we have arrived in the semi-finals we also have the opportunity and possibility to go to the final. We will go to the final to try to win it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:17:59.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
