Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nAnd here's a little more from The Donald (below): \nBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nSeriously — Donald, you mad, bro?? \nBut more serious — how dictator-ish does THAT tweet look? \nRelated: News Stations Are Pulling Out Of #NerdProm Due To Trump \nThe courts have temporarily halted his immigration ban because a federal judge ruled it is unconstitutional. \nIn America , checks and balances make it so that this immigration ban can go through the court system and qualified people can decide whether it is actually legal or not. \nIs that not how they do things in Russia , Donald? \nScary to imagine just how quickly The Donald would love to dismantle the American court system if he could. \n#Dictator", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:24:56.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
