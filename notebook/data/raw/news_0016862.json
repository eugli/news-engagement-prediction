Nathan MacKinnon and Carl Soderberg also scored, and Calvin Pickard had 23 saves.\nColorado improved to 5-24-2 in its last 31 games. It also snapped a five-game skid at Pepsi Center, where it is 6-18-1 overall.\nAdam Lowry scored each of Winnipeg's goals, stopping a 21-game drought. The Jets had won three in a row.\nNieto broke a 2-2 tie midway through the second period, and Soderberg made it 4-2 2:04 into the third with his fifth of the season.\nThe game got heated midway through the third when Colorado defenceman Nikita Zadorov delivered an open-ice check on Mark Scheifele. It was the second hard check Zadorov had on the Winnipeg center, and Jets defenceman Jacob Trouba went after Zadorov. Both received fighting majors and Trouba a game misconduct.\nThe Jets pulled Ondrej Pavelec for an extra skater with 2:20 left and Nieto scored into the empty net in the final minute.\nPavelec finished with 23 saves.\nIginla, who has talked openly about wanting to finish the season with a contender, assisted on Soderberg's goal and scored on the power play 5:27 into the game. He has seven goals and seven assists in 49 games this season.\n\n\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:34:16.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
