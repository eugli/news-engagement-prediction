'I never thought women's football would get this big' \nRecent recruit to the Adelaide Crows - Sally Riley - explained what it means to be a part of the rapidly changing arena and her own journey of making a choice. \n\"Personally, I never thought women's football would get this big, especially in my playing lifespan,\" said the 25-year-old recruit from the Northern Territory. \n\"I guess I could see a national league starting in the future but never saw it happening in 2017 and the response from the public has been huge – well beyond what I expected,\" she said. \nRiley said she thought people had been surprised by the talent and passion in the competition. \n\"We are not out there just for kicks and giggles, we are there to strive for and experience that winning feeling and to improve and perform at the highest level week-in, week-out.\" \nAfter playing netball for 18 years the greater growth opportunities in the budding women's AFL competition forced Riley to quit the sport and make the tough decision to focus on football. \n\"I had never given football a go and with the opportunity to play at a national level while living in Darwin I knew I would regret it if I didn't put 100 per cent into getting drafted.\" Expectation more money will flow to women's footy players \nIt is common for talented male players to be flown from the southern states to be involved in the Northern Territory Football League season. \nThe expenses are paid for the athletes, even those in lower divisions, and with women's football on the rise Riley expects more money will be put towards female players. \n\"For me at the moment, the payment is a bonus,\" Riley said. \n\"It is something that has always been a topic of discussion even at club level sport – the boys get paid to travel for local football but the girls don't get the same treatment for travelling for netball. As things evolve this will no doubt change.\" 'Natural talent will only get you so far' \nRiley has advice for young Territorians who are coming through the sporting system – the same advice she received and embodied. \n\"Natural talent will only get you so far\" She said. \n\"It is your attitude, belief, effort and character that has the power to take you to the highest level. \n\"Always strive to do your best even on the tough days and the rewards will come. But most of all – Have fun!\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:59:57.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
