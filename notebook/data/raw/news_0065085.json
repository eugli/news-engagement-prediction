Donald Trump does not seem to relent on his executive order against immigrants The Washington Post reports that the new guidelines “call for the hiring of thousands of additional enforcement agents, expanding the pool of immigrants who are prioritized for removal, speeding up deportation hearings and enlisting local law enforcement to help make arrests.” READ ALSO: BREAKING: 11,000 protesters take to the streets against Trump victory (photos) The report said the guidelines are intended to help ease the implementation of a pair of executive actions Trump signed in January adding that the “policies represent a sharp break from the final years of the (Barrack) Obama administration and could reverse a sizable reduction in the number of deportations that occurred toward the end of President Barack Obama’s time in office.” But the administration of Trump reportedly made attempts on Tuesday, February 21 to douse growing fears about the ban on some immigrants into the country by saying the measures are not intended to produce mass deportations. The country’s Homeland Security Secretary John F Kelly said the policy would take time to implement because of cost and logistical issues adding that the security agents would be cautious in wielding their discretionary powers. Though globally kicked against, Donald Trump seems to be carrying out his campaign promise of ensuring an action against immigrants to the US. ​ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:32:06.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
