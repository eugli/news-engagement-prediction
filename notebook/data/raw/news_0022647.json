Seeking urgent action would necessitate support from five justices while waiting for the lower courts could allow enough time for Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, to be confirmed.\nThus, the question for the Trump administration becomes, appeal the decision now and gamble on receiving the support of five justices, or allow the suspension to stand for months and bank on confirmation of Gorsuch?\nBased on the sentiments expressed in President Trump 's tweet, an urgent appeal to the highest court is not out of the question.\nEmily Jashinsky is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Mexican official blames cartels on US demand for narcotics Luis Videgaray said the U.S.-Mexico plan to deal with the cartels cannot be a \"blame game\" between governments.\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/09/17 7:39 PM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:04:21.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
