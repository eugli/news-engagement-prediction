Growing up between there and her father’s home in nearby Detroit, Michigan, Wilson spent her days playing basketball and watching shows like Forensic Files with friends. Walking the runway never crossed her mind: “I thought modeling was very girly so I would get upset if you suggested it to me,” she says. “Also I never thought I was pretty enough to be a model, [because] I never saw models who looked like me.” It wasn’t until a friend presented Wilson with a magazine featuring Stacey McKenzie, the red-haired, freckle-faced ’90s Jean Paul Gaultier muse turned Canada’s Next Top Model host, that she felt modeling could be viable. She saved up her money for a train ticket to Toronto, and made the trip at age 18. “By the time I got there I only had $20 in my pocket and I was practically winging it!” Wilson says. Her gamble was rewarded when she was signed to Elite Toronto that same day. Wilson’s look isn’t her only selling point; her bubbly disposition and varied interests lend themselves to the industry’s recent personality-driven direction. A fan of anime (Hunter x Hunter is a favorite), spooky TV shows like The Twilight Zone , and cosplay updates on her inventive Instagram, Oddfreckles, as she's nicknamed, is appealingly offbeat. And when she arrived in New York for her first big season, it didn’t take long for Wilson to catch the attention of casting directors. Casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro tapped her to walk Alexander Wang’s #NoAfterParty event for her debut, for which, Wilson recall, her excitement level was through the roof. “I didn't know where we were going they loaded all the models on a bus like a field trip and then we were on our way,” she says. “I had read the Vogue article on where the venue could be [beforehand], and I was so excited.” And though she now has a behind-the-scenes view of the process, Wilson still occasionally gets starstruck when she runs into her favorites at castings: “I like Slick Woods; I think she’s so cool.” Having closed off her Fashion Week walking Marc Jacobs right alongside Woods, Wilson, it’s safe to say, has officially arrived—and is ready for whatever the future has in store. “[Fashion] is super fast-paced and spontaneous,” she says. “Things can change in the blink of an eye, but I’ve learned that if you want something you can have it as long as you work for it!” Recommended For You ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:06:50.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
