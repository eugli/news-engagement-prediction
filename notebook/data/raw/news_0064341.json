It's not ending tomorrow or even at the end of this season, but it's a fact we are going to have to acknowledge over the next year or two as fans. It's also a fact that the cast is already coming to realize . In fact, during filming for Season 7 the fact that the end is nigh actually contributed to tension, according to a few members of the cast. Here's what Liam Cunningham, who plays Ser Davos on the show, had to say in a recent interview: \nBecause we know we're coming to an end, and [because of] what we've been filming in Season 7 --- without giving anything away, things are coming to a head, so not only do we feel the passage of time ... that's also been reflected in what we're shooting. So it can be occasionally a little odd on set; it adds to the work and adds to the tension and we can use it, but I've never committed to a job like this before, this length of time. I've got a family on this that I'm gonna miss hugely. \nBecause Game of Thrones is expected to end at the end of Season 8, the show is currently working to wrap up all of the major plotlines. Although George R.R. Martin has said the ending will be more bittersweet than devastating, we're assuming there's going to be plenty of death and destruction on the way before the final moments of the show. From what Liam Cunningham is saying in his spoiler-free comments related to filming Season 7, things are \"coming to a head\" and that's what is contributing to the tension on the set. \nIf you don't think that sounds all that bad, Liam Cunningham isn't the only person talking out about Season 7. In the chat with Mashable , Jacob Anderson, who plays Grey Worm on the show, also explained the same sort of tension more vociferously, stating: \nIt doesn't feel like a panic, but I'm panicked for people, I think. I think, and this is true of Season 6, you can feel that things are coming to a close. It's all getting a bit much. The show's kind of like a pressure cooker... It's just absolute chaos. \nWe've heard about a few of the big spoilers that look to be coming to Game of Thrones Season 7, but despite a few big moments seemingly coming out ahead of time there's still a lot we don't know about the penultimate season. The fact there has been tension and chaos on the set seemingly means there will be a lot to look forward to, though. \nIf you'd like to know more about what is coming in Season 7, take a look at our what we know guide . Although Game of Thrones is premiering late this year , we'll be sure to let you know as soon as HBO gives us an official premiere date. Take a look at what HBO has coming this spring with our midseason TV premiere schedule .
