At just 6 km from the surface, it was the closest the spacecraft had ever been to the comet at that ... Image: Rosetta selfie 16 km from comet October 15, 2014 \nUsing the CIVA camera on Rosetta's Philae lander, the spacecraft have snapped a 'selfie' at comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko from a distance of about 16 km from the surface of the comet. The image was taken on 7 October ... Europe's comet chaser gets final commands to end its mission September 30, 2016 \nEurope's comet-chasing space probe Rosetta has received its last commands putting it on course to crash-land on the icy surface of the alien world it's been following for more than a decade. Final descent image from Rosetta spacecraft September 30, 2016 \nA new image of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was taken by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta spacecraft shortly before its controlled impact into the comet's surface on Sept. 30, 2016. Confirmation of the end of ... Rosetta's last words—science descending to a comet December 16, 2016 \nESA's Rosetta completed its incredible mission on 30 September, collecting unprecedented images and data right until the moment of contact with the comet's surface. Rosetta space probe takes sharp, close-up images of comet February 16, 2015 \nThe European Space Agency says high-resolution images the Rosetta space probe took during a swoop close to a comet it's been tracking for months show boulders on the comet's surface as well as \"stunning details of the contrasting ... Recommended for you Lowest-frequency accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar found February 22, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—Astronomers have found the lowest-frequency accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar in the X-ray source known as IGR J17062−6143. By analyzing the data provided by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) spacecraft, ... Surprising dunes on comet Chury February 22, 2017 \nSurprising images from the Rosetta spacecraft show the presence of dune-like patterns on the surface of comet Chury.
