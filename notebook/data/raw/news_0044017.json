Related Stories \nPM says govt considering using EVM in general elections \nAs the discussion about the stalled EVM project gathers steam following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent comments, Abdullah spoke to journalists on the issue on Sunday. \nAfter the new EC took charge, the prime minister told Parliament on Feb 15 that the government is considering introducing EVMs in the next general elections to further ensure the people's voting right in accordance with all existing laws for a free, fair ballot. \nHowever, the BNP sees 'hidden agenda' of the government's plan to use EVMs in that election - a position that puts the two major parties in a face-off. \nThe use of EVMs will make the casting and counting of votes faster and cheaper. \nThe EC headed by ATM Shamsul Huda used EVMs in some local government elections for the first time in 2010 and prepared the machines for the 2014 parliamentary election before leaving office in 2012. \nThe last commission of Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, however, discarded the machines amidst complexities over their use and the BNP's opposition. The technology was brought in association with the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and Machine Tools Factory but the project came to a halt after five years following EC-BUET dispute over technical glitch.\nThe KM Nurul Huda-led commission has taken the oath of office but has not yet made its position on the matter clear. \nAbdullah said he was yet to discuss it with the new commissioners. \nAsked whether it would be possible to prepare the machines for parliamentary election in the next two years, the EC secretary said, \"Several hundreds of thousands of EVMs will be needed. It's not a matter of joke. \n\"A great deal of research will be needed. We have a long way to go. It's not so easy.\" \n\"An industry will be needed to make the machines and we'll have to have that capacity and investment. \n\"We will have to be certain after trials that the machines will work flawlessly. The officials and the voters will have to learn how to use the EVMs,\" he added. \nIn his view, more than 300,000 EVMs will be needed for as many polling booths. \"Extra machines will also be needed as backup,\" Abdullah said. \nThe EC secretary, however, was all for re-launching EVMs in local government elections. \nHe said the EC will take the decisions on the matter after getting a report from its technical committee. \n\"We don't want to make something like the run-down EVMs in stock now. We want rigging-proof EVMs with battery backup,\" he said. \nHe emphasised raising confidence of the people and all the political parties in the EVMs before putting them to use. \n\"We will have to take the help of digital technology for voting. E-voting will be introduced later. Anyone will be able to vote from anywhere in that system,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:22:21.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
