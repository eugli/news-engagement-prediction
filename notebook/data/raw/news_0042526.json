I saw more than 20 people lying on the ground. Most of them were dead,” he said. \nAl Shabaab, the Islamist insurgent group that is fighting the UN-backed Somali government, did not immediately claim responsibility. \nAl Shabaab has been able to carry out increasingly deadly attacks despite losing most of its territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the Somali government. \nThis month Somalia elected a new president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a dual US-Somali citizen and former prime minister. \nThe attack underlines the challenge facing the new president, who has inherited an administration with limited control over Somali territory due to the presence of Shabaab, and is heavily propped up by the international community. \nThe president’s inauguration takes place on Wednesday, although he officially took office this week at a ceremony marred by a series of mortar strikes near the presidential palace, which left two children dead. \nAfrican Union troops drove Shabaab militants out of Mogadishu in August 2011 but the fighters continue to control rural areas and launch repeated attacks in the capital. \nCivil war has riven Somalia since 1991. Aid agencies warn that a severe drought has placed large swathes of the country at risk of famine.
