Classes or activities that begin at or after 10 a.m. will be held as scheduled. Only employees previously identified as performing essential services should report as regularly scheduled, unless advised otherwise by their supervisor. Penn State's leadership will continue to track and assess the storm, and will provide updates throughout the morning as necessary. \nAll employees and students are encouraged to take responsibility for their own safety. Faculty, staff and students should use their own best judgment when considering traveling to campus or the need to leave early during times of inclement weather. Faculty and staff also should review Handling Weather Day Absences (Human Resources Guideline 10) at http://guru.psu.edu/policies/OHR/hrg10.html for specific information on how time missed for weather situations is handled. \nAnswers to frequently asked questions about University Park weather events, visit http://news.psu.edu/story/181480/2015/11/24/health-and-safety/penn-state... .
