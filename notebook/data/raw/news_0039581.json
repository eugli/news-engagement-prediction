  \nAn autistic woman who was pimped out and raped by up to 12 men a night as a child has penned a heartbreaking poem about one of her abusers. \nTaylor Edison, who has Asperger syndrome, suffered two miscarriages before the age of 13 after being pimped out by someone she had trusted. \nOn a nightly basis, she would lie on a filthy bed, with tissues, wet wipes and a bottle of vodka beside her, waiting for her next abuser to arrive. \nQueuing up outside the bedroom, men would walk through the door and have sex with her, often without a condom and without saying a word. \nThey would then leave, so the next attacker could arrive. \nA few \"obviously embarrassed\" men would apologise to Taylor, perhaps ruffling her hair or kissing her forehead as they climbed off her small body. \nIn future years, she would be horrified to see them around her town, driving taxis and wandering around shops with their families, their secrets hidden. \nSCROLL DOWN TO READ TAYLOR'S POEM \nTaylor's name and her abusers' names are all pseudonyms Taylor describes her horrific ordeal in her new book, I Know What You Are (Photo: Harper Element) \nDuring her childhood, Taylor was also abused at other locations, she explains in her new book, I Know What You Are , published a week ago. \nThe 22-year-old, who goes by a pseudonym, has written a powerful and shocking poem about one of her abusers, titled The Guy In The Car. \nIt includes the lines: \"My muscles tighten, My belly hardens, As you invade\", \"Tears sliding down my soul\" and \"You pass me a tissue, Don't say a word.\" \nYou can read it in full below: The Guy In The Car \nI don't like you \nThe disgust as I turn away \nMy muscles tighten \nBack pressed in the clutch \nCry out \nTears sliding down my soul \nRed hot \nYou pass me a tissue \nDon't say a word \nYou never even said please \nOthers shake their heads \nGive me a long hard stare \nThey don't care \nThe disgust crawls across their face \nAs I turn up in your car \nPush me \nShove me into the back seat \nAnother man \nFrom the smooth cold glass \nAs an Asperger sufferer, Taylor struggled to fit into society as a child. \nGrowing up, she had difficulty making friends and communicating her feelings, while her mum had \"problems of her own\" and wasn't around much. \nThis meant she was an easy target for much older abusers, who befriended her before repeatedly raping her and pimping her out to other men. \nAt the time, Taylor, who had two miscarriages aged just 12, believed her attackers were her friends - something she desperately wished for. \nIn her eye-opening book, she reveals how she was \"befriended\" by an older, married man called Tom, who would cook meals for her.

He would then leave, in silence. \n\"Looking back on it now, I realise that he probably felt guilty and ashamed of what he was doing,\" she explains in her book. \nSpeaking to Mirror Online, Taylor adds that she \"didn't like\" Tom when she first met him. \nHowever, she says that he began coming round, cooking for her and letting her borrow his possessions - which meant a lot to her. \n\"It was the little things,\" she says, adding that how she felt about Tom's behaviour linked back to \"not having much as a child\". \nReferring to the later incidents in her mum's bedroom, she describes how the married man \"wouldn't talk to me after doing certain things\". \n\"I thought I'd done something wrong,\" she says. \"On the media, I'd see a couple sleep together then always cuddle up and have a cup of tea.\" \nAs a youngster, Taylor lived in a \"doss-house\" with her mother, where she was surrounded by \"weed-smoking\" adults, drug addicts and alcoholics. \nShe says she never knew her dad, while her mum often told her she was \"retarded\". \nShe was eventually diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. \nShe describes how she became so confused and lonely that she would have \"done almost anything\" to feel her mum loved her, or that she had a friend. \n\"I had a very blinkered childhood,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \n\"I didn't really have many other children around me to compare it to.\" \nShe says she realised her childhood was different from others' after starting school. \n\"When I started going to school. I'd say how many people we had staying at my mum's house... It made me start realising,\" she says. \nShe adds that, as a young girl, she would turn things into a \"monetary measure\". \nShe would notice that other children had new shoes, or had just been on holiday, and would ask her mum why she didn't have the \"latest things\". \nDuring her childhood, Taylor found a man dead from an overdose at her home and helped her stepbrothers to shoplift, according to her book. \n\"I was just five,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"We'd go out altogether. This is before the days of CCTV. I would go up to the counter and talk to the shop assistant. \n\"I would say I was looking for a present for my mum. I had a script telling me what to do. I would then change my mind and go out the shop.\" \nShe says her stepbrothers would steal products such as razors, perfume and DVDs. \nSeven years on, aged 12, Taylor got to know Nadeer, an 18-year-old from Asia who worked in a local fast food shop and she often saw \"around\". \n\"He was always outside the shop and would strike up a conversation,\" she says. Taylor is now a 22-year-old university student, with a young child \nFor their first date, the pair went on a drive and Naseer told Taylor he wanted to have sex with her. However, she was on her period so she refused. \n\"Afterwards, he told his friends and everyone at the park that I wasn't a girl at all and for a while they all made fun of me,\" she says. \nNaseer, who had aggressive and drug-dealing friends, would deliberately humiliate Taylor, according to her book, published by Harper Element. \nHe and his friends would call her a 'retard' and offer her cans of beer filled with cigarette butts - as she discovered after drinking them. \nThey would also hide her shoes and open the door when she was on the toilet. \nTaylor says she was still seeing Naseer when she started dating a 17-year-old boy called Karim, who was studying at a UK college. \nShe says he stood up for her when other people teased her, so when they slept together, she decided to tell her mum she had had sex with someone. \nThen aged 12, she was four years below the age of consent. \nIn her book, she says her mum replied: \"Aaaah, my little girl's all grown-up at last.\" \n\"The reaction was very bizarre,\" admits Taylor, describing how her mother then took her to the GP to get the contraceptive pill. \n\"The doctor was quite worried to say the least,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"That was another hint that this wasn't normal. \n\"The doctor was asking, 'is it because of your daughter's periods?\" \nShe says, despite the doctor's concerns, she and her mum left the surgery with contraception. However, she didn't ever take the pills. \nIn her book, Taylor describes how she started going to Naseer's friend Saleem's flat, where they'd play Grand Theft Auto together. \nShe also attended parties with the 25-year-old, where on one occasion, a huge man tried to rape her in the bathroom. \nShe says Saleem would \"test\" her to see if she could keep a secret and, before long, she was being raped by both him and his friends. \n\"That's when the truth finally dawned on me,\" she writes in her book. \n\"I hadn't been invited to the parties because I was Saleem's girlfriend, or even part of the group: I was at his flat to work.\" \nStill aged 12, Taylor fell pregnant for the first time. She says after Saleem found out, he got her so drunk on vodka that she blacked out and started bleeding. \nIt was shortly after this that, after arriving at Saleem's flat, Naseer told her to come with him to a house to see \"some boys\". \nThe next day, she returned to the house to find a queue already forming on the stairs. \nFrom then on for around six months, every night was the same horrific ordeal. \nShe was given alcohol, before being sent to the bedroom. There, she would swig from a bottle of vodka every time one of her rapists left the room. \nShe would use wet wipes and tissues to clean herself up. In her book, she estimates she was forced to sleep with between five and twelve people a night. \nBecause many of the men had come to the country via refugee camps abroad, she says they didn't have much money to pay for the sex with her. \nTherefore, the \"currency\" was a bag of weed, a bottle of vodka or a \"favour\". \n\"I disassociated a lot from that whole time period,\" she tells Mirror Online. \n\"I don't have many memories of it. I was always drinking quite heavily. It was a role I had to fit into. I would see it as 'it's time to go to work'.\" \nBefore she turned 13, Taylor fell pregnant again, losing the baby when another man pushed her down the stairs when she refused to sleep with him. \nAt this time, as well as regularly drinking, she had \"opted out\" of going to school. \nShe had a laptop that she was supposed to be using for home schooling. \nEventually, Taylor says she grew up from being a \"naive little girl\" and became aggressive, with pimps no longer able to trust her to stay quiet. \nShe became less popular and, aged 14, a 21-year-old man she had befriended persuaded her to go back to school, she writes in her book. \nAged 16, she became engaged to a man called Baashir and at 17, she fell pregnant. \n\"For the first few months it didn't feel quite real,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \nShortly before her and Baashir's wedding, however, she started suffering from mental health issues, which would see her \"switch\" and become aggressive. \nShe eventually gave birth to their child. \nBut she suffered post-natal depression, while her husband was allegedly stealing money from her to buy drugs like cocaine. \nHe would also strangle her, leading their child to try to strangle another kid at nursery after witnessing the attack, Taylor reveals. \nShe says, after this, she started fighting back. \nDetermined to build a safe future for herself and her offspring, she saw a counsellor - who made her realise what she had suffered was abuse - and went to college. \nToday, she has moved away from her mum's house and is studying at university. \nShe lives with her child, although she says she remains fearful social services could take them away after a previous experience with a social worker. \nShe says the worker said something about removing the youngster from her care after she complained about domestic violence - which is no longer a part of her life. \nNow, she says she has a loving partner who has helped her to move on. Meanwhile, she loves and cares for her child every day. \nAfter splitting with Baashir, Taylor alerted the police to a violent attack he carried out on her and social services visited her home. \nHowever, she didn't take any further action, believing the police involvement would have already served as warning to her ex-partner. \nWhen asked whether she would consider going to the police about men who previously abused her, she told Mirror Online: \"I'm not totally opposed to it. \n\"I wouldn't do it for my own sake, it would stir up other memories.\" \nTaylor says, however, that she would likely contact officers and tell them about her past if she \"had reason to worry about anyone else\". \nDespite what she's been through, the young woman says she doesn't feel angry for how her mum acted towards her. \nShe says she just \"feels sorry\" for her. \n\"I stopped contacting her for a little while and then got back in touch,\" she says. \n\"She's really good with my child.\" \nTaylor, who is on a waiting list for therapy, wants her offspring to have a completely different childhood from the one she had. \nWhen asked whether she'll tell her child about her experiences, she replied: \"I was wondering that myself the other day. I'm not sure about that yet.\" \nShe also says that, although she used to think the abuse was \"OK because I went there willingly in a weird manner\", she now understands it was not. \nShe says she hopes that telling her shocking story will help other people to realise that \"what is done to you isn't what you are.\" \n\"A grown man shouldn't be interested in a 12-year-old,\" she says. \nAuthor Jane Smith, who helped to tell Taylor's story, tells Mirror Online that it was a \"very difficult one to write\" because it was so \"distressing\". \n\"Taylor was someone I instantly liked. I couldn’t imagine what she went through. It was hard to hear it, \"she says. \n\"She's very clever. But because of her Aspegers, as a child, she couldn’t understand what was going on around her. \n\"She’s had to teach herself what people mean.” \nJane says she believes there are, “without a doubt”, other people across the country who are in the same situation that Taylor was. \n“It’s the story of a lot of people,\" she says. \n“A lot of young people are abused in this way. They may not realise it themselves, they’re just looking for affection,\" she says. \nShe adds: \"The abuse needs to be stopped at root. \n\"How can people do that to a little girl?\" I Know What You Are by Taylor Edison and Jane Smith is published by Harper Element (£7.99).
