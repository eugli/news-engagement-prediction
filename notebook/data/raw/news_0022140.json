They also placed 4,000 jobseekers who had mismatches between their skills and existing employment, up from 3,000 in 2015. \nMr Lim outlined three main priorities for MOM this year: Professional conversion programmes to help workers transit into new jobs and careers, helping small and medium enterprises (SMEs) gain greater access to professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) and building a more inclusive workforce, especially for rank-and-file workers. \nRising unemployment continues to be a concern for the Manpower Ministry, Mr Lim said, attributing the trend to both lower job growth due to the restructuring of the economy and an ageing workforce. \n\"We continue to apply our minds (to) what we can do, what more we can do to ensure we can keep it in check,\" he said. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:39:43.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
