Marmion's Michael Jaffe, right, reacts after pinning Sandburg's Miles Trahey at 106 pounds in Tuesday's Class 3A Hinsdale Central Sectional. (Mike Mantucca / The Beacon-News) Steve Millar Aurora Beacon-News \nAt Saturday's individual state tournament, Marmion sophomore Michael Jaffe fell one win short of winning a state medal at 106 pounds. \nJaffe fell 10-5 to Downers Grove North's Nate Cummings in the quarterfinal wrestlebacks. \nJaffe had to put that disappointment behind him in short order as the Cadets got ready to take on Sandburg in Tuesday's Class 3A Hinsdale Central Team Sectional. \n\"The first day or two after state, I was kind of down,\" Jaffe said. \"Coming out for the team is even more important than individually, though. I knew I had to come out here and come up big and get a pin for us.\" \nJaffe did just that, scoring a fall at 4:39 over Sandburg's Miles Trahey to help the Cadets topple the Eagles 34-27. \nMarmion (15-2) advanced to take on Lockport (25-0) in a state quarterfinal at 9 a.m. Saturday at U.S. Cellular Coliseum in Bloomington. \nJaffe and Trahey waged a back-and-forth battle, something Jaffe expected because the two split a pair of matches earlier in the season. \nThe lead traded hands several times and the match was tied 8-8 before Jaffe came up with the pin. \n\"He's a tough kid,\" Jaffe said. \"To get a pin against him was big. I just saw an opportunity and I was looking I'm going for it. It happened. I got the pin.\" \nMarmion's Nate Jimenez called his loss in the 160 state championship Saturday \"the toughest thing ever,\" but he bumped up to 182 for the dual and rebounded to get an 11-3 major decision over Sandburg's Alex Hirschfield. \n\"I just went out there and let it fly,\" Jimenez said. \"My dad always says that. There were no nerves. When I'm wrestling for my teammates, I'm more excited. When I'm wrestling individually, I'm more nervous.\" \nJimenez was excited for the chance to keep wrestling after Saturday's heartbreak. \n\"It's about not being selfish and wrestling for the team,\" Jimenez said. \"I wouldn't want to do it with any other group of guys. These are my brothers and I'm wrestling for them now. We're not done. We've got to keep working hard and keep our eyes on the prize.\" \nSelflessness was the common theme for the Cadets. \n\"We had a speech the other day about being unselfish,\" Marmion coach Donny Reynolds said. \"We've got to put whatever happened at (individual state) behind us for a week and focus on the team.\" \nTrevor Chumbley (126) got a pin for the Cadets while Austin Esposito (160), Peter Ferraro (170) and Anthony Cheloni (138) recorded technical falls. \nSean McKenna won by a 5-2 decision at 132. \n\"We've got Lockport now and it's exciting,\" Jimenez said. \"They're the guys to beat. To get that win would be incredible. We're ready.\" \nSteve Millar is a freelance writer for The Beacon-News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:53:01.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
