None other than Brock Lesnar. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below Big details of FIFA 18's My Journey mode have been announced \nIt's interesting to note that this match between Owens and Lesnar is scheduled to take place a week after Fastlane on March 5, RAW's last pay-per-view before WrestleMania 33 later this year. K.O. is rumored to defend his title at the show, meaning he might not be Universal champion when he enters his match against The Beast. \nHowever, it is Goldberg, not Lesnar, that is speculated to be winning the Universal title at Fastlane and walk into WrestleMania as champion. It is strange as well that Brock is billed first on the match at MSG, and not Owens, the current title holder. \nPerhaps this is, therefore, an indication that it will be The Beast Incarnate that defeats K.O. at Fastlane for the title, and not Goldberg, setting up a rematch between the two before he takes on the former WCW icon at The Showcase of the Immortals. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
