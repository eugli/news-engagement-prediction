But that’s not necessarily a bad thing: a majority of 52 percent said they were more likely to watch the ABC broadcast Feb. 26 now that they do know the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host has the gig. \nDespite this overall positive reaction to Kimmel, THR ’s survey — conducted by the National Research Group, which in early February canvassed 800 people (half Hillary Clinton voters, half Donald Trump voters) for their opinions about movies, award shows and politics — reveals that America is divided on the issue of Academy Awards hosts. \nNineteen percent of Trump voters said Billy Crystal was their favorite host, compared to only 11 percent of Clinton voters, while 17 percent of Hillary supporters picked Chris Rock as a favorite, compared to 9 percent for Trump voters. Both groups are equally indifferent to Seth MacFarlane (only 7 percent on each side chose him as a favorite) and equally hostile to James Franco and Anne Hathaway (neither cracked 5 percent with either group). \nThere is one host both sides were nearly equally enthusiastic about: Ellen DeGeneres. Twenty-five percent of Clinton voters and 20 percent of Trump supporters said she did the best job emceeing the Oscars. \nA version of this story first appeared in the Feb. 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
