We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters (sic)\" \nBut while it took most of the world by surprise, it looks like one person knew the news was coming all along. \nFour days before the announcement, a Twitter user with the handle @beyoncefan666 wrote: \"Beyonce is pregnant. She told me.\" \nBut what's even more spooky is that the same fan tweeted all the way back in July 2016 saying Bey would make the big reveal in February 2017. \nAnd not only that, she also shared a post in June 2016 saying that Donald Trump would be elected President of the United States and that the UK would vote to leave the European Union. \nThen there's a tweet written in August 2016 about Lady Gaga releasing an album in October and that she would be performing at the Super Bowl half time show.
