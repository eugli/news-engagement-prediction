By Brett Berk February 24, 2017 Mercedes \nAt this year’s Detroit Auto Show , Mercedes-Benz unveiled an updated variant of the flagship, six-figure sports car from its performance sub-brand, AMG, the GT-S. The 515 horsepower twin-turbocharged V-8 engine in this face-lifted vehicle splits the difference between the hairy, balls-to-the-wall lunacy of the 577 hp the same engine makes in the track-going GT-R and the not-exactly run-of-the-mill millwork it does in the base GT, where it produces “only” 469 hp. These varied iterations of one car are meant to demonstrate Mercedes-Benz’s interest in providing distinct motoring experiences based around distinct motor tuning. Some extra-spicy, some just picante; none mild. \nNow, Mercedes-Benz is trying a similar tactic with other AMG-branded products. The motivational source in this case is their prodigious 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 engine, designated the AMG 43. Depending on the tuning and vehicular application, the AMG 43 makes a robust 362 hp to 396 hp. It is thus meant to offer a middle road between the sufficient power and price in Mercedes’“entry level” luxury vehicles, and the tire-smoking performance and wallet-smoking price of its highest-test, AMG bahn-stormers. \nThe goal here is to create a kind of Goldilocks option—one that has some of the sporty add-ons like additional power, upsized wheels and tires, throaty exhaust, and special aerodynamic trim, but lacks the jarring ride, ear-splitting roar, and aggressive fender flares and road-scraping splitters of the most potent models. One that comes standard with all-wheel-drive for year-round traction, instead of rear-wheel-drive for constant powerslides. One that will allow you to enjoy additional performance without screaming at your neighbors (or spouse) every time you hit the start button. One that is, to quote the little blond burglar at the Three Bears’ house, “just right.” \nMercedes has stuffed this new engine into at least nine different models, and we had the opportunity to drive all of them in and around the beaches and mountains and canyons of Malibu. The AMG 43 engine is punchy, torque-happy, and flexible in every application. It can even be coaxed into making some incorrigible noises. It’s good everywhere. So which one is “just right” for you? Scroll through for our quick take on each, and find out. 1/7 Mercedes Mercedes-AMG C43 Sedan \nClass is the C-Class sedan’s best trick. Because of its stunning resemblance, inside and out, to its stately big brothers, the E-Class and S-Class, it seems like a far more expensive car than it is. \nHP/Torque: 362 hp/384 lb-ft \nMPG: 20 mpg City/28 mpg Highway \nPrice: $52,000 \nPerfect Buyer: This sportier version adds sass to the class, perfect for a guy who likes to dress up his tailored suit with the latest limited-edition trainers, and isn’t afraid to run hard if it’s called for. 2/7 Mercedes Mercedes-AMG C43 Coupe \nCoupes are sportier by their very nature: swoopier in appearance and more solid and stickier in their handling. While the bulging C63 Coupe looks a bit flashy and roided out, this subtle performer keeps its muscles hidden, but pumping. \nHP/Torque: 362 hp/384 lb-ft \nMPG: 20 mpg City/28 mpg Highway \nPrice: $55,000 \nPerfect Buyer: The guy who doesn’t need to be the biggest or showiest one on the court in order to enjoy (and succeed) in the game. 3/7 Mercedes Mercedes-AMG C43 Cabriolet \nThe best thing about contemporary convertibles is that they offer great versatility with very little compromise. Okay, the trunk space is reduced a bit and they're a wee bit costlier to buy and run, but differences in safety, wind noise, temperature control, and performance are negligible between open and closed cars. So, stop suffering and lower the roof. \nHP/Torque: 362 hp/384 lb-ft \nMPG: 19 mpg City/26 mpg Highway \nPrice: $60,400 \nPerfect Buyer: A guy who frequently likes to take off his shirt and show off a little. A suite of in-seat heaters allow said toplessness to occur over a wider range of weather than you might expect. That guy is the same way with his toplessness, right? 4/7 Mercedes Mercedes-AMG E43 Sedan \nThe E-Class is a bit more grown up and fancy—and perhaps a bit more conservative—than its younger sibling. But it more than makes up for its larger size and luxury trappings by hosting the most power of any of the AMG 43 cars (396 hp versus 362 hp). \nHP/Torque: 396 hp/384 lb-ft \nMPG: 18 mpg City/25 mpg Highway \nPrice: $72,400 \nPerfect Buyer: It’s for that older guy in your office who everyone wants to shirk off, but somehow always has the best, right answer, first. 5/7 Mercedes Mercedes-AMG GLC43/GLE43 \nHaving a family does not mean having to give up on fun. A sure-footed and roomy SUV can make it possible to still take adventures (or trips to Costco) even with kids. So it should be easy for this guy to explain to his spouse why it’s necessary to get the version with more power: it allows everyone to go further, pack more stuff, and get there faster. Right? \nHP/Torque: 362 hp/384 lb-ft \n0-60 Time: 4.8 seconds/5.6 seconds \nMPG: 18 mpg City/24 mpg Highway - 17 mpg City/23 mpg Highway \nPrice: $54,900/$67,150 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:09:12.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
