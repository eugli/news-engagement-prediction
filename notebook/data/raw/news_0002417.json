The then-president-elect posted mocking tweets about Schwarzenegger’s Celebrity Apprentice ratings. \n“I said, ‘Let’s sit on it for an hour,’” Schwarzenegger said. “I called my assistant and said, ‘I think what we really should do is request a meeting and go back to New York. And then we just smash his face into the table. And then I think we can’t do that either. I think I have to be above all of that and put him on the spot.’ ” \nThe tweets in question came from Trump, 70, on Jan. 6, and read, “Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary.” Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for…. \n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nSchwarzenegger responded by tweeting a quote from Abraham Lincoln and wishing Trump luck with his presidency. Please study this quote from Lincoln's inaugural, @realDonaldTrump . It inspired me every day I was Governor, and I hope it inspires you. pic.twitter.com/QRoOFTZfQ9", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:38:48.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
