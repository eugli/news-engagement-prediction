[Image by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images] \nRadar Online made the claims, alleging last year that Kardashian was “fed up” of Lamar and his attempts to win her back, despite their divorce. \n“Khloe’s told him she’s blocking his number and doesn’t want him to call so many times, but he just gets her new number or uses someone else’s phone,” a Kardashian insider said. \n“[Khloe] wants to move on in her life and it’s never going to happen with Lamar harassing her several times a day,” continued the source, alleging that Kardashian was seriously considering filing for a restraining order against Odom to keep him away. \nBut while Kardashian is yet to file for a restraining order against her former husband, she has been publicly gushing over Thompson in recent weeks as the wedding rumors continue to swirl around the couple. \nPeople reported that Kardashian revealed during a recent appearance on The Talk that she’s in a great place in her life thanks to Thompson amid the engagement rumors, revealing on the talk show last week that she’s “in a really good space right now in [her] life.” \n“I feel really happy and secure,” Khloe said, just weeks after her divorce from Lamar was finalized and as the engagement rumors surfaced. “I’m just in a really positive, healthy relationship.” \nWhat do you think of reports claiming Khloe Kardashian is ready to drop some serious cash to keep Lamar Odom away should she and Tristan Thompson get married? \n[Featured Image by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:18:13.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
