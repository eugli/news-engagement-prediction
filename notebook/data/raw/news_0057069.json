Leila de Lima—MARIANNE BERMUDEZ/INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nA cell inside the Philippine National Police (PNP)’s Custodial Center is waiting for Senator Leila de Lima should the court issue an arrest warrant against her over what she called false drug charges. \n“We are preparing the space,” PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos said in a press briefing at Camp Crame on Tuesday. \nCarlos said immediately after PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa offered the Custodial Center to De Lima, PNP’s Headquarters Support Service and the custodial service in charge already took “necessary action to prepare the space.” ADVERTISEMENT \nIf she would be arrested, De Lima might share the same detention center with former Senators Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada and Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr.. The ex-lawmakers have been detained at the heavily secured Custodial Center inside Camp Crame since they were arrested for plunder charges in 2014. \nDela Rosa earlier offered De Lima the Custodial Center, calling it one of the safest detention centers in the country.

The cases have been raffled off last Monday to its three branches. The RTC branches will then determine the issuance of warrants against her.
