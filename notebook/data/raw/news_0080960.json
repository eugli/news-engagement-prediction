Read More Seven reasons why Mancunians will feel right at home in San Francisco \nIt will get passengers across the pond in 11 hours, 20 minutes - as opposed to the current 14-hour journey via Heathrow. \nAnd dubbing the trend ‘Man-Fran’, experts say it will have a huge impact on our culture and business. \nThey predict a boom in entrepreneurs setting up shop in both Manchester and San Francisco. \nAnd drawing comparisons with ‘NY-Lon’, coined a decade ago to describe the super-commuters living between New York and London, they say the similarities between the two ‘silicon cities’ are clear to see. \nBoth are northern, have a tram network, passion for music, thriving LBGT and street art scenes. \nAnd, central to the relationship - both have flourishing technology industries. \nWhile San Francisco is built on a heritage of silicon - Silicon Valley is home to Google, Apple and Facebook - Manchester is rebuilding itself as a British tech hub. \nWe are now the second biggest tech hub in the UK with 52,000 working in a sector that produces £2.2bn ever year. \nProfessor Sir Cary L Cooper, Alliance Manchester Business School: “The idea of Ny-Lon, or a ‘single city separated by an ocean’, has been around for a while. \nThere are more direct flights daily between London and New York than trains from Kings Cross to Edinburgh. Read More Manchester's first ever direct flight to San Francisco will take off next year in boost to northern tech industry \nWith Manchester’s tech and creative industries booming, I fully expect direct flights between the city and San Francisco to catalyse something similar: a shared business outlook, a common personality and ever closer connections. Man-Fran will become a real trend over the next few years.” \nChris Baker, MD of UK Enterprise, Concur, added: “London may need to keep an eye on Manchester as the city’s relationship with the epicentre of US technology continues to grow.” \nCraig Keeper, Virgin Atlantic CEO, said: “Manchester is the San Francisco of Britain. \n“Digital, entrepreneurial, creative, cosmopolitan and dynamic: it’s got every ingredient to be a world class 21st century city. Our job is to connect like minded customers together and this new route does just that Read More Where can I fly to direct from Manchester Airport? All the destinations mapped \nOperating three times weekly, the A330 flights will connect the region with world famous landmarks such as Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and Fisherman’s Wharf. The airline will also launch direct flights from Manchester to Boston, and passengers will be able to fly on Virgin Atlantic aircraft from Manchester to JFK, New York. \nThe Man-Fran trend is be boosted again in May, when Thomas Cook will begin its direct flights to the Northern Californian city. Direct flights have been launched between Manchester and San Francisco What the business community is saying... \nNick Brooks-Sykes, director of Tourism at Marketing Manchester, said: “The USA is one of our most important markets, and with San Francisco’s strengths aligning so well with Manchester’s we look forward to welcoming a host of new business and leisure visitors to our wonderful city” \nMichelle Hua is founder of Made With Glove, which makes heated gloves. Her technical team is based in San Francisco. Her network, WoW - or Women of Wearables - also includes women from San Francisco and the flights will mean that people across the network can meet up and attend events. \nShe said: “My business is based in Manchester, but as my technical team is over in San Francisco as well as the many important wearable tech and Internet of Things (IoT) conferences that I like to attend, I have to spend a lot of time travelling between the two cities. Previously travelling has taken up a lot of time with changeovers, however the direct flights from Manchester to San Francisco allow me to use my time more efficiently to re-invest into my business.” \nNigel Danson founded Interact, a Manchester-based tech firm. He said: “I moved out to San Francisco to set up operations at the recently opened Interact San Francisco headquarters. As a result, our Senior Management Team now travel between Manchester and San Francisco at least bi-monthly, so the new direct flights will make sure that our time is used much more efficiently. \nWe are currently recruiting between both Manchester and San Francisco as both cities have such a thriving tech scene and strong talent pool. This new direct route will definitely enable the hiring process to run more smoothly for us, and ensure that we recruit the best available candidates for the role.” \nHugh Campbell, managing partner at tech firm GP Bullhound in Manchester, said: “By connecting our San Francisco and Manchester offices directly we will be able to do more transatlantic tech deals. Finally, we are truly bringing the NASDAQ to the North. This improved access for the tech and investment giants of Silicon Valley, will stimulate our region’s digital economy through knowledge transfer, talent and investment.” \nIan Barber, branch manager at Hunters Estate Agents, said: “We’re already planning for a predicted rise in high net worth professionals and entrepreneurs looking at second home ownership in the San Francisco Bay area, or indeed vice versa. The Man-Fran effect will be seen in the property sector first.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:37:20.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
