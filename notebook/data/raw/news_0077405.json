'Source of embarrassment' \nHowever, in January this year the organiser of the CES tech fair told the BBC it was \"a source of embarrassment\" that there was a small British presence at the event compared with other countries. \nMore than 177,000 people attended the 2017 gathering in Las Vegas, at which robotics was a theme. \nThe event drew thousands of exhibitors from around the world seeking investment, distribution deals and publicity, but France sent almost five times more tech firms than Britain. \n\"Britain's been a little slow to the game honestly. We have a minister from Britain coming but there's not a lot of activity that we've seen at CES,\" said Gary Shapiro, president of the CEA which organises the event. \nA spokeswoman for the UK's Department for International Trade said at the time that it offered \"targeted support\". \n\"We want to help UK businesses make the most of trade and investment opportunities including in the US, through targeted support and bespoke business matching that better maximises their presence to win vital contracts abroad,\" she said.
