ISIS seized Mosul in 2014 and it is now the last urban center in Iraq controlled by the group. \nAs the operation began Sunday, Iraqi forces dropped leaflets over the city urging ISIS fighters to surrender. \nThe risk of civilian casualties as the operation progresses into the heart of Mosul will increase significantly. There are 750,000 civilians in the western section of the city, according to the United Nations. Iraqi rapid response forces are seen through a shattered glass window of a military vehicle south of Mosul on Monday. Alaa Al-Marjani / Reuters \nThose civilians are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation, with only 40 percent of those trapped in the western part of the city having access to clean drinking water and 80 percent of basic items not available to most people, according to Georgina Sword Daniels, an advocacy adviser with the International Rescue Committee. \nIn addition, those trapped in the city face a dilemma as the Iraqi military approaches: to stay and risk being becoming a casualty of the conflict, or to try and flee, but risk ISIS' wrath. \n\"If they decide to stay they might get caught in the crossfire,\" Daniels told NBC News. \"If they flee, they face a very dangerous journey, going across front lines, maybe being shot at by ISIS.\" \nShe added: \"Also, there are a lot of landmines and explosive devices lying around the city. We've seen from other places in Iraq that have previously been held by ISIS, people have come across these devices and been killed and injured by them. It's a pretty impossible decision either way.\" Mark Hanrahan ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:56:14.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
