Eight others had arrived on Friday. \nEmerson, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Winnipeg and close to the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota, has seen the porous border - in many areas with no official crossings - drawing greater numbers of asylum seekers since US President Donald Trump's travel ban. \nThe Republican took office in January and promptly signed an order to temporarily ban US entry for nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries, and for all refugees. \nUnder a bilateral agreement, asylum-seekers from the United States are usually turned back at Canada's border crossings.

Ninety-nine people crossed the border since the beginning of the year to seek asylum, local authorities say. \nThe trend has officials in Emerson fretting. They have asked federal and provincial authorities to increase resources to address the situation. \n\"Illegal crossings are dangerous and a burden on our local communities, and our laws must be enforced,\" Tony Clement, a Conservative spokesman for public safety issues, said on Twitter.
