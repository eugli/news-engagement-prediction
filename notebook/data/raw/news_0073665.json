The film managed to earn only Rs 6.07 crore on day one at the box office, after witnessing very low occupancies throughout the opening day. The movie needed to see a huge improvement on Saturday to be able to make a mark at the box office. But trade estimates suggest that it hasn’t been able to do so. According to India Today, Rangoon has managed to rake in around about Rs 7.50 crore on day 2. And while this takes the total tally of the movie to Rs 13.57 crore after two days, we expected it to be much higher. \nWith 1800+ screens at its disposal and a star studded star cast (Saif, Shahid and Kangana), we expected the film to at least rake in Rs 18-20 crore in two days. Rangoon was also one of the most anticipated films of the year. However, looks like low buzz and mixed reviews might have played spoilsport for the movie’s box office run. Even today, the occupancy of the movie has remained low during the morning shows. But with today being Sunday, we expect Rangoon to see a good growth in the evening shows and rake in a good amount of money.

However, even though it collects Rs 22 crore in three days, it will be a dismal start for Rangoon coz a lot was expected from a film of this magnitude. Shahid, Kangana and Saif have delivered their career best performances in Rangoon and people have been talking about it on social media. This word of mouth publicity will help the film grow and sustain, but the main test will be on the Monday Litmus Test. We will have to wait and see how well the film manages to hold its audience.
