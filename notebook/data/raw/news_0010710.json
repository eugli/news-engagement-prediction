But as the trooper tried to make the stop, Fletcher allegedly faked pulling over and drove away. The GSP believes Fletcher took off because he does not have a license.\nHe was also indicted last June on forgery charges as part of a credit card scam, Channel 2 Action News reported.\nChannel 2's Tyisha Fernandes reports. The trooper chased Fletcher on I-20 eastbound before losing track of him. Fletcher sped off in a 2011 Audi on the I-20 exit ramp to Gresham Road, jumped the curb, crashed into the sign at the Gresham Road Texaco and knocked it down, Channel 2 reported.\n“The trooper was unable to make the exit ... but noticed smoke, moved over to the shoulder and backed up to the Gresham Road exit,” the GSP said.\nSurveillance footage shows the Audi flipped over, narrowly missing an SUV, before crashing.\nHis girlfriend’s daughter, identified Tuesday as Serenity Largie of Decatur, was ejected from the Audi and taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. The girl was not wearing a seat belt, Channel 2 reported.\nFletcher is being held at DeKalb County Jail.", "external_links": ["https://players.brightcove.net/1345087319/rkw6LSiQ_default/index.min.js?videoId=5307700682001", "https://twitter.com/ga_dps/status/827273429170532354", "https://players.brightcove.net/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/gsp?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-03T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:57:15.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
