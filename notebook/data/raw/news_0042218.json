Eight varieties are available: Plain/Cinnamon, Chocolate Frosted, Maple Frosted, Maple Nut, Coconut, Sprinkle and Vanilla. \nMcClintock said they’re seeing a lot of interest from those who work late, including nurses on the night shift. \n“It goes on the general theme of college students and other people in the area, you know, who are up late at night and are looking for something to snack on,” he said. “…It caters to kind of a new niche market.” \nThe dairy will deliver anywhere within a three-mile radius of the dairy, located at 602 S Ashley St. \nCustomers may place an order anytime between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. by calling 734-662-3244. The approximate delivery time-frame is 30-45 minutes, depending on demand. For orders of 10 or more dozen donuts, at least 12 hours advance notice is appreciated.
