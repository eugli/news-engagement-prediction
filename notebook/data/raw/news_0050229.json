Why should I resign?” he retorted. Well, because his campaign to win the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election is going pear-shaped.\nEven his old soulmates on Merseyside are quitting, unhappy with the behaviour of a politician Gary Lineker once called Paul No-truth-at-all.\nBut this isn’t the United Kingdom Irritation Party for nothing. His heavies elbowed me to one side as the great leader mounted the stairs to a hustings meeting.\nIf looks could kill, I would be six feet under by now. Nuttall’s numpties don’t do embarrassing publicity.\nRead More UKIP leader Paul Nuttall gives three-hour Hillsborough witness statement - and FINALLY condemns slurs by donor Arron Banks Labour candidate Gareth Snell canvasing for support from voter Janet Riley (Photo: Daily Mirror) As he arrived at the meeting in a medical institute in the North Staffordshire town, one of his bodyguards, fitted like something out of an American movie with wires behind one ear, asked: “Is there a Green Room?”\nIt was hard not to laugh at the idea of a hospitality-and-retiring suite in such an austere place, but there are times when mirth is unwise.\nThis by-election is no laughing matter. Jack Dromey MP, Labour ’s campaign manager in the city, calls it “a defining moment” in political history: an acid test of Ukip’s grandiose claim to be the true representative of the working class.\n“There is a raft of discontents here,” he told me. “Real and understandable. But Ukip is trying to exploit that discontent to make Stoke the Ukip capital of Britain. Voters are alarmed about what that would do for the image of their city.\n“It could put people off, slash house prices and scare off investment.”\nPaul Routledge out and about in the Stoke-on-Trent constituency (Photo: Daily Mirror) Labour’s Gareth Snell, a local, who is married and has a six-year-old daughter, counters Ukip’s negative strategy with a positive Plan for the Potteries.\nHe pledges to fight for a special Brexit deal for the city’s ceramics industry, and to oppose Ukip plans to sell off the NHS.\nAlthough Stoke voted heavily in favour of Leave in the EU referendum , Gareth, 31, believes his opponents have overestimated the message of the poll.\n“ Brexit means Brexit. It doesn’t mean Ukip,” he said on a tour of the Bucknall housing estate. Nuttall is already playing down his chances, insisting that defeat “wouldn’t be terminal”.\nThere is also a Tory candidate, Jack Brereton, 25, and looking younger.\nTheresa May paid a flying visit, but I sense that the Government wouldn’t be too unhappy if Ukip wins.\nIt will be a race down to the wire. Labour is throwing everything into the last day of campaigning to elect Gareth, a former council leader and an official of Unison looking after public service workers.\n“Labour has always stood up for local people here, whether it’s building our first new hospital for a hundred years and defending vital children’s centres,” he says.\n“The Conservatives have done nothing for our city and now they’re trying to sell off £1.2billion of cancer and life care in North Staffordshire.\nStoke Central (Photo: Getty) “And Ukip’s plans for our NHS are clear – sell it off to the highest bidder.”\nGareth’s local links might just prove the winning ticket over the blow-in from Bootle. “That’s important to me”, said local resident Scott Barratt, 27, a retail manager, after meeting him on the doorstep.\n“And he came across as really honest.” I wish I could bring you a report from the Ukip front line, where much of the gunfire is coming from behind the candidate’s back.\nTwo senior party officials in his native Merseyside resigned over “upsetting and intolerable” remarks made by Nuttall about the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. That’s what prompted me to ask when he was going to resign.\nHonest, I tried to play “Hunt the Nuttall” on the stump in rainy Stoke all day but it wasn’t possible.\nHis aides prevaricated for hour after hour, refusing to say where or when he would be canvassing.\nHis website had closed “for maintenance” and followers couldn’t access his Twitter account. Covering dozens of by-elections in the past half-century, I’ve never known such an elusive politician. What has he got to hide from Mirror readers?\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next Online transgender star who inspired her own doll Watch this video again Watch Next Girl uses deodorant at school - now she's been ex 0:44 Police inspector reveals update on woodland hunt 0:36 Kind-hearted M&S checkout operator makes shopping 0:29 UK weather: Atlantic jetstream to bring SNOW and 1:39 Police are going undercover posing as cyclists in 0:34 Video will play in Emotional Paul Nuttall talks about Hillsbrough Share this video Watch Next In desperation, I stopped a random selection of people at Hanley shopping centre, showed them a picture of the fugitive candidate, and asked if they could indentify him. About half didn’t even know who he was.\nThey are not alone. For once, his hero, Donald Trump, got it right.\nAsked about Paul Nuttall, he replied, “Who?” So much for Ukip’s plan to turn the city into Stoke-on-Trump.\nThe Ukip leader has fathered more porkies than a Tamworth saddleback. He thought he could con Potteries folk with stories of being a professional footballer with Tranmere Rovers and losing someone close at Hillsborough.\nNuttall was caught out in those fibs and many more.\nHe put out a leaflet showing Jeremy\nCorbyn with the slogan “Labour wants to keep you in the EU”, despite the Commons vote for Brexit .\nJack Dromey drives home the point: “Ukip tried to portray us as the party that wants to keep the UK in the EU. Not true. We are very clear: Britain will leave the EU.”\nAt times, this political contest has looked like something out of a comic novel by Arnold Bennett, the famous Potteries writer.\nPaul Nuttall at the UKIP conference (Photo: Getty) Mr “No-truth-at-all” clearly fancies himself as Denry Machin, hero of The Card, dedicated to the cause of cheering people up.\nBut he only shares one thing with that character: “His opinion of himself, having once risen, remained at ‘set fair’.” Inflated by his own vanity, he thinks he can swan 70 miles down from the Mersey and take the votes of the Potteries for granted.\nHe didn’t live where he said he lived in the constituency, his party is a phoney friend of working class people and he’s promised to skedaddle back to Bootle if he loses. “When”, that ought to be, and it certainly can be.\nOutside Stoke public library stands a larger-than-life stainless steel statue of a steelworker, erected in memory of the thousands who worked at the city’s long-closed Shelton steelworks.\nIts plaque reads: “I believe in the dignity of labour, whether by hand or head; that the world owes no man a living, but that it owes every man the opportunity to make a living.”\nNuttall came down the M6 believing that Stoke-on-Trent owed him a living at Westminster – on top of the one he already has in the European Parliament as an £84,000 a year plus expenses MEP for the North West.\nTomorrow, 57,000 Stokies have a prize opportunity to remind this over-confident carpetbagger that the\ndecision is theirs, not his.\nI urge them to take it, by going out to vote Labour and sending local lad Gareth to speak for them in the mother of Parliaments.\nRead More Paul Nuttall Paul Nuttall's Hillsborough claim Press officer takes the blame Millionaire donor complains Nuttall branded a coward Nuttall claims he's the victim Paul Nuttall breaks cover Nuttall begs for support Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics Comments Show more comments More On UKIP Brexit Politics", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1456/4221396001_5331331797001_5331320897001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2504/4221396001_5331391524001_5331372140001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2360/4221396001_5330791867001_5330768368001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3008/4221396001_5331221225001_5331198811001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3056/4221396001_5330938624001_5330929317001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/993/4221396001_5327262505001_5327234651001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://i3.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article9828082.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS111904711.jpg", "http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/ukip-chief-paul-nuttall-branded-9828076"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:51:36.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
