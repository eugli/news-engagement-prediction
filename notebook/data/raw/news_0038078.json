I think it’s nakedly partisan.” \nHe pointed a finger at the New York Times in particular, recalling a time when he saw overwhelmingly negative pieces about Trump in just one issue. He called it a “very partisan paper masquerading as a paper of record.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:12:02.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
