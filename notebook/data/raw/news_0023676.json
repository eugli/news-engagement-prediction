Think about those sneakers you meant to replace by now. Or that pair of boots that looks great and fits not-so-great. \n\"If your shoes don't fit properly, over time your skin reacts to the friction by getting thicker as a protective measure,\" says Camp. \"And if it gets too thick then it will crack and fissure.\" \nYour solution: Fight friction with friction. \nYou could go for weekly pedicures—or you could make minor foot care part of your shower routine. It takes less time than shaving, it's an excuse to soak up the steam a little longer, and it feels good. \n\"Bathing your feet in warm water for a few minutes will help saturate that top layer of skin,\" says Camp. Then, choose your weapon. For an all-natural approach, use a pumice stone ($4.94, amazon.com ) . It gives your shower a \"volcanic spa in Hawaii\" feel. But even better for getting the job done is the classic callus remover ($9.99, amazon.com ) . \n\"These often have handles, which I find more ergonomically comfortable,\" says Camp. \"And they have two surfaces, coarse and fine.\" \nStart with coarse. The job is toughest when you first begin. After a few showers, or when attacking more sensitive areas like the side of a toe, use the fine side. \nA good, hard buff of the heels will yield tangible results. Just don't let them go to waste. When you get out of the shower, put moisturizer on your feet to lock in the smoothness. \nLike all things skincare, perfectly smooth heels take time, and require some maintenance. Yes, that’s a commitment. So maybe you’re saying, “No one notices my feet.” Maybe you're convinced that your girlfriend appreciates your “rugged\" heels and the way it accidentally scratches her while you’re sleeping. Convenient and romantic, right? No. Exfoliate your heels before they exfoliate someone you love.
