His win upset the plans of the union’s executive, which had handpicked a consultant who had never worked as a teacher as its favoured candidate. \nBarton, who steps down as head of King Edward VI school in Bury St Edmunds, said: “I am delighted to have gained this mandate as ASCL general secretary. I want to thank the association’s members for their encouragement over these past few months. The level of support has been both inspiring and humbling.” \nBarton secured 2,716 votes to the 677 votes for Chris Kirk, the former PwC consultant backed by the executive.

There’s never been a more important time for leaders, in our various roles across all types of schools and colleges, to speak with a distinctive, authoritative, united voice.” Nativity play-per-view: it’s a sure sign there’s a financial crisis in schools | Geoff Barton Read more \nSian Carr, ASCL’s president, said: “The election has inevitably divided opinion, as elections always do, but what unites us as school and college leaders is far stronger than any differences we may have. \n“The membership has made its choice through an open and democratic process. Today, I have called on all members to unite in supporting the new general secretary.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:06:40.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
