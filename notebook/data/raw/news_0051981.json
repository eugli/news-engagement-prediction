Rooney has a £35million-a-year offer to quit Old Trafford and move to China where the transfer window closes on Tuesday. Mourinho insists that he wants his captain to stay but has not ruled out that Rooney could leave after nearly 13 years. Jose Mourinho admits he cannot guarantee Wayne Rooney will stay at Manchester United The United boss insists he is happy for Rooney to stay at the club and would not push him out ‘Of course I can’t guarantee,’ said the United boss. ‘I cannot guarantee that I’m here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season? ‘What I can guarantee is that if one day Wayne leaves the club it is not because I want him to leave the club. I would never push a legend of this club to another destiny. ‘You have to ask him if he sees himself staying in the club for the rest of his career or sees himself moving.’ Asked if Rooney could go as soon as next week, he replied: ‘It is not a question for me because I am happy to have him. You have to ask him, not me. I was very open with you in the answer. I don’t want him to leave Rooney trained at Carrington on Tuesday but will not feature for Manchester United in France Rooney trained at Carrington Tuesday after missing the last two games through illness and injury but did not travel with the rest of the United squad to France for Wednesday night’s Europa League clash with St-Etienne. It remains to be seen if he will feature in the EFL Cup final against Southampton on Sunday in what could be his last Wembley final for United. Mourinho added: It was the first time he trained and didn’t even train 100 per cent with the group. ‘You saw 15 minutes open to the press and, yes, he was doing the warm-up and basic things after that. But then when the training session was high in intensity, he was not training. ‘He has no chance for tomorrow. He’s not here, he stayed back training. Let’s see for the weekend.’ Ashley Young shares a joke with Rooney as the Red Devils prepared for their St Etienne test RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:19:04.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
