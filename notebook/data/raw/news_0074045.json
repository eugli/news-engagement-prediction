Jeff Van Gundy (ESPN Images) \nUpdated at 11:08 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:08 p.m. ET \nJeff Van Gundy is a straight shooter, and he kept it real again on Saturday night. This time, he had his sights set on the All-Star game. \nWhen broadcaster Mike Breen asked Van Gundy during the Cavaliers-Bulls matchup if he liked this year'sÂ All-Star game, Van Gundy delivered a classicÂ response. \n\"You know, Mike, I think the players have left the commissioner only one thing to do with the All-Star game âŚ abolish it,\" he said. \nYou can hear the rest of Van Gundy's comments here: Jeff Van Gundy is đŻđŻđŻ pic.twitter.com/ua6ViZjDu2 â TotalProSports.com (@TotalProSports) February 26, 2017 \nVan Gundy has a point. While the All-Star Game is about the fans, it hasÂ just become nothing more than a overly friendly, buddy-buddy get-together among NBA players. \nYes, it's really just a marketing ploy. Yes, it's an exhibition. \nYes, they're all friends off the court, for the most part. But even through all this, does it really have to bleed into the on-court product? \nMORE: Van Gundy wants NBA to get tougher on domestic abusers \nCan we get some defensive stops? Anthony Davis is still dunking. There's also zero defense played, and the glorified night offÂ is starting to lose as much juice as the slam dunk competition. \nAnd now, with unfair All-Star snubs and the NBA essentially admitting they prefer star power over deserving players ( Carmelo Anthony over Bradley Beal , as one example), it's quickly becoming something of a joke. \nThe NBA and TV networks probably cringed when they heard JVG's comments, but that shouldn't matter.Â Van Gundy's 100-percent correct, and if nothing else, hopefully there are some NBA players listening.
