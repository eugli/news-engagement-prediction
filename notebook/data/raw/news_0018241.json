So, we’re trying to get some money together.” \nSandor’s daughters have reached out to the public for help and started an online fundraising campaign to pay for the rising costs. \nREAD MORE: Ontario couple killed in Tennessee wildfires were set to celebrate 50th wedding anniversary \n“We’re just not going to have enough to cover the cost of him coming home … which is what he really deserves,” Abramo said. \n“He was like the glue in the family. He was such an amazing man and you know, he was just a few hours away from his destination when this happened and we’re completely shocked. We never thought it would be his last trip.” \nSzilvia said Sandor was in New Mexico for business and was dropping off a package at the time of his death. \nREAD MORE: ‘He had no fear’: Family remembers Ontario man killed in Mexico nightclub shooting \n“Even when I told him not to, ‘Why don’t you just fly it down over there?’ But no he was just a hard worker and he just wants to do everything on his own. And then he just did it,” she said. \n“Very sad. Heartbroken. Shocked. Like there is no word for that, how we feel. It’s just terrible. It’s just absolutely terrible.” \nAbramo said Sandor was “very modest’ and would not have wanted to make a “big deal” out of arrangements for his funeral. \n“We’re going to miss him so much,” she said. “But we have to get him home, he has to be with us so that’s why we set up a fundraiser.” \nWith files from Peder Myhr, Jasmine Pazzano and The Associated Press \nSandor Tarkanyi is being remembered as an “amazing man” who was the “glue” that held his family together.
