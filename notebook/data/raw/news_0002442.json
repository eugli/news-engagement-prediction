(Photo: MECC) \nI never felt like I fit in. \nAnd it wasn't just me. It seemed that everyone else my age – those of us born in the late 1970s and early 1980s – just didn't fit neatly into the generational lines that had been drawn for us. \nIf I talked about the formative experiences of my childhood with friends a few years older, like playing \"The Oregon Trail\" on a brick of a computer in elementary school or wearing ripped flannel while head-banging to Nirvana in high school, they simply couldn't relate. \nBut explain this world to people a few years younger, and they looked at me like I had three heads. How old and quaint and … sort of depressing, they said. \nIt didn't make sense. How could we feel so outcast when everyone just slightly older or younger seemed to fit the Generation X and Millennial molds? (No wonder grunge music was so popular with us in high school.) \nEventually, I felt like I had to choose a side. I said I was a \"proud member of Generation X\" in my bio for work, even if I felt like some strange hybrid, because that's where my birth year falls. What the heck is Generation Oregon Trail? \nThen a friend shared with me an article about Generation Oregon Trail . And it all became clear. \nIt argues that we are part of a microgeneration whose childhoods were basically analog. We grew up writing notes to each other (on paper!) and playing in the street. We had the carefree innocence of a life not lived on social media. \nYet we came of age just as everything was turning digital. Which explains why we grew up with cassette tapes yet voraciously consumed everything we could on Napster. The Internet quickly became our friend. \nOthers have made similar observations about those born during this small window of time, though perhaps because we are such an enigma to everyone else, there's no agreement on what to call us. (Personally, I like Generation Oregon Trail, because the best way to win that game is to buy more bacon, and who doesn't like bacon?) \n► Related: Play 'Oregon Trail' online ... for free \nThere is wide recognition that the traditional way of dividing generations every 15 to 20 years doesn't work anymore. Behavioral differences now divide generations, and thanks to technology, that's occurring more often. Those born in the years surrounding the divide are increasingly becoming their own distinct group — a microgeneration. Why our microgeneration suddenly matters \nThe cool thing about being born in 1979 (or thereabouts) is we were exposed to the best of the analog and digital worlds — and that has uniquely equipped us to feel at home in both. It also means we were born at the ideal time to navigate the strange world in which we now live, a place that is being turned on its head by technology and social change. \nThose grounded in the analog world are having a tough time adapting: Witness the election of President Trump and the appeal of \"draining the swamp.\" They feel like society is leaving them behind. \nBut those who know nothing more than the digital world are equally lost: They absolutely cannot understand why those in the analog world are so upset. Progress is good, right? \nUs Oregon Trailers have both the cynicism and the optimism to broach this chasm, to bring understanding among the warring factions. Or at least not let their protests completely ruin our lives (remember, we more or less patented the word \"whatever\"). \nWe're the go-betweens — and, maybe, the most resilient ones in the chaos around us. \nNot bad for a bunch of kids who grew up thinking we had no place in the world. 158 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:43:32.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
