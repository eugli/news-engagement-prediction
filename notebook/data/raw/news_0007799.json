The Howard Hughes Corp. Though the schedule for completing construction of Elk Grove's outlet mall remains unclear, a leasing brochure posted online suggests more than 20 businesses have committed to joining the center. The brochure from commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield bills the unfinished mall, called The Outlet Collection at Elk Grove, as \"the single entertainment and dining destination for couples & families in one of the fastest growing communities in the country.\" An early rendering of The Outlet Collection in Elk Grove, released in 2014. The Howard Hughes Corp. An accompanying map includes several new tenants: Nike , Victoria's Secret , Columbia Sportswear , Zales , Rack Room Shoes and Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse. The mall will also have an unnamed eyebrow-threading business as well as a fragrance outlet, according to the map. In addition, the map reveals some food tenants, including Starbucks and Zpizza . A dining area apparently will feature a cluster of some relatively small eateries: DJ's Taco, China Max, Chicken Now, Meatball Spot, Little Tokyo, Patty Shack and Tropical Sensation. It appears that some of those restaurants are in other outlet malls. An eatery called China Max is in the Great Mall in Milpitas, and a restaurant called Chicken Now has locations in outlet malls nationwide. The leasing brochure for Elk Grove's outlets also confirms other tenants previously reported by the Business Journal, including Guess , Express , American Eagle Outfitters, H&M, Francesca's, Forever 21 and a movie theater. Some previously reported tenants, such as shoe retailers Steve Madden and Asics, are not listed on the map. The Wilton Rancheria tribe also wants to develop a casino resort , 302-room hotel tower and convention center on 36 acres within the site of the planned shopping mall on the south end of Elk Grove. Casino opponents have sought to stop its development with a referendum. On Monday, representatives of mall developer The Howard Hughes Corp. declined to comment on specific tenants or the construction schedule for the shopping center. But in a prepared statement, the real estate development company said, \"As we make progress on securing tenants and moving forward with development, we continue to receive positive feedback and enthusiasm from the retail community regarding the casino resort and are optimistic that it will continue to generate additional interest.\" The center will include more than \"440,000 square feet of outlet and traditional mall retailers,\" the brochure states. Shoppers can expect \"50,000 square feet of regional and national dining options,\" it says. Last year, an Elk Grove official said that half of the center would need to be leased before construction work would begin. The outlet mall, which is northwest of where Highway 99 meets Kammerer Road, will fill an area once expected to become an upscale lifestyle mall. First proposed by a previous owner several years ago, the mall was left half-finished due to the recession. Media representatives from some of the listed tenants, including Nike and Victoria's Secret , did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional details.
