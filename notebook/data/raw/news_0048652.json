auction: Ben Stokes, Tymal Mills cash in as franchises chase pace \nBen Stokes was snapped up for a record price of Rs 14.5 crore and compatriot Tymal Mills came a close second as England cricketers led the demand for pace-bowling players in the IPL auctions in Bengaluru. cricket Updated: Feb 20, 2017 13:17 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times Exciting England all-rounder Ben Stokes will turn out for Rising Pune Sunrisers in IPL 2017 after the franchise snapped him up for a record Rs 14.5 crore in the player auctions in Bengaluru on Monday.(Getty Images,) \nAll-rounders and fast bowlers, especially left-arm pacers, and leg spinners were in much demand in the Indian Premier League auction as England’s Ben Stokes and Tymal Mills, and Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan made the headlines .(IPL auction, live updates) \nRising Pune Supergiants broke the bank to get Stokes for Rs 14.5 crore and Royal Challengers Bangalore got T20 specialist pace bowler Mills for Rs 24 crore, for 24 times his base price. \nBut the story of the day was Afghanistan’s 18-year-old leg-spinner, Rashid Khan, being bought for Rs 4 crore by Sunrisers Hyderabad. \nRead more | IPL auction: Ben Stokes goes for record Rs14.5 cr to Rising Pune Supergiants \nINDIAN PLAYERS \nAmong the Indians, Railways leg-break bowler Karn Sharma was bagged by Mumbai Indians for Rs 3.2 crore and Tamil Nadu left-arm pacer T Natarajan was picked for Rs 3 crore by Kings XI Punjab. Known as a death-overs specialist with accurate yorkers, Natarajan came into focus in the inaugural Tamil Nadu Premier League. \nIt was a big pay day for Karnataka’s spin-bowling all-rounder K Gowtham, left-arm pacer Aniket Choudhary and all-rounder Pawan Negi as well. Gowtham and Choudhary were picked for Rs 2 crore by Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore respectively. Pawan Negi was bought by RCB for Rs 1 crore. \nIshant Sharma and Irfan Pathan went unsold on first offer. \nRead more | IPL quick fix: Fast bowlers the hot picks at Indian Premier League auction \nENGLAND PLAYERS \nThe England players were fresh in memory of Indian clubs and Stokes, Mills, Chris Woakes amd Eoin Morgan profited. Woakes was picked by Kolkata Night Riders for Rs 4.2 crore and Morgan by Kings XI Punjab at his base price of Rs 2 crore. Tymal Mills went to Royal Challengers Bangalore for Rs 12 cr. (Getty Images) \nStokes was outstanding across formats throughout the tour of India, which ended last month. The all-rounder went for only Rs 1.5 crore less than the all-time highest bid of Rs 16 crore for Yuvraj Singh. \nStokes, however, will not be part of it at the crucial knockout stage as the England players are likely to leave for national duty after the first week of May. \nRead more | IPL auction: Rising Pune Supergiants show intent with record Ben Stokes buy \nCALCULATED RISK \nPune coach Stephen Fleming defended their move to go all out for the all-rounder. “We now are in a situation to back youngsters and we have some big-time players. There is an element of risk when spending big-time money, but we are ready to take that risk. \n“We look strong on paper. It’s the top eight that you really have to respect. You have got three captains, so you have leadership. We have bowlers, all-rounders in Mitch Marsh and Stokes,” said Fleming at the auction in Bengaluru. \nDelhi Daredevils made the early buys, getting two tearaway fast bowlers and two all-rounders. Their best pick was South Africa pace sensation Kagiso Rabada for Rs 5 crore. While there was no doubt about Rabada going big, Delhi also paid a whopping Rs 4.5 crore for Australian Pat Cummins. \nCummins’ career has been hampered by injuries but he is capable of extreme pace when fit. He had showed how effective he can be when he had rattled India at the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, bouncing them out at the R Pramadasa Stadium, claiming both Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni in a spell of 4-0-16-2. \nFOREIGN FAST BOWLERS IN DEMAND \nOverall, as expected, foreign fast bowlers were in most demand, with left-arm pacers making hay. Apart from Mills, Rabada and Cummins, there was strong bidding for Trent Boult. The Kiwi left-arm pacer, who can swing the ball at pace, was snapped up by Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 5 crore. Mitchell Johnson was also sold, at his base price of Rs 2 crore, by his old club Mumbai Indians. Boult was part of the winning team Sunrisers Hyderabad last season but hardly got to play, and Johnson had helped Mumbai Indians win the IPL in 2013. \nMILLS MAKES HAY \nMills benefitted as a lot of franchises got into bidding for him. Mumbai Indians, Punjab, KKR all stretched the price before RCB could get their man. RCB needed a replacement for Mitchell Starc and went on to claim Mills for what could be the highest price for a bowler in IPL auction. RCB had Rs 5 crore added to their purse after Starc dropped out on the eve of the auction. Apart from being a like for like replacement, the advantage of having the left-arm quick is that, unlike other England players, Mills will be available for the entire season. \n“He can bowl at 150 kph and has a really good slower ball. I saw him at the Big Bash first hand,” said RCB coach Daniel Vettori. \nAFGHANISTAN’S IPL FIRST \nAll-rounder Mohammad Nabi became the first Afghanistan player to be picked in the auction. An off-spinner and middle-order batsman, Nabi has been the backbone of the Afghanistan team for the last five years. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:01.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
