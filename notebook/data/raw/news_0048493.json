Presenting Isan food will benefit Thai tourism a lot,” she said. \nOn average, Japanese women spend five per cent more than men. \nIf Thailand can draw more Japanese women to visit the country and try Isan dishes, it will be possible to boost the cuisine’s popularity, helping food vendors in the process, said Ms Kobkarn. \nShe is confident that launching more tourism campaigns could increase the number of Japanese women visiting Thailand by 30 per cent. \nThis year, Thailand expects to attract 1.7 million Japanese tourists, generating 66.2 billion baht (US$1.9 billion) in revenue. \nLast year, the country welcomed 1.43 million Japanese travellers, up 4.1 per cent from 2015, generating 61.4 billion baht (US$1.75 billion), up 6.3 per cent, said the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). \nAccording to a TAT survey, the most popular tourist destinations for Japanese travellers are Bangkok, Chon Buri, Phuket, Chiang Mai and Ayutthaya. \nMs Kobkarn said the ministry has launched numerous campaigns to attract women that have been well-received by Japanese visitors, especially executives seeking to reduce stress by enjoying Thailand’s nature and hospitality. \n“New tour packages will be offered along with various activities and campaigns to lure Japanese women to spend more in Thailand,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:53:46.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
