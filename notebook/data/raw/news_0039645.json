Jeremy pictured in London last week (Photo: WENN.com) Jeremy shared this picture of Caben-Albi (Photo: Instagram/Stephanie Davis) \n\"We know that Jeremy really wants to meet his son, but to tell a national newspaper he has seems a little odd. \n\"We can only think Jeremy wants to bolster his image as a decent dad - but this isn't the right way to do it.\" \nSteph has previously said she has no objection to her ex, who she met in CBB , having a relationship with Caben. \nYesterday sources close to Jeremy told The Sun: â€œIt was an emotional reunion between him and Stephanie but close pals were glad to see the pair finally putting their past behind him.\" Jeremy reportedly flew to Liverpool for the meeting (Photo: WENN.com) \nThe alleged meeting came a week after Jeremy confirmed he was the father of Stephanie's baby, after initially questioning his paternity. \nIt was originally thought Jez had met the baby over the weekend, when he shared an adorable picture of Caben-Albi to social media. \nFans immediately thought he had taken it himself, but Jeremy actually posted the picture after he took it from ex Stephanie 's private social media account. \nA source close to Jeremy said at the time they were in discussions about the future but admitted his post was very misleading as he definitely hadn't met his newborn son.
