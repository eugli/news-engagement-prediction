But Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in his sprawling district, so he must choose his words about the president with more caution than Democrats in deep-blue districts. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The National Republican Congressional Committee included his seat among its three dozen initial targets in the 2018 midterm elections. Mr. Kind might have another idea in mind: He has not ruled out a run for governor in 2018, when Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, could seek a third term. At the town hall meeting, Mr. Kind was blunt about his current level of influence: Like it or not, Republicans are in the driver’s seat. “They control the agenda,” he said. But voters had ample concerns to share. “I think we’ve got somebody at the helm now that makes Captain Queeg look stable,” said George Nygaard, 69, who asked about putting a psychiatrist on staff at the White House, embracing an idea put forth by Representative Ted Lieu , Democrat of California. Mr. Kind was noncommittal, saying he would talk to Mr. Lieu and noting that there was a medical doctor with the president all the time. “And yet mental health is just as important for any commander in chief,” he observed, before steering away from the subject. Mr. Nygaard said later that he understood why Mr. Kind had chosen not to take a stand regarding the president’s mental health. “He’s in that kind of district,” he said. “We’re purple.” Photo About 200 people showed up to meet with Mr. Kind at the American Legion. Credit Lauren Justice for The New York Times Mr. Kind responded to the man who brought up the Civil War by expressing concern about what he described as “the tribalism that’s been created in this country.” He encouraged people to diversify their sources of news. The congressman offered particularly forceful words when asked about Russian hacking and the election, drawing a parallel between that matter and two grave events in American history. “Make no mistake,” Mr. Kind said. “We were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941. We were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. And we were attacked on Nov. 8, 2016, with outside foreign government interference in our election process.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The session also brought out some of the soul-searching that is still playing out for Democrats, growing out of both Mrs. Clinton’s jarring defeat and the party’s presidential primary. In the Wisconsin primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won decisively in Mr. Kind’s district, though the congressman backed Mrs. Clinton. One questioner, noting that Mr. Sanders won the district and that Mr. Trump prevailed there in the general election, asked Mr. Kind what he would say to working-class voters who “feel disenfranchised with the leadership of the Democratic Party.” The query drew enthusiastic applause from some in the room. Mr. Kind said the heartland could not be treated as “flyover country.” Another questioner, reminding Mr. Kind how many of his constituents voted for Mr. Sanders in the primary, asked if he would voice support for Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota in the race to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Ellison supported Mr. Sanders in the presidential race. Mr. Kind emphasized his longstanding friendship Mr. Ellison — a law school classmate of his — but he also offered positive words about another candidate, Thomas E. Perez, who was labor secretary under President Barack Obama. By the time things wrapped up, Mr. Kind offered to hold another meeting in the area so he could field more questions. He was also able to do something that Republicans battered at town meetings might envy: He thanked everyone for their civility.
