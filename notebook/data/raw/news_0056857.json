Key points: The new directive would reverse guidelines allowing transgender students to use bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity Conservative advocates say the Obama-era directive violated fixed gender students' rights Transgender legal advocates said civil rights were matters for the federal government \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday the current directive, issued last August, was confusing and hard to implement. An official with knowledge of the plans said anti-bullying safeguards would not be affected by the change. \nThe official was not authorised to speak publicly about the plans and did so on condition of anonymity. Mr Spicer did not say when the Trump administration action might actually come. \nA federal judge in Texas put a temporary hold on the Obama guidance soon after it was issued, after 13 states sued. \nEven without that hold, the guidance carried no force of law. But transgender rights advocates said it was useful and necessary to protect students from discrimination. \nOpponents argued it was federal overreach and violated the safety and privacy of all other students. \nAlthough the Obama directive carried no force of law, transgender rights advocates said it was necessary to protect students from discrimination. State vs federal rights \nMr Spicer said the Departments of Justice and Education were working together on the new document. \n\"The President has made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer in states' rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level,\" he said. \nThe Obama administration's guidance was based on its determination that Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education and activities, also applied to gender identity. \nWhile not legally binding, that guidance sent a warning schools could lose funding if they did not comply. \nRepublicans pushed back against that directive, arguing the federal effort was an example of the Obama administration meddling in state and local matters. \nThe reversal would be a major setback for transgender rights groups, which had been urging Mr Trump to keep the safeguards in place. \n\"By rescinding these protections, the Trump administration is compromising the safety and security of some of our most vulnerable children,\" American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said. \n\"Reversing this guidance tells trans kids that it's OK with the Trump administration and the Department of Education for them to be abused and harassed at school for being trans.\" \nConservative activists hailed the change, saying the directives were illegal and violated the rights of fixed gender students, especially girls who did not feel safe changing clothes or using restroom next to anatomical males. \n\"Our daughters should never be forced to share private, intimate spaces with male classmates, even if those young men are struggling with these issues,\" said Vicki Wilson, a member of Students and Parents for Privacy. \n\"It violates their right to privacy and harms their dignity.\" Trump turnaround on transgender bathroom choice \nDuring the election campaign, Mr Trump originally said transgender people should be able to use the bathroom they feel was appropriate, but changed tack after coming under criticism from fellow Republicans, saying it should be a matter for states to decide. \nTransgender legal advocates criticised the \"states' rights\" argument, saying federal law and civil rights were matters for the federal government to enforce, not the states. \n\"Since when does the United States make your civil rights subject to your zip code?\" said Eliza Byard, executive director of LGBT student advocacy group GLSEN. \nThe federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. \nBut it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person's gender identity. \nThe US Supreme Court could settle the issue in a case due to be argued in March. \n\"Title IX never talked about this,\" Mr Spicer said. \n\"It was enacted in 1972. There was no discussion of this back then and to assume certain elements of the law were thought of back then with respect to this would be completely preposterous.\" \nThe draft document challenges the Obama interpretation that Title IX protects gender identity, saying it has \"given rise to significant litigation\" and has confused educators who have \"struggled to understand and apply\" the previous guidance. \nAP/Reuters First posted February 23, 2017 09:27:01 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:30.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
