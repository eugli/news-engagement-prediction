His RBI single in the fifth inning off of Rangers reliever Brady Dragmire brought home the first run of the game. Full Game Coverage \n\"I'm out there having a great time with a new team,\" Brinson said. \"Just trying to come back and do it right, just kind of show them what they missed out on. I wanted to go deep, but three hits will work better. It was fun seeing all those guys again, seeing the old faces. Having a good game makes it even sweeter.\" \nBrewers right-hander Junior Guerra , who was the club's PItcher of the Year in 2016, made his first start of the spring and pitched a scoreless inning. Guerra gave up a one-out double in the first to Shin-Soo Choo but struck out Rougned Odor and Mike Napoli . \nRangers knuckleballer Eddie Gamboa made his first start and pitched two scoreless despite allowing five baserunners. Brinson led off the game with a double and Gamboa picked him off second. Gamboa also got out of a bases-loaded jam in the second by striking out Michael Reed and getting Ivan DeJesus to fly out. \n\"It has been awhile, it was fun to get my feet wet and get back out there,\" Gamboa said. \"It's competing, when you get between the lines, you've got to strap it on and get after it.\" \nBrewers Up Next: Zach Davies makes his spring debut when the Brewers return home Tuesday to host Ned Yost's Royals at 1:05 p.m. CT on Fox Sports Wisconsin.
