Recalling the day when Sasikala was ousted and later welcomed back into Poes Garden by Jayalalithaa, Panneerselvam said, “I was called inside Poes Garden on the day Sasikala had returned. Amma (Jayalalithaa) told me separately that day Panneerselvam, I have only asked Sasikala to return, not her relatives.“ \n\nOn Monday, Sasikala speaking to the party cadre and the media outside Veda Nilayam claimed that but for a crucial pep talk she gave Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu would not have had its second and largest woman chief minister. \"After Thalaivar (MG Ramachandran) died, Amma (Jayalalithaa) told me: 'Sasi, I do not want all this now',\" Sasikala told the press referring to a moment that she claimed was Jayalalithaa's indecisiveness over her political journey. \n\nShe moved on with little restraint to touch upon an event of harassment that even Jayalalithaa seldom recalled. Describing the scene as Ramachandran's hearse was stationed for public view, Sasikala said: \"Just as Amma was laying the wreath, relatives of Janaki (Ramachandran's wife) started assaulting her. Jeppiar (a strongman-turned ­educationist who passed away recently) was hitting her... They had pushed her from the vehicle. I, standing below, caught hold of her as she fell.\" On reaching Poes garden after the assault, Jayalalithaa had \"fainted right here\" Sasikala said pointing at the door step of the Veda Nilayam residence. \"I sprinkled water on her face. When she regained consciousness she vowed to quit politics. But I told her they have literally pushed you out of the scene. Just for that, you need to climb back.\" \n\nPeople seemed to be lapping up every bit of these new versions trickling out.\"Of course there is excitement among the public who are getting to hear versions of what was considered to be a palace secrets at one point of time,\"said political analyst Perumal Mani. Forwards of fake recordings of Perumalsamy, a personal security officer of Jayalalithaa were already doing the rounds.
