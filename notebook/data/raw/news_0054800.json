I'm focused on fixing the youth justice system, something the Liberals failed to do for four long wasted years,\" she said in a statement. \nRioting teens have caused more than $3.3 million damage to the state's youth justice centres from July 2015 to November 2016. \nA riot in Parkville last year made the centre uninhabitable and prompted the government to move detainees to the adult Barwon maximum security prison near Geelong. \nThat move was then fought in the Supreme Court by human rights and Aboriginal Legal Service lawyers. \nEarlier this month, Ms Mikakos, Premier Daniel Andrews and Treasurer Tim Pallas announced a new $288 million youth jail for Werribee South. \nThe announcement has been met with fierce opposition from nearby residents who question how the site west of Melbourne was selected.
