As the President has expressed many times, he hopes to achieve peace throughout the Middle East region. The Trump administration has not taken an official position on settlement activity and looks forward to continuing discussions, including with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he visits with President Trump later this month.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:26:54.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
