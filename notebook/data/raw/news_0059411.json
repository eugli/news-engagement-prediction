While there are many who are breaking away from the usual 9-5 job pattern and are taking up their passion turning it into a profession, not many are able to handle the ever evolving challenges of workplace, which in turn disrupts the work-life balance. However, there are many ways that one can handle stress at their workplace in an effective way and can emerge victorious in gaining back that work-life balance back. AT talks to professionals on what causes the stress and how to handle: Keeping up with the trends From buying, selling and even advertising a product is going big on the digital front. So in such a situation keeping oneself constantly upgraded about the new skills and learning something new to keep up with the competition is one of the major causes of stress, asserts Shaival Desai , entrepreneur. \"While we do need manpower to get our work done, but today, more than experience it's their skills that is the deciding factor. Also keeping yourself constantly upgraded about what's happening in your field creates a lot of stress.\" How to handle it: Shaival shares, \"One of the best ways to keep stress at bay is talking it out. Whether to a friend or a professional, it always helps. Talk it out to someone who can guide you or who can assure you that this rough time shall too pass.\" No thorough understanding With so many startups emerging constantly, it is important to understand your product before you go all gung-ho about it, suggests Sandeep Patel , CEO, of a waste management company. \"While it is good that so many start-ups are coming up, the major problem is that either there is lack of funds or you have so much fund that you don't know how to utilise to the maximum. Another major reason is that not many have the thorough knowledge of their product so, when they are out in the market, they get flustered by small hiccups. Also, these days, people don't focus on getting the right team, which can help to sail through tough times. \"Putting the right team together is half the battle won.\" How to handle it: Sandeep adds, \"In order to feel less stressed at work, it's important to have the right team, with the right skills to help you out when you feel lost.\" Lack of patience \"As a service provider while we have the patience to listen and understand what the client needs, many a time the client comes to us with unattainable deadline, so it becomes mandatory to give our 100% under such circumstances. Also since we also can't forego important clients we end up putting in more time which leads to stressful and long working hours,\" shares Radhika Bhuptani, a brand consultant. Lack of patience and intolerance leads to one of the most pivotal and important causes of stress - competition, says Abhishek Patel, operations manager with an e-pharma startup. \"Competition is one of the major reasons for stress because all of us know that the day we stop performing, our jobs will be at stake, and there are many in the market ready to take our positions. So keeping ourselves constantly upgraded, understanding the product thoroughly, attaining deadlines, constant competition â€” all of this leads to stress.\" How to handle it Dr Prashant Bhimani, consultant psychologist shares, \"Competition, anxiety and constant comparison are the major reasons for mental as well as emotional stress, today. Regular exercising, healthy diets, short vacations is a good way to de-stress. Taking professional help is not a taboo anymore. More importantly do or learn something which keeps you happy.\" Dr Ankur Dave, corporate medical consultant, shares, \"Although many corporates keep regular health and other rejuvenating activities, one must follow a healthy pattern of exercises and good food regularly to keep stress and ailments at bay. Jogging, swimming, yoga , squash, or a brisk walk everyday for 30-45 minutes, release endorphins, which are good for your body and your mood as they fight stress, keeping you healthy.\" Tips to keep stress at bay: Exercise regularly and eat healthy Take out at least 30-45 minutes daily to do what keeps you happy Talk to someone whom you trust and who can help you out Short breaks certainly helps you to get back to work with gusto Getting enough sleep is a must as it helps in concentrating better  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:48:17.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
