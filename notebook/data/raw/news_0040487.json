Bonner returned to the show on Friday (February 17) to debut a remix to one of those songs featuring some very familiar faces. \nDeGeneres hooked Bonner and his students up with all the resources to make a hit music video for their song “Read It”: sets, props, cameras, and, of course, superstar cameos. Big Sean joins the kids in rapping about the joys of reading while riding a scooter, and Migos , Ice Cube , Ty Dolla $ign , and Lin-Manuel Miranda also contribute some bars to the cause. If you ever wanted to hear Sean Don boasting, “Man, you know I love to read,\" here’s your chance. \nBonner first appeared on Ellen in January, where the host donated $25,000 to South Greenville elementary school and created a GoFundMe page that has since earned over $80,000. This time around, Bonner returned with all of his students in tow, and discussed how the funds have impacted their lives — check it out in the cute clip below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:33:51.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
