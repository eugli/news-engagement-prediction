Shots were fired during the fight, and Torian was hit. \nWarrants have been issued charging Richard Jackson, 16, with first-degree murder in the case. He wasn't in custody Tuesday, and police said they believe he might be staying with family in Virginia. Hess said he is should be considered armed and dangerous. \n\"Right now, we have one side of the story. It is important that you turn yourself in so that you have an opportunity to get this off your chest,\" Hess said in a plea to Jackson to surrender. \n\"As a parent, my heart goes out to both parents in this tragedy,\" Hess said. \"The tragic loss of life tonight has forever impacted two families.\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:58:01.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
