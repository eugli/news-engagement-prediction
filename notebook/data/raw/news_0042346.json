Eric Greitens took to Facebook this weekend to slam St. Louis aldermen for a bill adding reproductive health decisions to the city’s anti-discrimination ordinance. \nThe bill, which took effect last week, bans employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, use contraceptives or are pregnant. \n\"This bill attacks clinics that help women,\" Greitens wrote. \nThe change has been met with opposition from nonprofit \"alternative to abortion agencies,\" sometimes called \"pregnancy resource centers,\" which counsel women against having abortions. Greitens allocated $6 million in funding for such clinics in his 2018 budget proposal. \n\"Now St. Louis liberals and the National Abortion Rights Action League are trying to undermine and destroy them,\" Greitens accused. \nBills moving through the GOP-led Legislature would effectively block the changes to the ordinance on the grounds that it inhibits the free speech and religious rights of alternative-to-abortion agencies. \nAldermen have already raised concerns that signing such measures into law would undermine a city's local control. \nGreitens said he would team up with lawmakers but did not mention that legislation specifically, and a spokesman for the governor could not be reached for comment. \n\"We're working with legislators, faith leaders, women's advocates, and anyone who values life to fight back against this Abortion Sanctuary City movement,\" Greitens wrote.
