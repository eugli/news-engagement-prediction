(Robert Jones/CBC)\nBut it also veered into the personal.\nAnti-nuclear activist Chris Rouse, who is one of two non-lawyers registered to ask questions at the hearing, called the three NB Power vice-presidents \"lifers\" for spending most of their careers with the utility and wondered whether they were partially responsible for its financial troubles.\n'Do you think you deserve a raise?' - Chris Rouse, anti-nuclear activist He then asked whether they felt they were entitled to raises this year, a decision Murphy said would be made by others.\n\"That's not what I asked,\" said Rouse. \"Do you think you deserve a raise?\"\nMurphy said it's not relevant what he thinks.\nNB Power seeks average 2% rate hike for all customers next year NB Power predicts much higher rate hikes after carbon tax Rouse then said he would be opposing the portion of the rate hike that will be used to finance raises.\nSubsidies criticized Also questioning the three vice-presidents Monday was former utility employee Greg Hickey, who has been critical of the way NB Power subsidizes several large industrial customers.\nKeith Cronkhite acknowledged the large industrial renewable energy purchase program, where NB Power buys renewable energy from large mills at a high price and then resells it back to the same mills at a lower price, often involves phantom transactions.\nCronkhite said NB Power often never takes possession of the electricity it buys under the program since the mills consume it as it is produced.\nThe program costs NB Power several million dollars per year and is expected to grow larger next year.\nGoal to reduce debt $1B NB Power has been pursuing a long-range goal of paying down $1 billion in debt but has fallen well behind on that plan. It missed its profit target last year and again this year by nearly $120 million combined, although that was before accounting for last month's ice storm.\nIt has also already announced the likelihood of missing next year's profit target, even if it wins a two per cent rate increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:38:13.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
