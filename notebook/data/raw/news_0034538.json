Getty By Gina Mei Feb 15, 2017 The controversy surrounding one of President Donald Trump's most contentious cabinet picks just got an extra boost. In a political cartoon published in the Belleville News-Democrat on Monday, conservative artist Glenn McCoy recreated Norman Rockwell's iconic painting \"The Problem We All Live With\" â€” with education secretary Betsy DeVos at the center instead of civil rights activist Ruby Bridges.
