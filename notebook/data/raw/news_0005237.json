In addition to its annual “Shamrock Shake,” and for a limited time only, the fast-food giant is debuting a new Chocolate Shamrock Shake, a Shamrock Chocolate Chip Frappe, a Shamrock Hot Chocolate, and a Shamrock Mocha, Brand Eating first reported. The shakes are already available at some McDonald’s locations, though not all are participating, notes Consumerist. AND YES, SAVANNAH HAS IT!

Before, customers could ask McDonald’s servers to make a mint-chocolate version of the drink. These are the seasonal offerings that you can get at a participating McDonald’s mcd near you: Chocolate Shamrock Shake: This drink is “layered,” meaning there’s a chocolate shake on the bottom and Shamrock Shake on top. According to Brand Eating, it’s topped with whipped cream, green sugar crystals, and chocolate syrup. Shamrock Chocolate Chip Frappe: A Chocolate Chip Frappe is blended with Shamrock Shake syrup, Brand Eating reports, and is also topped with whipped cream, green sugar crystals, and chocolate syrup. Shamrock Hot Chocolate: A hot chocolate combined with Shamrock Shake syrup, according to Brand Eating. Shamrock Mocha: A mocha (which is chocolate syrup, espresso, and steamed milk, notes Brand Eating) mixed with Shamrock Shake syrup.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/UMKEOcM64K"], "published": "2017-02-02T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:58:47.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
