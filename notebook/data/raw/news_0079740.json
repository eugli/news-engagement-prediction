Key points: Donald Trump says the budget will be about public safety and national security President's budget plan needs to be approved by Congress US already spends about $759 billion annually on defence \nMr Trump will seek to boost Pentagon spending by $US54 billion ($70 billion) in his first budget proposal and slash the same amount from non-defence spending, including a large reduction in foreign aid, a White House budget official said. \nThe President does not have the final say on federal spending. \nHis plan to ramp up military spending is part of a budget proposal to Congress, which, while it is controlled by his fellow Republicans, will not necessarily follow his plans. \nMr Trump told state governors at the White House that his budget plan included a \"historic increase in defence spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America\". \n\"This is a landmark event and message to the world in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve,\" he said. \n\"We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one thing: win.\" \nOfficials familiar with Mr Trump's proposal said the planned defence spending increase would be financed partly by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-defence programs. \n\"We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people,\" Mr Trump said. \nSuch a hike would be unusual given that the United States is not engaged in a major war, although its special forces and Air Force are active against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. \nAn official familiar with the proposal said Mr Trump's request for the Pentagon included more money for shipbuilding, military aircraft and establishing \"a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints\" such as the Strait of Hormuz and South China Sea.

(ABC News: Giulio Saggin, file photo) \nThat could put the United States at odds with Iran and China. \nThe US military is already the world's most powerful fighting force and the United States spends far more than any other country on defence. \nDefence spending in the most recent fiscal year was $US584 billion ($759 billion), according to the Congressional Budget Office, so Mr Trump's planned $US54 billion ($70 billion) increase would be a rise of 9.2 per cent. \nIn a speech to conservative activists on Friday, Mr Trump promised \"one of the greatest military build-ups in American history\". State Department likely to take major hit \nThe White House is sending Mr Trump's proposal to federal departments this week as he gears up for budget negotiations with Congress that often take months to play out. \nA second official said the State Department's budget could be cut by as much as 30 per cent, which would force a major restructuring of the department and elimination of programs. \nThe United States spends about $US50 billion ($65 billion) annually on the State Department and foreign assistance. \nMore than 120 retired US generals and admirals urged Congress on Monday to fully fund US diplomacy and foreign aid, saying that \"elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defence are critical to keeping America safe\". \nMr Trump also said he would talk about his plans for infrastructure spending in a speech to Congress on Tuesday. \n\"We're going to start spending on infrastructure big,\" he said. \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, said Mr Trump's budget would not seek cuts in federal social programs such as Social Security and Medicare. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:02:59.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
