And she doesnâ€™t believe he should be allowed to speak and recruit others to that cause. \nCarlson pointed to the whole free speech issue here and asked her exactly what she wants to see happen to Yiannopoulos if she considers him to be a dangerous fascist. He repeatedly pressed this issue as Felarca argued that people have a right to defend themselves when unsafe environments are being created for a lot of people. \nWatch the whole segment above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:14:25.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
