Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFancy-free Little Mix star Jesy Nelson ­is aiming to try out the trans­atlantic talent on Valentine’s Day. \nThe unattached singer has her sights set on flirting with a fit American guy on the most ­romantic day of the year, the Sunday People can reveal. \nJesy is well placed because she and the girls will be in Nashville to support Ariana Grande on her Dangerous Woman tour. \nBut if she draws a blank there will plenty more chances – Little Mix have another 30 US gigs. \nThe slimmed-down and ­impressively toned singer ­endured a “horrendous” split from Rixton’s frontman Jake Roche , 24, in November. \nJesy, 25, said: “I’m free, ­single and loving life. I’d really like to experience flirting with an American guy. That would be nice.” Read More Jesy Nelson shows off amazing weight loss and super toned tummy in busty snap Jake Roche and Jesy Nelson broke up in November (Photo: Getty) \nShe said breaking up with Jake, son of actor Shane Richie and Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan, was “one of the worst pains” but insisted they are still pals. \nShe said: “I’ve found a lot of ­independence. I think you learn a lot more about yourself when you’re single.” \nBandmate Jade Thirlwall, 24, reckons dating will be easier for Jesy in America. She said: “You’re in different states, so if it doesn’t go your way, you’re like, ‘Oh well, I’ll never see you again.’” Read More Little Mix then and now: Group's amazing transformation from X Factor hopefuls to pop sensations Little Mix are supporting Ariana Grande on her US tour (Photo: Getty Images) \nJesy told a radio station she loved first dates and is looking for a “weird, fun, sassy and spontaneous” man. \nShe added: “I do love a tat and someone who looks naughty – ­preferably a boxer. I’m really fussy.” \nHer bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 25, is hoping the tour will be spiced up by a visit from her football star boyfriend, Burnley’s Andre Gray.
