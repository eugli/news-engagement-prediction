Chris Hine would conduct mini-therapy sessions at his dressing room stall to air his frustration over his lack of scoring.\nToews would say he had a lack of confidence and if he could just get a couple of shots to go in or bounce his way, well, that might make a world of difference. \nSome fans became impatient as Toews tried to stay out of his own head. \n\"You knew at some point the tides were going to change for him,\" forward Nick Schmaltz said. \nThey have been almost overwhelming lately. \nToews is a much happier player who no longer has to account for why the puck isn't going in for him or his linemates. Instead, he is explaining how a night like Tuesday can happen when Toews scored his fourth career regular-season hat trick and collected his second career five-point game in a 5-3 victory over the Wild . \nAfter his rough first few months, which included a nagging back injury, Toews is happy to savor the moment. \n\"You have nights like (Tuesday) where you might not have another game like that for a little while,\" Toews said. \"You never really know when it's all going to go in like that.\" Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville breaks down the play of Jonathan Toews' line \nBlackhawks coach Joel Quenneville breaks down the play of Jonathan Toews' line in the victory over the Wild.

(Chris Hine/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \nBut it hasn't just been Tuesday. Toews leads the NHL with 20 points (eight goals, 12 assists) and five multi-point games in his last 11 since Jan. 22. Before then, he had seven goals and 15 assists in 39 games. \nToews always tried to keep his approach simple so he wouldn't let his earlier scoring drought consume him. \n\"I think for me the biggest change in my approach to the game is just my expectations,\" Toews said. \"Just try to go into every game with no expectation, focus on the process, focus on playing well, playing the right way, staying in the moment, especially if things don't go in or things don't go your way. You're just building one game after another to try and follow up good efforts and put weeks together, multiple games back to back.\" \nIt has helped that he has been able to put weeks and multiple games back to back with a consistent set of linemates in Schmaltz and Richard Panik , who made for a lethal combination against the Wild. \n\"He always has been a great player,\" Schmaltz said. \"He just wasn't getting the bounces at the start of the year.\" \nEach of the linemates scored a goal Tuesday while making plays that made it look as if they have been playing together for years. And when Toews had opportunities to score, he was able to finish, unlike early in the year when the puck was a magnet that was repelled at the goal line. \n\"I played with him in the beginning of the season and our line, things didn't go our way,\" Panik said. \"I knew eventually it was going to come and he was going to start scoring goals.\" \nIt wasn't so long ago that Toews doubted whether it would happen this season. \n\"We're getting contributions from all over the place,\" Toews said. \"It makes you a dangerous team and a tough team to beat.\" \nBut not quite as dangerous as when Toews himself is clicking too. \nTwitter @ChristopherHine", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:55:50.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
