Most Popular By Darren Orf Feb 1, 2017 Denis Villeneuve, director of last year's highly successful sci-fi thriller Arrival as well as this year's Blade Runner 2049 , has officially accepted the job of creating a new Dune film series, a sci-fi property that has foiled many talented directors in the past. Frank Herbert's son announced the news last night on Twitter, saying his father's work would be helmed by the increasingly popular French-Canadian director.   It's official -- Legendary Pictures has signed the very talented Denis Villeneuve to direct the exciting new DUNE series film project. \nâ€” Brian Herbert (@DuneAuthor) February 1, 2017 Most Popular As the tweet mentions, this is a film series project. Like most Hollywood properties these days, it looks like Dune will be a multi-film saga. Of course, the Dune universe as plenty of material to support such a sprawling franchise with six novels, each one a sizable tome. David Lynch's 1984 Dune was originally cut at over four hours long and eventually whittled down to just over two hours. It was also critically panned with Roger Ebert calling the film \"a real mess.\" Other directors, like Chilean-French film director Alejandro Jodorowsky, also attempted to create an epic cinematic Dune , an eventually aborted attempt recently chronicled by the the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune . So many great directors have fallen before the cinematic challenge of recreating the sci-fi fantasy world that Frank Herbert originally forged in 1965, a work often cited as the core inspiration for Star Wars . If Villeneuve can somehow crack the enigma, fans may finally get the Dune adaptation that Herbert's iconic novels justly deserve.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:47:03.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
