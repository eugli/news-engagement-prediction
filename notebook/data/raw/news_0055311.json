Pope suggests 'it's better to be an atheist than a hypocritical catholic' \nThe only one who could get rid of the poison was Lord Shiva, who agreed to consume it. \nThe poison was so deadly, that if any had entered Lord Shiva’s stomach – which represents the universe – the world would have been destroyed. \nHe held it in his throat, which then turned dark blue as the poison took effect, and became known as Neelkanth. \nMaha Shivaratri is a day where Hindus acknowledge their thanks to Lord Shiva for protecting the world from this poison.
