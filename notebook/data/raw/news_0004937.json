But the onus is now on boss Bilic to to inspire the players to respond with improved performances for the remainder of the campaign. Bilic's side are back in the bottom half of the Premier League after the midweek games (Photo: Getty) \nThe Croat’s bosses at the London Stadium will review his position in the summer when he'll have just a year left on his contract. \nThis season’s slump appears to vindicate the Hammers board's decision not to rush into giving him a new deal during his impressive debut campaign a year ago. \nMancini, 52, who was also at Arsenal’s shock defeat to Watford the previous evening, steered City to their first league title for 44 years back in 2012 and also lifted the FA Cup 12 months previously. \nHe is currently a free agent after spells at Galatasaray and Inter Milan, following his dramatic Etihad axing days after losing to Wigan in the 2013 FA Cup final. Mancini steered Man City to their first silverware in decades with the FA Cup...
