(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDanica Patrick's NASCAR team has sued sponsor Nature's Bakery for breach of contract. \nThe Nevada-based company that sells fruit bars was expected to be the primary sponsor of the No. 10 Ford for at least 20, but as many as 25, Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races this season, what would be the second in a three-year deal. \nThe news first was reported by The Associated Press. \nIn a statement released to USA TODAY Sports, Stewart-Haas Racing said: \n“Nature’s Bakery is in material breach of its contract with Stewart-Haas Racing. It is an unfortunate situation, as the team has delivered on all aspects of its contract and was prepared to do so again in 2017. Ultimately, this is a situation that will be resolved in a court of law. “Stewart-Haas Racing remains focused on its preparation for the 2017 NASCAR season where it will again field four entries in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series while also introducing a full-time NASCAR XFNITY Series team. The litigation with Nature’s Bakery will not impact the organization’s on-track efforts.” \nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE: Danica Patrick may be short on sponsorship for 2017 \nAccording to AP, the lawsuit filed Friday states Nature's Bakery had cash flow problems just after signing the original agreement and made attempts to rework the structure of the deal. Stewart-Haas Racing is suing for $31.7 million, plus interest. The suit also indicates the sponsor informed SHR via letter Jan. 19 that the sponsorship agreement was terminated, after Nature's Bakery had missed several payment deadlines. \nOn Jan. 24, USA TODAY Sports reported that Nature's Bakery was currently in discussions with Patrick's team “about how the sponsorship might look in 2017.\" \nPatrick wore a fire suit adorned with her TaxAct sponsor for her NASCAR media day appearance at the Charlotte Convention Center last week. TaxAct will be on the No. 10 Ford for three of 36 Cup Series points races. Rounding out Patrick's portfolio is Aspen Dental (four races) and Code 3 (three). So if Nature's Bakery is done, Patrick is well short on sponsorship for her fifth full-time season. \nContributing: The Associated Press NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
