He’s big enough, he’s powerful enough and he’s got the players around him to help him out out there. \n“Whether he’s there or Jordan Turner or someone else, I’m not sure, but if he gets the nod, he’ll be ready to go.” \nCroker said he had been working closely on Cotric’s development during the pre-season, with the teenager’s power and confidence his stand out qualities. \nDespite his rapid rise and the big expectations starting to mount on him, Croker said his protege wasn’t getting ahead of himself. \n“I’ve been doing a lot with Nick over the preseason to try to calm him down. He’s a good kid, he wants to play and he wants to learn,” Croker said. \n“The more he learns, the more he listens, the harder he tries, he’s going to go well. \n“He’s really confident, you’ve got to be these days. \n“He’s confident, he’s a great young kid, he’s polite, he’s a well mannered kid, so I hope whenever he does get his chance he takes it with both hands.” \nSpeaking to The Daily Telegraph in the lead up to Lee’s release, coach Stuart admitted he felt let down by the salary cap system and its propensity to push out long-serving players. \nLee, 24, and 28-year-old Fensom, who looks set for an imminent switch to the Cowboys, have spent their whole careers in green, making the call to let them go a tough one. \n“It is the hardest thing I have had to do as coach of the Raiders, sitting both these men down and having to talk to them about their futures,” Stuart said. \n“I have felt uncomfortable about it for many months and I still don’t feel comfortable today because they are two mates. \n“And I can tell you it is something the players here struggle to understand also, especially when you are building a culture at a club. NRL 2017 officially underway 2:59 \n“The players don’t want to lose their mates, and neither do the fans. I totally understand that because that is exactly how I feel. But it is the reality of the salary cap as it is.” \nCroker has played his whole career with Fensom, winning an under 20s competition with the discarded back-rower, and he admitted it would be a tough pill to swallow to lose him from the squad. \n“Fenno and I won the under 20s together nine or 10 years ago. He’s been a lifelong friend of mine, a very close mate so it would be sad to lose him,” Croker said. \n“Edrick’s the same, Edrick and I have played alongside each other on the field for the last four or five years now. \n“If that’s the case and I know it’s football and it’s the way it is sometimes, but it’s extremely disappointing. \n“You don’t want to have to let club greats and great mates like that go but sometimes unfortunately that’s the way it is.” \nDo you live in Queensland?
