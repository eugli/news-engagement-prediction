German man, 73, dies after car driven into pedestrians in Heidelberg Read more \nThe prayer rooms of the Fussilet 33 mosque in the central district of Moabit was a known meeting place for men and women who moved in Islamist circles. \nMore than 460 police officers swept 24 other locations across the city in the early hours of Tuesday morning in raids linked to activities at the mosque, where it is suspected money was regularly collected to fund terror attacks in Syria. \nAmri, who carried out the attack on 19 December in which 12 people died and more than 50 were injured, was a regular visitor to Fussilet 33, along with other Islamists police believe were willing to carry out further terrorist attacks. \nMembers of the mosque – mostly of Turkish or Caucasian origin – were allegedly radicalised there and recruited to fight for Islamic State in Syria.

Communication between various members of the Fussilet 33 association had also been under surveillance. \nAmong the properties searched on Tuesday were office spaces, flats, and six cells in two prisons. No arrests are believed to have been made. \nAmri fled Berlin after the attack and was apprehended on the outskirts of Milan four days later by two police officers, one of whom shot him dead. \nAuthorities announced they would finally close the mosque this month after several attempts to do so since 2015. Given notice of the closure, the organisers moved out last week and cancelled their rental contract with the landlord. \nThe door has been boarded up and a notice in German and Turkish reads: “This mosque is now closed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:53:51.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
