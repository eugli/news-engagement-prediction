The controversial Frenchman, whose ban on playing in the same team as Mathieu Valbuena following a blackmail investigation was lifted on Feb. 18, per Reuters Sport (h/t Sky Sports ), is in a spot of bother thanks to a picture posted to his Twitter account: Karim Benzema @Benzema 12/26/2016, 6:08:33 PM Benzema was holidaying on the island over the Christmas period, taking a well-earned break after his goals in December ensured Real Madrid were top of La Liga for the winter break. But since his return to the club, the Martinique National Park has made a formal complaint, claiming that Benzema is in violation of a law that prohibits \"capturing and deliberately disrupting a delicate species.\" Iguanas are an endangered species in Martinique. \"Benzema will always be welcome in Martinique but he must be careful, footballers are not above the law,\" said the park's manager, Louis Boutrin, per Marca .

Things are finally looking up for the hapless Benzema, although news of his latest misdemeanor —breaking the morning after Real's shock 2-1 La Liga defeat to Valencia —is unlikely to impress manager Zinedine Zidane.
