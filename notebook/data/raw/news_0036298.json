Related Christie Blatchford: Man jailed for a year after anti-Islam speech spurs emergency-alarm on Toronto subway train \nConveniently, someone (who wasn’t made clear in court) audio-taped the entire rant, which, however aggressively Brazau may have spoken, wasn’t particularly different in content from, and arguably more lucid than, the ordinary press conference held by say the new American president. \nIndeed, as Fericean read the agreed facts onto the record, it appeared that what was most offensive and egregious about Brazau’s conduct was that he was citing inflated numbers of dead from the Paris attacks, “despite the fact that the identity and motivation of the Paris attackers was still unconfirmed.” \nIf accuracy in numbers is the issue, then half the world’s media could similarly be charged with breaching the peace. \nThe fact is, in the bloody confusion after such attacks — and the one in Paris involved multiple locations and a number of bars and restaurants as well as a soccer stadium — police and security officials, most concerned with treating the wounded and tracking the suspects, often make mistakes. And the press usually repeats them. \n(Consider the attack upon the Quebec City mosque late last month, where for hours, authorities and press both believed there were two attackers, identified them both by name, only to later realize the second suspect was in fact a witness. Oops.) \nSimilarly, Brazau had fixated upon an inflated number – he repeatedly claimed “they just killed 500 people in Paris” — where, the prosecutor said, the New York Times reported the total figure was 120. \nAnd in fairness to him, Brazau was right when he said “40 people” were killed in Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant suicide bombings the day before in Beirut and only a bit off when he talked about the wholesale kidnapping of schoolgirls by Boko Haram, an ISIL faction, in 2014 (though he got the country wrong; it happened in Nigeria, not Kenya). \nThis emphasis on truth-in-numbers and geographical accuracy was curious. After all, would the state have deemed OK what Brazau said if he’d only waited until the dust settled on the Paris attacks and he’d been able to get the correct figures? \nWhile it’s perhaps a not-unreasonable expectation that authorities and media get it right, or at least right as far as they can and that they are quick to correct, it’s an awfully high burden to place upon ordinary citizens, least of all upon cranks like Brazau. \nIt would also disqualify a great many people from freely speaking their opinions on social media, where in the post-truth, post-fact, alternative-fact era, ranting without a brain in your head is the norm. Are these people causing a disturbance as well? \nOr is Brazau’s mistake that he does his ranting literally in the public square and once in a subway train (someone pulled the emergency alarm and he was duly charged with causing a disturbance and breaching his probation)? \nHe didn’t stop there, of course. As he admitted, he was “freaking out” that night. He also said in multiple ways that the Koran directs Muslims to kill infidels (and parts of it surely do), and in his defence, he has actually read it, albeit with the goal of finding in it what he seeks. \nProsecutor Fericean said he “also compared Muslims to the Nazis,” but what he actually said was that “I think that Islam is a real problem of immense magnitude like when the Nazis, fascists, were coming”, which is hardly saying the two are the same. \nThus, says the agreed statement of facts, “By shouting and yelling in a crowded public place and causing an angry crowd to form around him” did he cause a disturbance and breach the peace he was bound to keep. \nNota bene: He didn’t attract a happy crowd of devotees, but an angry one. \nIt does raise the question of whether Canada, which already has laws against hate speech and propaganda and more vague catch-alls such as causing a disturbance for offences which don’t meet the tougher test, really needs M-103, that much-discussed motion which would have the government formally recognize the need to “quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear.” \nCanadians seem quite capable of quelling on their own. \nBrazau has spent seven months and change behind bars in pre-trial custody, though he is out now. Lawyers will make submissions on sentencing next month. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:08:52.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
