We thank everyone for all the love and kindness you have shown us,\" the 35-year-old politician wrote on Twitter Wednesday.\nChandra Herbert has been a long advocate for LGBTQ rights and equality, and recently introduced legislation to ensure transgender people are explicitly protected in the province's Human Rights Code.\nThe road to becoming a parent has been a long one for the prominent couple, who have been married since 2010.\nTheir search to adopt in B.C. was cut short in 2014 when the child's relatives rejected the couple because they were same-sex.\n<br /> \nPhotos Romi and Spencer Chandra Herbert welcomed their son, Dev, at B.C.
