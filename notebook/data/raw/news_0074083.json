The sun angle in early March is equal to that of early October. \nAs quickly as the warmth returns, a storm system is set to barrel across the country during the middle of the week and wash the spring preview away. \nEherts added that this storm will usher in cold air from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic and New England. \n“While temperatures will remain near or slightly below average in most locations, the steep temperature drop and gusty winds will make the late week and weekend weather feel strikingly colder,” Eherts said. \nBy Friday, temperatures will struggle to exceed 40 degrees in the Interstate 95 corridor from Boston to Washington, D.C., while interior regions get stuck near the freezing mark. \nA bit of snow may accompany the colder air from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic on Thursday into Friday. \nEherts mentioned that winter weather enthusiasts should take advantage of the weekend weather in the Northeast before warmth briefly builds back in by early next week. \n“With an active weather pattern ahead for March, another warmth-busting cold front could impact the eastern U.S. again next week,” Eherts added. \nIt is quite possible that this chaotic pattern of 25- to 35-degree temperature swings over two or three days repeats at least a few times during March. \nThe upcoming temperature roller coaster is likely to not only have an effect on humans and their seasonal time clocks, but also on crops, early blooming trees and plants. \n“Any early blooming could put crops in the Plains and Midwest, as well as cherry blossoms peeking out in Washington, D.C., at risk should subfreezing air return before spring as currently predicted,” Eherts stated.
