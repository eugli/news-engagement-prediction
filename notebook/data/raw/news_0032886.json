Repeat this is not a drill,” the National Weather Service said Sunday, urging people living below Oroville Dam to evacuate. The evacuation was ordered because of a “hazardous situation” involving the Northern California dam's emergency spillway. The National Weather Service said the auxiliary spillway is expected to fail and could send an “uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville.” Feb. 12, 2017, 6:09 p.m. Where is Lake Oroville and the Oroville Dam? Matt Ballinger \nLake Oroville is about 75 miles north of Sacramento and about 25 miles southeast of Chico. The dam is the tallest in the United States. Its emergency spillway is damaged, and the lake is at capacity.
