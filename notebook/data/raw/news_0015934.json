According to the new IDC Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker whose results were published on Sunday, the smartphone market in the Far Eastern country recorded a 19-percent year-on-year growth in 2016. The Chinese smartphone market also grew by 17 percent during the fourth quarter of last year in comparison to Q4 2015, IDC found. Most local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) experienced positive business results over the course of 2016 as their market share in China grew to 57 percent by the end 2016. For reference, Chinese smartphone vendors were holding approximately 46 percent of their home market in 2015. \nOPPO topped the list of domestic smartphone vendors with an 18.1-percent market share in China, latest data collected by IDC revealed. The Guangdong-based consumer electronics manufacturer shipped 24.5 million devices during the fourth quarter of last year and shipped 78.4 million devices in total over the course of 2016. OPPO became the largest smartphone vendor in China primarily due to its rapid growth as the firm increased its annual shipment volume by more than 122 percent last year. Apart from OPPO, the largest smartphone vendors in China are Huawei, Vivo, Apple, and Xiaomi, in that order. The impressive growth of the Chinese smartphone market during the last quarter of 2016 can partially be attributed to increasing dependence on apps, IDC claims. As more and more consumers rely on mobile apps on a daily basis, they’re developing a need to upgrade their phones, the company believes. This trend would explain the increasing demand for mid-range smartphones in certain Chinese cities which OPPO and Vivo were happy to fulfill over the course of 2016. \nIDC predicts that most Chinese flagship devices in 2017 will feature curved screens and dual camera systems. Seeing how Chinese OEMs experimented with these features even before they became popular in the West, it’s possible that more unconventional experimentation will follow in 2017. Xiaomi, LeEco, and Huawei are particularly likely to experiment with their flagship devices, IDC’s analysts believe. The increased focus on curved displays is also expected to increase the demand for AMOLED panels in the Far Eastern country, and Chinese panel makers are seemingly getting ready to help fulfill that demand.
