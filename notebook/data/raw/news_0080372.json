Warne said O’Keefe was simply a “safe” option by Australian selectors early on day one, saying he wished selectors went for the more dangerous selection of Ashton Agar or Mitchell Swepson. \nO’Keefe was surprisingly handed the new ball in Pune and at the time Warne said the spinner was Australia’s “weakest” bowler. \n“When you first start a session you want to set the tone and put pressure on the Indian batsmen and, without trying to be too harsh on Steve O’Keefe, this is the weakest of the Australian bowlers,” Warne told Star Sports. \n“You can understand Steve Smith trying to give him confidence, but there is a time and a place for Steve O’Keefe to get his confidence, right now is the time for Australia to ram home the advantage with Nathan Lyon I believe at that end. \n“I think Steve O’Keefe might get a wicket and that would be great, but I think Nathan Lyon is a better chance of taking a wicket. \nIt’s not the first time Warne has been critical of O’Keefe. The leg-spinner made similar comments following O’Keefe’s recall for the Sydney Test against Pakistan in January. \nBut O’Keefe provided the perfect response to Warne’s jibe and it’s safe to say Australian fans let the spin king know about it. Hey great man @ShaneWarne , do us a favour and write @CollingwoodFC off for the premiership!!
