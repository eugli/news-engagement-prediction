Shutterstock \nMuskos, 42, believes the Swedish people are not spending enough time with their partners, and he hopes the paid time off could help to bolster people’s relationships and mental and physical health. \nI mean, if a mandatory hour of paid sexy time isn’t going to save your marriage, I have no idea what will. \nThere is, of course, the concern that people will be spending the hour-long, paid “sex break” doing things other than making sweet, tender love to their neglected partners. \nFortunately, Muskos fully understands and acknowledges the concern. “You can’t guarantee that a worker doesn’t go out for a walk instead.” Swedish official suggests paid \"sex break\" for employees. https://t.co/Z4yJ5rOoXb pic.twitter.com/8Ao2nWbMma \n— Medical Daily (@medicaldaily) February 21, 2017 \nThat being said, he believes his Swedish people need to be trusted to use the free hour as it was intended to be used. After all, the hour is about their health and happiness more than it is about anything. \nMuskos explained, “There are studies that show sex is healthy. It’s about having better relationships.” And according to MailOnline , Muskos believes his motion will be passed without a doubt.

An entire HOUR devoted solely to boinking your partner?! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR? \nMuskos is right. There are plenty of studies that have shown regular sex can help improve both your physical and emotional health . \nIf people actually use the hour for its intended, sexy purpose, the entire city could be happier and healthier. \nThat being said, can you imagine how much it would BLOW being the only single friend in your work clique during the sex break?? \nEveryone goes home to bang their partners, and you just have to sit at home, picking your nose and watching YouTube videos.
