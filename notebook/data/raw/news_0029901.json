A teenager riding in the passenger seat was not injured. \nHighway Patrol officers said Jeremy Paylor was on his way to help the teen when he was injured in a separate crash. According to officials with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, Paylor was speeding across the centerline and struck an SUV carrying two children. \nPaylor remains in critical condition at Duke University. The driver of the SUV and the children, ages 8 and 10, were not badly injured in the crash. \nPaylor rushed to the scene as soon as his family heard about Daye's crash, officials said. His crash occurred about two miles from the original wreck. \nThe crash is under investigation, but police do not believe alcohol to be involved in either case.
