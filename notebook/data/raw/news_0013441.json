What, do you think our country’s so innocent?” \nPoppy Harlow asked Sciutto for his reaction, and he said that Trump essentially talked down America by saying its actions are comparable to practices in Russia and China. Sciutto was also concerned that authoritarian nations might take Trump’s “moral relativism” and use it as a propaganda tool to justify their own behaviors. \n“The U.S. has made many mistakes, but the question is, putting it on a par with a historic authoritarian state such as Russia is, one, just not factually true, and two, just a remarkable thing for American president to say,” Sciutto said. Sciutto went on to contrast America and Russia’s historical actions, and he reiterated that it was “just remarkable” to hear Trump comparing the two. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:42:36.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
