Voters lobbed profanities at her social media feed. Some threatened to get behind a Democratic primary challenger in 2018. A Republican colleague, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, gleefully seized on a misleading news report placing Ms. McCaskill among a group of senators who purportedly said they would not filibuster the nominee. By then, Ms. McCaskill had made clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold for confirmation. It did not matter. Leaving the Capitol last week, Ms. McCaskill, a typically voluble senator — from a state Mr. Trump carried by more than 18 points — had settled on a new approach. “I’m not talking about the Supreme Court nominee at all, in any way,” Ms. McCaskill said. “I just don’t think it’s a good idea.” Democrats from other conservative-leaning states have been eager to demonstrate an openness to Judge Gorsuch. After meeting with the judge at his office last week, Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, urged his colleagues to “give him a fair shake.” “He deserves that,” Mr. Tester said. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who has said he will not join any filibuster, smirked when asked if he felt any pressure from other Democrats to stand against Mr. Trump. \nAdvertisement   “I’m immune to pressure,” said Mr. Manchin, who once demonstrated his independence by firing a bullet through Obama administration energy policies in a campaign ad. “If I can go home and explain it, that’s how I make my decision.” With Judge Gorsuch’s completion of a Judiciary Committee questionnaire over the weekend, lawmakers have begun scrutinizing his record in more detail. Democrats have expressed particular concern about his votes in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, a chain of retail stores that cited religious objections in refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to female employees. Outside groups on the left have also sought to assert themselves, with anti-Gorsuch television ads airing in Montana, Missouri, West Virginia and other Trump-leaning states with Democratic senators. Last week, Judge Gorsuch and his team seemed inclined to supply additional cover to these moderate Democrats. In private meetings, the nominee appeared to break with Mr. Trump’s recent attacks on the judiciary, calling any such attacks “demoralizing” and “disheartening” while declining to criticize the president directly. But when one of the Democrats with whom the judge met, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, described Judge Gorsuch’s statement, Mr. Trump responded with an attack on Mr. Blumenthal, undercutting the president’s own nominee. “If there’s a strategy, it’s a very schizophrenic one,” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. “If they are seen as trying to have it both ways, it certainly diminishes his supposed independence.” The Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, has accused Judge Gorsuch of evading even the most basic questions in meetings, likening him to John G. Roberts Jr., now the chief justice, during his early meetings on Capitol Hill. Mr. Schumer also dismissed Judge Gorsuch’s comments in response to Mr. Trump as insufficient. “To whisper to a senator but refuse to say anything publicly is not close to a good enough show on independence,” he said from the Senate floor last week. “So from my view, not a good start for Judge Gorsuch. Not a good start.” \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
