(Photo: Logan Bowles-USA TODAY Sports) 201 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Indianapolis Colts needs' at pass rush are well-documented , but what if new general manger Chris Ballard and company decided to go a different direction with their first round of the upcoming NFL Draft? What if they added an heir to 34-year-old Frank Gore? \nMany draft analysts and experts believe that's exactly what Indy should do if Florida State lightning bolt running back Dalvin Cooks falls to them. \nThe consensus seems to be that adding Cook would alleviate a lot of the stress put on Luck and add a dimension to this Colts offense that they haven't had in years. \nESPN's Todd McShay says the Colts can protect Luck with a selection of Cook. Protecting and supporting Andrew Luck is priority No. 1 for the Colts, but drafting more O-linemen (they picked four last year) isn't the only way to do that. Indy can't bank on RB Frank Gore , who turns 34 in May, to continue to defy the odds. Cook, the No. 8 player on our board, is an explosive runner and a weapon in the passing game. He loves the game, too. \nCBS Sports' Dae Brugler says a player of Cook's caliber would disguise problem areas on the Colts' roster. For his first draft as the general manager in Indianapolis, Chris Ballard could go in several directions to improve the Colts. But adding a dynamic runner like Cook would help disguise several concerns on the roster. \nNFL.com's Daniel Jeremiah is on board with Colts + Cook = good. \nThe Colts need an explosive running back; Cook would be a perfect fit with Andrew Luck \nThe folks at WalterFootball.com also believe the Colts' offense could jump to another level with Cook in the fold. \nThe Colts have a number of positions that they need to address on defense, and they also have some holes to fill on the offensive line. However, the top prospect on the board is Dalvin Cook, and he also fills a big need. Frank Gore is about to turn 34, and he's not going to be very effective in the near future. Having a dynamic player like Cook in the backfield would be a huge boost for Andrew Luck. There are some character concerns with Cook, but new general manager Chris Ballard was with the Chiefs when they selected Marcus Peters, who also had off-the-field concerns. Peters worked out, so perhaps Ballard will ignore Cook's issues. \nObservation: Draft analysts love using the word dynamic — especially when describing Cook. USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis is no exception. \nFrank Gore gave a heroic effort last season at age 33, but it's time to give QB Andrew Luck a young, dynamic threat for the future. Cook is a fierce competitor and every-down back who would be a boon to Luck by virtue of his running, blocking and capability as an outlet receiver when all else fails. \nNewsday's Nick Klopsis is a Cook to Colts supporter. He says the young back's big-play ability fits in well with what the Colts like to do. \nAs good as Leonard Fournette is, there wouldn't be too much argument here if a team thought Dalvin Cook was the top running back. Cook has an excellent mix of speed, quickness and vision, and has shown off some reliable receiving chops as well (79 receptions in 38 career games). He has dealt with his share of injuries in college, including a hamstring injury that lingered throughout his sophomore season, but his big-play ability in a big-play Colts offense could be too good to pass up. \nSports Illustrated's Chris Burke has the Colts passing on Cook on going with Michigan State defensive lineman Malik McDowell. The buzz has quieted some on McDowell—he had a frustrating, injury-plagued year and wasn’t eligible for the Senior Bowl. But it’ll pick back up. He’s still a highly mobile defensive lineman built for the mix-and-match fronts of the modern NFL. \nOddly, CBS Sports' Rob Rang is one of the only mock drafters who has the Colts selecting an edge rushers. He sees Ballard targeting Tennessee pass-rusher Derek Barnett. Outside linebacker Erik Walden contributed a full third of the Colts' 33 sacks this season and with longtime standout Robert Mathis retiring, adding reinforcements to the pass rush should be among the Colts' top priorities. The 6-3, 257-pound Barnett lacks the length and pure explosiveness scouts would prefer, but he's a well-rounded player who combines quickness, strength and technique to be effective against the pass and run, alike. \nNFL.com's Lance Zierlein's pick comes from out of left field a bit — at least among his draft comrades. He sees a potential fit with Wisconsin tackle Ryan Ramczyk. This might seem a little early, but Ramczyk is the top tackle on my board. New GM Chris Ballard knows he has to start building along the offensive and defensive fronts. \nDrafttek.com also goes against the grain a bit, suggesting the Colts go after Florida cornerback Quincy Wilson. Wilson is the choice for Indy in the latest CMD, with the Colts able to go in a variety of directions here. One thing is certain, however, and that is the Colts do need a top-shelf defender to field opposite Vontae Davis. Injuries have plagued Davis in consecutive seasons and he's not getting any younger. The pass defense was much too leaky, finishing 27th in the NFL. So Wilson (and another CB) are among a host of \"needs\" for this defense. Wilson, because of his size, length, and speed would give the Colts a solid defensive back with the ability to stay in the hip pocket of any WR. He's able to come up to provide support against the run, but that element is the biggest flaw in his game and will require immediate improvement. Quincy Wilson has length and athleticism that enhance his instincts and smarts at the position. In press man or zone, Wilson maintains his effectiveness, and his speed allows him to pickpocket receivers. With his long reach and vertical leap, Wilson can effectively high-point the ball and deflect passes that others may not be able to defend. Again, this comes down to how the first 13 picks fall and whether GM Chris Ballard is looking solely at \"trench warfare\" in RD1 and RD2 . I don't think he will \"tunnel vision\" his first selection, and the flow of the draft could dictate his need to look away from both the O and D lines at this selection. 201 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:48:59.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
