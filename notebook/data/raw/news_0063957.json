The public has spoken on recreational marijuana, we’ve seen it work in Colorado, and now is the time to lift the federal prohibition.” \n\nFollowing the November election, 95 percent of Americans now live in states or territories that permit, to varying degrees, legal access to medical marijuana and/or cannabis derivatives, with even more states considering expanded access this year. Additionally, nearly a fifth of all Americans now live in a state with legal access to recreational marijuana for adults. \n\nLast week, Polis, along with three other members of Congress, launched the bipartisan Cannabis Caucus. The Caucus will provide a forum for members of the U.S. House of Representatives to discuss, learn, and work together to establish a better and more rational approach to federal cannabis policy. \n\nPolis has been a longtime advocate for updating federal marijuana policy. Last Congress, he introduced the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act. This bill would have removed marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug; transitioned marijuana oversight from the jurisdiction of the Drug Enforcement Agency to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and regulated marijuana like alcohol by inserting it into the section of the U.S. Code that governs “intoxicating liquors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:06:01.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
