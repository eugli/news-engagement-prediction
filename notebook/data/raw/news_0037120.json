But they believe that given the potential impacts that an El Niño can bring, it is better to raise the possibility now so that authorities can be prepared.\n\"If actually the El Niño does take off, then it has a lot of implications for many of the monsoon regions,\" said Dr Kolli.\n\"It is associated with a big monsoon in much of South East Asia - and drought in some parts of Africa. People should be aware of these possibilities.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CFC3/production/_94678135_gettyimages-605508084.jpg", "http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/elnino/what-is-la-nina", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10989/production/_94677976_gettyimages-506985678.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/BBCMattMcGrath/", "https://twitter.com/MattMcGrathBBC", "https://phys.org/news/2017-02-el-nino-gobbled-california-beaches.html", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/157A9/production/_94677978_anomw.2.13.2017.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38652746", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34832317"], "published": "2017-02-16T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:14:35.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
