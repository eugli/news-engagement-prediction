(HT Photo) \nTamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami won a dramatic trust vote on Saturday after opposition DMK legislators were thrown out for unprecedented violence and Congress MLAs walked of the assembly. ( LIVEUPDATES ) \nPalaniswami won by 122 votes to 11 after Speaker P Dhanapal twice adjourned the House within a couple of hours when DMK legislators broke furniture and microphones, threw papers and even occupied his chair. \nThe eviction of the 88 DMK legislators and the secrecy surrounding the special session are likely to take the sheen away from Paliniswamy’s win, which also hands a moral victory to disgraced AIADMK chief VK Sasikala in a high-stakes battle against her challenger O Panneerselvam. \nHis victory meant that Panneerselvam’s gamble of revolting against Sasikala – a long-time confidante of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa – has failed and his dreams of holding on to the top job gone, at least for the time being. \nPalaniswami, 62, was propped up as the chief minister by Sasikala after the Supreme Court sent her to jail in a 20-year-old corruption case. \nHe was invited to form the government on Thursday after he convinced the governor about the number of MLAs supporting him. \nPanneerselvam, with barely a handful of legislators in his camp, however, found support from the DMK, the Congress and the All India Muslim League.

It was rejected by the Speaker. \nTV visuals showed DMK legislators surrounding and shoving the Speaker before he gets up and leaves. Two DMK MLAs, identified as Kuka Selvam and Ranganathan, was seen sitting on the Speaker’s chair briefly. \n“They tore my shirt and insulted me,” Dhanpal told reporters outside the House. \nDMK working president MK Stalin countered the allegation. He walked out of his car with his shirt unbuttoned and gesturing to reporters that he was assaulted inside the assembly. \nThe Speaker barred media into the assembly and even cut off power to a public announcement system at the press room inside the assembly.

But he failed to garner enough numbers to seriously challenge Palaniswami. \nThe governor had given Palaniswami 15 days to prove his majority but the CM chose to take the floor test immediately – apparently over concerns that the lawmakers confined in the resort were getting anxious. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:16.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
