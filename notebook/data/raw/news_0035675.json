A nice touch from the 6ft 2in defender. \nFlorentin will also sport the number 19 shirt on the side of his head in tribute to, well, himself. \n\"The 19 is my squad number and the six is for him. I hope he and I enjoy it the best we can. \n\"Mum's going to be here. Obviously these things don't happen very often in a player's career, the chance to see her two sons playing against each other. She can't lose really, can she?\" \nEarlier this week, Florentin also spoke to the Guardian about playing against his brother for the first time: \n\"I watched the draw and, when I saw who we got, my first reaction was 'Yes, that's a dream that's going to be fulfilled'. \n\"We used to play every day and hope that one day all three of us would play together in a professional match. \n\"That was the biggest dream. We haven't managed it yet but having two of us together on the pitch is already good. \n\"We've been having fun about it ever since the draw, sending messages like 'Watch out, the match is getting closer' and so on.\" \nCan Florentin and his Saint Etienne side produce a shock win at Old Trafford tonight? or will brother Paul steal the limelight once again? \nLet us know your thoughts.
