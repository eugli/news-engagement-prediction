(Supplied: John Morse) \nTelstra North Coast area general manager Mike Marom said Telstra has no intention to silence its customers. \n\"We do, on occasion, offer compensation when there has been a disruption to services that has impacted people, but we don't look to silence people,\" Mr Marom said. \n\"We are taking this matter very seriously, and we are investigating why this customer received a miscommunication so that we can ensure that we don't have a recurrence.\" \nTelstra confirmed that the hundreds of customers in the Thora area were having their signal strength impacted by overgrown vegetation and trees. \n\"Council has given us permission to take action to clear vegetation and to prune the trees [and] that will take place on February 12,\" Mr Marom said. \n\"That will certainly improve the quality of service.\" \nTelstra has also confirmed there are plans to upgrade the Dorrigo Mountain network to 4G by the end of year. \nThe company said the upgrade would substantially improve both voice and data services for the area. Challenges and costs of of living regionally \nLike many people who choose to live in the regions Mr Morse understands there are challenges and costs to delivering the service. Video: Fighting the data drought in the bush (Landline) \n\"I'm prepared to pay the ridiculous charges of $150 for 50GB a month,\" he said. \n\"I'm even prepared to accept a slower speed, but I want to be able to use the internet because I run a small business — like many people in regional Australia. \n\"What we're asking for is a reasonable, not a fabulous, just a reasonable internet and phone connection. \n\"It's our lifeline to the outside world.\" Living with limited service \nOn the mid-north coast of NSW there is growing frustration that customers are paying for a service which is not being delivered. \nLocal resident 'Peter' phoned ABC Local Radio on his drive from Valla to Port Macquarie on Wednesday. \n\"My phone has been dropping out all morning,\" he said. Amanda Salisbury explains how the cost of the data drought in regional Australia was driven home when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and accessing specialist medical support online proved impossible. \n\"I need my phone for business and when you go to both the major carriers' websites to look at coverage maps, it says that the areas are covered but it's not until you take up the service that you realise the failure of it. \n\"It's appalling that in this day and age we're not all covered, especially when we all live so close to the coast.\" \nBellingen resident Andrew Woodward who lives 1.2 kilometres from the local exchange said his ADSL2+ was working well until early January, when his download speed dramatically reduced. \nAfter lodging a complaint with Telstra, he was advised that the copper network was not performing well and he should consider a prepaid wireless system until the issue could be fixed. \n\"Instead of my 1,000GB a month for $99 for substandard ADSL which I currently pay, they have advised I can pay $10,000 a month — yes, $10,000 a month — for the same amount of data per month to get broadband by 4G/3G,\" Mr Woodward said. \n\"This was not hoax.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:19:15.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
