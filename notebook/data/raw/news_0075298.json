PUBLISHED: 21:12, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:48, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 GETTY Theresa May has decided to shelve the removal of the EU Human Rights Act \nJustice Secretary Liz Truss acknowledged that the Tory party's manifesto pledge was not feasible at the moment as Britain prepares to enter into the long and wrangled negotiation process of finally divorcing from Brussels. \nThis means the EU's Human Rights Act will remain in place until after the General Election in 2020 – but even then there is no guarantee it will be replaced with a bespoke British concept. \nIt was the Labour party that introduced the EU's directive into British law, but the Conservatives appear content to let the legacy of a by-gone pro-European era remain.

It’s important we only do one constitution reform at a time.\" GETTY Liz Truss met with the Prime Minister to discuss plans for the Human Rights bill \nParliament will no doubt be consumed by Brexit and the Great Repeal Bill for the coming years, but the move paves the way for Mrs May to pin her 2020 election campaign on establishing a British bill. \nThat is a political move that will chime with Tory Eurosceptics and could help mobilise her ground base when she attempts to wipe Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party off the map in 2020. These are the most eurosceptic countries Fri, February 24, 2017 Play slideshow 1 of 8 \nMrs May's decision could see her engage into another war of words with Nicola Sturgeon, whose SNP have outspokenly opposed the British Bill of Rights, preferring to remain part of the EU. \nThe notion of a British Bill of Rights was floated by David cameron in 2010, but is was put on ice during the Tory/LibDem coalition. \nIt reemerged in 2015 when Mr Cameron put the idea in his manifesto, after referring to Britain's human rights relationship with the EU as being \"a total mess\". \nPrior to the 2010 general election, Conservative party leader David Cameron proposed replacing the Human Rights Act with a new \"British Bill of Rights\". After forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, these plans were shelved and reinstated only after the Conservative party won an overall majority in the 2015 general election.
