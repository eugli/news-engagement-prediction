Janie Harris | NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nWashington senior guard Kelsey Plum broke the NCAA all-time scoring record Saturday night, surpassing Missouri State’s (which at the time was Southwest Missouri State) former guard Jackie Stiles’s 3,393 career points. \nThroughout the season, you may have read story after story comparing the two high-scoring players. But, just how similar are their career statistics? In their freshmen years, the pair remained just a fraction of a point away from the other’s average.Stiles began to pull away in points in her sophomore year, but Plum’s unselfish play led her to average more assists than Stiles.By their respective junior years, Stiles continued her climb in point productions. But while Plum maintained a lower average than Stiles, she scored more points overall, adding to that potential record-breaking career total.In Plum’s senior year, she may be averaging fewer points than Stiles at the moment, but she still has pulled together enough to pass Stiles’s total.Now, Plum, heading into the postseason, will continue to increase what players behind her may strive for as Washington battles for Pac-12 supremacy.
