Consulting with a Professional Homeopathic Practitioner \nModern homeopaths are open to combining conventional treatments with homeopathic remedies. While the medical community is becoming more aware of the emotional component to disease and pain, homeopathic studies have always considered the notion that our emotional states are in need of relief when we are ill. The ethical homeopathic practitioner will want to know your full medical history and what medications you are currently taking. Also be prepared to answer questions regarding your routine habits such as diet, sleep patterns, physical activity, etc. All of these things are considered during a \"holistic evaluation\" to help give your homeopathic practitioner the information he needs to suggest a remedy regimen designed uniquely for you. Self Treatment with Homeopathic Remedies \nHomeopathy is generally safe but it is important to remember that these remedies are not as tightly regulated as conventional medicines. If you decide you would like to explore homeopathy as a treatment option on your own choose a remedy that most closely matches the symptoms associated with your migraine or headache. Dosages are given on the packaging. If you are following the label directions correctly and you experience no improvement within a reasonable time then you may need to stop using it and select a different remedy for testing. Each person's pain and physiology is unique and therefore a remedy that works for one person may not work very well for someone else. \nATTN: CHRONIC SUFFERERS - Consulting with a homeopathy practitioner, rather than attempting self-treatment with homeopathic remedies , is recommended if you suffer from chronic headaches or frequent Migraine episodes. \nTALK TO YOUR DOCTOR - Any time you are considering using alternative methods of treatment it is important that you make sure your medical care provider is aware of it.
