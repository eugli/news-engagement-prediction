(Picture: Twitter/@Dungeon_London) \nWhich all – understandably – led to some very unhappy twitter users. (Picture: Twitter) \nAwful taste and lack of humour aside, the most confusing thing about all of this is what exactly it all had to do with the London Dungeon experience. \nDid Henry VIII go about calling women good eaters? \nIs cat-fishing a historical phenomenon? (Picture: Twitter/@Dungeon_London) \nIt was all very uncomfortable – particularly as the London Dungeon is primarily thought of as a family-friendly historical attraction. \nEven Ann Summers, who were apparently working with the tourist attraction for one their Valentine’s Day events thought it was in bad taste. \n‘It is really disappointing to see tweets which are overtly sexist and negative towards women – attitudes we absolutely do not tolerate – or support – at Ann Summers,’ they told Metro.co.uk. We recognise that we’ve upset some people and for that we’re very sorry. pic.twitter.com/RW8d4VRC8D \n— The London Dungeon (@Dungeon_London) February 15, 2017 \n‘Ann Summers teamed up with London Dungeon for a fun, one-off Valentines event in relation to the Fifty Shades Darker film release. We are not an official partner of the Merlin Group and were not, in any way, associated with the social content posted by the London Dungeon on Valentine’s Day. \n‘Ann Summers do not condone or support violence against women. We stand for female empowerment and sexual confidence and are a brand which was created by women, for women.’ (Picture: Twitter/@Dungeon_London) \nThe London Dungeon have since apologised for their tweets which they say were all just good banter. \n‘We apologise that our social posts caused offence. Our “Dark Valentine” campaign was a range of posts aimed to highlight the darker side of history and create debate and conversation,’ they told Metro.co.uk. \n‘As a brand, we strive to entertain our guests so they can enjoy the London Dungeon experience – both in our attraction and on social media. However, on this occasion, we recognise that some of the topics many felt were inappropriate and something that is consigned to the history books, therefore we apologise for any offence cause.’ \nRather than isn’t actually apologising for the jokes themselves, they’re just admitting that they f**ked up. In the words of a prolific Twitter user: Sad. \nMaybe they should stick to the history stuff and leave Twitter to the millennials.
