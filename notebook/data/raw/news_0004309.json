A Trump flag was spotted on a military convoy driving outside Lexington, Kentucky, on Sunday.The US Navy confirmed to CNN that the Humvees were being driven by an East Coast Naval Special Warfare unit -- also known as a Navy SEALs unit. Flying certain flags from military vehicles is allowed, but a blue Trump flag waving in the wind is not one of them. \"Department of Defense and Navy regulations prescribe flags and pennants that may be displayed as well as the manner of display,\" said Navy Public Affairs Officer Lt. Jacqui Maxwell. \"The flag shown in the video was unauthorized.\" The Navy has started a command inquiry on this incident. Read More The Humvees in the video are based in Fort Knox, Kentucky, she added. The convoy was traveling between two military training areas. The Facebook video showing the convoy had been viewed almost 80,000 times before it was removed Thursday afternoon. The responses to the video were harsh, with some people blasting the person who filmed it while driving, to others told the world to get used to President Trump being the commander in chief. \"Good lord, get over it already, he's the president and it will be that way for 4 years!!\" said one Facebook commenter.
