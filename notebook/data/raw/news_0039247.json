Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMelania Trump is reportedly miserable and struggling to get to grips with her role as First Lady, according to bombshell claims being made in US media. \nWhile Donald Trump has embraced his being able to wield his power as US President from day one - and is wallowing in being the centre of attention - it's claimed his wife is hating the scrutiny which comes with the role. \nIt's even being claimed by 'insiders' she is living 'virtually trapped inside Trump Tower' - 'fearing venturing out' of its gold-plated front door. \nLate night TV chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel even joked last week that she's “trapped like Rapunzel” in her $100 million penthouse. \nThe latest issue of Us Weekly quotes family friend and stylist Phillip Bloch as saying: \"This life wasn’t her dream. It was Donald’s. \n“Truthfully, it’s a lot to cope with.” It was literally day one - at the inauguration - that alarm bells started ringing when the world saw the look on Melania's face Melania has remained in New York while the couple's son Barron, 10, attends school (Photo: Getty) \nMelania, 46, has remained living in New York while their son Barron, 10, finishes school - but it's claims has only left the apartment \"a handful of times\". \nUs Weekly says that Melania used to take her son to and from his private school in a chauffeured SUV. \nNow, according to a family source, it says: “Melania has the Secret Service take Barron to school and retrieve him.” Melania and her husband haven't looked comfortable at each other's side (Photo: AFP) The pair have attended events together - but their body language has caused media speculation (Photo: Mirror.co.uk) \nWhile she was never a fixture on the New York social scene, “she is staying hidden more” claims Bloch. \nAnd the family source says of the few times she has been seen by her husband's side: “Don’t let her smile in those photos fool you. \n“She hates this.” Melania hasn't embraced the role in the same way her predecessor Michelle Obama did (Photo: Rex) First Lady Melania Trump has attended important events with her husband (Photo: Rex Features) \nIt's true that little has been seen of Melania in public since inauguration day. \nBy contrast, during her first week in the job in 2009, Michelle Obama hosted an open house for selected members of the public - plus a party for White House staffers. \nA video on Us Weekly's website calls Melania a \"reluctant First Lady\" who is \"struggling with the realities of her role.\" Melania left the penthouse to visit Palm Beach with husband Donald (Photo: Getty Images North America) The pair attended a Gala together at Palm Beach (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe public backlash, it claims, has also been tough for her to deal with. \nShe reportedly did enjoy supermodel Gigi Hadid's mocking impression of her on stage at the American Music Awards. \nIndeed, Us Weekly claims a source told them that she was horrified when the world made fun of her.
