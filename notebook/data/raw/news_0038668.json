By AGENCIES \nLooks like Kenyans have exported their thieving tendencies outside the country. \nA Kenyan company has been accused by Malawian government of fleecing it Sh4.8 million ($48000) claiming it will supply lifts at the Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe, according to reports in local media. \nOpposition members of parliament on Tuesday took the government to task for paying the amount to secure a lift for Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe, which never came. \nBoth The Nation and Nyasa Times reported that Malawi’s Justice minister Samuel Tembenu said the government cannot trace the Kenyan company even after being paid. \nMr Tembenu, however, maintained that his government was working with Kenyan authorities to trace officials of the company which has gone underground. \n“It is our hope that the company will be found and be dealt with accordingly,” said Mr Tembenu. \nINVESTIGATIONS \nCuriously, the unnamed Kenyan company was recommended to the Malawians by Japanese company Mitsubishi, said Mr Tembenu. \n“The official from the company came to inspect the specifications and said there were some aspects lacking and they needed to inform Mitsubishi about the correct equipment to be installed. If the company is insolvent, we will file claim. There is no need to be despondent,” the minister added. \nThe matter was raised in Malawian parliament by Chitipa South MP Welani Chilenga. The MP alleged that the government paid for the new lift between 2014 and last year. \nLegislators wondered how the government paid the whole amount before the lift was brought to KIA. \nRumphi East MP Kamlepo Kalua said no due diligence was made or investigations on whether the company is genuine or bogus.
