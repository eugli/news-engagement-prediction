What we know is that they want to govern the state without telling us what their policies are.\n\"Everyone knows BN's education and economic policies, but what of the opposition? So, how will the people vote for them if they do not know what their policies are.\n\"What is now touted by the opposition is that their leaders are ready to be prime minister or chief minister. These are very important posts,\" he told reporters after attending an ang pow festival organised by SJK(C) Chung Hwa Saturday night.\nAbdul Rahman expressed his disappointment that the opposition parties use approaches that are seditious and slanderous and vilify their political opponents to gain the people's support instead of offering better policies than Barisan.\n\"I want to tell the opposition, if they want to capture the hearts of the people of Sabah, they need to come up with the announcement of better economic, social, security and education policies.\n\"As a BN leader, I will review their policies. Then we will be in a healthy political situation. Only then can we develop the nation,\" he said.\nAbdul Rahman said the opposition will be rejected if it only comes up with rhetoric to change the government and leaders without policies. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:45:46.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
