Frederic Joachim, Mr Le Pen’s lawyer, confirmed on Sunday that he was now set to stand criminal trial, but insisted that his remarks had been ‘misinterpreted’. SOS Racisme - the anti racism group which is providing evidence against Mr Le Pen -called the pun ‘the most anti-Semitic filth.’ In turn, Mr Le Pen said: ‘The word oven that I used had no anti-Semitic connotation, except for political enemies or imbeciles.’ Marine Le Pen, who denounced the comments, has tried to play down her party’s anti-Semitic and racist roots. Marine Le Pen (right), Mr Le Pen’s 48-year-old daughter, is the FN candidate for upcoming election But her father, who has multiple convictions for crimes including Holocaust denial, remains a hugely influential figure in the FN. He is much admired by supporters after founding and leading the party for decades, and – like his daughter – remains an MEP. The pair are said to have fallen out last year, with Ms Le Pen officially trying to expel him from the party, but he remains honorary president following an appeal by his lawyers. Ms Le Pen is currently predicted to win the first round of this year’s French presidential election in April, but then to be roundly beaten in the second round in May. If that were to happen it would the same result her father faced in his 2002 presidential bid when he won the first round, but then lost the second to Jacques Chirac by a landslide of more than 80 per cent. Thousands of French Jews died in Nazi ovens and gas chambers during the World War II Holocaust after being entrained to Germany from cities such as Paris and Marseille.
