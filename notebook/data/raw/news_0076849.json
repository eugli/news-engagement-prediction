However, producer J.J. Abrams does know what we're getting and he's already begun to hype the film in a big way. Specifically, Abrams is singing the praises of Mark Hamill in the movie, claiming that his turn as Luke Skywalker could be an award worthy performance. \nI think we are all going to be very upset if he does not win an Oscar, and no one more upset than Mark. \nJ.J. Abrams made the comments to the New York Daily News prior to last Sunday's Oscar ceremony and while at first, it might seem like Abrams is just joking around, the story would seem to indicate that there's at least some honesty in the statement. Star Wars is not a franchise that one thinks of when considering award-caliber performances. Sir Alec Guinness was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the original Star Wars but the franchise hasn't seen an acting nomination since. \nBut who's to say that Mark Hamill won't be nominated for an Oscar? While science fiction and fantasy films have a history of being ignored at the Academy Awards that has slowly ceased being true in recent years. The Lord of the Rings films did very well at the ceremony and recent sci-fi dramas like The Martian and Arrival have also been recognized. The role we expect to see Mark Hamill playing in Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the reluctant mentor, a sort of role that tends to be nominated in traditional dramas. One would also assume that Hamill's nomination would be as Best Supporting Actor , as he likely won't be considered the lead, which at least in theory can be a less competitive category, making a nomination, as well as a potential win, more likely. \nJ.J. Abrams' comments do seem to imply that one long-held theory, that Star Wars: The Last Jedi will be \"Luke's movie\" in the same way that Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a \"Han Solo movie.\" Of course, if true, the idea would seem to imply a plan for Star Wars: Episode IX to have focused on General Leia, which of course will be impossible. If Mark Hamill actually does find himself on an Oscar stage a year from now accepting an award, Carrie Fisher will not be able to be one of them people cheering him on. \nSo far all we have to go on is J.J. Abrams biased comment, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. Could we see Mark Hamill winning an Oscar in 2018? What do you think the odds are of that? Let us know in the comments below.
