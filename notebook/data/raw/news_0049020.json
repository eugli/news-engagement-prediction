As soon as the set of pacers were ready to be auctioned on Monday, the franchises were braced to begin a fierce bidding battle. \nThe jackpot was hit by English pace bowler Tymal Mills, who was bought for Rs 12 crore — 22 times his base price of Rs 50 lakh. It came as no surprise that Royal Challengers Bangalore went all out for Mills, a clear replacement option after Australia spearhead Mitchell Starc parted ways with RCB on the eve of the auction to manage his workload. \nNew Zealand pacer Trent Boult and SA pace sensation, Kagiso Rabada, were both snapped up for Rs 5 crore, by Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils respectively. \nDelhi Daredevils loaded themselves with another pacer — Australia’s Patrick Cummins, for Rs 4.5 crore. \nRajasthan left-arm seamer Aniket Choudhary, who took four wickets for India A against Bangladesh and was called up by India to prepare for Mitchell Starc, was bought for Rs 2 crore --- base price Rs. 10 lakh --- by Royal Challengers Bangalore. \nTamil Nadu left-arm pacer T Natarajan, who impressed in the run-up to the Ranji Trophy, was snapped up by Kings XI Punjab for Rs 3 crore. Basil Thampi, Kerala pacer with a base price Rs 10 lakh, was bought by Gujarat Lions for Rs 85 lakh. \nThere was some interest for former Australia pacer Mitchell Johnson too as Mumbai Indians were the only bidders to buy him at his base price of Rs 2 crore. This will be his second stint with the two-time IPL champions. \nFor many, Ishant Sharma not being able to attract any bids may come as a surprise, but the Indian pacer was not a regular for Rising Pune Supergiants in the last IPL and even struggled in the matches he featured in. The last T20 International he played was in 2013. By keeping his base price at Rs 2 crore, the odds were stacked against the tall pacer, though he has looked in good rhythm in Tests. He should count himself lucky if he gets picked in the second round of bidding. \nThe likes of Australia’s Nathan Coultre-Nile and South Africa’s Kyle Abbott too remained unsold in the first round of auction. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:01.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
