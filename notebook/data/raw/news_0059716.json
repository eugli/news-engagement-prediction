If there is due cause, people will be sanctioned. \n\"The investigation is basically to see what transpired and then what role the individuals had in this incident.\" \nOn Sunday Rapport said Josh Jordaan, the policy and strategy researcher in De Lille's office, gave one of the paper's journalists an official document. \nIt was reportedly offered as proof that August and fellow Cape Town councillor Matthew Kempthorne were victims of a hate campaign, having been found guilty by the DA federal executive of not following proper procedure in procuring party T-shirts in the run-up to last year's local government elections. \nThey were fined about R50,000 each and given suspended membership terminations. Jordaan resigned on Monday. \nDA federal executive chairman James Selfe said the leak of the documentation was \"in violation of the party's policy on the confidentiality of closed meetings\".
