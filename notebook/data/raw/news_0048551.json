(THOMAS KIENZLE/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 19, 2017, 8:07 PM \nVice President Mike Pence and his family visited the Dachau concentration camp Sunday near Munich, Germany where hundreds of thousands of Jews and others died there during World War II. \nPence was joined by his wife Karen, their 23-year-old daughter Charlotte, and Abba Naor, a camp survivor who now lives in Israel, as they toured the former concentration camp. Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, was also present. \nThe Pences walked through Dachau’s iron gates bearing \"Arbeit macht frei “or” Work sets you free\" and placed a wreath of white flowers beneath the camp's International Memorial. \nThe Dachau concentration camp was established in March 1933 about 10 miles northwest of Munich. The Pences were accompanied by former Dachau prisoner, Abba Naor, and Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, on Sunday.

At least 28,000 of those prisoners died there between Jan. 1940 and May 1945. American forces liberated the camp in April 1945, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum . \nThe Pence family also toured the exhibits, barracks, crematoriums and gas chambers before they attended a church service on the camp’s ground. \nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also toured the concentration camp with his granddaughter in 2015. Vice President President Pence and his wife Karen toured the concentration camp Sunday. (THOMAS KIENZLE/AFP/Getty Images) \nThe visit comes a day after Pence addressed foreign diplomats to ease European concerns about U.S.-Russian relations during the Munich Security Conference Saturday. The vice president also met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders during his first trip overseas. \nPence’s visit also comes the week President Trump dismissed a question by a reporter from a Jewish publication about the rising of anti-Semitism in the U.S. during his 77-minute press conference Thursday. \nThe question prompted Trump to tell the reporter to “sit down” and defended himself by saying he’s “the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.” The Pences toured through the crematorium at the Dachau concentration camp.
