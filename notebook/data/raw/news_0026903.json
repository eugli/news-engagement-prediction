But she's definitely still got it in 2017. In fact, the 63-year-old model makes 60-something look like 20-something , and it got us thinking: What is she eating and how in the world does she maintain that killer bikini bod ? Here's everything you need to know.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Yes!

Brinkley puts a bit of manuka honey and cayenne pepper into her hot water with the juice of a whole lemon , then sips it every morning ‚Äî before she even thinks about making a cup of coffee ‚Äî to get herself revved up for the day.\nHer breakfast is very, very full. In a 2014 interview with Harper's Bazaar , Brinkley said she loves sheep-milk yogurt mixed with blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, papaya, chia seeds, raw oatmeal, and walnuts. If she wants more protein, she'll whip up an egg-white omelet with spinach and mushrooms. She's also a huge fan of avocado toast .\nThe Fruits of my Labor!!! #homegrown #organic #goodforyou #goodforourplanet #goorganic!\nA photo posted by Christie Brinkley (@christiebrinkley) on Aug 20, 2016 at 8:36am PDT\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below She's a strict vegetarian... ...but a self-described flexible vegan . \"Because, you know, Italy exists,\" she joked with New York Magazine. \"Mozzarella and pasta exist. In France, I may have to have a piece of Camembert , you know. Un petit sandwich au fromage [a cheese sandwich].\" But she hasn't touched a piece of meat since she was 12 and, over the years, has fluctuated between eating different types of dairy .\nHer lunch is light, but she fills up with snacks. \"I always have a salad with whatever grain or bean was left over from dinner piled on top,\" she explained to Harper's Bazaar. Then, later in the afternoon, she'll make fresh juice using kale, lime juice, orange juice, and avocado and snack on a homemade pumpkin-seed mix made with Himalayan salt, walnuts, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, and dried raisins. If she's hungry before lunch, an apple ‚Äî sometimes with peanut butter ‚Äî is her go-to post-breakfast snack .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below ITS GOING TO BE A GRAPE SHOW!

A ton of different veggies with grains ‚Äî or, as she puts it, going for \"as many colors as possible in a day\" ‚Äî is the goal.
