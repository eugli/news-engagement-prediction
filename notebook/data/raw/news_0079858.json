The company also plans to bring in apparel, music merchandise, pop culture figures, licensed figures, plush characters and an assortment of board games. \nPart of the expansion includes a commitment from Sunrise to hire HMV employees who want to continue their career in music retail. \nStores will start opening in early April 2017. \nSunrise Records currently has nine stores in Ontario. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:18:55.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
