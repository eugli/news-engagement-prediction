Terrorism is not a one-country problem. In any case Kenya has in the past hosted big events and never failed to secure them,” Kiraithe told The Standard.

With the August 8 General Election, Kenya’s desire to host the last of IAAF premier youth competition may now take a battering. \nFormer Boston Marathon winner and member of Kenya's marathon team to Rio Summer Olympics Wesley Korir called for the cancellation of the championship, whose patron is Kenya’s First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, because of lack of competitive teams. \n“I said it before, no team will risk sending their children to Kenya during the electioneering period. Kenya needs to swallow its pride and do what is right for the country; cancel the event,” Korir said following US's withdrawal. \nThe US withdrawal is a double blow for Kenya, which is already reeling from lack of adequate equipment and funding. Athletics Kenya Youth chairman Barnabas Korir admits the pullout has occasioned a big dent on the event. \n“We are done for. I can assure you other countries like Jamaica will soon follow suit. AK regions are having camps, and I have not received a single penny for the camps. The people manning camps want to be paid and no single kid has received travel refunds,” said Korir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:43:23.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
