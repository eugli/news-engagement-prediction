She said she is concerned to learn that students are keeping their \"economically liberal\" views to themselves in seminars, and that undergraduates with conservative views had \"kept schtum\". \n\"Silencing student voices is never what we aspire to as a department,\" she wrote. University of Sussex Credit: Christine Boyd \nE arlier this month, a survey by the online magazine Spiked found that a fifth of universities are “hostile to free speech and free expression\" and mandate explicit restrictions on speech, including, bans on specific ideologies, political affiliations, beliefs, books, speakers or words. \nThe survey found that university administrations are becoming increasingly “censorious”, with nearly a quarter of them having “actively censored speech and expression” in 2017. \nSussex University said that the workshop was about “challenging extreme attitudes, such as racist or homophobic comments” and that the “wording” of the poster had not reflected this. \nProfessor Alan Smithers, head of the centre for education and employment at Buckingham University, said it is “alarming” that such workshops were taking place. \n“The university is letting its prejudices show if it is conflating right-wing opinions with homophobia and racial prejudice,” he said. The university is letting its prejudices show if it is conflating right-wing opinions with homophobia and racial prejudice Professor Alan Smithers \n“It is very sad the way universities are going. Within universities there has always been a spectrum of views and one of the pleasures of universities is having them rub against each other. \n“That is what university is about – enabling its students to think widely and critically and come to their own views crucially backed by evidence.” \nJ an Selby, Professor of International Relations and the director of the university’s Centre for Conflict and Security Research, organised the workshop but declined to respond for comment. \nA university spokesman said that the staff involved in the discussion recognise that the poster \"did not reflect the aims of the discussion”. \nThe spokesman added: \"The University will never try to stifle diverging political views, which are an essential part of learning. \n\"The University will address any instances where it feels its freedom of speech policy is being curtailed in anyway.\" Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:07:11.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
