Roker will stay with NBC, but only in his capacity as a co-host during the first two hours. \nHall had been with NBC and MSNBC since 2007 and has co-hosted the third hour of the “Today Show” with Al Roker since 2014, according to Deadline Hollywood . Roker will host the third hour of “Today” until Kelly makes her official NBC debut later this year. \n“Tamron is an exceptional journalist, we valued and enjoyed her work at ‘Today’ and MSNBC and hoped that she would decide to stay. We are disappointed that she has chosen to leave, but we wish her all the best,” NBC said in a statement released Wednesday. \nHall’s last day at NBC was Tuesday. It is unclear whether she has another TV job lined up. \nThe now-former NBC host said in a statement: “The last ten years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I’m grateful. I’m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you.” \nJust one day after Hall’s final NBC appearance as a host, the NABJ released a statement , blasting NBC and accusing it of “whitewashing.” \n“NBC has been a leader for diversity in broadcasting, but recent reports that Hall and Roker will be replaced by former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly are being seen by industry professionals as whitewashing,” the statement read. \nBeginning this fall, Kelly will take to the NBC airwaves as a daytime talkshow host, Sunday night news show anchor and special political programming co-anchor. Kelly’s new role at NBC will begin just months after leaving Fox News, where she worked for more than a decade. \nIn 2014, NBC named Lester Holt as the permanent anchor of “Nightly News,” making him the first black solo anchor of any evening news program on network television, according to CNN . Holt replaced former “Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams, who was demoted after exaggerating a number of personal experiences, calling into question his credibility as a journalist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:11:05.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
