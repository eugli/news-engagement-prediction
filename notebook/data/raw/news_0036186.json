By Caroline Bologna \nBack in October, Jessica Biel shared an unusual Instagram post that resonated with a lot of moms. \nThe actress posted a photo of a plate, fork and cup of coffee in the shower. “Yes. I eat in the shower. I admit it,” she wrote in the caption, along with the hashtag #ShowerEats . \nThe post elicited a lot of responses from her fellow parents, who commented that they engage in similar multitasking stunts. A photo posted by Jessica Biel (@jessicabiel) on Sep 30, 2016 at 1:35pm PDT \nAppearing on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” on Thursday, the actress elaborated on her Instagram post and got real about parenting. \n“You eat in the shower?” Fallon asked her. \n“This is just mom life,” she replied. \nBiel and her husband Justin Timberlake are parents to a son named Silas, who turns 2 in April. It seems that being a parent has helped the actress refine her multitasking skills. \n“I don’t know if anybody else does this,” Biel said of her shower meals. “I do not have time for anything. I’m feeding him in the morning, trying to get ready and I realize I haven’t eaten. I just take it into the shower.” \nShe added, “Sometimes its a huge success. Sometimes it’s a huge failure.” \nBiel also mimed to demonstrate how she eats while showering and cautioned that it works well with foods like sausage or cereal but not with sandwiches. \n“You should try it!” she told Fallon.
