It added that the ICE's refusal to honour its previous agreement had not been based \"on any new facts about Yee, but solely on President Trump's new directives\", referring to the recent executive order on border security and immigration signed by US President Donald Trump last month. \nThe statement added that while the executive order had stated that the US Department of Homeland Security should ensure that asylum and parole are not \"illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens\", the ICE had interpreted the directive as the \"authority to indefinitely detain all asylum seekers.\" \nAmos, who arrived in Chicago on a tourist visa with a round-trip ticket from Singapore, has served two jail terms in Singapore for wounding religious feelings. \nAn Immigration Court judge in Illinois on Monday accepted the teenager's application for political asylum in the US, setting March 7 as the date for a full hearing. \nIn the 10-minute hearing, his lawyer, Ms Sandra Grossman, appeared in person before the judge while Amos appeared via video from the jail where he has been detained. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:13:08.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
