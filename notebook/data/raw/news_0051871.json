The deal later fell apart. \nMr Manafort at the time was working as a consultant and lobbyist for Mr Yanukovych, who was putting together his ultimately successful campaign for Ukraine’s 2010 presidential election. \nMr Manafort was forced to resign as Mr Trump’s campaign manager amid allegations that he helped Mr Yanukovych's Party of the Regions secretly move $2.2 million to two major Washington lobbying firms .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:24:09.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
