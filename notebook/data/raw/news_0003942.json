We went for an emergency landing in a paddock, a large field, but we didn't see a low power line because of the lighting and the colour of the field.\n'We hit the power line, the plane flipped backwards and went straight into the ground.\n'We were doing about 80mph when we hit the ground but faster than that at 110mph when we hit the powerline just under the right wing.'\nThe Jabiru plane nosedived into the ground, destroying much of the aircraft's body.\nThe men stumbled to the nearest road in Kingston-On-Murray and hitchhiked home after the crash.

Doctors in Australia and the UK treated him\nSomehow Mr Myatt and the pilot, both in intense pain, managed to clamber out and get to safety.\n'My first thought was to get out as petrol was going everywhere from the tank. I dived out as soon as I could and laid on the floor in relief,' Mr Myatt said.\nThe men stumbled to the nearest road in Kingston-On-Murray and hitchhiked home. But they didn't seek medical attention until Mr Myatt's leg continued to bleed.\nHe added: 'We went home first as it was early in the morning. I had a shower and went out for a bit.\n'The real reason we went to hospital was because my cut on leg didn't stop bleeding and I didn't want an infection.\n'As soon as we came out of the hospital we went to a party that night. It was a massive birthday party for a young farmer in a barn, it was bit crazy. It was rocking.'\nFrom left, Ben with the pilot's brother Pete and another friend during a night out in Australia\nAn X-ray of Ben's injured back which turned out to be a serious spinal problem diagnosed by UK doctors\nThe plane crashed in the outback three days after he arrived in Australia on Boxing Day last year to see friends he met during a business course in New Mexico, US.\nBerri Hospital in Australia discharged him on the advice he had a sprained back. Two days later after visiting again doctors identified he had also sprained his ankle.\nIn the weeks after the injury Mr Myatt continued partying, water-skiing and surfing.\nOn returning home to the UK on January 24 his GP referred him to Princess of Wales Hospital.\nThere doctors diagnosed three spinal injuries and a broken rib. They told him it was a miracle he was still walking.\nMr Myatt, whose parents run Bromsgrove local the Dodford Inn, is now undergoing weekly physiotherapy and has been signed off work for eight weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:12:40.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
