Jailed: Ian Stewart (Hertfordshire Constabulary/PA ) \nJudge Andrew Bright sentenced the murderous computer expert, who refused to attend the hearing, to life with a minimum term of 34 years at the same court on Thursday. \nHe said: \"I am firmly of the view that you currently pose a real danger to women with whom you form a relationship. \n\"Whilst we will never know whether you may have had some additional motive for killing the woman who loved you and wanted to be your wife, I am in no doubt this is a clear case of a murder done in the expectation of gain with aggravating features which make it difficult to imagine a more heinous crime.\" \nPolice said the \"sudden, unexpected\" death of Stewart's first wife, Diane - who was found in the couple's garden in 2010 - will now be re-examined. \nStewart scoped out vulnerable widow Ms Bailey on the internet in 2011 - earning his way into her trust and later her £3.3 million estate after launching a \"love-bombing\" offensive. \n\"She was being grossly deceived by someone who was preying on her,\" prosecutor Stuart Trimmer told his trial. Ian Stewart arrested in dressing gown for murdering fiancee Helen Bailey \nOver many weeks, Stewart surreptitiously fed Ms Bailey his prescription anti-insomnia drug, Zopiclone, possibly by slipping it into her morning scrambled eggs. \nShe soon became panicked by her deteriorating state of mind, searching online for terms such as \"can't stop falling asleep\" and expressing concern to loved ones. Murder victim: Helen Bailey (Hertfordshire Police) \nA pillowcase found next to the author's body led the prosecution to suggest Stewart used a pillow to smother her while she was sedated. \nHer lifeless body was dragged into a foul cesspit hidden deep below their luxury home, where her body lay undiscovered for three months. The process of recovery of the body of Helen Bailey who was found in a cesspit deep below the couple's home (Tania Butler/Hertfordshire Constabulary/PA) \nMs Bailey, known for her young adult stories and memoir on bereavement, was finally found submerged in a tank of human sewage underneath the couple's garage on July 15 last year. \nDead at her side was Boris the dog, her loyal companion. \nBodycam footage filmed by police has since revealed the moment Stewart feigned shock as he was arrested for her murder at the couple's home while he was barefoot and dressed in a bathrobe. Convicted: Ian Stewart during his arrest interview (Hertfordshire Constabulary/PA) \nThe author's shattered family welcomed the verdict, but said her death had left them lingering in a \"long shadow of loss\". \nMs Bailey's brother, John, sat in court for almost every day of her killer's trial, while their elderly mother Eileen broke down as she gave her testimony. \nThe family said in a statement: \"Despite this victory for justice there can be no celebration. \n\"Our families have been devastated and nothing can ever bring Helen back to us, or truly right this wrong. A forensic tent set up at the home in Hertfordshire (Hertfordshire Constabulary/PA) \n\"A long shadow of loss has been cast over the lives of so many who will always remember Helen with enduring love and affection.\" \nStewart sparked a major search effort after feeding Ms Bailey's loved ones the lie that she had left abruptly to seek some \"space\" at her seaside cottage in Broadstairs, Kent. \nThe former software engineer's deceptions culminated with a fantastical tale of a deadly kidnap plot by two mystery men called Nick and Joe. Moment killer fiancé of children's author is arrested for her murder \nThe couple had met on a Facebook group for the bereaved and started a relationship within a year of Ms Bailey's first husband drowning on holiday. \nStewart soon became the chief heir to her fortune in a re-written will and gained power of attorney over her affairs. \nHe stood to gain around £1.8 million from her investment portfolio, plus the value of their home in Royston and her coastal cottage in Kent. \nHours after the murder, he also illicitly boosted a standing order to himself from her account. \nThis earned him an extra £12,000 over the three months following her disappearance, during which he played the part of a man wounded by his bride-to-be's abandonment. \nHe is likely to \"end his days behind bars\" due to a litany of health problems which have dogged him for decades, his defence counsel said on Wednesday.
