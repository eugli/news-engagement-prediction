David Aldridge \nPublished on Jan. 30, 2017 \nJan. 30, 2017 \nWhat would the point be to the New York Knicks trading Carmelo Anthony right now? \nMORE: NBA trade rumors: Magic step up efforts to trade Serge Ibaka ahead of free agency \nThe toxicity around the Knicks right now is approaching Superfund levels. Team president Phil Jackson, who has said nothing publicly to anyone covering the team since September, has nonetheless created the impression that he’d like Anthony gone, via confidante Charley Rosen and a sharply critical column Rosen wrote for FanRag Sports earlier this month. \nA Jackson-Anthony summit a couple of weeks ago did nothing to quell the trade talk. The disclosure last week that the Knicks have reached out to the Cleveland Cavaliers and LA Clippers to assess their interest in Anthony made it plain: Jackson wants Anthony out. \nBut there’s no way, right now, that the Knicks will get anything close to what they want or expect for the 32-year-old Anthony. Everyone knows he’s on the block, so no one is going to offer that much. Add to that Anthony’s no-trade clause, giving him veto power over any potential deal, and New York’s not operating from a position of strength. \nIt is easy to say that it’s time to build the franchise around Kristaps Porzingis. It is quite another to determine what Anthony’s true value is in today’s market and in today’s game. That’s not unique to Anthony, by the way. Even though Brook Lopez is firing 3-pointers this season at an all-time rate (career-high 223 attempts and counting), he’s not viewed around the league as a stretch five (or whatever the nomenclature of the week is for his position among the advanced stats folk). \nIn the new NBA landscape, awash with money, teams need to have multiple players in their rotation that aren’t pulling down eight figures per year. That makes Draft picks and young players on cheap contracts even more valuable than they already were. \nThe list of available and willing suitors just isn’t that big. \nThere just isn’t a credible path to get Anthony to Cleveland and close friend LeBron James. There’s no way the Cavs are going to deal either Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love or Tristan Thompson, and let’s be honest, there isn’t anyone else on the roster that would be a blip on New York’s radar. \nNor has Anthony ever expressed any interest in a homecoming in Washington with the Wizards (he grew up in nearby Baltimore). Even if he did, the Wizards certainly aren’t parting with John Wall or Bradley Beal, and have said they’ll match any offer for rising restricted free agent Otto Porter, who leads the NBA in 3-point percentage this season. \nDallas could certainly use someone who can score the way Anthony can, but the Mavericks have made it clear that Wesley Matthews is off-limits, and league sources indicate that Deron Williams is equally unattainable. And the Los Angeles Lakers are no longer in the kowtowing-to-the-aging-superstar business. \nWould Oklahoma City like to reduce Russell Westbrook’s nightly burden? Sure. Thunder GM Sam Presti has never been shy about midseason roster shake-ups and OKC currently has two near non-scorers in the starting lineup in Andre Roberson and Domantas Sabonis. \nThe Clippers are working on borrowed time. Everyone in L.A., up to and including coach Doc Rivers, is under the gun. Owner Steve Ballmer may look like a shot-and-a-beer billionaire, but like all other billionaires I’ve known, endless patience is not in his tool box. Add to that the impending free agency of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and J.J. Redick, and the immense pressure Golden State’s lineup puts on everyone in the conference to keep up in the arms race or die, and it’s easy to see L.A. rolling the dice. They would have to go all in with a pursuit of the Warriors this season, and add ‘Melo where Luc Mbah a Moute currently resides at small forward -- and, all due respect, does not engender fear in the Bay. \nThe only deal that would make sense is to send Austin Rivers (yes, Doc’s son) along with Crawford and filler salaries to make the deal work -- in this case, Johnson’s $5.6 million this season. \nThe Clips are currently obligated to send their 2017 first-rounder to Toronto, but even though the pick is Lottery protected -- the Clippers would keep it if they somehow wound up missing the playoffs -- they can’t send it to New York. If the Clips keep this year’s pick, the obligation to the Raptors flips to 2018. And Los Angeles is already obligated to send its 2019 first to Boston. So L.A. can’t trade either its 2017 or 2020 first-rounders because of the Stepien Rule, leaving the earliest possible first-round pick it could move to be its 2021 first. \nIt isn’t the haul that you would normally associate with a player of Anthony’s caliber, but if the Knicks want to get rid of him as badly as everyone says, they’re going to have to accept pennies on the dollar. Besides, Rivers has been a solid two-way guard for the Clippers, and would give the Knicks a credible alternative at the point next season if they opt not to re-sign Rose. What Doc Rivers would say to Kristin Rivers -- his wife, Austin’s mother -- would be best left to history.
