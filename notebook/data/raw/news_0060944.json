Recently quitting \"America's Got Talent\" over a major disagreement, Nick Cannon announced that his new baby boy has been welcomed into the world. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 124557, \"name\" : \"Nick Cannon\" } } \nBack in November 2016, Cannon revealed that he was expecting a baby with beauty pageant queen Brittany Bell . The comedian even played with our emotions and released a song called \"Baby On The Way\" with K. Michelle , before he confirmed this to the world. \nToday (Feb. 22), the former \"AGT\" host revealed that his new son was born. \"Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose!\" he captioned a photo of himself holding his newborn. \nCongrats, Nick! Dem Babies finally have a younger brother.
