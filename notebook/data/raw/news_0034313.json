Photo by Laurie Skrivan, lskrivan@post-dispatch.com \nFive-year-old Liam was a hyperactive child, and his doctor thought a dog in the house would help calm him down. \nSo Liam was delighted when Gotti arrived at his Florissant home. “They bonded the first time they saw each other. Gotti jumped and gave him a big kiss,” said his mother, Nicole Bray. “That night (Gotti) slept in his bed and woke him up in the morning. I knew he was the dog we needed.” \nLiam had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which made him sometimes act out in anger. “He was able to communicate without the anger when he was around Gotti. The dog would know if Liam was getting upset and come over and nudge him,” said his mother. “He was a completely different kid when Gotti was around.” \nGotti, who was named for an East Coast mobster, was actually a gentle dog, good around children, she said. \nSo, Bray was shocked to find three representatives of the city of Florissant at her door one day in 2011. “They told me I had a week to get Gotti a new home. If I didn’t, they would take him, and I would be fined,” she said. \nSince 2005 , Florissant has had an ordinance banning pit bulls within city limits. Removing the ordinance has become a cause celebre with dog-loving activists around St. Louis, who have packed meetings of the Florissant City Council. \nThe council on Monday night took the first step toward ending the ban. The council took public comments on a measure that would lift the restriction and another that would strengthen the city’s rules on dangerous dogs. Both were advanced for final action, expected at the council’s meeting Feb. 28. \nThe discussion brought out dozens of residents and advocates dressed in orange to show their support for repealing the ban. \n“This ban is responsible for ending lives,” said Andrea Castleberry of the Florissant Bully Alliance. \nShe showed the council members photos of pit bulls and asked if they could follow through with killing the banned dogs. \nWhile some advocates say pit bulls are not inherently vicious but are put at risk by negligent owners and poor trainers, others at the meeting alleged pit bulls were stronger and more aggressive than other breeds. \n“I know that people love their pit bulls, but they are a high risk,” said Alan Jones of St. Louis, citing instances of mauling by the breed. \nSupporters of the ban said other restrictions should be in place on the breed, including rules governing spaying and neutering, and licensing and registration. \nGrace Whitnah said she moved from Florissant four months ago because of the breed restriction. She adopted two pit bulls a couple years ago and said she received an ultimatum from the city regarding her dogs and chose to move. \nA Florissant Police Department spokesman said Chief Timothy Lowery supports lifting the pit bull ban so long as the city’s dangerous dog ordinance is strengthened. The spokesman could not elaborate on what changes Lowery supports. \nOver 700 localities around the United States have passed breed-specific legislation, according to DogsBite.org , an organization that supports banning certain breeds such as pit bulls. Law enforcement officials around the country, including Springfield in southwest Missouri , have reported fewer pit bull attacks over time as a result of such bans. \nAmong the other breeds that have been targeted for bans in various places are Rottweilers, German shepherds and Doberman pinschers. \nBut despite the proliferation of such laws in recent decades, a number of organizations focused on animal cruelty, public health and civil rights have opposed or recommended against such laws. They include federal agencies such as the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development, which say bans must make exceptions for pit bulls if they are registered service animals. \nIn 2014, the city of Yakima, Wash., amended its pit bull ban to make exemptions for pit bull service animals. City officials there said not offering the exception could put the city in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThe American Bar Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the American Kennel Club also oppose such laws, according to the Humane Society of the United States , another opponent. \nPit bull advocates say the breed is unfairly maligned. Its reputation for biting stems not from the nature of the dog, but from the behavior of some owners. The breed, known for its muscular build, is a favorite among dog-fight trainers. \n“I’ve met those people — gang members, drug dealers,” said Mandy Ryan, who used to be an animal control officer in Columbia, Mo. “Every single pit bull that I dealt with that was aggressive, it was the owner’s fault,” she said. \nNow Ryan, of Ellisville, helps lead Missouri K9 Friends, an organization trying to overturn ordinances that ban certain breeds of dogs, most often pit bulls. With good owners, pits are friendly dogs, she said. \nFlorissant has an ordinance against dangerous dogs, and that should be enough, Ryan says. \nRyan’s group filed Sunshine Law requests for documents from the city of Florissant. They show 38 dog bite reports in Florissant in 2005, the year before the pit bull ban. Of those, pit bull mixes tied with Labrador mixes for the most bites, with five each. By 2015, dog bite reports rose to 82. Pit bulls ranked fourth among biters, with seven bites. Labradors had nine, dachshunds 10 and shepherds bit 15, according to records released by Ryan’s group. \nFlorissant seized 201 pit bulls between 2011 and last August. Of those, 164 were killed and seven were returned to their owners. The rest were adopted or given to dog rescue groups. \nThe political battle over the ordinance is being fought with surveys. Councilman Tom Lee said a survey of Florissant residents last year showed a fairly even split on the pit bull ban. \nRyan says that survey was worded in such a way as to encourage a response against pit bulls. So Ryan’s group paid to have its own survey done. \nIn that survey, Florissant residents were told that dog bites had risen sharply since the breed ban was passed and that the top bite offenders were not the banned breeds. \nRespondents favored ending the breed ban by 55 percent, with 26 percent opposed and the rest undecided. \nPit bull advocates are placing their hopes in a bill in the Missouri Legislature sponsored by Rep. Bruce DeGroot, R-Chesterfield, that would overturn all municipal breed bans in the state. \nWhen health officials came for Gotti, Bray argued with them, saying that Gotti isn’t a pit bull. When Gotti was adopted from a shelter, the vet had pronounced him a bull mastiff. \nThe health officials weren’t buying it. To them, Gotti looked like a pit bull. “He has that bully head,” she said. \nBray couldn’t afford a blood test to prove Gotti’s innocence. So she called a friend who owned a farm and agreed to take the dog. Gotti was banished. \n“Liam kind of went back into his shell,” his mother said. “He has another dog now, but it’s not the same connection.” \nAshley Lisenby of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.
