I remember one time, Karen wanted to watch the news and Shannon’s picture came on the TV. Karen Matthews planned the abduction of her own daughter, Shannon (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“My oldest daughter said: ‘I can’t wait for Shannon to come home.’ I said, being the honest mum I am, ‘well, it’s not guaranteed she’s going to come home so we need to prepare ourselves if that happens.’ \n“Karen turned around and said: ‘Look she’s famous now, she’s on TV. Don’t worry, she’s coming home.’ \n“I told Karen she couldn’t give the kids false hope, and she looked straight at my daughter and said: ‘I know she’s coming home.’ \n“It was that comment, it was that moment, I just thought: ‘Hang on.’ \n“I noticed she was smiling around the cameras and, as a mother myself, I just thought: ‘I wouldn’t want to be in front of the cameras, I would be doing exactly what the police told me to do. I would want to be at home with my remaining children.’ Karen Matthew being led from Dewsbury police station (Photo: PA) \n“It was lots of little things building up. \n“But when I raised my suspicions with anyone such as my husband or Julie about the way Karen was acting, they would tell me I was being paranoid and reading into things.” \nWhen Shannon was eventually found on March 14, the community was overjoyed. \nBut Natalie became even more concerned – and had good reason to be. \nShannon was found hidden in Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr after being drugged with sedatives to keep quiet. \nDrug tests revealed she had been drugged for up to 20 months before the incident. \n“When we were told a girl had been found, we were all so relieved we were shouting and screaming,” remembers Natalie. But Karen was just so blase about it.” \nAs Karen heard the news, she walked away from her suspicious friend, who believes she had already been distancing herself because she knew Natalie feared something was amiss. \nKaren, who has seven children by five different dads, went into the kitchen where she started insisting everything must be tidied up and started emptying bins.

They have just told you they might have found Shannon!’ She had to be told by the family liaison officer to leave to go and see her at the station. \n“The last thing on my mind if someone told they had found my child would be to clean my house.” \nWhen Karen arrived at the police station, she is shown in the drama as completely emotionless when seeing Shannon through one-way glass. \n“If that had been my child behind that glass I would have been doing everything I could to get to her and give her a hug,” says Natalie. \n“But the family liaison office told me Karen just did nothing.” \nEventually Karen confessed – but Natalie still doesn’t believe the full truth has been revealed. Natalie Brown friend and neighbour of Karen Matthews (Photo: Ross Parry Agency) \nKaren told Natalie and Julie that she had arranged for Shannon go away from home as part of a plan to leave her partner, Craig Meehan. \nThe trio were sat in a police car when she admitted asking Donovan, who was also given an eight-year sentence, to look after Shannon while she broke up with Meehan. \nNatalie told the Leeds Crown Court trial about Karen’s confession, but she’s still not convinced. \nShe believes it was just another lie told by Karen as her deception spun wildly out of control. \n“She told lie upon lie upon lie upon lie,” Natalie says. \n“I think this was just a way of her getting out of it, by supposedly confessing. I hated giving evidence again her. \n“I looked at her in court and she wouldn’t even look me in the eye. I just stood there and thought: ‘Is that how much our friendship meant to you?’” A community devastated after Karen Matthews was unmasked (Photo: Copyright unknown) \nKaren sobbed in the dock as she gave evidence, denying she had anything to do with Shannon’s disappearance and blaming the kidnap on Donovan. \nBut the jury were unconvinced and found both her and her co-accused guilty. \nSince being released on licence in 2012, Karen has begged for forgiveness, saying she has turned to God as she tries to turn her life around. \nBut it still affects Natalie, who says the new adaption is so true to life, she cried remembering that hellish time nine years ago. \n“The estate got such a bad reputation but I actually think there is a side to the story that wasn’t told,” she says. \n“It was about a whole community coming together and looking for a child that had gone missing. \n“So this programme shows a different side to Dewsbury. It shows the real story.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:04:16.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
