It got rid of desktop advertising platform FBX in May 2016 in order to focus on mobile advertising. The company is also looking to add advertising in its messaging services What's App and Facebook Messenger. It's recently added advertising in Instagram Stories , and has detailed plans to add ads in between livestreamed content. \nThe company beat analyst expectations during its last quarter. It was expected to report $8.51 billion in revenue, per a Thompson Reuters consensus estimate. Earns-per-share came in at $1.41, compared to the estimate of $1.31.
