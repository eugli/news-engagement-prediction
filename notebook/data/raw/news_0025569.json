That ruling is a win, albeit a temporary one, for Gov. Roy Cooper in his ongoing conflict with legislators over a batch of laws passed in December that dilute his powers. \nThe law in question merged the five-member elections board and the state's eight-member ethics panel. Cooper went to court to block the merger, saying, in part, the move stripped him of authority. In particular, the merger took away the governor's 3-2 advantage in appointing Democratic members of the elections board, splitting the merged panel's members evenly, 4-4, between Democrats and Republicans. \nA Superior Court panel stayed the law's implementation until a full hearing on the case. But late last week, the state Court of Appeals reversed that lower court order , allowing the merger to go ahead, despite the fact it could still be reversed. \nThe Supreme Court order once again puts the merger on hold – and reconstitutes the old State Board of Elections – while the courts figure out if lawmakers are or are not allowed to authorize such a merger.
