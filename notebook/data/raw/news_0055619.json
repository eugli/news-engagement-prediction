Williams, Ph.D. 23 Feb 2017 0\n23 Feb, 2017 23\nIn a strangely convoluted interview, the new Superior General of the Jesuit order suggested that different interpretations of the Bible can all be valid since no one really knows what Jesus said anyway. “It would be necessary to start a nice reflection on what Jesus really said,” Father Arturo Sosa said in his interview with Swiss Vatican journalist Giuseppe Rusconi, since “at that time no one had a tape recorder to record his words.”\n“What we do know is that Jesus’ words need to be contextualized. They were expressed with a language, in a specific setting and were directed to someone in particular,” he said.\nAsked whether Jesus’ words have an “absolute value,” Father Sosa said that scholars have been struggling “to understand exactly what Jesus meant to say.”\n“The word is relative, the Gospel is written by human beings, it is accepted by the Church which is made up of human persons,” he said.\n“It is true,” he said, “that no one can change the word of Jesus, but we need to know what it was!”\nGetting down to specifics, the interviewer asked Father Sosa whether Jesus’ words regarding divorce are “debatable.”\nThe priest answered that Jesus’ words should not be doubted but “brought under discernment.” His words continue to oblige, he said, but they oblige us to “follow the results of discernment.”\nThe Jesuit seemed to suggest that the Holy Spirit is very active in the discernment process but was not quite so active in inspiring the biblical text itself, which was simply “written by human beings” and is therefore “relative.”\nWhat is up for discussion, he continued, is “not the word of Jesus, but the word of Jesus as we have interpreted it.”\n“Doctrine is a word that I don’t like very much, it brings with it the image of the hardness of stone,” he said. “Human reality is much more nuanced, it is never black or white, it is in continual development.”\nDoctrine is part of discernment, and “true discernment cannot ignore doctrine,” Father Sosa said.\nAt the same time, however, discernment can reach conclusions at odds with doctrine “because doctrine doesn’t substitute discernment or the Holy Spirit,” he said.\nFollow Thomas D.
