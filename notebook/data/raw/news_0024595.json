That changed to a director with two films — Theevram and You Too Brutus. That designation will now change with the viral response to the trailer of the upcoming film Oru Mexican Aparatha that will see Roopesh making a comeback to the silver screen as an actor. It would not be a surprise if any of the viewers have not recognised Roopesh as he has shed 23 kilos to play the character and looks trim and fit.\nAn ecstatic Roopesh is happy on two counts — Oru Mexican Aparatha (OMA) has turned him into a health and fitness freak and the more important reason, the number of compliments coming his way after the release of the trailer two days ago. A happy Roopesh informs, “Vineeth Sreenivasan and Prithviraj complimented me and the biggest encouragement I got was from Vineeth who said that I had good screen presence and that I should do as many roles as possible.”\nIn a pensive mood, he continues, “I have seen the dirty politics in cinema but want to say that the present generation of stars is very supportive and encouraging of each other and new talents!” So what is the role that is getting him rave reviews? Roopesh replies that he is playing a hardcore antagonist in this campus political thriller with Tovino Thomas in the lead. Roopesh adds, “The film is set in a college where one party has enjoyed undisputed victory for several years till a young leader of the opposite party comes along and my character gets challenged. I do not play the regular kind of villain and I am extremely happy that I got this role as my comeback film!”\nNot many know that Roopesh almost did not do the film, not because he was not interested but because of industry dictates. Roopesh reveals, “Director of OMA Tom Emmatty assisted me when I directed You Too Brutus and it was during this time that Tom narrated the script of OMA to me. I liked it and suggested the names of actors including Tovino. Though I had no plans of acting at all, Tom wanted me to do the role of the villain but the producers he approached were not ready to accept me in the role because I had no market value. Every producer wanted me to be replaced and I told Tom to replace me with someone else, but Tom was adamant that I do the role. Luckily, producer Anoop Kannan came along and he had wanted me to act in one of his earlier films. So he was completely ok with me playing the role.” Roopesh has been getting a lot of offers, but is waiting for the outcome of OMA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:22:54.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
