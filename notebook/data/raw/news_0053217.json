Clooney claimed it's wrong for conservatives to dismiss the 67-year-old’s statement just because she’s a wealthy actress. \nBEN AFFLECK, GEORGE CLOONEY DEFEND MERYL STREEP FROM TRUMP \n“This is the part that makes me a little crazy,” said Clooney, as quoted by Gossip Cop . “When Meryl spoke, everyone on that one side was like, ‘Well, Hollywood elitist Hollywood speaking’. Donald Trump has 22 acting credits. He collects $120,000 a year from a Screen Actor’s Guild pension fund. He is a Hollywood elitist.” Rencontres de cinéma du 19/02 - Spécial césar \n“Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director. That’s the truth, that’s what he’s done,” added Clooney, who also stated that Americans have a “demagogue” in the White House. \n“He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L.A. riots that he couldn’t get made, you know, which is a shock. He made a lot of money off ‘Seinfeld.’ He’s elitist — Hollywood. That’s the reality if you want to look at it that way.” \nGEORGE CLOONEY HOPES TRUMP SUCCEEDS \n“So I look at when people say Meryl shouldn’t speak up — of course she should,” he said. “She has every right to speak up. She’s an American citizen, and she was an American citizen a long time before she was an icon.” \nClooney previously endorsed Hillary Clinton’s failed Democratic presidential campaign.
