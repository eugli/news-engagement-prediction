It is alleged that the woman was then seen standing in water up to her thighs while holding her child underwater.\nSelby said the witness then yelled at her and she then lifted the child out of the water. The witness was then able to get into the water and help both of them get to shore.\nThe witnesses wrapped the boy in warm clothing until police and EMS arrived at the scene to transport him to hospital.\nSelby said Durham police “tip their hats” to the Good Samaritans who stepped in and helped.\n“Here’s two complete strangers that decided to get involved because something didn’t look right,” Selby said. “That was fantastic what they did.”\nSpeaking with CTV News Toronto, area resident Ann Buffett said she hopes she would react the same way in such a situation.\n“When you see something like that you don’t know what’s going on, it may take you a few second to realize the child’s in danger, but I’m sure I would’ve jumped in and done it,” she said.\nThe boy was treated for unknown injuries and later released to the care of his father.\nInitially, police arrested the woman under the provisions of the Mental Health Act but later charged her upon her release.\nA suspect identified as a 29-year-old Ajax woman has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and failure to provide the necessaries of life.\nPolice did not provide the suspect’s name in order to protect the identity of the child.\nThey urge anyone who was in the area at the time or anyone who may have new information about the incident to call them at 1-888-579-1520, ext. 5234.\nPhotos A Durham Regional Police vehicle is pictured.
