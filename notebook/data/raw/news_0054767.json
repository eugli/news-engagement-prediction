They’ve got a lot going forward but their manager makes sure they’re well drilled. \n“The way they play, all the midfield fuses back in. There’s 11 behind the ball, 24/7.” To Socceroo forward Cahill, that’s a legitimate game style, but it has yet to bear fruit. \n“You have to respect that. That’s the reason that they’re at the top (but) questions will be asked when it’s about winning games at the right times,” he said. \n“Come finals time, that’s when everyone needs to be firing. \n“You can slip in the backdoor and (last-placed) Adelaide can do it now if they want and finish sixth and win the league. \n” It’s whoever is up for the fight at the end of the season.” Off the back of last weekend’s showing, Cahill would argue City have stolen a march on the competition. \nTheir drubbing of The Nix was just a third win in 11 matches since City’s FFA Cup final win. \nIrrespective of their results, Cahill says the club’s performances merited a place in the title conversation. \n“We weathered the storm at the start (against the Phoenix) and when you look at it, we played excellent,” he said. \n“We’re working hard to bring some real steel to the team. \n“There’s a fresh buzz about our team and we’re starting to click. “This is like another FFA Cup final. Everyone’s got to be excited about this game because there’s a lot (riding) on it.” \n- additional reporting with AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:00:12.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
