Instead it was Australians Steve O’Keefe and Nathan Lyon who proved pivotal, O’Keefe starring with a record-breaking 12-wicket haul. \nWhile the Indian media was critical of the fielding performance of Virat Kohli’s team — Australian captain Steve Smith was let off four times in his decisive century — they were up in arms about the decision to prepare such a spinning deck. \n“Two days before the Test, Pandurang Salgaonkar — the long-time curator of Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) — had boasted “the Test will last five days’’ and that the “ball would fly”. When asked what happened, Salgaonkar quipped “Ask Daljit [Singh],” reported The Hindu. \n“What he meant was that the pitch prepared by him was “tinkered with” by the BCCI’s ground and pitch committee representatives to suit the Indian spinners.” \nNot only was Daljit Singh’s role questioned by DNA India, the news outlet also questioned his suitability to hold such a role at his advanced age. \n“The question that is now being asked is how come Daljit is being allowed to continue as he is pushing 80 years whereas strict guidelines have been made for administrators, selectors as well as employees,” wrote DNA India. \n“Daljit is already 79 years old. If you can’t have national selectors above 60 years, if your administrators have to quit at 70 and employees are made to retire at 60, how come Daljit is still continuing?” 'It's just another game' 0:31 \nCricket: Virat Kohli talks to the press following Australia's win over India February 25th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Australian Internationals/ 'It's just another game' \nStunned by the humiliation, former wicketkeeper batsman Farokh Engineer questioned the nature of Pune pitch and slammed the home batsmen for their poor shot selection. \n“I am totally shocked. I watched every ball in this game, the first ball turns square, you don’t prepare a Test match wicket in this manner. You prepare a Test match wicket to last five days,” Engineer, who played 46 Tests, was reported as saying. \n“I think the whole thing misfired in our faces. We were too complacent, our spinners are the best in the world, (Ravichandran) Ashwin, (Ravindra) Jadeja, they are fantastic bowlers. We missed so many chances.” \nEngineer said he hoped that the team learns from its mistakes in the rest of the series and changes tact on pitch preparation. \n“We were playing, (like) we are playing IPL. Good bowling. You have to give Australians credit, they outplayed us. It hurts me as an Indian. We were humiliated and this is not (what) we expected after great performances against England and New Zealand,” he added. \nThe Hindustan Times also focused on the role of the pitch in the defeat. \n“With India beaten by spin in Pune, will the Border-Gavaskar series witness such rank turners anymore in the series? \n“That is one question that should give a headache to the pitch curators at the next three venues. While it remains to be seen how India plan to improve on their game, it would be surprising if another turner is dished out for the rest of the series. \n“In Pune, India were again given a taste of their own medicine. Earlier, MCA stadium curator Padurang Salgaoncar had suggested preparing a neutral strip but the BCCI pitch committee head Daljit Singh apparently wanted India to have a distinct home advantage.” \nOne of the biggest chirpers before the series began was Harbhajan Singh, who predicted a 4-0 verdict in favour of India. \nHe too bagged the wicket, but did have some words of praise for his great rivals. \n“Credit to Australia for playing unbelievably well on that wicket,” he Tweeted. \nThe paper was also disppaointed at India’s use of the DRS. \n“When will India ever use Decision Review System correctly? Saturday was yet another example of how they have failed judiciously to use the technology for good. They wasted two reviews on Friday afternoon which potentially cost them at least two wickets on Day 3. \n“And when they came to chase, by the time Australia had sent down seven overs, they were again left without any review in no time. Both Murali Vijay and KL Rahul reviewed their respective leg before decisions and regretted doing that. Result: With India under the pump having lost their openers within 10 overs, their best batsmen and captain Virat Kohli was left without any review should he need one.” 'A lot of hard work to do' 3:47 \nCricket: Australia have claimed an unlikely first test win over India in Pune.
