Palace can be expected to take a ruthless ‘back to basics’ approach with Allardyce adopting a hardline stance having told the players their performances were unacceptable and he has given them plenty of opportunities. Allardyce forced the players into training at 7am on Sunday morning Credit: Leicester/BPI/REX/Shutterstock \nP arish is the kind of chairman who is loath to get involved in the dressing room area but so poor was the performance that he felt moved to act in this instance in the hope that it would provoke a reaction. There is no suggestion at all of any tension between manager and chairman. \nAfter the game Allardyce said the team deserved to be booed after conceding all four goals by half-time against his former club who, despite the win, remain bottom of the table albeit level on points with Palace. Premier League team of the weekend \nA llardyce took over at Christmas but has so far achieved only one victory, and collected four points in seven Premier League matches and spoke of “the fear” that is now gripping the players and of his “shock” at their performance. When asked how much the defeat hurt him, Allardyce replied “deeply”. \nAllardyce’s debrief included making the players watch a video of the Sunderland match and a clear message that they cannot hope to stay in the top-flight if they continue to perform like that. \nParish, a Palace fan, is fully supportive of his manager, and is equally frustrated at their under-performance this season especially as there has been significant investment in the squad. \nThe mood was ugly at Selhurst Park with one fan arrested after invading the pitch to confront defender Damien Delaney at half-time. Delaney was substituted but Allardyce later said it had nothing to do with the altercation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:36:31.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
