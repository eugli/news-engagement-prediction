Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state superintendent of public instruction Delaine Eastin. \nThe only well-known Republican in the race thus far is former Los Angeles Rams football star Rosey Grier. On Monday, Republican venture capitalist John Cox of Rancho Santa Fe also announced he also was considering a bid for governor and was forming an exploratory committee.
