The guest list is like none other -- everyone from Jane Fonda to Metallica -- and the performances range from specially anointed newcomers ( Alicia Keys famously made her industry debut there) to pitch-perfect tributes (like Beck and the surviving members of Nirvana paying homage to David Bowie with a mesmerizing version of “The Man Who Sold the World” last year) to roof-raising performances from legends like Smokey Robinson , Aretha Franklin and many others. \nThe performers are generally kept secret until they appear onstage, but Davis usually reveals a couple of them in the days before, and this year is no exception: Grammy-winner and current nominee Maxwell -- who accompanied Davis for this interview and who will be paying tribute to Prince -- as well as Chance the Rapper, whom Davis may not have intended to reveal, but as the sound of Chance rehearsing songs from his Grammy-nominated album Coloring Book nearly drowned out parts of this interview, rapidly became obvious. ( Billboard asked Davis many of the obvious questions about the party before last year's show, so we didn't bother repeating them; check them out here .) \nThe pair talked about Prince, Chance, Davis' upcoming documentary The Soundtrack of Our Lives , and of course Saturday's 41st installment of the party, which takes place yet again at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. \nMaxwell, since you’re sitting here I assume you’ll be performing at the party Saturday night, and Clive, since you’re wearing a purple tie and pocket square and since Maxwell has been covering a Prince song on his recent tours, I’m going to take a wild guess that... \nMaxwell: I’ll be playing tambourine. [ Laughs ] Uh, not the Prince song “Tambourine” [from Prince's 1985 Around the World in a Day album]! \nDavis: I will confirm that Maxwell will be performing. I had the challenge of trying to decide what would be the best way to honor Prince’s memory, and having seen a video of Maxwell doing “Nothing Compares 2 U,” I was so taken with it that I reached out to ask him to perform, and he very graciously agreed. I can’t wait to have him take over the stage, and I think we will all feel honored that we’ve paid appropriate tribute to Prince. \nMaxwell: [More recently on tour] I did “Adore” [from Prince's Sign O’ the Times album]; I did “Nothing Compares 2 U” earlier in the tour because I’d always change the years [in the lyrics] to be the actual day and time he’s been gone, so it gets a little hard and a little bit depressing for me, because I knew him. \nWhen did you last see him? \nMaxwell: My last interaction with Prince connects with Harry Belafonte . We were shooting the cover for [ blackSUMMERS'night, Maxwell’s recent] album, and I got a call from one of Prince’s many beautiful women [staffers], because he’d never actually call you himself! He was announcing his book [the memoir he announced shortly before his death, apparently not completed], he was having a book party at this club in New York and I went. Trevor Noah came in, and people always joke around about how much we look alike, and Prince says [ deep voice ] “Is this your brother?,” joking around. So later I got a call from Harry and he says [ imitates Belafonte’s gravelly voice ], “Brother Maxwell, so me and Prince were talking and we need your voice [in support of artists].” Now, there was a lot going on and I really didn’t want to be acting all “famous,” and music was depressing me a bit, because -- I’m gonna be honest -- of the streaming thing. It’s not about the money, because I’m good, I’ve made some good investments, so it’s not like I need this check. But Prince was so, so, so passionate about artists' rights, and being creative used to have a reward! So when you look at someone like Chance the Rapper, he’s the antithesis [of the old model] -- he’s almost the answer. For music’s sake, I love that he’s got so many nominations, because he’s saying, “I can put my own music out and make it all happen for myself and bypass [the old structure].” \nDid the two of you [Maxwell and Davis] ever work together? \nDavis: No, although people who worked for me have worked with him. \nMaxwell: Mitchell Cohen [the A&R who signed Maxwell to Columbia in 1995] worked for Clive, and as always happens when you work with someone as great as him, you’re certified as qualified. And Mitchell always stayed in close contact with you. \nDavis: He has a very good critical eye. When I was finishing my autobiography, I made sure Mitchell read the draft pages of it to make sure I’d gotten it right. And my documentary, Mitchell was one of four or five people who I let see it, just to see his critical insight into it. The documentary will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival at Radio City Music Hall on April 19, so it’s a big moment in my life. I had no control over it, so what was most touching was when I got a list of the artists who were interviewed for it: Paul Simon and Artie Garfunkel, who I worked with 40-plus years ago, Santana , Bruce Springsteen , Jennifer Hudson , Alicia Keys, Dionne Warwick , Barry Manilow , Patti Smith . I’m very touched that artists I worked with over the years really gave of themselves to be in it and reflect on our times together. \n[ Sounds of Chance the Rapper rehearsing begin blasting from the ballroom next door .] \nApart from Maxwell, what else is in store for the party? \nDavis: Well, the party is so special. Just knowing the RSVPs, knowing who’s in the audience each year. Michael Keaton was there last year, he’s coming back, Puffy attends every year, Stevie Wonder is coming back, he’s been a very big part of the party over the years. It’ll go on for two or three hours -- we’re both from Brooklyn, so we stay up late! If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have heard Springsteen at Max’s Kansas City or Patti Smith at CBGB at midnight. \nThere’s a lot of political discord right now. Do you feel any … not obligation, but responsibility to reflect that? \nDavis: No, I feel we’re all citizens. We all feel very keenly what’s going on in Washington and in life, but I don’t think there’s a responsibility for the party to reflect that. I don’t think that is an intentional mission. I do know that we all have to be vigilant that there’s respect for art and music and culture, but I don’t think we’re there to send word back to Washington as to what’s important. That night is to celebrate music. \nI asked you last year if any one year was more memorable than any other, and of course you said that’s impossible to say, so you gave an example of one very memorable year -- the Aretha Franklin tribute. What’s another? \nDavis: Each year has been unpredictable and so special, but if you’re asking me to pick out another special year, OK. The year I was leaving Arista [2000] was a very emotional time, my documentary goes into that, and I only had two artists perform that year. The first half was Carlos Santana -- Rob Thomas and Wyclef joined him, and Santana reminisced about how we started together [in the late 1960s]. Then it led to Whitney [Houston], celebrating our life together, and every word and song she sang became personal: “I Believe in You and Me,” “I Will Always Love You.” And unbeknownst to me, Stevie Wonder came onstage and even though we never worked together -- well, he never recorded for me, although he produced Aretha and Dionne -- he talked about how special our life together had been. \nMaxwell, what do you think makes this party so special? \nMaxwell: Anyone who’s been a part of this is a part of the family. And you’ll see someone like Johnny Mathis being watched by someone like Miley Cyrus or Taylor Swift , and in an industry where people are so prone to believe that they need to compete with each other and to do as many outlandish things as they can to get press attention, this is the most contributive experience you can have. It’s not about upstaging; it’s about collectively celebrating, because he is the Don! \n[ Chance the Rapper’s rehearsal grows even louder. ] \nAre there any other performers you can confirm for this year’s party? \nMaxwell: [ Laughing ] \nDavis: I’d say that every era of music is going to be covered. There’s going to be a great, promising, important rock band, there will be hip-hop represented by Chance the Rapper, he’s an incredible new talent. There will be pop, R&B, and there’s going to be very special moments that I can’t talk about. But there will be lifetime memories for those who will be there.
