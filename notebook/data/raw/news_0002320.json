Image copyright AIKEN COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE Image caption Steven Murray is facing several charges, including murder \nAuthorities say he was killed days earlier by a man, Steven Murray, whom he had been trying to help for months. \nIn 1995, the priest signed a \"Declaration of Life\" document, which was witnessed and notarised by a lawyer. \n\"I request that the person found guilty of homicide for my killing not be subject to or put in jeopardy of the death penalty under any circumstances,\" wrote Fr Robert. \nThe note had remained in his personnel file at his own insistence, said Catholic bishops, who are protesting against the prosecutor's decision to seek capital punishment for his killer. \nFr Robert had devoted his life to helping society's most troubled people, including convicts and those with mental problems. Image copyright ST JOHNS COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE Image caption Father Robert \"was well aware for the potential violence that might involve his ministry\", said an archbishop \n\"He was well aware for the potential violence that might involve his ministry, but he cared for those people nonetheless,\" said Archbishop Wilton Gregory. \nThe archbishop was among about a dozen clergymen who rallied on Tuesday outside the court in Augusta, Georgia. \nThey delivered a petition by more than 7,400 people from Fr Robert's diocese asking that his wishes be honoured. \n\"We want to be the voice that he no longer has to make that 'Declaration of Life' a part of the understanding of this particular case,\" said Bishop Gregory Hartmayer outside court. \nBishop Felipe Estevez, of the St Augustine diocese, said the alleged killer clearly deserved punishment. \nBut, he added, \"imposing a sentence of death as a consequence of killing only perpetrates the cycle of violence in our community\". Image copyright St John's County Sheriff Image caption The suspect was caught driving the priest's Toyota Corolla \nThe prosecutor, Augusta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Ashley Wright, has cited four aggravating factors in her decision to seek the death penalty if the accused is convicted. \nShe said these were that the slaying was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman. \nMr Murray, a repeat offender, had asked the priest for a lift in Jacksonville, Florida, before abducting and murdering him, authorities said. \nThe suspect was apprehended while driving the priest's blue Toyota Corolla in South Carolina a day after Fr Robert was reported missing. \nMr Murray led police to the priest's body. \nDuring a court appearance shortly after his arrest, he appealed for forgiveness. \n\"If anybody loves Father Rene, they'll forgive me because he was a man of God, and forgiveness is forgiveness,\" the suspect said, according to South Georgia's WALB News. \n\"I have mental problems and I lost control of myself. I apologise.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:10:09.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
