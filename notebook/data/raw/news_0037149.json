Saudi Arabia has broken up four Daesh cells suspected of providing shelter to wanted militants and recruiting fighters, the Interior Ministry said on Thursday, according to Saudi state television. Automatic weapons were seized from the four cells, which comprised 15 Saudis, two Yemenis and a Sudanese man, the ministry's statement said. Security forces also seized more than 2 million riyals ($530,000) in cash. Among those helped into hiding by the cells, which operated in the capital Riyadh and in eastern and northern regions, was Taye' al-Say'ari, one of two suspected militants killed in a security operation in Riyadh last month. \"Cell members were (also) active in ... choosing and conducting surveillance of targets and passing information to the organisation abroad, promoting the deviant group and recruiting members for the organisation and inciting them to fight in areas of struggle,\" the statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:27:17.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
