She’s hoping to send her other son to Ministik to start kindergarten in the fall. \n“As a parent I feel that it is my right to choose where my kids go to school. \n“This is where my children want to be,” she told Global News. \n“It’s a hub for people,” said Tammy Reil, who has both a son and daughter attending classes there. “This school is more than just numbers and statistics.” \nMinistik Elementary has approximately 128 students and according to parents Global News spoke with, the school’s attendance has been growing. \nThe school was founded in the early 1900s and the current building was constructed in 1951. \nThere’s also four portable classroom on the site and the Elk Island Schools superintendent, Mark Liguori, said they have outlived their lifespan and have issues with mould and mildew. Lead pipes have also caused problems for the school’s water supply. Liguori said it is safe for students but it’s something the board is considering. \nOne of the reasons the school is on the chopping block is finances. Liguori said in 2015, the school board expended $1.7 million more than it brought in from the province. \n“If we continue on that, it’s unsustainable. So as a board, we need to take that fiscal reality seriously,” he said. “One of the options we have looked at is what kind of infrastructure do we have and is there possibilities that we are able to consolidate space.” \nThe school board has also looked into its operations, personnel and programming. \nIf the school is shut down, Liguori said at this point it’s hard to know how much it would save the school division but he estimates it to be between $400,000 and $450,000 a year. \nStudents have a number of options for other schools in the area. The closest is Fultonvale Elementary Junior High, located 16 kilometres away. \nParents said that would not only put a strain on their kids, but also the kids who attend the other school. \n“They could possibly have another 100 kids just plopped in their laps,” Hope said. \n“(My son) said, ‘If Ministik closes, I think I want to be home-schooled,” she said. “It breaks my heart, it really tells me that his heart is here.” \nFor Reil, the thought of losing the school causes her to get emotional. She knows her daughter will be OK at another school but is worried about her son. \n“The anxiety he’s had about going to another school is devastating for me,” she said through tears. “He doesn’t know where he’s going to fit in. Here, he knows.” \nThe school division is hosting a pair of meetings at the school – located at 21246 Highway 14 in Sherwood Park – on Feb. 7 and Feb. 15 at 6:30 p.m. The board is also accepting written feedback .
