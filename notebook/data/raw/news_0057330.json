(Cook County Sheriff's photo /) (Jason Meisner) \nWhen Andre’s 14-year-old sister left to go to school, Sean and Davonta Williams forced their way in, ordered all three family members to the ground at gunpoint and duct-taped their hands and feet together, prosecutors said at the time. \nThe two ransacked the home and demanded cash from the victims, then left briefly to put some stolen items in the car. \nSean Williams returned to the home and shot Andre and his mother in the head so he couldn’t be identified, according to prosecutors. The girl had managed to free herself and run for help. \nAll three suspects confessed following their arrest, prosecutors have said. \nSean Williams is next scheduled to appear in court April 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:46:59.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
