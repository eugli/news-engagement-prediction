'British people are on average sometimes very hard to befriend,' Mr Ruizinowitz moaned. English bacon isn’t what we consider bacon. You have to order “streaky” bacon and even that isn’t as good as American. 'Asking for directions was like pulling teeth. British people would never answer me or were very standoffish whenever I would ask for an address or if I were lost and needed help.' He added: 'The general incivility is much worse. Or maybe I had bad luck. But I remember going to stores and, twice, noticing a scene where a customer was just out-of-control screaming at a cashier. Like, unhinged, raging, utterly nasty. 'And people just drank way more so fought way more on the streets as a result, including attacking bus drivers, from one incident I saw.' Signal failures on the tube Anyone staying in London over a week or so will experience some sort of delay while travelling the tube, with signal failures being the prime culprit, according to the Quora community. Sean Quinn, who lived in London for three years, complained: 'I know it’s an old system but how many signals failures can there be that make you 30 minutes late for work on a daily basis. 'My wife and I ended up using the bus more often.' The royal family The Queen is hard to avoid in Britain given that her image is on the currency and postage stamps and royal family memorabilia is available everywhere for tourists to take home as a souvenir. But Antonio Felgrand, from Texas, finds the UK's fascination with the family bizarre. 'We really don't care about the royal family,' he said of he and his fellow Americans. 'Personally, I find it very strange to see Prince Henry and his family on gossip magazines whenever I check out at the grocery store.' Dreary weather 'The constant feeling like it was going to or had just rained (even though it hadn’t and wasn’t going to) and the late sunrise and early sunsets got to me,' Sean Quinn moaned The United Kingdom is famed for its poor weather and it's always advisable to have an umbrella to hand whatever the season. Mr Quinn was particularly vexed at the unreliability of the weather during the British summer: 'The constant feeling like it was going to or had just rained (even though it hadn’t and wasn’t going to) and the late sunrise and early sunsets got to me. 'Couple that with the fact that you can have an entire summer where the summer never truly comes and it can get tough... I understand why people spend so much time in pubs, especially in the winter.' Bad customer service Americans are well known for their almost obsequious customer service, but in the UK it's a little different. Pope Rudraigh, from California, shared: 'There were many times we went to the “High Street” shops in various cities, towns and villages. 'Usually, they had Europop blasting over the speakers. The staff were far too young to give a f***. They would be huddled in the back of the store/shop yakking among themselves. 'They couldn’t care less that anyone had come into the store. On the rare occasion one could get their attention, it was like they really couldn’t be bothered.' Driving on the 'wrong' side of the road The UK is one of the few places in the world where people drive on the left - and it's unsurprising that this infuriates foreign visitors. Thomas L. Johnson, from Minnesota, bemoaned: 'I really don’t like it that the UK remains the only place in Europe or the Americas (okay, Ireland and Malta do it too) where driving is reversed from the dominant left-hand steering wheel and right lane traffic pattern. 'If I could change one thing in the UK, that would be it.'
