It’s actually the reason I became a marketing major in college. Just kidding. I chose that major because I had no clue what I wanted to do, my parents told me to go with a business degree, marketing was the only business major at Siena that my brain could handle, and the rest is history. And as you can see by my career choice, my diploma is going to GREAT use. \nAnyway, you gotta chalk this up as another W for the people at Foot Locker. They crushed it with the D’Angelo Russell ad and the Draymond Green commercial. In fact if this commercial comes out before All-Star voting closed, I guarantee Russ is starting instead of Steph New Orleans in 2 Sundays. Averaging a triple double should be enough to make you a starter. But a great commercial to spear the movement is the cherry on top that was needed. \nBut again, since I have a marketing degree, I have two notes to pass along to the producer of this commercial. \n1. I know you can’t control that these are the 31s. But can we do a spin on them being the 32s. 3-2, triple double, Russell Westbrook. Boom, the 32s are the Russell Westbrooks in my mind and now I want to buy them because they will make me play like Russell Westbrook. Well maybe they will make you play like Russell Westbrook. I already do. \n2. The Vine part of the commercial was my favorite part. But lets be honest, Steph Curry saved Vine’s ass. Russ helped, but Steph did the heavy lifting by being a video game character for two straight years.
