He said, “He was not only a guy with the greatest sense of humor but a guy that had a human level of decency and love and kindness and humor.” \nMany media figures outside of Fox News mourned Colmes’ passing too with many kind things to say about him, but Slate put out a jaw-droppingly nasty obituary about Colmes that called him a “liberal weakling” who played the part of a “patsy” on the network. It read in part, “Colmes was the most absurd, useless, and mocked television personality in America for many years, precisely because he was nice.” \nHannity was appalled by the piece––posted hours after Colmes’ death, with his family still in mourning––and blasted it on Twitter: Only mean soulless assholes could ever write and print something this viscious, cruel, and heartless. You r so ignorant, wrong, and hateful! https://t.co/u06wk1ytoT \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 24, 2017 \nAnd he wasn’t the only one who found the piece disgusting: Alan Colmes died yesterday. \nThis is how the losers at @Slate respond. Pathetic. \nRIP, Mr. Colmes https://t.co/4cG9ZOIBet \n— Chet Cannon (@Chet_Cannon) February 24, 2017 My story on Slate's distgusting obit on Alan Colmes.

I'm not a liberal. I never agreed with Mr Colmes, but I respect his memory & his family. #Despicable", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:25:41.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
