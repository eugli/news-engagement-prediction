Don't be happy when you are greeted with 'namaste' on Delhi streets – know why By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 11:07 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Delhi Police , which is doing everything to make Delhi safer, has recently busted a new gang of robbers involved in daring gun-point robberies in the national capital. \nAfter the 'thak-thak' gang, the 'namaste' gang is the new trouble maker, which has now set its sight on motorists plying on Delhi roads. \nThe Delhi Police came to know about it and its strange modus operandi after it arrested four persons of the gang, which used to waylay motorists and rob them of their belongings by waving and saying ‘namaste’. \nThe 'namaste' gang members were arrested from west Delhi. \nGiving more information about the gang, DCP (west) Vijay Kumar said, “Four alleged members of the ‘namaste' gang - Nasimuddin, Sakawat, Guljar and Naim - were caught by a police team near Ranibagh underpass.” \nSpeaking about its modus operandi, the top cop said, ''The gang members used to say 'Namaste' to their target or to pass a smile to them and then rob their valuables and cash at gunpoint. They also used to terrorise them by the name of Kanjhawala gang.'' \nThe 'Namaste' gang is different from 'thak-thak' which would keep knocking the car's window pane till the driver is annoyed and steps out of the car giving an opportunity for the gang to rob them, he said. \nNamaste gang has a friendly gesture. They would wish you, be friendly and would attempt to get into the car and steal your valuables, threatening the driver before absconding, Kumar said. \nThe accused disclosed that they are all close relatives and childhood friends. They all have criminal antecedents and have been to jail many times. \nThe gang mostly targeted age old people. After the burglary, they used to take the wrong carriageway, so that the victim would neither chase them nor could they note down the number of their vehicles. \nThree firearms, two used and three live cartridges, and a knife were also recovered from their possession.
