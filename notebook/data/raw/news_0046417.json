A fluffy sheet of banana cake is the perfect partner to a mix of crunchy, earthy nuts and seeds. To make this wholesome cake a bit more sweet, we're finishing it off with a drizzle of bittersweet chocolate. Nutty Banana Sheet Cake: Watch the Video Another One-Bowl Wonder \nI love the ease of making this cake. Like banana bread, it's a one-bowl wonder, thanks to the use of oil instead of creamed butter and sugar. Even with the use of oil, you still get a light cake, which means this recipe is ideal for eating any time of day. A Wholesome List of Ingredients \nWhile still very much a cake, this recipe is chock-full of wholesome ingredients. The mashed bananas make it moist and flavorful. Applesauce doubles down on the tenderness of this cake. Poppy seeds, walnuts, and sunflower seeds make this cake hearty — but not dense — and add a nice layer of crunch. You can swap in flaxseeds or coconut flakes here with equal success!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:02:50.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
