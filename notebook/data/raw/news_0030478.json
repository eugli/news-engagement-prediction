'This was the first time I've had the feeling of failure.' It was evidently also the point the Qataris lost faith in manager Laurent Blanc to deliver the prize they covet the most. He was replaced by Unai Emery last summer and the ultimate test of whether PSG have moved forward comes on Tuesday night when they welcome Barcelona to the Parc des Princes for a last-16, first leg encounter. The transition hasn't exactly been smooth and there definitely remains more questions than answers about Emery and his plans as PSG prepare to take on the might of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez again. PSG chief executive Nasser al-Khelaifi celebrates their win over Chelsea last season Luis Suarez was on target when Barcelona beat PSG 3-1 in the 2015 quarter-finals Suarez leaves David Luiz, now at Chelsea, for dead during Barcelona's win in April 2015 Part of the reason they have received this tough draw is a lack of ruthlessness in the group stage, especially in their two meetings with Arsenal where they outplayed them twice but had to settle for draws. An inexplicable home draw with Ludogorets Razgrad on the final matchday saw them surrender top spot and now sees the return of the MSN trio that tore them apart at the quarter-final stage two years ago. Back then, PSG could take a sizeable lead in Ligue 1 for granted by this point in the season but things have changed and rivals have caught up. Four league losses in the opening half of the season saw Nice and then Monaco take custody of top spot and, though a recent spike in form may yet see PSG claim a fifth consecutive league title, the old guarantees have gone. For example, while PSG have won 10 of their last 11 matches, they could only draw with Monaco, who currently retain a three-point lead at the summit with 13 rounds left. Lucas Moura celebrates after scoring for PSG in their group stage game with Arsenal Edinson Cavani rounds Arsenal keeper David Ospina to score against them in Paris PSG find themselves three points behind Monaco at the top of the Ligue 1 standings More fundamentally, there remains a niggling sense that Emery doesn't yet know how to get the optimum out of his players, with pundits in France speculating whether he'll opt for the 4-3-3 formation we see in the league against Barcelona or the more measured 4-2-3-1. The summer saw the departure of key men Ibrahimovic, David Luiz and Lucas Digne - the latter to Barcelona - and placed a greater emphasis on the likes of Edinson Cavani, Thiago Silva and Angel Di Maria. In a significant blow, Silva, their captain, has been ruled out of the Barcelona game with a calf injury, but Cavani and Di Maria find themselves in good form. Cavani might not yet be matching the popularity of Ibrahimovic, but his outstanding return of 33 goals in 31 games across all competition suggests he can equal or exceed the Swede's goal tally. He scored two brilliant volleys in PSG's 3-0 win at Bordeaux on Friday night and will undoubtedly trouble Barcelona's back line. Edinson Cavani pictured during training as PSG gear up for the first leg against Barcelona Cavani scored two volleys as PSG defeated Bordeaux 3-0 in the league last Friday His conversion rate of 34 per cent this season exceeds all of Europe's top strikers, including Suarez (30 per cent), Gonzalo Higuain at Juventus (29) and Diego Costa at Chelsea (29), while his goal return betters Messi's 31. Patrick Kluivert has a big say in recruitment since his appointment as director of football and he aided the signings of Julian Draxler from Wolfsburg and Goncalo Guedes from Benfica in January. Again though, Emery hasn't fully worked out whether Draxler is best deployed on the flanks or tucked behind Cavani in a central role and it will be interesting to see where the German operates on Tuesday. But that's all irrelevant if PSG don't manage to keep Barcelona at bay and the injury to Silva offers a chance for the young defender Presnel Kimpembe to enhance his reputation. Julian Draxler arrived in January to strengthen PSG's attacking options PSG will be without their captain Thiago Silva for the game after he suffered a calf injury The academy graduate will partner Marquinhos in the middle, but the manager has a key decision to make over the full backs - the conservative Maxwell and Serge Aurier, or the more offensive Aurier and Layvin Kurzawa. In midfield, Thiago Motta is absent through suspension meaning Adrien Rabiot will likely slot in alongside Marco Verratti, who returned from injury last week, and Blaise Matuidi. For all, it'll be an extreme test of their Champions League credentials. Barcelona represent the pinnacle of European football and everything PSG are striving for. And to be honest, they look a way off yet. RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:04:45.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
