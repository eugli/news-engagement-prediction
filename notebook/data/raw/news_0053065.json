All of the centres returned to normal operations, Posner said in a statement. \nThe FBI was investigating the incidents, Posner said. Officials at the FBI were not immediately available for comment. \nWATCH: FBI probing wave of fake bomb threats to U.S. Jewish centres in January \nOfficials at the Harry and Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, north of Milwaukee, received a bomb threat at 10:15 a.m. local time, the second such incident at the centre over the last three weeks, it said on Twitter. \n“Taking very cautious measures, we are sheltering in our gym, as has been recommended,” the Milwaukee JCC said in a text message sent to parents of children who attend the preschool at the centre, according to an NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. \nThe centre reopened two hours later, the centre said on Twitter. \nMonday’s incidents come after three waves of bomb threats in 2017. In all, 69 incidents at 54 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province have been reported, according to the JCC Association of North America. \n“We are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life,” Posner said. \nJewish community centres typically offer after-school activities, fitness programs and various other services. \nOver the weekend, the headstones at the graves of about 170 Jews were vandalized in the St. Louis area, the Washington Post reported. \nOn Twitter, President Donald Trump’s oldest daughter, a convert to Judaism, called for “religious tolerance” in the wake of the reported bomb threats. America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \n“America is a national built on the principal of religious tolerance,” she said. “We must protect our houses of worship and religious centers.” \nTrump converted to Judaism before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner, who is an Orthodox Jew. © 2017 Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:16:14.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
