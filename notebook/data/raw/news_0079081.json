HonestJohn.co.uk director Daniel Harrison said the purchase proves Britain has one of the cheapest second hand car markets in Europe. He said: 'We think this may be the cheapest used car in Britain and while buying it may have been initially for a bit of fun, there are a couple of serious points to take from this.

'There are few other places in the world where you could find a fully functional used car this cheaply, but the very fact that we did it proves that it's entirely possible.
