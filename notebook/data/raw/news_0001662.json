Credit Nicholas Calcott As the saying goes, Too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth. But not at De Maria, a stylish new restaurant on the edge of NoLIta. “Even though we are all very new friends, it was very clear from the start that we all shared a common aesthetic and vision, both in design and a way of providing thoughtful dining experiences,” offers De Maria’s culinary director and executive chef Camille Becerra. Her collaborators comprise a mostly female group of creatives and trailblazers from various industries. Becerra, who was responsible for Cafe Henrie’s colorful, much-Instagrammed Dragon bowls (and before that, the locavore-driven menu at the SoHo seafood hot spot Navy), teamed up with De Maria’s co-owner and creative director Grace Lee to create the all-day cafe. With its colorful, sun-faded interiors and charming patina of a space that’s been passed down through the decades, it has a welcoming European feeling akin to the charming, palazzo-facing cafes of Italy. Amy Morris and Anna Polonsky, co-founders of the design and branding studio the MP Shift, oversaw and executed the interior design concept, while the art director Nikki Brand, who also edits the e-newsletter Stella Spoils, brought her visual and branding expertise to the table. “We believe in the power of women uniting, especially at a historic time right now when women are truly at the epicenter of society advocating our beliefs,” says Lee, a music producer who’s worked with artists such as Kanye West and Lykke Li, and who founded the agency Liaison Femme, which boasts an all-female lineup of D.J.s and producers. Given the volume of artistic talent behind the project, it’s unsurprising that art influenced the restaurant’s design. The place even gets its name from the midcentury artist Water De Maria. “In Latin, our restaurant name translates to, ‘by Mary, from Mary.’ The idea of this iconic woman evolved into other famous Marias like Mary Magdalene and the artist Walter De Maria,” explains Lee. Lee and Brand designed a neon blue Virgin Mary artwork — and installed it in the bathroom. It’s a striking contrast to the rest of the space’s palette of muted pastel shades and sand-colored leather banquettes. Photo An original Virgin Mary artwork glows in the restaurant’s bathroom.

True to Becerra’s trademark style, the menu comprises vibrant and healthful offerings: crisped quinoa and a turmeric-poached egg, lemon-vanilla and black lava salt focaccia — and yes, grain bowls — with a strong focus on seasonality and global influences. “I really don’t know how to explain it other than it’s a byproduct of living in New York City, where one is immersed in so many different cultures and their cuisines,” she says. Consider it a modern iteration of “local” cuisine (not to mention a relevant diversity of nourishing comfort foods for these politically charged times). In the coming months, the group will also open the Lo downstairs, a 45-seat speakeasy-style cocktail lounge where guests can convene for pre-dinner drinks, or afterward linger into the late hours.
