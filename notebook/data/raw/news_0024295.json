South Australia blackout: entire state left without power after storms Read more \nCognisant of the fact energy security and energy prices are currently a red hot issue in South Australia, the government has been attempting to build a political case that Labor’s energy policies are failing consumers and business, and the Coalition is the party of low prices and secure power. \nTurnbull in an interview with Adelaide radio on Thursday said the government was prepared to consider subsidising a “clean” coal baseload power station in South Australia in cooperation with a private energy firm. “We would certainly consider it,” the prime minister said. \nThe prime minister said it was “shocking” to think the state would lose power in 41 degree heat, and he accused the South Australian government of walking “mindlessly into this situation”. \nBut the South Australian energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, lay the blame at gas generators and failing market rules.

Engie decided to sell their gas to the export market,” he said. \nBruce Mountain, an energy economics consultant at CME, said the underlying cause of the blackouts on Wednesday were the same as those behind what happened in July last year, when low supply led to massive spikes in wholesale electricity prices. \n“When the renewables are not operating flat out or making enough electricity, the fossil fuel generators have the market to themselves. And as we know from studies that I’ve done from 2008 onwards they can and do corner the market,” Mountain said. Energy companies withholding supply to blame for July price spike, report finds Read more \nAfter the July price spikes, Mountain’s analysis showed that electricity generators were withholding supply in order to push up prices. “This is just classical market cornering,” he said. “If you decrease your output by half but as a consequence increase your price by a factor of ten, you’re better off decreasing your output.” \nWhen Aemo put out the first of their warnings at 12.47pm on Wednesday, they said they were expecting to be about 100 MW short of their required contingency capacity. \nThroughout the afternoon, Aemo released increasingly urgent notices, eventually directly asking the market to respond just before 5.15pm. \nIn a statement released today, an Aemo spokesperson said the market did not respond, causing the blackout. “AEMO did not receive sufficient bids into the market to maintain the supply/demand balance in South Australia,” the spokesperson said. \nAs a result, Aemo ordered the transmission networks to cut supply to avoid damage to the network. NSW last in class on Climate Council report card for renewable energy use Read more \nAt 4.43am on Thursday, Aemo released the highest level of low supply forecast for NSW, indicating that they may need to intervene in the network there on Friday too. NSW is expected to have supply exceed demand by 19MW between 4pm and 4.30pm on Friday, the alert warns. \nAs with the South Australia warnings, the market operator said: “AEMO is seeking a market response. AEMO will determine the latest time at which it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event.” \nNSW has the lowest amount of renewable electricity of any state in Australia. \nEngie, the operators of Pelican Point, said the second unit at the generator “is not able to provide a market response under the current rules of the National Electricity Market.” \nAGL, who operate other gas power plants in South Australia, have been contacted for comment. \nThe prime minister has been attempting to argue that ideology needs to be removed from the energy debate, and all technologies, including coal, need to be on the table in order to supply secure reliable baseload power at reasonable prices. \nBut the federal government last year ruled out the policy mechanism that most experts believe will deliver technology neutral emissions reductions at least cost to households – carbon trading – because of ideological opposition to that mechanism inside the Coalition party room . Josh Frydenberg backtracks on emissions trading comments Read more \nThe government has also been emphasising the importance of gas in the energy mix, and has been critical of state moratoriums on coal seam gas, but the Nationals have also been significant opponents of CSG development because of the encroachment on prime agricultural land. \nOn Thursday, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said opposition to CSG development in the bush would ease if “a fair return goes back to the landholder”. He said farmers should reap a percentage return from the gross earned at the wellhead. \n“And that means that farmers have a huge financial benefit if they are basically in partnership with the resources that come off their place,” Joyce told the ABC on Thursday. \n“So if you cut a good deal with the farmers, then I think – as long as you’re not destroying aquifers and you’re not destroying prime-ag land – then I think you can find a happy medium in this debate. Because everybody wants to make a buck. Talk to them where they listen most and that’s through their wallet.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:33:16.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
