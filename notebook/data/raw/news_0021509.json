Photo: Jeremy Piper \n\"Cultural change is . . . extremely difficult but it is the task at hand,\" he said. \nThe archbishop released a video ahead of the commission's hearing, describing its data on alleged clerical sexual offending as a \"horrific portrait of appalling abuse\". \nThe commission's research found there had been 4444 alleged victims of child sexual abuse within Catholic institutions over the past 35 years and 1880 alleged offenders. It found, overall, seven per cent of priests were alleged perpetrators. \nPeter Johnstone, president of Catholics for Renewal and a former senior public servant, told the inquiry the real numbers could be higher. \n\"The statistics ... are quite conservative given that they're based on those who have come forward,\" he said. \nMr Johnstone said greater inclusion of women would help change the culture of the church. \n\"Women are half the population and should be involved in good governance,\" he said. \"That sort of thing has to be said very clearly to the Pope, to the Holy See, to the bishops of this country.\" \nArchbishop Coleridge told the hearing that women were playing a more significant role. \n\"There has been an increasing tendency to include both lay people and women particularly in decision-making processes, with real responsibility,\" he said. \n\"If the Catholic church says it cannot ordain women we are obliged to explore ways in which women can exercise genuine responsibility in the decision making processes at the highest levels.\" \nPatrick Parkinson, a professor of law at The University of Sydney, told the commission there may have been a \"culture of facilitation\" in male religious orders which explained the high proportion of alleged perpetrators in orders such as St John of God, the Christian Brothers and the Marist Brothers. \n\"That gave people permission, I suspect, to continue offending,\" he said. \nThe hearing before Justice Peter McClellanâ€‹ continues. \nBlue Knot Helpline 1300 657 380.
