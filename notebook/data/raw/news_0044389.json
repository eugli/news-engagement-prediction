Shuja-ul-Haq | Posted by Samiya Latief Highlights 1 Fazili, now 43, was released following the order of acquittal passed by a court on Thursday. 2 Fazili was 30, when he was arrested on November 21, 2005, just 24 days after Delhi blasts. 3 Mohammad Hussain Fazili used to work as a shawl weaver in Srinagar when he was arrested. \nAfter spending close to 12 years in jail, Mohammad Hussain Fazili was acquitted by the trial court on February 16. Fazili was proven innocent. He was arrested from his house in Srinagar and booked on charges on being part of the 2005 Delhi blasts. It took the family more than a decade to prove his innocence in the court. \n\"They arrested me for blasts in Delhi. I kept on pleading that I had never been to Delhi ever in my life but they never listened to me,\" said Hussain Fazili. \nFazili is one of the three Kashmiris acquitted by the court. The modest Fazili household is jubilant as returned after 12 long years while his family had lost all the hopes. \"Till the last moment, we didn't even inform my mother that I could be coming home. We were not sure of the final outcome in the court. Anything could have happened. So, we didn't want to build her expectations. She has already suffered a stroke because of me,\" said Fazili. \nFor him, these years changed everything. He can't even remember the exact address of his home in Srinagar now. \nWhile speaking to India Today on phone and asking directions to his home, he said, \"I am sorry. I have to pass it on to my sister to tell you exactly where I live. I can't remeber the exact directions.\" \nAlso read: No shutdown on Shivratri festival in Kashmir; separatists call off strike \nFazili, now 43, was released following the order of acquittal passed by a court on Thursday. Fazili was 30 when he was arrested on November 21, 2005, just 24 days after the serial blasts in Delhi. \nHe used to work as a shawl weaver in Srinagar. Fazili and two others, Mohammad Rafiq Shah and Tariq Ahmad Dar were also arrested in November 2005 in connection with the Delhi blasts. While Fazili and Shah were acquitted, Dar was convicted with 10-year imprisonment. Dar has already spent 10 years in jail. \nAlthough Fazili is happy to be back home but has many questions for the government and the security agencies. \"I want those people to be brought before the law not for myself only but for all others who are suffering in jails like i did,\" added Faizili. \nFor more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:17:46.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
