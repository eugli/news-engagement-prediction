Stop worrying about how many calories you're burning during sex \n29-year-old Jennifer Vaughan’s stammer was so bad that she struggled to even say her own name – and, because of this, feared she’d never find love. \nShe’d never have dreamed that she’d be saying her own vows to her now-husband Ashley Vaughan, of whom she met in a house party in 2011. \nHaving worked extremely hard during her speech therapy lessons for five years, Jennifer spoke flawlessly on her big day, bringing 100 wedding guests to tears. \nIn her personally written vows, which she read aloud in March 2015 at Rockliffe Hall, near Darlington, Jennifer told Ashley, 29: ‘You are my one true love and I’m so lucky I found you.’ (Picture: PA Real Life) \nJennifer’s words were incredibly heartfelt – especially as she never thought she’d have a wedding day. \nShe said: ‘Getting married was something I always told myself I didn’t want to do. I couldn’t say my own name, how was I meant to say my vows never mind bring up a child? \n‘But Ashley convinced me I wanted to get married and I realised I should take the opportunity to stand up in front of all the people I love and give a speech – because I finally could. \n‘I was more nervous about the speech than actually getting married. But I was so glad I did it. It was something I never even dreamed of.’ \nJennifer completely owned the room whilst giving her speech – which included lots of teasing jokes at Ashley’s expense. \nBut Ashley just sat and brimmed with pride as he watched all of their guests watch Jennifer in awe. (Picture: PA Real Life) \nHe said: ‘I knew how much speaking in front of everyone on our big day meant to her, so it was amazing to see.’ \nThe wedding day was both incredible for the couple, as well as a huge revelation for Jennifer herself – as she has suffered from her stammer since the age of five, ever since her parents’ marriage broke down. \nDuring high school, she faced bullies who teased her and by the time she reached Teeside University, there were days when she did not even speak for fear of being ridiculed. \nEven the simplest tasks, like booking a doctor’s appointment or ordering food in a restaurant, filled her with dread. \nSome days she couldn’t say her name and even thought about ending her own life, due to frustration. \nJennifer’s life was so consumed by her speech condition that she feared she’d never achieve her dream job as an occupational therapist. \nBut her determination not to lose out on her dream motivated her to try out various speech therapies and hypnotherapy, to get things under control. (Picture: PA Real Life) \nFor a while, nothing worked – until her mother, Susan Golden, 57, suggested a course in Scotland. \nAnd so, in October 2010, Jennifer joined the McGuire Programme, which taught her breathing techniques, allowed her to practice public speaking freely as well as having psychological factors that may have hindered her speech looked at. \nJennifer feels the course totally transformed her life – and it seems it really has, as now, Jennifer has achieved her dream and has landed her dream job as an occupational therapist, and as well has to marry the love of her life, has just given birth to a beautiful little girl. \nNow the occupational therapist has told of her joy, having given birth to 7lb 2oz Edith earlier this month at James Cook Hospital, Middlesbrough, – and her excitement at being able to teach her to speak. \n‘For years I never thought I would or could have a baby, as I was so afraid of passing my problems on to them,’ she said. \n‘But having overcome my stammer to read my vows in front of so many people, I know I can teach our little girl her first words too.’ (Picture: PA Real Life) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:25.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
