Jaitley also did not tinker with the secutities transaction tax. \n\nBSE barometer Sensex rallied 300 points while the Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 8,600 led by gains in realty, power, oil & gas, capital goods, bank and auto stocks . \n\nFears had earlier intensified following a comment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on low taxes on capital gains, even though Jaitley had later clarified that there was no plan to tinker with those taxes. The Union Budget left the long-term capital gains tax on equity investment, STT and other taxes untouched. \n\nJaitley also tweaked the domestic transfer pricing rules and exempted some FPIs from indirect transfer provision. He also further clarified the GAAR rules. \n\n“It was already hinted that FPIs would be spared from the implications arising from indirect transfer by keeping the recently issued clarifications on hold. The proposed amendment to the law would rest at anxiety apprehensions of foreign investors,” said Pranay Bhatia, Partner – Direct Tax , BDO India \nBoosting investor confidence, the FM also proposal to abolish the FIPB, a body that clears proposals envisaging foreign investment up to Rs 5,000 crore. This clearly reflected the government’s commitment for creating an conducive investment environment for FIIs . \n\n“FIPB has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI applications. We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out. We have, therefore, decided to abolish the FIPB in the year 2017-18. Our roadmap for the same will be announced in the next few months,” Jaitley said. \n\nThe FM proposed 100 per cent FDI to be allowed through FIPB route in marketing of food products produced and manufactured in India,. \n\nThe minister also announced that further liberalisation of the FDI policy was under consideration. \n\nThe FM maintained fiscal prudence by keeping the FY18 fiscal deficit target at 3.2 per cent against the Street estimate of 3.5 per cent of GDP . Jaitley, on the other hand, pegged FY19 fiscal deficit target at 3 per cent, a level the government had aimed to achieve in FY18. \n\nWhile announcing a total expenditure at Rs 21.47 lakh crore in FY18, the FM said the FRBM roadmap would be maintained. \n\nThe Economic Survey released on Tuesday had sounded caution on relaxing the fiscal consolidation path. It had asked the government and states to maintain fiscal prudence, but had fallen short of making an explicit recommendation about the deficit target for FY18. \n\nIndranil Pan of IDFC Bank had anticipated the fiscal deficit target at 3.3 per cent of GDP. \n\nPranay Bhatia, Partner – Direct Tax at BDO India, said the proposal for the extension of the period for claiming MAT credit to 15 years is a welcome move. \n\nAbhishek Goenka , Partner – Tax & Regulatory Services , PwC, said: “There was an expectation that the rate of MAT will be reduced in line with its goal of reducing the headline corporate tax rate to 25%. However, instead of that, the rate has been retained and a higher period of 15 years for carry forward for future credit claim has been provided, instead of the existing 10 year period. While this is welcome, a reduction in the rate should have been made.” \n\nNon-reduction of headline tax rates will be a major disappointment to many, said Milind Kothari. Managing Partner & Head of Direct Tax, BDO India. \n\n“Nearly everyone expected that the Budget will reduce the corporate tax rate that would have helped India align to the rest of the world regime where the tax rates are constantly dropping. To win more investment, India needs to compete with the rest of the world economies, including emerging economies,” he said. \n\nAakash Choubey, Partner, Khaitan & Co, said: “Given most sectors are under automatic route, FIPB was losing its significance. Move to abolish it is positive and may give a fillip to FDI, but a lot will depend on a consistent roadmap that Government should lay down.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:10:42.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
