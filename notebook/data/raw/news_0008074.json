More videos Donations debate rolls on \nFormer PM Tony Abbott has joined in the call to ban foreign and other donations to political parties. \nLet's be clear. There has been no breach of the law or rules here, just the technical application of a notoriously opaque system built by politicians to minimise scrutiny and delay accountability to voters for as long as possible. \nThe particulars though are extraordinary: A personally wealthy Prime Minister, no doubt increasingly desperate as his re-election hopes slip toward the cliff, reaches into his own pocket, reportedly handing over more than $1 million.

What is known though is that the Coalition scraped home by a whisker - securing a bare minimum one-seat majority. \nAnd it certainly helps explain why the PM was fuming on election night.

Any disclosures I make were made in accordance with law and to the Electoral Commission and are then disclosed by the AEC at the normal time. I comply scrupulously with the law and the honourable member would be well advised to look to his own party to ensure that they do so too,\" Turnbull told the House of Representatives on October 17 last year.
