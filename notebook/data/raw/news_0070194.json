By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 23, 2017 11:12 am Tax evader and liquor baron Vijay Mallya \nTax evader and liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who was at an event in UK to launch his new Formula One car, took to Twitter early Thursday morning and claimed that Indian media instead of taking pride in a successful Indian entry into Formula 1 (F1), was busy focussing only on lambasting him. He said, “Very unfortunate Indian media do not share pride that an Indian entry into Formula 1 is so successful. Only focussed on blasting me.” \nWATCH: \nAt the event, on Thursday he said he had become a political football for two major Indian parties as they went around campaigning for elections. He, however, added that the parties can present their evidence and let the law take its own course. “Have become a political football between the two major Indian parties which is evident by the rhetoric in the election speeches. Let them come with whatever evidence they have but I doubt if they have any evidence and then let law take its own course,” said Mallya at an event in UK promoting a new Formula One car launched by his team Sahara Force India. \nMallya also said the India had no grounds to extradite him and that he was safe under the law of UK. Safe under UK law until proven otherwise.Would rather be safe than sorry as I don’t want to be at mercy of some maverick in GOI.” Mallya co-owns the Force India Formula One team. \nOn Tuesday, India and UK discussed the issue of extradition of Mallya, along with 15 others, as the officials from both sides met. A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that both sides held “detailed and fruitful” deliberations on the legal processes and procedures in either country and reviewed the requests for extradition and mutual legal assistance pending on either side. On February 9, India had submitted a request for extradition of Mallya. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:52:14.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
