While it’s known that wind and ocean currents play a role in their movement, there has been much debate over the mechanism that causes them to form. Now, researchers have developed a model that could help to explain the phenomenon, simulating the motion of small spherical objects floating at the surface. While it’s known that wind and ocean currents play a role in the movement of garbage patches, there has been much debate over the mechanism that causes them to form. The map shows global plastic concentration GARBAGE PATCHES Garbage patches are regions with high concentrations of marine debris, according to the NOAA. The form from rotating ocean currents called gyres, and are not actually ‘islands of trash,’ as commonly believed. These patches are mostly composed of microplastics, most of which are the remnants of larger pieces of plastic garbage that have been broken up by the sun, salt, wind, and waves. These microplastics are just 5 milimeters in size. The new study from researchers at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and colleagues used data on currents and winds to simulate the debris’ movement. Garbage patches are mostly composed of microplastics, most of which are the remnants of larger pieces of plastic garbage that have been broken up by the sun, salt, wind, and waves, according to the NOAA. The team investigated data from both anchored buoys and those that have become unanchored – also known as undrouged. This allowed them to track the accumulation of debris in five ocean gyres over 20 years. They also considered the effects of water and wind-induced drag.
