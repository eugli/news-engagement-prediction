The Bhatinda lad has been a heavy-scorer in junior cricket since the past three years. \"Shubman Gill is the most dedicated boy I've seen in my coaching career,\" Rahul Dravid said. (TOI Photo) MUMBAI: If there was one player who stood head and shoulders above everyone in the India versus England Under-19 one-day series, it was Shubman Gill . The 17-year-old had failed to convert his starts in the first two games, having got out for 29 and 24, but, perhaps fired up by the \"challenge\" thrown up by his coach Rahul Dravid to go and get a \"big one\", cracked back-to-back centuries - an unbeaten 138 in the third one-dayer, followed up by 160 in the fourth, to play a key role in India's 3-1 series win. The highly-promising Punjab batsman finished the series as the top run-getter by far on either side - 351 runs in four games@117.00. The hosts felt his absence in the final one-dayer, where they failed to cross 226 after resting him from the game. \"I think Shubman was terrific, he had been getting in the first two games and we sort of challenged him a little bit to try and see if he could convert it. He is obviously a good player and it was good to see him get the two big hundreds. The hunger is what you want to see,\" Dravid said. Gill had learnt the importance of scoring \"daddy hundreds\" when he was just 14. In 2014, he had slammed 351 in an inter-district game, sharing a record 587-run stand for the opening wicket with Nirmal Singh . \"After he crossed 50, he played a rash stroke. I told him that he needs to score a hundred to get into the Punjab U-16 team, since a fifty wouldn't be noticed. I kept repeating the exercise after 100, 200, and then 300 too, and since then, he's developed a habit of scoring big runs. \"He's the most dedicated boy I've seen in my coaching career. I once saw him train even when it was raining,\" Sukhwinder Tinkoo, Gill's coach told TOI from Mohali on Wednesday. \"The beauty of his batting is that unlike others, he doesn't need to hit in the air to get his boundaries. He's good at finding the gaps,\" praised the coach. The Bhatinda lad has been a heavy-scorer in junior cricket since the past three years. The belief that a hundred isn't enough to guarantee a win grew stronger in this prodigy a couple of years back, when Punjab lost the U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy final to Madhya Pradesh despite his ton, as they suffered a collapse after he was gone. The loss rankled Shubman deeply. The next season (2014-15) saw Punjab meeting the same opponents in the final, but this time, Shubman's century ensured the title for his team. The boy rustled up 1018 runs@ 92.54 in seven matches to lead his team from the front. Shubman's father, Lakhwinder Singh - an agricultural land owner - wanted to play the game professionally but lack of opportunities nipped his dream in the bud. He then decided to make his son a cricketer; and that too a batsman. \"Shubman was interested in the sport since a very young age. I would myself train him. Our village is about 300 kilometers away from Mohali. But due to the lack of facilities there, we brought him here (in Mohali). He had performed well in district matches and so we shifted to Mohali thinking it would give him better opportunities,\" Lakhwinder recollected. \"My father is my coach. He used to play, but in villages. I was born in a village (Chak Khedevala, near Muktsar) and he taught me cricket. He has been my coach from starting to now,\" Shubman, who now practices and hones his skills at the Mohali Cricket Centre, had told this paper earlier. \"I mostly try and score runs within the V, but sometimes I also play the big shots. The cover drive is my favourite shot,\" he had said.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:05:01.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
