Let me start by saying that no one loves an internet conspiracy more than me. I’ve spent many days lost in a rabbit hole and I’m not ashamed to admit that. But the latest emoji conspiracy from NBA players is why we can’t have nice things. Do you remember the emoji war over DeAndre Jordan and his free agency decision? That was fun and arguably the greatest day in Twitter history. What we have now is nonsense and it must be stopped. It started on Monday of trade deadline week when Isaiah Thomas of the Celtics tweeted out the eye emoji. I’ll admit it did have some merit, since he tweeted the same thing before the Celtics signed Al Horford over the summer. So, the internet went crazy with it. — Isaiah Thomas (@Isaiah_Thomas) February 21, 2017 Twitter took the tweet so seriously, other players started jumping in on the fun. — Andre Drummond (@AndreDrummond) February 21, 2017 ✌ ✌ — Jared Sullinger (@Jared_Sully0) February 22, 2017 On Wednesday, Thomas tweeted out an hour glass and sent the internet into another frenzy. ⏳ — Isaiah Thomas (@Isaiah_Thomas) February 22, 2017 And this is when we got completely out of hand. We now have aliens being tweeted out. — Andre Drummond (@AndreDrummond) February 23, 2017 ☕️ — CJ McCollum (@CJMcCollum) February 23, 2017 These players are just messing with us. They’re having fun watching Twitter twist and turn every single tweet into a new trade. And Twitter has gone as far as checking players’ bio updates, follows and unfollows, and location changes. To be clear, I fully support good internet fun, so just make sure you know these players are totally stringing you along and laughing with every update. Since cryptic emojis were taking over NBA Twitter, we asked which emojis you would use in a cryptic situation. Here are some of our favorites. — Andrew Pevny (@apevny) February 23, 2017 @SBNationNBA (I mean you don't even know what to do. Stop slow or go.
