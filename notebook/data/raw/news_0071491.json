Compare the best rates across providers and save on costs But thanks to a recent change in Spanish law, banks are now jointly liable with developers for the loss of downpayments on properties bought off-plan.\nAs a result, Malcolm, 56, has got back the whole amount plus interest. With the pound currently weak against the euro this means he has banked £200,000, even after legal costs.\nA flood of new claims is now expected as British buyers seek to recoup similar payments estimated to be worth a total £5.3billion, including interest.\nAnalysts at the Centre for Economics & Business Research suggest 130,000 British purchasers are owed between £10,000 and £500,000 each.\nKEY STEPS IN MAKING A SUCCESSFUL LEGAL CLAIM - Dig out documentation, including the contract signed with the developer.\n- Provide proof of payments into a Spanish bank account. If a payment was made via lawyers or estate agents, evidence will be required that the money was transferred to the developer.\nThe lawyer taking on a claim may require a Power of Attorney to chase missing paperwork and to progress the case.\n- Produce any court judgments relating to previous action so lawyers can examine earlier decisions.\n- Supply other supporting documents for the property, such as development plans.\n- Consider deadlines. As a general rule you have 15 years after a developer has failed to deliver the property promised to make a claim to get your deposit back.\nThe longer you leave a claim the harder it will be to get a successful result.\n- Find a reputable lawyer through recommendation or via the Association of International Property Professionals at aipp.org.uk.\nNo-win, no-fee deals may be offered where cases seem clear cut, with a percentage of the final payout taken in lieu of a fee.\nAn alternative is to make stage payments as a case progresses or choose a fixed-fee arrangement.\n- Beware claims chasers. There will be sharks circling for a piece of the multi-billion pounds reclaims action.\nIndependent overseas mortgage expert Simon Conn warns: ‘This is another potential money-making scheme for unscrupulous firms.\nEnsure you choose an independent lawyer that is expert in the field and remember a reputable firm will not cold-call you with promises of getting your money back for an up-front fee.’\nThe turning point for victims such as Malcolm came in 2013 when a Spanish court ruled that banks must return deposits even when no guarantee was in place when a developer went bankrupt.\nThe ruling pointed to a law dating back to 1968 that said buyers must be given guarantees on deposits.\nThis was reinforced by the supreme court in Madrid in December 2015. In the heat of the Spanish property boom many builders did not arrange protection and banks began to withdraw guarantees once they sensed an impending property crash.\nRuling: The ruling pointed to a law dating back to 1968 that said buyers must be given guarantees on deposits\nMalcolm was fortunate to have kept the paperwork to back up his case, crucial for anyone planning to fight a claim.\nHe says: ‘It has been a nightmare hanging over me for years and emotionally I had given up on seeing the money again.\nBut my lawyer Carlos Comitre Couto was so determined to seek justice I became optimistic I would succeed in the end.’\nMalcolm signed up Couto after seeing his name crop up on internet discussion boards for victims.\nBUYING NOW? MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD LAWYER Brexit uncertainty has unnerved would-be buyers considering a property in any European Union country.\nBut good prices in Spain mean interest is picking up again.\nFor example, property sales in the Costa Blanca nearly doubled last year according to Halo Financial, a currency exchange specialist, with a 60 per cent increase in UK buyers.\nBut buyers beware:\n- Hire a reputable lawyer to check all contracts.\nPeter Esders, of UK-based international property lawyer Judicare, says: ‘Do not choose the pet lawyer recommended by the developer who will tell you everything’s fine about the deal.’\nFind an independent firm through personal recommendation or via the Association of International Property Professionals.\n-Scrutinise contract wording carefully. Some contracts may be worded to appear you will get your money back if a property is not completed on time but they often have nasty get-out clauses.\nEsders says: ‘We have seen clauses saying buyers will get their money back if the property is not completed within 18 months of the developer getting planning permission.\n'The builders may never get planning permission so they can then argue the contract is not broken.’\nA good lawyer will spot these anomalies as well as make sure planning permission is watertight.\nEsders adds: ‘Contracts usually come written in English and Spanish alongside each other. You will need to check the accuracy of the English translation. When I look at contracts I tend to focus on the Spanish version as that will be the legally binding one.’\n-Make sure vital protections are in place, including bank guarantees to return deposits if a developer does not deliver or goes bust. This might only be for the short term.\n- Check the developer owns the land and has the right to build there.\n- Pay deposits by bank transfer rather than cheque and never with cash. Check the developer does not pass on taxes to you that they are in fact obliged to pay.\nThe lawyer was so convinced of eventual redress for Malcolm and others that he helped set up service Spanish Legal Reclaims last year to help buyers get back their money.Malcolm says: ‘I think it will be much easier for others now.’\nCouto’s colleague, Luis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, says three more of its British clients have won their cases and are awaiting payment. It is ploughing through many more.\nSpanish banks are now setting aside huge sums to meet the anticipated flood of claims from buyers like Malcolm.\nLawyers such as Spanish Legal Reclaims must fight each case separately and the process is not speedy, taking up to two years. Banks are likely to appeal any case found in a buyer’s favour.\nCuervo says: ‘Banks will hire the best lawyers as they do not want to make it too easy. But we are winning cases. It is not just a hope now – it is actually happening.’\nVictims who use Spanish Legal Reclaims are considered on a no-win, no-fee basis. If the claim is successful, the firm charges a fee of about a third of the amount recovered.\nMalcolm plans to put a portion of his long-awaited windfall into a technology start-up developing anti-ageing cosmetics.\nThe divorcee, from East Woodburn, Northumberland, says: ‘I had been going to Marbella since 1984 as my aunt had a villa there and I loved the place.\n'In 2004 I decided to buy two properties off-plan. It seemed like a great idea as there was no sign of a global financial crisis.’\nUnlike the majority of buyers nursing losses, Malcolm’s properties were completed. But he was unable to take ownership because the planning permission was illegal.\nTaking action is not without risk. If a claim fails, legal bills must be met by the losing side. Cuervo says: ‘We cannot promise a 100 per cent success rate. But we will not take on a case that looks like it might lose.’\nAmong those also hoping to recoup losses is football legend Geoff Hurst, famed for the hat trick that secured the 1966 World Cup for England.\nHe told The Mail on Sunday recently he had ‘written off’ a £253,000 deposit he put down on a Marbella home until he heard of successful claims made by Spanish residents who, like him, did not have bank guarantees.\nHurst, 75, has hired lawyers Bufete Salmeron – the firm behind the 2013 court case that highlighted the responsibility of banks to provide guarantees.\nHoliday Money Deals of the Week Free currency exchange card FairFX reader offer Avios point for spending BA Premium Plus 0% currency fees 18.9% (APR) Zero card 0% foreign fees in Europe Current Account 0% foreign fees Free cash abroad Halifax Clarity credit card", "external_links": ["https://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_SANTANDER_PURCHASE_CARD&index=88&count=118&selectedProductId=CC_SANTANDER_PURCHASE_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO12", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AMEX_BRIT_AIRPREPLUS&index=7&count=7&selectedProductId=CC_AMEX_BRIT_AIRPREPLUS&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO12", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-3406415/Foreign-exchange-rates-transfer-money-abroad-less.html", "http://www.fairfx.com/refer/thisismoneygbp", "https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/bank-accounts/products/current-account/", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_HALIFAX_CLARITY&index=7&count=8&selectedProductId=CC_HALIFAX_CLARITY&gid=CC_LOWRATE&page=&source=THISMO12"], "published": "2017-02-25T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:25:13.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
