It has also had devastating effect on her confidence. \nHer physical deterioration means she has to rely on parents, Barbara and Pete Mason, to help look after her little boy Lawrence, aged 18 months, who was born before Babs’ symptoms became severe.

We’re now at stage where Babs is having one appointment with the consultant every six months.

It’s just that they don’t have any other patients with the same illness. \n“It’s heartbreaking for a parent to see their daughter like this. Babs has no life any more. Barbara Mason and Daughter Barbara (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \n“We’re trying to do everything we can so she can maintain as much independence and dignity as possible. \n“But it’s very difficult. Babs can fall more than 12 times a day on a bad day. \n“Her walking is very stiff now and sometimes her legs just give way. It’s scary for us in case something bad happens to her while we’re out. \n“We’re at a stage where we feel like no one is fighting for her. \n“We’re hoping by publicising her illness someone somewhere might be able to give us some advice on treatment or medication. \n“We don’t know what the future holds. We are just desperate to help improve our daughter’s quality of life in any way.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:19:50.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
