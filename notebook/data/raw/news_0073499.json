A team like (Manchester) United, people will always believe them, because they have the history. \n“We just try to do our best, try to come close to United, but it's what's got to happen in the few years coming. \n\"From the beginning of the season until now, we always do that [attack], we always show that, that's the most important. With the new manager now it's all about attack. \n“Sometimes you can do a mistake, but mistakes are part of the game. If you don't do mistakes, the football is not going to follow. We try to keep it going, try to be focused, try to do what we can.” \nCity served up what will go down as an all time classic in the Champions League with their 5-3 win over Monaco at the Etihad.

When I sit on the sofa, watching a European game, that's the kind of performance I want to see. \n\"We need to score two goals and we have to be careful. The tie is not finished yet, still we have a game to play away at Monaco. We have to not underestimate them, and try to score goals again. We are a team we can score goals or we can concede goals.

We showed a lot of desire and hunger as well to win.” \nMeanwhile, Sergio Aguero has admitted his future at Manchester City is out of his hands. \nAguero, the two goal hero in the win over Monaco, insists he wants to stay but claims the club will make a decision in the summer.

Fortunately he counted on me, now I have to help the team and show what I can do.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:49:51.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
