(Photo: Courtesty: Britax) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON – The Britax click-and-go mounts on its stroller frames have been recalled because they sometimes disconnect from car seats, allowing a child to fall, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Thursday. \nAbout 676,000 of the strollers have been sold, according to the commission, along with 36,400 in Canada and 4,600 in Mexico. \nBritax said in a statement that an investigation found that damage to the stroller frame could occur when it is stowed or dropped while the click-and-go receivers are attached. #Recall : @Britax B-Agile, BOB Motion strollers w/Click & Go receivers; Fall hazard; Free remedy https://t.co/TVKA0NBrBq pic.twitter.com/C96liGrNx5 — U.S. CPSC (@USCPSC) February 16, 2017 \nThe company urged consumers to stop using the B-Agile and BOB Motion strollers in cars, but said they were safe to use a stroller as a recliner for an infant. \nThe company told consumers not to return the product to the retailer, but to dispose of the click-and-go receivers. For a single stroller, the company is providing a remedy kit to fix the broken part. \nMore information is available from the company can be contacted at us.britax.com/recall or at 844-227-0300 from 8:30 a.m.to 7 p.m. Eastern time on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday.
