Laws to protect victims of domestic abuse are finally going to improve \nThe court heard the shop manager, Hamza Naeen, who is also a student at Newcastle University, was at work when the defendant entered Dixy Chicken on West Road at around 4.45pm. \nJames Long, prosecuting, said: ‘At first he thought the defendant was coming into the take-away to buy some food but instead he asked for a warm blanket for his snake, “It’s a cold blooded animal” he told him. \n‘At this point the shopkeeper noticed the defendant had a large snake wrapped around his wrist. He’s now banned from Dixy Chicken (Picture: Google) \n‘He tells him he doesn’t have a blanket and asks him to leave as he can see a customer looking scared because a man has just walked into a take-away restaurant with a python wrapped around his wrist.’ \nThe court was told Dando shouted ‘here don’t talk to me like that, I will smash your head in and throw this snake at you’ as he was asked to leave. Woman arrested after death of Kim Jong-Un’s half-brother ‘thought she was in comedy show prank’ \nLong added: ‘The witness was clearly frightened, he had never seen a snake before in his life and didn’t know what would happen if the snake was thrown at him. He was worried what would happen.’ \nThe chicken shop manager handed two pieces of chicken free-of-charge over the counter in the hope that Dando would feed the snake and leave, the court heard. \nHowever, while still wearing the python like a scarf, Dando ate both chicken strips intended to placate the hungry snake himself and asked for a drink to wash it down with. \nHe eventually left the shop after he heard a manager tell a colleague to call the police. \nDefending Adrian Ions said that Dando had made a ‘stupid’ comment.
