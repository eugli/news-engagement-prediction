Advertisement \nJust nice I have a friend who is in the insurance line but is from Prudential Singapore, she accompanied my mum down to the business office to settle the issue with them. \nFrom the understanding of my friend from Prudential, once we applied for the LOG, we only need to settle any DIFFERENCE between the LOG amount and the interrim bill. She also has a few patient admitted in Mount E as me at the same time and this never occur to them. \nSo of course next best move is to call my seemingly incompetent agent for an explanation, AND GUESS WHAT? \nThe best response he manage to pull off to smog through and tell my mum is that, \"oh Private hospital maybe will happen one lo, if you want confirm no problem then you go in to Government hospital lo\". \nEh siao eh limbei buy private hospital plans and rider end up you tell me for safe go lodge in government hospital? hello Income please give me a satisfactory explanation for this rubbish response. Mind you that i have quite a number of media & reporter friends, unless you want this scandal to appear on every mediacorps channel, I hope to hear from your higher management within a week of this post. \nAnd the next thing he tell us lagi best, \"remember to ownself submit your claims and documents ah, cause i don't do all these one, the clients need to ownself settle\" \nWell, that definitely crossed the line, in my contacts, i have at least 20 insurance agents that i can easily swap to, but guess what? because i have my claim to settle first before i can ditch this useless agent which every time meet my family first and last thing is always hard selling policy to us. TO ALL MY INSURANCE AGENTS FRIENDS \nPlease don't be like this guy here, i just had my operation for sleep apnea so i can't talk at all, if not i would had call my agent up and gave him hell. Gentle Reminder, Income you have 7 more days. \nYours Sincerely A fucking pissed off client Source:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:30:58.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
