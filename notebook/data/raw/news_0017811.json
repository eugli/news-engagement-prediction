The 25-year-old Nottawasaga man rushed to hospital with serious injuries, but was later pronounced dead.\nThe memorial, which contains a cross with “RIP Dylan” on it, could be seen Monday surrounded by flowers and a Toronto Blue Jays hat.\nThe trail was in an \"open limited\" status at the time, which means sledders are advised to use extreme care and reduce their speed.  \nPolice haven't said how fast Robinson's snowmobile was going.\nRelated Stories Nottawasaga man dies in snowmobile crash Photos A memorial for a snowmobile rider who died over the weekend can be seen on a trail in the Blue Mountains, Ont. on Monday, Feb. 6, 2017.
