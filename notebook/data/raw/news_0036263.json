She describes Phillips as, “fierce, passionate and loyal.” \n“Being a leader is never easy and good strong leaders upset some people and they make other people happy, and it’s not the same people at the same time,” Meheden said. \n“I think the beauty of Shannon is that she is very curious and very inquisitive so she ensures that she hears multiple sources and that she asks a lot of questions.” \n“You want to talk about leadership? Cheryl Meheden has exemplified it throughout her contributions to this community,” Phillips said. “It’s always an honour when someone who is as accomplished as Meheden, thinks highly enough of me to take the time to go through the application process.” \nThe minister said there are so many more women in this community who will continue to be recognized in years to come. \n“Now that I have received this honour, I’m going to be looking for women in the community and women-identified individuals who are also making those contributions and from various backgrounds,” Phillips said. \n“From immigrant backgrounds [to] indigenous backgrounds, to make sure we are honouring all of the contributions that make this place great.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
