A few supporters then hit the photograph of the PM kept on a chair on the stage with shoes while the minister was present on the dais. \nAn enraged senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said the party would raise the issue in both Houses of Bihar Assembly tomorrow demanding the removal of Mastan. \n\"One can have ideological difference. But, the Constitution does not allow a person, who is a minister in a state, to incite a crowd and to humiliate a Prime Minister in this manner,\" Sushil Modi told PTI. \nState Congress president and minister Ashok Choudhary said though he has not seen the video, but \"people in public life should keep control over their language.\" \nRepeated attempts to contact Mastan for his comments proved futile as his phone remained switched off.
