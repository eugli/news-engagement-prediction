A flash flood watch has been issued for Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties from Friday morning through Saturday morning. Evacuations have been ordered in some burn areas. High surf could cause coastal flooding. Powerful winds could result in downed trees and power lines. Feb. 17, 2017, 2:53 p.m. Watch 'explosive' landslide size of 3 football fields travel down San Bernandino County mountain Veronica Rocha \nSan Bernardino County firefighters captured the moment a massive landslide the length of three football fields crumbled into a mountain on Thursday. \nThe 1:05 minute video shows a large swath of snow, rock, soil and timber slide off a San Bernardino County mountainside. The debris then traveled into a valley below. \nThe landslide is 300 yards wide and extends 1,000 feet from top to bottom in the Slide Canyon area, fire department spokesman Eric Sherwin said. \nSherwin said the landslide is threatening four homes and a fire station in the unincorporated community of Forest Falls. It can also impact Valley Of The Falls Drive — a major road for residents living in the area. \nThe blockage could trap a couple of hundreds of residents for several days, he said. \nWhen firefighters first discovered the landslide about 10 a.m. Thursday, Sherwin said, it was \"explosive\" and chunks of debris were falling. \nAlthough the landslide is now controlled, firefighters worry Friday’s storm could speed up the process.
