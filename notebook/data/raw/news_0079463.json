Then again, Van Dyk’s journey to Michigan State hasn’t exactly been normal in any way. \nVan Dyk is one of three seniors, along with Alvin Ellis and injured Eron Harris , who will be honored on senior day after the Spartans’ game Sunday against No. 15 Wisconsin (4 p.m./CBS). \n“I really have no idea what to expect,” Van Dyk said Friday. “Midway through the season this year, I thought senior day would come and it would be just another day. Now that it’s coming up … looking back on the past few years, there’s a chance it might be an emotional day.” \nNo one expected much from Van Dyk, either, when he quietly showed up on MSU’s roster three years ago . And his story is perhaps Tom Izzo’s most unexpected among a long line of walk-ons who have contributed to his program. \nThe 2012 Imlay City High grad received mostly NCAA Division II and III offers out of high school, as well as interest from NAIA schools and an offer to walk on at Oakland University. He chose Hope College in Holland but left after a semester and enrolled at St. Clair County Community College in Port Huron. \nIn his one playing season at St. Clair, Van Dyk earned first-team All-Region XII for averaging 16.6 points and 8.1 rebounds while shooting 55.6 percent in 29 games. He enrolled at MSU the summer of 2014 and started showing up for open practices after spending mornings working on his family’s lettuce farm in Imlay City. That persistence eventually earned Van Dyk a walk-on spot for the 2014-15 season, when both he and Harris had to sit out due to NCAA transfer regulations and served as a vital practice players as the Spartans made the Final Four. \n“When the team was on the road and we were back here, we spent a lot of days together, getting to know each other,” Van Dyk said of Harris. “I really appreciate how much work he’s put in, and I know how much he loves the game. I feel like I just want to do whatever I can to send him off right.” \nRarely used off the bench a year ago, Van Dyk wowed his teammates and fans with some late-game dunks. Then when Schilling and Carter went down this season, he got pressed into duty at power forward out of necessity. \nWhen freshman phenom Miles Bridges got hurt, the 6-foot-5, 220-pound Van Dyk was inserted in the Spartans’ starting lineup for a four-game stint – all MSU victories. \n“He started at a Big Ten school, a top-20 school at the time,” said Izzo, himself a former walk-on at Northern Michigan. “That’s a story in itself.” \nVan Dyk’s limitations are obvious against much bigger players. He averages 1.4 points and 1.9 rebounds in 8.4 minutes over 26 games, making 52% of the limited shots he’s taken (13-for-25). However, he also has shown grit and tenacity playing out of position in the post, adding 11 blocks and eight steals. He played a career-record 23 minutes against Oakland, scored a personal-best seven points against Rutgers and grabbed a career-high nine rebounds against Youngstown State . \nAll things that far surpassed his expectations of taking the leap of faith to transfer into one of the nation’s top programs. \n“Matt Van Dyk,” Izzo said with a grin, “I mean, he lives a dream.” \nContact Chris Solari: .
