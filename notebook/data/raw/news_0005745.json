Their first conversation was sailing along when Mr. Weisman almost made another terrible mistake. “I think this is going well,” he said abruptly. “What do you think? Do you want to meet up again?” Ms. Zuckerman didn’t know what to think. “I was kind of paralyzed for a moment,” she said, and laughed. “No one had ever asked me for a middate evaluation.” Mr. Weisman quickly recovered. “It was more of a recommendation than an evaluation,” he joked. They were soon dating “long distance,” as Mr. Weisman put it, referring to the one-hour bumper-to-bumper haul between their homes, hers west of Interstate 405 and his to the east. In November 2014, they took their first weekend road trip together, to Palm Springs. The next month, they rode dune buggies together on Pismo Beach, where Mr. Weisman first told Ms. Zuckerman that he loved her. “By that point, I loved him too, but I didn’t want to be the first to say it,” Ms. Zuckerman said, “though it almost slipped a million times.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As their love grew, so too did their disdain for their long-distance commute. “I lived beneath the Hollywood sign, and she lived clear across town,” Mr. Weisman said. “Sitting in all of that traffic just wasn’t fun anymore. We may as well have been living in different states, so we took what seemed like the next logical step.” That step was taken by Ms. Zuckerman in February 2015, just four months after she met Mr. Weisman, when she moved into his apartment. “It made things a lot easier,” Mr. Weisman said. “We never fought or got sick of each other, and no matter what I suggested, whether it was trying a new restaurant or going to a museum or concert, or even driving cross country, Lizzie was always up for a new adventure.” In the coming months, they would travel to Hawaii, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, Japan, France, Germany and Colombia, among other places. Their greatest adventure, however, began to coalesce in October 2015, when they became engaged. As it turned out, marriage was not the only thing Mr. Weisman proposed: He asked Ms. Zuckerman, who had also grown tired of the Los Angeles scene, if she would consider moving with him to Nashville, where Roc Nation was opening up an office. “At first I thought, I’m definitely not moving there,” Ms. Zuckerman said. “But then I thought about it, and realized that if we stayed in Los Angeles, we would have never taken the next step, because it’s impossible to feel financially secure there, especially for two people who just got engaged and wanted to buy a home and start a family. “But Nashville was that kind of family-friendly place where we could put roots in the ground and have a real life together. It has seasons and real people who you can communicate with every day, which sort of snaps you back into reality.” In April 2016, they put Los Angeles in the rearview mirror and drove onward to a new life in Tennessee, where Ms. Zuckerman soon opened a project management consultancy that bears her name. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Nashville is a cute little town pretending to be a big city,” Mr. Weisman said, “but it’s certainly a big enough place for us to get a fresh start.” They were married on Jan. 14 at the Riverhorse on Main, a restaurant in Park City, Utah, with a rustic-meets-elegant vibe and dark wood floors, exposed brick walls, stone and metal accents and a front-of-the-house atrium that overlooks the town’s busy Main Street, where the couple went to take pre-wedding photos. Later that day they stood before a friend, Rob Heppler, who had became a minister of the American Marriage Ministries to oversee the nondenominational ceremony. Mr. Weisman began to recite his vows but could get through only a few words before tears began streaming down his cheeks. “I’m not nervous,” he said, wiping his brow and his watery eyes. “I just love her so much.” He tried once more, and this time he managed just five words, “Lizzie, before I met you …” before bursting into tears again. “You know, there was a bet about how quickly I would cry,” Mr. Weisman said, to the great amusement of the 100 or so guests seated in the dimly lit upstairs restaurant, some dressed in rhinestones, cowboy boots, jeans and leather, others in fur and fringe. The groom eventually pulled it together and addressed his bride directly. “I used to be scared,” he said. “Scared of failing. Scared of starting a family. Scared of not making enough money. Scared of everything. I’m not scared anymore, Lizzie. The only thing I fear is not spending every day for the rest of our lives together.” Then it was her turn. “The face that greeted me that night on a curb in Beverly Hills has since become my best friend, mentor, playmate, confidant and my greatest challenge,” the new Mrs. Weisman said. Several guests cheered, others cried, all of them knowing that somewhere between the madhouse that was Los Angeles and the tranquillity that is Nashville, the bride and groom had come to each other’s rescue. \nJennifer Dobner contributed reporting from Park City, Utah. \nON THIS DATEWhen Jan. 14, 2017. Where Riverhorse on Main, Park City, Utah. Not by Design The bride wore an ivory lace strapless gown with a short train from a designer she couldn’t name. The groom wore a custom blue sport coat, a chambray Carhartt shirt, RRL jeans, an oversize Margiela belt buckle and custom suede Lucchese Chelsea boots. Stretching the Streak The couple began their wedding day with an early morning yoga session at Tadasana in Park City to continue their streak of over 450 consecutive days of yoga. “Since Aug. 1, 2015, we have done more hours of yoga than there have been days on the calendar,” the bride said. Stayin’ Alive The bride walked down the aisle to a recording of P. M. Dawn’s “I’d Die Without You.” Dancing the Night Away The couple’s first dance was to a recording of “Penthouse Suites,” by Wise Blood, and later in the evening they danced to a live performance of “Computer Love” by the band Zapp. The D.J. Brisk One played a mix of hip-hop, old school and ’90s jams in between the band’s sets. Cake Alternatives There was no wedding cake. Instead, guests were treated to homemade chocolate chip cookies (with gluten-free options) and an adult hot chocolate bar with late night snacks of grilled cheese and tomato soup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:14:28.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
