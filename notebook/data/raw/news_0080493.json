Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, has scheduled the executions over a 10-day period in April. (Danny Johnston/AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Monday, February 27, 2017, 5:21 PM \nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas' governor on Monday set execution dates for eight inmates over a 10-day period in an attempt to resume the death penalty after a nearly 12-year hiatus, even though the state lacks one of three drugs needed to put the men to death. \nRepublican Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed proclamations scheduling double-executions on four days in April for the eight inmates. The quick schedule appears aimed at putting the inmates to death before another one of the state's lethal injection drugs expire, and if carried out would mark the first time in nearly two decades a state has executed that many inmates in a month. \nThe move comes just days after the state's attorney general told the governor the inmates had exhausted their appeals and there were no more legal obstacles to their executions. \n\"This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the law, but it is also important to bring closure to the victims' families who have lived with the court appeals and uncertainty for a very long time,\" Hutchinson said in a statement. \nSupreme Court orders new hearing for black Texas death row inmate \nThe U.S. Supreme Court last week rejected the inmates' request to review a state court ruling that upheld Arkansas' lethal injection law. The state Supreme Court on Friday lifted the stay on its ruling, clearing the way for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge to request the dates be set. \nArkansas hasn't executed an inmate since 2005 due to legal challenges and difficulties obtaining execution drugs. \nThe state's supply of potassium chloride — one of three drugs used in lethal injections — expired in January. A prison system spokesman said Monday that the drug hasn't been replaced, but Hutchinson's office said officials were confident they could obtain more. It has been nearly 12 years since Arkansas has used the death penalty. (RIC FELD/AP) \nAnd the state's supply of midazolam lists an April 2017 expiration date, which pharmacy experts say is commonly accepted to mean the end of the month. \nMississippi considers firing squad as execution method \nThe state's supply of vecuronium bromide expires on March 1, 2018. \nAn attorney for the inmates did not have an immediate comment on the governor's announcement. The inmates late Friday filed an amended complaint in state court aimed at blocking the executions. \nSince the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, only Texas has put eight people to death in a month — doing it twice in 1997. Arkansas has had multiple executions in the past, including triple executions in 1994 and 1997. At the time, the state Correction Department said multiple executions reduced stress on prison staff. \nBut the 2014 botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett was the first of a scheduled double execution. Lockett's execution was halted by the state's prison director after Lockett writhed and groaned on the gurney. He died 43 minutes after the drugs began to flow. \nAn Oklahoma review team later recommended that at least seven days pass between each execution. The report said a veteran paramedic who placed Lockett's intravenous line had noted a sense of urgency in the air.
