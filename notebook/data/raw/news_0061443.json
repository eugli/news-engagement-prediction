The sultan’s displeasure should immediately have brought Selangor Umno chief Noh Omar’s defence of Jamal’s hearse demonstration into the spotlight. \nA good example is when he and his men were involved in what the police described as a ‘gang robbery’ . If convicted, he could be jailed up to 20 years under Section 395 of the Penal Code. \nAlthough news of his detention attracted 89 comments from readers, the excitement was only short-lived. A month after his detention, we have not heard any update on whether he would be prosecuted, or the case would be dropped. \nThis is not the first case where people were hoping that the long arm of the law would finally catch up with him. I personally believe it will eventually put him behind bars. No one can escape, for whatever a man sows that shall he also reap. \nA very bad example \nThe hearse and the ‘gang robbery’ are not the only incidents involving him that caused many of us to be ‘angered’ by Jamal. \nIn another incident, he and his men were busy heckling Ampang MP Zuraidah Kamaruddin and her supporters, despite them not retaliating. \nPut in other words, Jamal sets a very bad example to the younger generation of Malays. When restrained by the police, he initially blamed the police for hitting him. \nIt was obvious who were restraining him, and if he had received a blow on his face, it could not have come from Zuraida or her men as they were not involved in the scuffle at the shopping mall. \nThe next thing Jamal said to the press was that the punch had come from the very people whom he had been heckling for the past few hours. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
