This includes where and when training is taking place, players' home addresses and any other places where they regularly stay overnight. Manchester City have been charged over an alleged breach of Regulation 14(d), which states: 'It shall be a breach of this Regulation if the information is either initially inaccurate or has not been updated by the Club as necessary to ensure it remains accurate.' Penalties range from a warning to a fine, suspension or points deduction. Sportsmail understands that Bournemouth's three strikes involved three different players. In one instance a player had moved house and his new details had not been logged by Bournemouth on the system operated and policed by UK Anti-Doping. On the other two occasions, it is believed two different youth-team players were absent from the club's Canford base, where the non first-team sides train, because they had been called by Eddie Howe to the main training ground adjacent to the Vitality Stadium, with a view to training with the first team. An FA statement on Friday read: 'AFC Bournemouth have been charged in relation to The FA's Rules on Anti-Doping. 'It is alleged the club failed to ensure that their 'Club Whereabouts' information was accurate, contrary to Regulation 14(d). 'Bournemouth have until February 23, 2017 to respond to the charge.' Sportsmail understands that Bournemouth face a fine for the breach. Eddie Howe's side have until February 23 to respond to the charge Gary Neville lashed out at lenient penalties for doping breaches on Friday, claiming that clubs are getting off lightly, whereas Rio Ferdinand was hit with an eight-month ban in 2003 for three missed tests. Ferdinand missed Euro 2004 as a consequence of his ban and England players considered going on strike in opposition to the suspension. Neville tweeted: 'Clubs breach anti-doping and nothing! Player gets 8 months and misses a European championships! Should have followed through with the strike.'
