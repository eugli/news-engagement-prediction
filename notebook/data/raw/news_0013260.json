He explained that unlike popular belief, sepsis can develop 'extremely quickly', as in her case. When asked if Jayalalithaa was conscious when she signed the Election Commission's papers of her party nominee for November 19 bypoll to Thirupparankundram, the doctors said she was very much awake.\"She was conscious when she signed the Election Commission papers, she read the papers. Since she was very weak, she could not sign the paper and made the thumb impression instead,\" Apollo doctors said.\"She came into hospital with sepsis - she was certainly conscious and responding before her condition worsened,\" Dr Beale clarified.On September 30, Dr Beale was flown to India, eight days after Jayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo Hospital. His area of expertise includes acute lung injury, sepsis and multi-organ failure. Dr Beale had left two days later but continued to be in touch with the medical team attending to Jayalalithaa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:56:42.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
