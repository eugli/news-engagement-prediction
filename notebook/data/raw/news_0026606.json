They used the tools to cut holes in their cells at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora and hack through underground pipes before crawling out through a manhole. Joyce Mitchell is escorted out of court after pleading guilty in Plattsburgh, New York, in July 2015. Christinne Muschi / Reuters \nMatt was shot and killed by a tactical team of law enforcement officers, while Sweat was shot and captured. Mitchell pleaded guilty to a contraband charge. \nClinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie hailed the board's decision. \n\"If not for her selfishness and direct contribution to David Sweat and Richard Matt, they would have not escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility,\" he said. \n\"Her direct conduct put immense pressure on every citizen of this community, as well as our local, state and federal resources,\" Wylie said. \"Her careless actions endangered law enforcement officers and potentially every person in the State of New York and surrounding areas. Joyce Mitchell must be held accountable and be required to serve the maximum sentence imposed on her.\" \nMitchell's attorney did not return a call for comment.
