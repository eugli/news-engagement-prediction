New York Yemenis stunned by Trump's ban: 'I feel like somebody has killed me' Read more \n“We have a strong community here in downtown Brooklyn so we have to close and just show the people that we can change anything,” said Abdul Kareem, who owns the Cobble Hill Deli in Brooklyn. Kareem has owned the store for 12 years and has been living and working in the US for more than 24 years. \n“This shutdown of grocery stores and bodegas will be a public show of the vital role these grocers and their families play in New York’s economic and social fabric and, during this period, grocery store owners will spend time with their families and loved ones to support each other; many of these families have been directly affected by the Ban,” the strike organizers said in a statement. \nKareem’s wife and four children are just a few of the hundreds of Yemeni nationals and US visa holders who were stranded in the small African nation of Djibouti due to Trump’s controversial executive order. \n“They should have had a visa last week and now they are denied,” Kareem said. “So now we have to wait at least 90 days, then we will see what’s what.” People participate in a Yemeni protest against President Donald Trump’s travel ban at Borough Hall in Brooklyn on Thursday.

For years, refugees have been escaping across the Gulf of Aden to Djibouti. Kareem said he began the process of trying to get his family to join him via the US embassy in Djibouti three years ago, and hasn’t seen his family in almost as long. \n“I used to go every year, but when the war started …” Kareem trailed off. \nThousands of Yemeni immigrants own, operate or work in one of the ubiquitous corner stores, known as bodegas, that dot New York’s five boroughs. \nKareem said the potential lost revenue from closing down in the middle of the day was worth it, and expects a powerful sense of solidarity at a rally scheduled to take place at Brooklyn’s Borough Hall at 5.15pm on Thursday. Yemeni Americans were already gathering there by mid-afternoon. Thanks to social media, support for the protest rapidly spread beyond New York , as the hashtag #Bodegastrike began trending.
