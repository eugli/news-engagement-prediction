She was alone in the house. Story continues below \nSgt. Shawn French said the incident is considered suspicious and the RCMP Major Crimes unit out of Edmonton has taken over the investigation. Her cause of death is not known. \nA friend who had known Clifford for a few years said she was always upbeat and happy and her enthusiasm was contagious. The friend said she was “in disbelief about her death and hope answers are found about what happened.” \nPolice want to talk to anyone who may have been out walking or driving in that area between Thursday evening (Feb. 23) and Friday morning (Feb. 24). \nRCMP are looking to speak to residents who may have noticed any unusual activity in the area of 12 Street and 8 Avenue. Investigators are specifically interested in anyone with exterior video surveillance in their home or vehicle. \nSgt. French did not identify any suspects and said as of Saturday afternoon, no arrests had been made. \nAnyone with information is asked to call Wainwright RCMP at 780-842-4461 or call your local police.
