He must step up & speak out.” \nTrump is yet to comment on the shooting, which took place last Wednesday night, leaving Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla dead and two others injured in an apparent hate crime. \nKuchibhotla was killed and Alok Madasani was injured when Adam W Purinton, a white man who earlier served in the US Navy, shot them at the Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas state, on Wednesday night. \nPurinton reportedly got into an argument with the victims and hurled racial slurs. He yelled \"get out of my country\", \"terrorist\" before shooting them. \nKuchibhotla of Hyderabad and his colleague Madasani from Warangal district in Telangana were working as aviation programme managers at Garmin, an MNC. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that it was too early to call the act a hate crime.
