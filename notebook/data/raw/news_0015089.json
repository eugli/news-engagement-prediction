Story continues below \n“I couldn’t even talk when I got up to the ladder,” Erikka Weisgerber said. “Your body is just in complete and total shock.” \n“Kind of like you’re being hit by a truck, let’s put it that way,” Elizabeth Kaculin said. \nA record 100 plus plungers participated. Organizers estimate more than $21,000 was raised for Special Olympics Alberta, another record for Lethbridge. \n“To put that in perspective, Edmonton raised $60,000, we’re 10% the population and we did one third what they did,”Cst. Mathieu Champagne, lead event organizer, said. \n“All the money raised stays within the province, a lot of it stays down here in Lethbridge as well, so it benefits our athletes locally,” Cst. Braylon Hyggen said. \nThe Polar Plunge is a fundraiser presented by the Law Enforcement Torch Run to support Special Olympics Alberta. There are 3,000 athletes with an intellectual disability who take part in daily sport programs in the province. \nThere are four Polar Plunge events in Alberta this year. The next one is February 25th in Calgary. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
