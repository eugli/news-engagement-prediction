Trump has said he will soon issue a new executive order that addresses concerns raised by the appeals court judges.\nThe president's Jan. 27 order caused chaos at airports around the world as visa holders heading to the United States were pulled off planes or turned around upon arrival at U.S. airports.\nTrump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. His original order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely.\nAmericans were deeply divided over the measure, which was condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies and challenged in court by the state of Washington.\nThe 9th Circuit had directed the Justice Department to file a legal brief defending the travel ban later this week. Given Trump's intention to issue a new order, however, the Justice Department asked last week for the appeal to be placed on hold.\nIn a response, the state of Washington said the Trump administration has said both that it would pursue an appeal, and that it would issue a new order.\n\"Throughout these proceedings, there appears to have been a lack of communication between the Department of Justice and the White House,\" the Washington attorney general's office said in a court filing arguing that the 9th Circuit move forward now.\nRepresentatives for the Justice Department declined to comment.\nAfter stating that a new travel ban would be issued last week, a White House official said on Wednesday that a new order would come sometime this week.\n(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Frances Kerry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:07:45.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
