Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nLess than five minutes later, the Saints found themselves behind after Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s brilliant free-kick and Puel’s side eventually lost the clash 3-2 thanks to the Swede’s late winner. \nThe Saints were the better side on the day and were left ruing Gabbiadini’s disallowed goal afterwards. \nHowever, Le Tissier believes the goal would have stood if Jose Mourinho’s side had scored it and says referees don’t make these type of ‘mistakes’ against the ‘big clubs’. Gabbiadini was onside but his goal was disallowed (Picture: Sky Sports) \n‘(If United had scored) it wouldn’t have been given offside, I genuinely think that. The flag wouldn’t have gone up in the first place,’ Le Tissier told talkSPORT. \n‘Big teams get so many more decision you must see that, surely? Do you think that officials are just not very good and that was a genuine mistake? \n‘There are certain decisions where the margins are so close, you can understand why mistakes are made. \n‘I still can’t understand how he can give Gabbiadini offside when the ball was played by Cedric (Soares), he couldn’t even see Gabbiadini because the defender was in the way. \n‘Surely that gives him a clue that, actually, Gabbiadini wasn’t offside.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:53:30.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
