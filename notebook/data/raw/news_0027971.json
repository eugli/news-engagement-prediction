A portion-controlled trail mix with lots of nuts and seeds is a good snack option. Source: Getty Images \nTHE BEST \nA nutritionally balanced snack food will offer a mix of unrefined carbohydrate and protein, to keep us full for at least a couple of hours. For the average adult, a snack should be between 150-200 calories, with ingredients you know and recognise. Most importantly, you want it to taste good! \nCheese and crackers \nLet’s be honest, who doesn’t love a cheese and cracker!? \nThe simple combo of a portion controlled serve of calcium-rich cheese along with a few crackers, offers a great mix of carbs and protein. \nBest brand: Mainland Light Cheese and Crackers \nNut Bars \nYes, you can reach for a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit, but the great thing about a nut-based snack bar is that it is portion controlled. It can be made from a variety of different nuts and contain up to 10g of protein per serve. \nBest brands: Go Natural Nut Delight, Carman’s Nut Bars, Uncle Toby’s Nut Bars \nRoasted Broadbeans \nForget potato chips. These simple, flavoured broadbeans are a great source of fibre and protein and taste so good, you will not even realise they are not chips. \nBest brand : Happy Snack Food Company Faava Beans \nFruit and Nut Snacks \nDried fruit is notoriously high in sugars, as are many commercial trail mixes. But if you get the right mix of seeds and nuts in a portion controlled pack, you get the right mix of carbs, proteins and good fats to keep you full for a few hours. \nBest brand: MUNCH Pumpkin Seeds \nProtein Balls \nWhile some low carb and low sugar products can be packed with different types of sugar, fats and less than nutritious additives, there are a few brands with relatively clean ingredient lists, which offer both a good source of carbs and proteins in a tasty, calorie-controlled snack.

With literally no protein or fibre, there is not a lot of positive things to say about plain biscuits. \nWorst brands: Tiny Teddies, Shapes \nRice Crackers \nWith high GI refined rice, oils and flavours including MSG among the primary ingredients, not only is it exceptionally easy to overeat these crunchy morsels, but they offer literally nothing positive nutritionally \nWorst brands: Sakata , Fantastic Snacks \nMuesli Slices \nWhen a snack is described as having a muesli base, it can be easily interpreted as a relatively healthy option. But a number of commercial products are packed full of sugars, oil and refined flour with very little muesli at all. They tend to be packed full of calories with up to 400 calories (or a meal) per serve. \nWorst brand: Mother Earth chocolate and apricot bars \nNoodle snacks \nThis is another snack food that looks relatively simple. But a closer look at the ingredient list can show a mix of flavours, additives, salts and refined starches, which are good for no one, especially small children. \nWorst brand: Mamee Monster Noodle snacks \nSnack bars \nThe range of snack bars available in supermarkets is wide and constantly growing, which makes it difficult to make nutritionally sound choices. In general, plain snack bars are processed, contain a range of added sugars and flavours with very little fibre or protein to help keep you full. They are best left as party food or left out of the shopping trolley completely.
