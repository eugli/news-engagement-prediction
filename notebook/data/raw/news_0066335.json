While the Shiv Sena emerged on the top with 84 seats, the BJP was a close second at 82, and claiming the support of at least four independents, announced it would stake claim to the key post of Mayor. Congress remained at the third spot with 31 seats to its kitty. \nAny party or combine requires 114 corporators for a simple majority in the 227-member BMC house. \n“The BJP core committee will meet and take a decision. We shall respect the verdict of the people,” Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said Thursday evening. He thanked the electorate, saying they have “reposed complete in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies of development for all”. \nWhile Shiv Sena activists started early celebrations as it appeared set to retain control of the BMC, but by late evening, the BJP surpassed all expectations and became an equal contender for the post of mayor. \nBJP Mumbai President Ashish Shelar said the party was in a position to claim the mayor’s post. \nBut Sena President Uddhav Thackeray did not agree and said that “the Mayor will be from Shiv Sena”, which emerged the single largest party. \n(With Agency Inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:15:22.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
