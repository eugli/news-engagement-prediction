In return, hotels employ Mandarin-speaking concierges, show Chinese television channels and accept Chinese bank card payment services.\n“The potential of the middle class travellers is astounding and initiatives like these simply benefit both parties and create more awareness about Dubai as a tourism destination in the Chinese market,” says Siddiqi.”\nThe Dubai Tourism and Commerce Marketing also signed a partnership with Tuniu, an online Chinese travel agency, last year to launch collaborative marketing initiatives. “The scale and potential of that market is just so immense and we are only beginning to tap in,” Siddiqi said. “2017 will see a higher rate of growth. We are hopeful.”\nRabiya Shabeeh is a freelance journalist based in Dubai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:10:38.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
