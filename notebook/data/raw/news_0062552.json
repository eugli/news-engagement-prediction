There’s so much stuff that is edited out,” Manton, 33, ranted.\n“In my case, there needs to be a villain in these shows, and I happen to be it on Married At First Sight.\n“I’ll give you an example — last night’s episode we had homestays and Nadia and myself spent four days in my apartment in Sydney.\n“We went to the races in that time, we had dinner with friends and family during that time, we cooked for each other, we had some great moments — and what do they play? Me blowing up about my Wi-Fi connection.\n“In four days that’s all they play, a 30 second clip. That’s a great example of how heavily edited these shows are.”\nmedia_camera Anthony is ‘married’ to glamorous flight attendant Nadia. Picture: Supplied/Nine\n“Married” to glamorous flight attendant Nadia, the defensive comments come as Confidential hears that Manton has been seen around his Sutherland home looking very close to another woman and her children.\nSpeaking about his motivation to go on the fourth season of Nine’s televised social experiment, he said a lack of opportunity to meet women had spurred him on.\nRelated Susan calls out Anthony for bullying 0:33 Susan called out Anthony for the way he acted and how he bullied Cheryl when she returned on Married at First Sight.

You’re exposing yourself big time to the world, your private life becomes very public.”\n“I took a risk and I’m still hanging in there,” he added.", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/74d354cb3e943806498972dc30b332be?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2Fmedia%2F201702%2F4b2d4a6c-07e5-418b-a25c-c3c76292b265%2FMarriedSUSAN.mp4%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.NhNGt2OTE6cgB6omMRzm7cPMYRHbCsvA?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b41e856495c13e9692c6cc7b1d769a0c?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aea58bfb73ab4018eaedda901c040c4c?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e2508a7aaa5a766352e106e0c021441d?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:26:25.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
