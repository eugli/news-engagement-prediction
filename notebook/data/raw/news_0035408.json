One onlooker said: 'The club was packed and then when Drake came into the DJ booth everyone in the venue pushed towards the front. Crowd pleaser: The rapper took his 20-strong entourage to Paper nightclub where they enjoyed a wild party that went on into the early hours Getting into the spirit of things: The hip-hop star was the centre of attention at the bash Going hard: Drake arrived late and headed straight to the VIP arena and then partied hard in the DJ booth with UK rap artist Giggs and Chip (formerly Chipmunk) 'The whole club was a sea of mobile phones as everyone was trying to post videos to Snapchat. 'It was incredible, usually you can only get to see him perform in huge arena but here he was in a club performing to 250 people, it was fantastic.' The nightclub’s dancers the PaperDolls were on stage performing with Drake, and the rapper looked clearly impressed with their very skimpy Bluebella lingerie outfits which left very little to the imagination. One onlooker said: 'The club was packed and then when Drake came into the DJ booth everyone in the venue pushed towards the front' The club went on until 3.30am and Drake’s table was overflowing with over £30K worth of bottles of Dom Perignon vintage champagne and Belvedere vodka, splashing the cash to thank his team for such a successful tour. Drake hardly drank at the event though as he is due to perform in Sheffield Arena tonight on the next stage of his Drake The Boy Meets World Tour. The onlooker at the club said: 'Drake had just one or two drinks but he had a great time, he was jumping up and down when Giggs was MC-ing and everyone loved his energy and whole place started jumping too.'
