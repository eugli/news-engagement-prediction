\nTwenty-seven University of Notre Dame students were awarded Fulbright grants in the 2016-17 program, placing the University among the top-producing universities in the nation. These 27 students are currently working on their Fulbright projects abroad. Preliminary results for the 51 students who are semifinalists in the 2017-18 competition will be available by May. \nThe Fulbright program is the U.S. government’s flagship international educational exchange program. It awards a one-year postgraduate fellowship for research, study or teaching English abroad. During their fellowship, scholars will work, live and learn in their host country. \nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program Top Producing list appears in the Tuesday (Feb. 21) edition of The Chronicle of Higher Education. Notre Dame was tied with Georgetown University in second place on the doctoral institution list, trailing only Brown University. This is the first time Notre Dame has appeared on the list for three consecutive years, and this is the University’s highest ranking. \n“The unprecedented prominence of the University of Notre Dame on this year’s list of Fulbright U.S. Student Program Top Producing Institutions is a testament to the exceptional students admitted through the Office of Admissions and the Graduate School, the excellent globally oriented education that Notre Dame provides, and the outstanding programs and mentoring offered by units such as Notre Dame International , the Keough School of Global Affairs , Notre Dame Research , the Center for Social Concerns and the many faculty members who engage with international research and education in their work,” Jeffrey Thibert , associate director of Notre Dame’s Flatley Center for Undergraduate Scholarly Engagement , said. “On behalf of the Flatley Center and the Graduate School Office of Grants and Fellowships, I can say that it is a pleasure to work with our Fulbright applicants, and we hope that our applicants’ successes will encourage more students and alumni to consider applying for the Fulbright and other nationally competitive fellowships.” \nNotre Dame’s 2016-17 U.S. Fulbright Students are: Lauren Antosz, Chicago; Spanish, Class of 2016 — study and research grant to Chile.
