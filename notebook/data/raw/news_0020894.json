That nightmare may be about to get a lot more vivid thanks to a leaked photo. \nOn Friday evening, a photo emerged in a report from Business Insider that shows what the publication claims is at least one iteration of the Magic Leap prototype, being worn by an unnamed user. SEE ALSO: Magic Leap patent reveals what may be the next augmented reality system \nAlthough the front-facing portion of the device isn't shown, we are able to see shoulder straps, a head harness, and a backpack filled with electronics. The person in the photo also appears to be holding a controller of some sort. \nIn general, the contraption looks extremely early in its development. However, there's no way of knowing if this purported photo leak isn't just an old photo representing something the company had in existence a couple of years ago, or if it represents the latest phase of development for the device. \nAn image of what Business Insider claims is a Magic Leap prototype photo leak. \nImage: screenshot of business insider website \nIf it turns out that this is an old photograph, this might just be a bit of clever marketing spin by Magic Leap to greatly lower expectations before unveiling a polished product in the coming months. \nThat's the best case scenario. \nThe worst case scenario is that this does represent the latest version of the company's product meant for consumers, in which case there's very little chance we will see a Magic Leap device available to consumers any time in 2017. \nThe company has yet to comment on the leaked photo, and it should be emphasized once again that there is no confirmation that this is, in fact, a device created by Magic Leap — so far, we only have the claims made by Business Insider . When contacted by Business Insider , the company declined to comment, and I've also requested confirmation (or denial) of the photo's authenticity from my Magic Leap contact — as of this writing, I have yet to hear back. \nNevertheless, given the company's strong response to The Information 's report a few months ago , which didn't speak well of the company's augmented reality technology, we may hear something soon.
