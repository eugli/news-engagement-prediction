On one account, the man really, really loved meat. You could tell because the photos were of him awkwardly holding steak in a supermarket and wearing a shirt emblazoned with the word: \"BACON\". On the other account, the man was a vegan. You could tell because he was pictured holding a watermelon and wearing a shirt bearing the word \"VEGAN\".\nHey guess what: turns out heterosexual women don't want to have sex with men who wear bacon vests. PETAfound that twice as many women right-swiped the vegan version of the man than the meat-lovingversion. This got me thinking:'Would men right-swipe a vegan woman over a meat-loving woman? Or nah? Or, just, nah?'\nMel Gibson managed to work out what women want (spoiler: men who treat women likehuman beings), but what do straight men really want? After 25 years on this planet I still do not know. So with the help of our intern, Marianne, I spent a couple of days running diametrically opposedTinder profiles to see which ones got the most right swipes.Our methodology was simple: right-swipe 100 guys, keep track of the matches, then swap the picture and repeat.\nFirst off:\nMEAT LOVER VS VEGAN \n\nWINNER: Meat-eater, with 51 matches\nLOSER: Vegan, with 43 matches\nNo surprise here:a highly unattractive picture in which I am grabbing a wetsymbol of masculinity a 5.50 discounted sirloin steak from Morrisons is whatmenwanted. What I wanted to know is: what exactly iswrong with the vegan picture?I'm holding a cauliflower in a nurturing way that says,\"Yes, I will be the primary caregiver for your babies, and yes, I am essentiallyMother Earth.\"\nAnswer: men just hate vegans.\nWhat they said in the DMs, first off for the vegan one: \n\n\nBeing vegan didn't put everyone off. This considerateoffer came from one guy who simultaneously acknowledged that is but an average middle class white man, while also nodding towards what he could do for me.\nAs for the meat pic: \n\n\n\n\nYeah, they pretty much just allmade weak meat gags.\n\nVAPERVSSMOKER \nWINNER: Vaper, with81 matches\nLOSER: Smoker, with69 matches\nName me anything worse than a humanwho's actively into vaping. Not people who buy the things to help them quit smoking, but: my younger brother, who bought an e-cig despite never smoking before;or people who envelope you in great bubblegum-scented clouds outside train stations; or anyonedescribes their vape as a \"rig\".\nHowever, it would seem Big Vape lobbyists have been successful in changing hearts and minds. The men of Tinder would rather shag someone who vapes than someone fitter because I do look at least 1 percent fitter in the cigarette picture who smokes.\nWhat they said about the vape photo: \n\n\n\n\nThe thought of me toking on a smelly pipe appeared to be a turn-on for some, while cigarettes were just a little toorisqu:\n\n\n\nPOLO NOSE VS SXE \nWINNER: Polo nose, with 62 matches\nLOSER: Straight edge angel, with50 matches\nThis app is tohelpyou find people to introduce to your genitals, not to act as a middle man for evangelical study buddies, so it's no surprise polo nose won. You might be thinking, 'Weirdthe other girl got nearly as many matches.' But asany girl who's spent a considerable amount oftime on Tinder will know:for every man who tells you apropos of nothing that he'll cum on you until you drown, there's asensitive little soul who hasn't had sex since his last LTR ended two years ago, who'shappy with anything he can get. This is exactly why someone who doesn't drink alcohol or have casual sex the two Big Things aboutTinder dates can still get 50 matches.\nWhat they said in the DMs, first for polo nose: \n\n\n\nAs for straight edge princess:\n\n\nKNIFEVSNOKNIFE \n\nWINNER: A woman brandishing a knife, with 76 matches\nLOSER: A woman not holding a knife, with52 matches\nYeah, sorry, I don't understand men. If they want a bit of spice they canjust buy a butt plug from Lovehoney.Instead, they're right-swiping on a woman who could gut them like a hog before they'd started on their opening line. But then they'd like that wouldn't they. The picture on the rightlooks just like my basic bitch Tinder picture in real life, which is probably why I haven't had sex in *looks at watch and whistles*.\nWorst part about this round is that we got banned because so many big cry-babies reported the knife picture, so who knows how many more sexual mavericks out there would have matched with me had they been given the opportunity.\nWhat they said in the DMs: \n\n\n\nCan't argue with that:\n\n\nPUPPIESVSTURKEYS \nWINNER: Turkeys, with58 matches\nLOSER: Puppies, with56 matches\nAnyone right-swiping on that turkey is no oneI want to come into contact withever. Maybe it's because the turkey looks a bit like an inflamed scrotum? And allthese guys were submissives liked the fact I was laughing at something that looked like a scrotum? I don't know! I'm not a psychology expert! Or a scrotum expert!\nWhat they said in the DMs: \n\n\n\nUltimately, thisexperiment proved what I already knew:that men do not want to have sex with vegans.\nBut let's summarise everything else we learned: thatmen seem to love stuff that reminds them of their dicks;thatthey like a bit of danger and potentially some blood loss; and that nothing will put the most determined off a potentialshag, even a photo of theirsex partner vaping.\n@hannahrosewens \nMore on VICE: \nThe UK's Most Right-Swiped Universities \nThe VICE Guide to Tinder For Men, Written By Women \nNormcore vs Health Goth vs Cutester: I Tried Each One For a Week", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:39:56.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
