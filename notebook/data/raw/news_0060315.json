Although the provincial capital seems close to Bangkok, its western boundary extends all the way to the border with Myanmar. Despite the fact that I have been to Kanchanaburi so many times over the past 26 years as a journalist and have seen more of the province than many of its natives, I would not say I know Kanchanaburi inside out. \nNot only does this expansive province boast many places that I have never had the chance to visit, it also holds hidden gems I had never even heard of. One such long-kept secret is in Thong Pha Phum district, the amazing tunnels of tambon Sahakon Nikhom. \nActually, I had been to this tambon three times before because it's the gateway to Pha Sawan, a series of beautiful limestone waterfalls which could be reached via a rough dirt track that begins 6.5km from the tambon municipal office. But the cascades (shown in a photo taken years ago) were not in the itinerary on my latest visit to Sahakon Nikhom. My destination was the decades-old tunnels which cut through limestone hills further up the tambon's main road. The longest one measures 2.3km; that's a full kilometre longer than the legendary Khun Tan train tunnel in Lampang! \nAccording to the municipality's deputy mayor Chalumpon Suntithumsut or Rong Mee (Deputy Mee), the tunnels, each of which are wide and tall enough for a pickup to easily run through, were part of a deserted mine, which the municipality and the villagers have joined hands to develop as a tourist attraction. \n\"The main tunnel, the first one, is very long and there's no lighting whatsoever. Along the dark passage there are several junctions. The numerous side tunnels, at least one of which climbs to higher level, have not yet been surveyed,\" said Rong Mee, who also acts as one of the contact persons for the local tourism group. \n\"So for safety reasons, the gate to the old mine is always locked. Visitors need to inform us first so we can accompany them and make sure both the tourists and the place are safe.\" \nAt the moment, except for the pickup of the tourism group members, all vehicles are prohibited from entering the mine site. But after a pickup ride through the length of the main tunnel, Rong Mee allowed me and my bike buddies to ride through the other two, with the truck following behind. In the longer of the two, like in the main tunnel, when the truck's lights were turned off at our request, it's all pitch black -- we couldn't even see our hands. Imagine getting lost in the main tunnel in such darkness. Interestingly, along the way, we didn't spot any creepy crawlies. The air underground was cool and not damp. \nAs previously mentioned, the tunnels, which require permission to visit, are not the only attraction Sahakon Nikhom has to offer. Visitors to the tambon can also enjoy the scenery at Noen Sawan lookout point which is close to the old mine, or climb a rocky hill called Thong Pha Phum's Everest. They can also learn about the relationship between nature and the local ways of life in the community forest. \nThe deputy mayor revealed that the municipality and the local people are in the process of designing sustainable tour programmes which include the tunnels and other attractions in the area. As mountain bikers, we suggested to Rong Mee that the tourism group arranges a pickup that can take riders and their rigs up the mountain to the mine site and through the long tunnel. Only after that the bike ride can begin with a local rider leading the way to the minor tunnels and other sites of interest. Rong Mee added that at the end of the day cyclists can try camping in the community forest. And that sounds like a good idea. \nLet's hope that the people of Sahakon Nikhom come up with some good news for bicycle lovers soon. \nWell, see you here again next Thursday.
