The butterfly world, in some ways, is actually more complicated than ours,\" said Dr Natasha de Vere, head of science at the National Botanic Garden of Wales. \n\"It's really important. If they're finding a mate, if they're finding their food plants, they've got to be able to see those and they have got to be able to see those with the light levels that they would normally be used to.\" Media caption Scientists explain a study of how butterflies see \nThe garden, near Llanarthney, Carmarthenshire, opened its butterfly house in June last year . \nAt any one time, it has about 300 butterflies of 20 different species. \nDr de Vere said the research could help them improve conditions for the insects during winter, when there is less light than in their natural habitats. \nDepending on the results, the garden could, for instance, install specially-designed lights to mimic the conditions best suited to the insects. \n\"They should definitely be happier, because first of all it should be easier to find a mate and the same for food plants,\" she added. BBC iWonder - Why do we see colours differently ? \nShe said it could also help to shed light on how different conditions affect butterflies in the wild, assisting with regeneration work after a forest has been cleared and when it comes to releasing captive butterflies into the wild. \nZoologist Dr Roger Santer, of Aberystwyth University, said there is still a lot to be learned about how butterfly species perceive colour. \nHuman colour perceptions are based on three kinds of cone photoreceptor cells in the eye which respond to light - blue, green and red, he explained. \nThis means colours for humans are made up of different amounts of blue, green and red, which is why TV and computer screens use them to represent different shades for our eyes.
