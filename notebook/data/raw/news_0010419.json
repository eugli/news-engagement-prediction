The Langdale Estate has moved upmarket with the opening of its 16-suite Brimstone Hotel, which has a new spa which is unequalled in the Lakes Fiona Duncan , Hotel expert 6 February 2017 • 12:09pm \nI t happens every time I review a Lake District hotel. I set off from Euston and in a nanosecond (OK, two hours 50 minutes to Oxenholme) I’m met at the station by a warm and chatty hotel employee, who transports me (all part of the service) thither. \nThe hotel is often in a breathtakingly beautiful location and I wonder yet again why on earth southerners don’t come here more often for a weekend break, letting the train take the strain. It’s far longer to Cornwall but still most Londoners head south-west. The weather may be milder, it’s true, but little can beat the Lake District scenery. \n• Read the full review: Brimstone at Langdale There’s brilliant lighting in the luxurious bedrooms, and log fires \nB onkers. Guess what, they even have spas in Cumbria and the one here at Brimstone is as good as – better, in terms of integrity and authenticity – most down south. There are specially devised treatments using local products, including one involving birch twigs – ouch. \nThere’s a café, six “thermal experiences”, an indoor/outdoor pool and an outdoor fireplace on the terrace. Surrounded by soaring hill, the new spa, unequalled in the Lakes , is perfect for a spot of post-Fell pampering. \n• The best hotels in the Lake District Chalet-style Lodges pepper the wooded, watery grounds \nB ut back to the station. My driver, Andy, explained the story. “Both Brimstone Hotel and the spa are part of the Langdale Estate,” he told me. “It was a gunpowder factory until the Twenties, but by the Eighties it had become a timeshare estate.” \nTimeshare. He might as well have said “plague”, so vilified did that once wildly popular concept become. The estate still has plenty of timeshare occupants in its Lodges, but it has since moved upmarket with the opening of its 16-suite Brimstone Hotel three years ago, a large contemporary restaurant, Stove, in early 2016, and now the intimate, luxurious spa, all within a few minutes' walk of one another. \nAs for the chalet-style Lodges, they pepper the wooded, watery grounds, and there’s another hotel too, four-star Langdale . No getting away from the holiday park vibe as you navigate the estate but, if that’s your bag, it strikes me as a good one, with something for everyone. \n• Read the review: The Langdale Hotel Rooms are undoubtedly glamorous \nI t feels authentic too. There’s an honest commitment to sustainability and the local community here, including two biomass boilers, a picturesque waterwheel that makes electricity and an indoor pool in the leisure centre that’s given over to the local school every Thursday. \n“It’s sacrosanct,” says Andy, “if the Queen wanted a swim, she wouldn’t get one on a Thursday.” At Brimstone Hotel , constructed in local slate and recycled wood to resemble a ski lodge, friendly “hosts” dressed in stylish country casual uniforms look after guests in an admirable atmosphere of privacy and informality, with thoughtful touches such as complimentary pantry in the Reading Room and equipment for walkers: boots, coats, waterproofs. \nThere’s brilliant lighting in the luxurious bedrooms, and log fires, though the rooms are too “designed” and the whole place, though undoubtedly glamorous, a bit standardised for my taste. \n• The UK's best hotels for spa breaks The hotel is constructed in local slate and recycled wood to resemble a ski lodge \nF amilies go to the Lodges and the workaday leisure centre; couples to Brimstone and spa. In the restaurant, all ages inhabit the brasserie part, while couples cosy up in the quieter dining area. Somehow it all works; there’s a cooperative spirit, and a warmth that you just don’t get down south. \nLangdale Estate, Chapel Stile, Cumbria LA22 9JD (015394 38062; brimstonehotel.co.uk ).
