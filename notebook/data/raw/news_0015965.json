Sun Peaks, BC, Canada Best for: Attractive village, quiet ski area \nSun Peaks has come a long way since it was developed in the Nineties. It has a friendly, attractive small village with a traffic-free main street and a fair amount of varied terrain, which makes it appealing for family holidays. \nUntil 20 years ago Sun Peaks was simply Tod Mountain, a local hill for the residents of nearby Kamloops. Since then, a purpose-built village with ski-in/ski-out accommodation has changed things considerably. In addition, the ski area has been expanded extensively. Low-rise, pastel-coloured buildings have a vaguely Tirolean feel about them, and the family-friendly village is a pleasant place to stroll around. The main street is lined with lodgings, restaurants and shops, including a smart art gallery, a chocolate shop and a few coffee bars. \nThe Sundance Kids Centre takes non-skiing children from 18 months to five years, while the Sun Tots and sun Kids programmes provide lessons and comprehensive childcare for three to 12 year olds. \nWith almost 4,300 acres of terrain over three linked mountains, Sun Peaks is the second biggest ski area in British Columbia after Whistler – but it’s not big by Alpine standards, and you're never far from the village itself. Weekdays are usually very quiet and queues quite rare. The traffic-free resort of Sun Peaks has a quiet ski area that's great for children Credit: Adam Stein \nThere are nursery slopes right in the village centre, and two of the three mountains (Mount Tod and Sundance) can be reached by high-speed quad chairs from the centre. \nThe Sundance area is mainly blue and green cruising runs, but there are a few short blacks too. Both Sundance and Tod have great gladed tree areas to play in. These are marked on the trail map, and some are easy enough to be tackled by intermediates looking for an extra challenge. \nThe third mountain, Mount Morrisey, is reached by a long green run from the top of Sundance. It has a delightful network of easy blue runs with trees left uncut in the trails, effectively making them groomed glade runs that even intermediates can try.
