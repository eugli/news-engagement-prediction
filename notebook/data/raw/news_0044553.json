It’s not just about him, but he represents what’s happening in the world at the moment,” protester Alison Dale, 61, told Reuters. \n“The invitation was kneejerk, and made us look desperate. Now we’re leaving the European Union, it’s clear we’re just desperate for trade deals, and we look weak.” \nSince taking office in January, Trump has sparked global protests over plans to ban migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, and from women activists who call him misogynistic. \nTrump says his immigration orders are aimed at protecting the United States and that his opponents have misrepresented his intentions. \nPrime Minister May has said she will not consider canceling the visit. Managing the backlash adds to her diplomatic “to-do” list as she sets about reuniting a country divided over Brexit and negotiating a divorce with European trading partners.

Previously Trump has clashed with Salmond over his investments in Scotland. \nCritics focused on accusations of sexism and referred to his immigration policies, while other lawmakers argued Trump should come to Britain, but should not be given the high honor of a state visit, which would involve lavish displays of royal pageantry and a banquet hosted by the queen. \nCrispin Blunt, head of parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said a head-of-government visit by Trump would be appropriate this year but a full state visit should wait until 2020, the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim Fathers’ settlement in New England. \n“If we don’t take the hype out of this debate, with all the people who signed this petition, there is every possibility that of course this visit is then going to become a rallying point for everybody who is unhappy both with the direction of American policy, or British policy or anything else,” he said.
