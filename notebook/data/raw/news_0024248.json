Some nights I could manage a few notes, sometimes nothing came out at all when I opened my mouth. And it was in front of an audience, you know, and the band.\" \nCollins developed a form of dysphonia, a condition often associated with psychological trauma. \nIn the years that followed, she wrote books while working in charity shops and a job centre to support herself. But her music was discovered by a younger generation of fans - including Blur's Graham Coxon and the Decemberists' Colin Meloy. \nEventually, she was coaxed back onto the stage - and released her new album to wide acclaim last year. Going Gaga? \nCollins is nominated for singer of the year alongside Ireland's Daoiri Farrell, Scottish musician Kris Drever, and five-time Folk Award winner Jim Causley. \nFarrell has the most nominations, three in all, while Songs of Separation - a project inspired by the Scottish referendum, featuring Eliza Carthy, Karine Polwart and Jenny Hill - has two. Image caption Woody Guthrie is one of the most influential figures in folk and popular music \nUS folk icon Woody Guthrie will be inducted to the Folk Awards Hall of Fame on the 50th anniversary of his death. \nThe author of classics such as Do Re Mi, Pretty Boy Floyd and This Train Is Bound For Glory, his songs were a major influence on popular music, and have been covered by the likes of Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. \nJust this week, Lady Gaga sang a portion of his civil rights anthem This Land Is Your Land in a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump at the Super Bowl. \nBilly Bragg, who made a Grammy award-winning album with Wilco based on unused Woody Guthrie lyrics, will pay tribute to the star with a headline performance at the awards. \nScottish singer-songwriter Al Stewart, best known for the hit single Year Of The Cat, will also perform, after being honoured with the lifetime achievement award. \nMark Radcliffe and Julie Fowlis will present the awards at London's Royal Albert Hall on Wednesday, 5 April. The ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 2. \nRadio 2 Folk Awards 2017: Full list of nominations FOLK SINGER OF THE YEAR Daoiri Farrell", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:06:21.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
