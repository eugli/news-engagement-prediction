Fayemi and Fayose \n“In the next few weeks payment shall be made. But before that we will have to verify the work done by each contractor. Those who have completed the jobs 100 percent would be given priority. Those who still have little things to do on site should go and tidy up. \n”The last government owed th e money and ran away, but Mr Governor has sourced for money to pay you. Remember that the action of the last administration caused the suspension of the state by the Universal Basic Education Commission from its activities for some years now.” \n“You have waited enough and it is not going to be fair to keep you waiting and suffering. The governor is taking the step to alleviate your suffering without any political consideration,” the governor’s representative said. \nAkinola said in the first instance about N250 million would be paid out to the contractors, while the verification of other projects would be done too. \nAlso speaking, the Executive Chairman, Ekiti SUBEB, Senator Bode Ola, lauded the governor’s initiative. \nThe Chairman, SUBEB Contractors, Mr Bankole Adeleye, said the decision of Governor Fayose to pay the debts was commendable. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:14:30.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
