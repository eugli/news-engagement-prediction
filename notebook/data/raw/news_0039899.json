But EDDC charges them as much as N38,000 per shop. \nThey accused EEDC officials in Aba of being reluctant to the issuance of prepaid meters which they said would curb excessive billing. \nIn an interview with journalists, Comrade Onyebuenyi Chimaobi and Mr. Ibe Ihesinulo said “We are protesting of the crazy electricity bills that the EEDC people are giving to us. It has been like that in the past, but the February bill is very outrageous. Some of us are billed N106, 000 for three bedroom flat, some over N200, 000. The cheapest one is N38, 000 for three rooms. The high rate of bill is unacceptable to us. That is why we are calling on Abia State and Federal Government to see that we are given prepaid meter. \n“The cost of paying for electricity bill is now higher than the cost of rent. We have paid for meters several years ago but as we speak, the meters are yet to be supplied to us. With prepaid meter, this issue of overbilling will be reduced.” \nPolice Area Commander in charge of Aba, ACP Peter Wagbara commended the residents for their peaceful protest and urged them to remain law abiding. \nNo official of the EEDC could be reached for comments when journalists made efforts to speak with them over the allegations made by the Umuode community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:30:56.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
