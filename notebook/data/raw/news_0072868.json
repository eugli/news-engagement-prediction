Well, kind of. The brand will return, but it will be run by a new company, HMD Global, where a few key former Nokia executives reside. The manufacturing of the phone will now happen in China, but some of the ingenious design that went into the Nokias of the past will likely come to these new phones, so we're excited. First stop for Nokia's international return is Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. We expect to see the new Nokia 3310 unveiled. Yes, this is that good old 'indestructible' feature phone that we know from the past and it will likely not be a smartphone, but just a tough reincarnation of the legend. Some also say that Nokia might reveal a flagship-grade Android smartphone. Wait and see, wait and see. The Nokia MWC 2017 phone announcement event will be livestreamed and you can tune in right here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:25:55.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
