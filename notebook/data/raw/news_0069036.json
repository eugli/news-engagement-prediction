Yet our one species is having such a heavy footprint on the other millions of species that don't have voices,\" said Beaty.\nHe and his wife, Trisha, have a son and four daughters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:29:48.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
