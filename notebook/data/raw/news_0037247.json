This sign was posted on the door of Colonial Cafe in Naperville to announce it would be closed Thursday in support of \"A Day without Immigrants,\" a protest in opposition to the immigration policies being pursued by President Donald Trump. (Erin Hegarty / Naperville Sun) Erin Hegarty Naperville Sun \nAt least two Naperville businesses were closed Thursday in support of the \"Day Without Immigrants\" boycott and protests, which were held nationwide to show the impact immigrants have on the nation's economy. \nNaperville's Jalapeno Grille at 1316 N. Route 59 announced its plan to be closed on social media. \n\"We are an immigrant owned business and stand in solidarity with our family, friends, employees, and immigrants across the country,\" a post on the restaurant's website read. \nThe Colonial Cafe at 8 W. Gartner Road hung a sign on its door expressing a similar sentiment. \n\"The Colonial Cafe will be closed today, Feb. 16, in support of of families, friends and team members,\" the hand-printed note read. \"Thank you for understanding and for your continued support of Colonial Cafe.\" \nMaria Calderon, who owns the Jalapeno Grille restaurants in Naperville and Geneva with her husband, Anastacio, said supporting immigrants by closing both businesses was important to the couple. \n\"We believe everyone should have access to the American dream,\" said Calderon, who is also a registered nurse. \"People come from all over for a better life, either for economic or safety reasons.\" \nCalderon was born in Chicago after her parents immigrated to the United States from Coahuila, Mexico, for work and to have a better life, she said. They became citizens in the 1970s. Anastacio also immigrated to the U.S. from Guanajuato, Mexico, and became a citizen a few years ago, Calderon said. \nThe business owners were initially nervous about closing for the day and posting the announcement on Facebook, Calderon said. \n\"We are a small family business and love to serve the people of our communities,\" Calderon said. \"We did indeed receive some negative comments but we received even more support. Everyone has the right to their opinion, negative or positive. It is one of our freedoms and is one of the things that make this county great.\" \nThe national day of action comes in response to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, attempted ban and promised actions. \nMany restaurants across the country and in the Chicago area closed, including the four owned by famed restaurateur Rick Bayless . A lunchtime rally in Chicago drew thousands as people heeded the call to show the impact immigrants have on the country by skipping work, closing businesses, not spending money and keeping their children out of school. \nThe Chicago Tribune contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:03:32.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
