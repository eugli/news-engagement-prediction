Long Story \nOh, Mariah. The 46-year-old O.G. diva who recently split from Australian business mogul James Packer has sent her ex — and the world — a serious reminder of just how sexy she is. That, and she's made us seriously rethink our attire for that couple's workout we had planned this Valentine's Day. \nNever one to do things the traditional way, when it comes to exercise, Mimi does not hit the gym in an oversized T-shirt and leggings. Nope, even designer yoga pants or state of the art workout gear don't make the cut when you're Mariah Carey and you have a net worth of $500 million. \nArriving at celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson ’s Los Angeles gym yesterday, Mariah made quite the statement when she showed up wearing an outfit better suited for the bedroom. Nearly putting Chrissy Teigen's sultry '80s workout to shame, MC crushed her routine in fishnet stockings, lingerie, a blinding diamond necklace (of course), heels (designed by Rihanna who completely freaked out when she saw the photos) and her signature cleavage. Like, a LOT of cleavage.

The singer also posted two videos to Instagram to prove she wasn't just there for the likes. First, she showed off her running because, as we all know, if you can't run in heels, you can't really run. Running amok. @gunnarfitness A video posted by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Feb 2, 2017 at 7:18pm PST \nThen, to top it all off — and this is perhaps the best part — Mariah picked up two 20-pound weights for some fabulous bicep curls like it was no big deal.

Own The Conversation \nHow important is gear to a workout, really? Disrupt Your Feed \nI'd work out with Mariah Carey any day. Seriously, any. day. Drop This Fact \nMariah Carey knows a thing or two about diet and exercise: In 2011, she discovered the key to dropping a whopping 30 pounds in just three months.
