These individuals would serve as herbalists, healers, and spirit communicators. The duties and types of healing arts and spiritual ceremonies performed would naturally vary from tribe to tribe. Tribal Leaders Disapprove of Shamanism Workshops \nToday's tribal leaders often frown on terms such as Shamanism , Shaman, and even Medicine Man being used so freely as a means to lure students to learn Native American practices. Disapproval is warranted when seminars and workshops commercially touted as \" Native Shamanism \" are not purely traditional teachings, but are a packaged blend of studies which include bits of Native American ceremonies along with Wiccan spells, New Age spirituality, and Eastern medicine.
