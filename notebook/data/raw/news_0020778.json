And, the latest episode in the saga has been scripted by SP Shamuganathan, the AIADMK legislator from Sivaikuntam near Tuticorin. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, Shamuganathan attended a party MLAs meet to show support to AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala -- who paraded 130-plus lawmakers in a show of strength to counter a rebellion by caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam. \nBut later in the evening, Shamuganathan had a change of heart and slipped away to Panneerselvam’s camp. \nAccording to sources, Shanmuganathan told those in charge of getting MLAs to board the bus to a luxury resort that he was feeling giddy and wanted to take medicines. A diabetic, this former minister did go out for some time and returned. \nBut when the time to board the bus came, the party managers found he had slipped away again. The MLA later surfaced at the residence of Panneerselvam – known popularly as OPS -- at Greams Road. \nDespite his paltry numbers, the caretaker chief minister is confident that, given a chance, he would pass the floor test. According to sources, the chief minister is planning to meet governor at the airport when Vidyasagar Rao arrives in Chennai in the afternoon. The governor is said to have given an appointment at 5pm to Sasikala.
