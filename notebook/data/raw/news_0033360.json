Read at your own risk! \nSupergirl revealed a shocking truth about Lena Luthor during Monday’s episode — but her true allegiances may still be up in the air. \nWith her adoptive mother Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong) on trial and despised by basically everyone in National City, Lena Luthor (Katie McGrath) had but one ally — Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist) — who had faith that this Luthor wouldn’t follow in the footsteps of her family. \nEven when it looked like Lena was responsible for breaking Lillian out of jail, Kara gave her friend the benefit of the doubt. But everyone else on Team Supergirl was quick to believe that Lena is just another Luthor; it doesn’t help that her brother is the infamous Lex Luthor and her mother tried to rid the world of aliens as the head of Project Cadmus. “But she’s adopted!” you yell. Au contraire, Monday’s episode revealed that was not actually the case, and Lena is the illegitimate child of Lionel Luthor, making her a true Luthor heir. \nAfter Lillian offers Lena a place by her side at Cadmus, Lena is quick to realize that her mom was just using her to open a DNA-encrypted cache of weapons. In the end though, Supergirl rescues Lena from Lillian’s clutches. However, Lena didn’t technically take a side in this fight, unlike last time around when she had her mother arrested, so the question remains: Can Lena really be trusted? \n“That’s Lena’s journey for the series,” executive producer Andrew Kreisberg tells EW. “Are we who others think we are? Are we who we want to be? She’s not adopted, she’s actually truly a Luthor by blood, and is it nature vs. nurture? The audience’s perception of a character named Luthor mirrors the characters’ perception. ‘If your name is Luthor, you must be bad. That name is synonymous with evil.'” \n“Watching every character have their moment with her where they doubt and do they believe, it’s so interesting,” Kreisberg continues. “Even Clark [Tyler Hoechlin], when we had Superman on, didn’t trust her because of that name. It’s the difference between Kara and Clark, in our interpretation of these characters, is that Superman is a little jaded after doing this for so long, and Kara is still wide-eyed and fresh-faced and still believes in the goodness in people. Whether or not Kara and Supergirl’s belief in Lena is going to be enough to overcome the corrupting influence of Lillian is the plot of the series.” \nIn other words, Lena is good — for now — but only time will tell. \nSupergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
