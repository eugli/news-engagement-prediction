While Eater predicted a few of the hot happenings, like the Chez Nous dinner with James Beard Award winner Renee Erickson or the Daniel Boulud Legacy Dinner, there’s still tons happening outside of the sit-down events. Today, the festival announces that there will some Top Chef action happening in the Culinary Village. With the Bravo reality show still running the final episodes of the season filmed in Charleston, viewers are eagerly awaiting the winner.
