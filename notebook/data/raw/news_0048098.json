Shame on You ... — JOHN HONEYFORD (@INTERTELTOP1) February 21, 2017 I was a massive fan of Rory McIlroy but after hearing he played a round of golf with Trump at the weekend, no more. Bad move, Rory! — Trevor D (@_trevordonaghy) February 20, 2017 Rory McIlroy didnt play in the olympics cos he didnt want ppl to hate him , but he plays golf with donald trump .Good one rory #rorymcilroy — jimmy morgan (@jimmymo78647603) February 20, 2017 I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for Rory McIlroy's round of golf. #Trump was probably asking him how to improve his lie. — Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh (@Fachtna_Kelly) February 20, 2017 Just when you thought it was impossible to dislike Rory McIlroy more, off he goes playing golf with Trump. — Cack Jollins (@cackjollins) February 20, 2017 Rory McIlroy has just gone way, way down in my estimation #Trump", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:29:27.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
