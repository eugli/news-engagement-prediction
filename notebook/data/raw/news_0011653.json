This week, Michael's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz was told by police that he is no longer part of their investigation. The former hairdresser, who dated Michael for four years, had been questioned by officers as they tried to piece together the last hours of the star’s life. This week, Michael's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz (left, with the singer was told by police that he is no longer part of their investigation) The former hairdresser (pictured), who dated Michael for four years, had been questioned by officers as they tried to piece together the last hours of the star’s life Fawaz, 40, told them he spent Christmas Eve with the singer, but fell asleep in his car that night, only discovering he was dead when he went to wake him the following morning. But have now said they do not believe there was any foul play surrounding Michael's death and said Fawaz will not face further questioning. Despite this, Fawaz is said to have been frozen out by the star’s grieving family, as well as the ‘inner circle’ of Michael’s closest friends, following the publication of bizarre statements on his Twitter feed claiming Michael wanted to commit suicide. Sources say toxicology tests on the 53-year-old (pictured in 1987) will not be completed until the end of the month In a series of messages ten days after the singer’s death, it said: ‘The only thing George wanted to do is die. He tried to kill himself many times and finally he managed.’ Last month, Michael's childhood friend Andros Georgiou said he believed the 'reclusive' singer died from a cocktail of drugs and alcohol. Mr Georgiou claimed the singer, who died at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, had been trying to 'lead a normal life' but that he accidentally took 'too much of something' shortly before his death. The music producer - who was so close to the Wham! star that they called each other 'cousins' - vowed to 'get to the truth' and find out 'who gave it to him and why'. Speaking to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Georgiou said hard drugs 'had been back in [Michael’s] life' and crack cocaine was his 'favourite'. 'I just think he took too much of something, mixed with antidepressants and other drugs he was on - with alcohol,' he said. 'I think his heart just stopped beating.' He added: 'There’s a lot about this that doesn’t make sense. 'I just want to get to the truth about what happened: what was in his blood at the time, who gave it to him, why he had it again.' Until his body is released, Michael's loved ones cannot plan a funeral to say goodbye to the Wham! star.
