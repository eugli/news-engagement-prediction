Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports Matt Moreno FOX Sports Midwest Feb 27, 2017 at 10:48p ET 0Shares \nST. LOUIS — It looks like Kevin Shattenkirk will be linking up with T.J. Oshie once again as the Blues have reportedly traded the defenseman to the Washington Capitals. \nShattenkirk, 28, was dealt for forward Zach Sanford, a 2017 first round pick and a 2018 second round pick, according to multiple to reports. Shattenkirk trade has other details but main parts I believe: 1st RD pick in 2017, 2nd RD pick in 2018 and Zach Ranford going to St. Louis \n— Pierre LeBrun (@Real_ESPNLeBrun) February 28, 2017 Confirmed: #stlblues return for Shattenkirk is 1st in 2017, conditional 2nd in 2018 and forward Zach Sanford, as @Real_ESPNLeBrun reported. \n— Jeremy Rutherford (@jprutherford) February 28, 2017 \nShattenkirk, whose current contract makes him a free agent after the season, led all Blues defensemen with 42 points on 11 goals and 31 assists this season. The Blues acquired Shattenkirk in 2011 when dealing former first overall draft pick Erik Johnson to the Colorado Avalanche. \nSanford, 22, has split time between the Capitals and their AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears. The 6′ 4″, 203-pound forward has scored two goals and one assist in 26 games with Washington. In 25 games with the Bears, Sanford has scored 11 goals and notched five assists. Sanford was drafted by the Capitals in the second round of the 2013 NHL Draft. \nThis is the second time in roughly a year and a half the Blues and Capitals have hooked up for a blockbuster trade. In 2015, the Blues dealt T.J. Oshie to Washington for Troy Brouwer, goaltender Pheonix Copley and a third-round draft pick in the 2016 NHL draft. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:08:53.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
