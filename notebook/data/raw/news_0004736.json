USA TODAY’s picks for book lovers include two titles for Black HIstory Month, one a memoir of Trayvon Martin, the other a history of the Emmett Till case. \nRest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin by Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin; Spiegel & Grau, 331 pp.; non-fiction \nThe world will never know who Trayvon Martin — the unarmed 17-year-old fatally shot in Florida by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman on Feb. 26, 2012 — could have grown up to be. \nIn a way, we never knew who he was. His humanity was lost, broken down into school records, headlines and 140 characters in the ensuing media scrutiny and trial of Zimmerman for his role in the altercation that ended in Trayvon’s death. \nIn Rest in Power , Trayvon’s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, gather the pieces and attempt to present the whole of who their son was when he was just a boy — before he became a martyr and before his death sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. \nBut as much as the book is about Trayvon’s life, it’s also a meditation on the criminal justice system that his parents believe did not do him justice. \nUSA TODAY says ***½ out of four stars. “Offers a prayer that someday, as Fulton writes, ‘the killing will stop’ and ‘the healing will begin.’ ” Trayvon Martin's parents honor son's 'Enduring Life' \n4 3 2 1 by Paul Auster; Henry Holt, 866 pp.; fiction \nThis novel takes the life of one man, Archie Ferguson, born in 1947, and offers four alternative versions. \nUSA TODAY says *** stars. “Give Auster full points for literary moxie… 4 3 2 1 must be applauded for its ambition.” One man, four lives, in Auster's '4 3 2 1' \nThe Blood of Emmett Till by Timothy B. Tyson; Simon & Schuster, 304 pp.; non-fiction \nRe-examines the case of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy who was visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955 when he was kidnapped and brutally murdered by two white men. \nUSA TODAY says ***½ stars. Tyson “(applies) diligent research, scrupulous perspective and a vigorous aptitude for weaving public and intimate details.” 'The Blood of Emmett Till' remembers a horrific crime \nLucky Boy by Shanthi Sekaran; Putnam, 469 pp.; fiction \nWho will get custody of little Ignacio El Viento Castro Valdez — his young, undocumented Mexican mother, or the Indian-American couple in California who foster him? \nUSA TODAY says ***½ stars. “Pulses with vitality.” Two warring countries and one 'Lucky' little boy \nThe Girl Before by J.P. Delaney; Ballantine, 336 pp.; fiction \nThe current renter of a gorgeous minimalist house in London tries to determine what happened to the girl who rented the house “before” she did. \nUSA TODAY says *** stars. “Worth a few hours of idle pleasure.” \nContributing reviewers: Jaleesa Jones, Eliot Schrefer, Gene Seymour, Steph Cha, Charles Finch CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k6Lxkx NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
