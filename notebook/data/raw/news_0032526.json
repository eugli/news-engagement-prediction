Mumbai: Bollywood stars went gaga over the quirky trailer of Anushka Sharma’s ‘Phillauri’, where the actress plays a friendly ghost, and were singing praises on social media.\nBut the appreciation for the trailer has been sidelined by recent reports of star cricketer and Anushka’s alleged boyfriend Virat Kohli’s involvement with the film. While earlier it was reported that the Virat would be getting involved in the promotional campaigns of the film, other reports claimed that the star cricketer was also producing the film.\nHowever, Anushka was not too pleased with the reports and took to Twitter to slam the reports in a lengthy post.\nThe actress says that the film is produced by Fox Star Hindi and her banner Clean Slate Films and asked the news platforms to ‘have some shame’ and practice ‘responsible journalism’. He calls the ‘source’-based reports ‘bogus claims’ and ‘rubbish’ and says that she felt ‘disrespected’ by them.\nThe actress also added that she chooses to stay silent on several such stories but her silence should not be considered a weakness and asked the news platforms to refrain from publishing stories without her approval.\nConsidering she is one of the few actresses to have turned a producer, she also feels such reports tarnish the theories of ‘women empowerment’ or ‘women in films’ that she is trying to put forth with her efforts. She ends the post by emphasising that she is ‘more that capable’ of producing her own films.\nHer post:\nAnushka’s ‘Phillauri’ releases on 24 March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:22:01.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
