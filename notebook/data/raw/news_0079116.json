After joking that Pawar would have to hold Kimmel up as Rafiki holds up Simba in the film, he agreed that it may be best if they went the other way around. \nKimmel held Pawar up high as \"The Circle of Life\" played in the Dolby Theatre, with the crowd laughing and Pawar announcing that Mike and Ikes were about to fall from the ceiling for the crowd's enjoyment. \nEarlier this awards season, Pawar became known as this year's Jacob Tremblay, who stole Hollywood's hearts last year at awards ceremonies as the star of Room . \nAt the Golden Globes , the audience cheered and \"awwed\" as Pawar joined his Lion co-star onstage. The young actor only spoke one line into the microphone, after Dev Patel picked him up to reach it: \"This is our movie, Lion! \" But the crowd was already won over. \nThe 89th Academy Awards were held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center and aired on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:39:58.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
