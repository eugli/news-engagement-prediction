What national security goals could possibly be served by this?\" he added. \nA full 47% of those interviewed by the UN said they had a family member who had been killed in the operation, while 43% reported being raped. \nThe Rohingya are loathed by many among Myanmar's Buddhist majority. \nYangon refuses to recognise the Rohingya as one of the country's ethnic minorities, instead describing them as Bengalis – or illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh – even though many have lived in Myanmar for generations. \nThe military crackdown in Rakhine, home to more than one million Rohingya, was triggered by a series of Oct 9 attacks on border guard posts. \nYangon's own probe into the unrest denied that the security forces had carried out a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya. \nMyanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has said the allegations are invented and has resisted mounting international pressure to protect the minority. \nBut Zeid, who has previously urged Yangon to act, hit back again on Friday demanding that impunity for such serious crimes had to stop. \n\"The Government of Myanmar must immediately halt these grave human rights violations against its own people, instead of continuing to deny they have occurred,\" he said. – AFP <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:43:43.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
