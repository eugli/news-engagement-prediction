Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases,\" Trump said. \"And I think it is really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.\" At no point during his answer, however, did Trump acknowledge that he was the person who asked Flynn to resign or explain why he would have asked a \"wonderful man\" to leave his White House. Trump's comments are at odds with what his top aides said Tuesday after Flynn was let go.

Flynn's resignation,\" Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. Trump added Wednesday that \"illegally leaked\" classified documents meant to harm Flynn were part of a \"criminal act.\" \"I think it is very, very unfair what has happened to Gen. Flynn,\" Trump said. \"The way he was treated and the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked.\" Trump concluded that the leaks were meant to \"cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.\" At no point did Trump refute the details of the Flynn story or the reporting that he talked about sanctions with the Russian ambassador.
