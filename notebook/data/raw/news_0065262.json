On Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016, the men who are proposing to build two new casinos in northern New Jersey near New York City, concluded the statewide ballot question that would authorize the projects will not pass, and ended their financial support for a campaign in its favor. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) Today’s planned Senate committee vote on a bill to allow casino gambling has been cancelled leaving the bill’s future in doubt. Sen. Rick Jeffares, R-McDonough , notified members of the Senate Regulated Industries Committee late Wednesday that today’s planned 1 p.m. hearing will not happen. Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta , the sponsor of Senate Bill 79 , confirmed the development Thursday and said it is still possible the hearing is rescheduled for Monday. But another member of the committee said Jeffares polled the committee on Wednesday and the “opposition was overwhelming so he told me there would be no hearing (Thursday).” The member asked not to be identified as he was discussing internal Senate communications. The bill is “sounding pretty dead,” the senator said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will again have Georgia’s largest team covering the Legislature.

The most recent version would allow for up to two “destination resort” casinos in Georgia, one in the Metro Atlanta area and one elsewhere in the state. Beach negotiated with senators in recent weeks to divvy up the expected proceeds from a proposed 20 percent tax on casino revenues. But, as of Thursday morning, it appears he has more work to do. The calendar is not on his side, however, as next Friday, March 3, is Crossover Day in the General Assembly, the last day a bill can move from one chamber to the other without parliamentary maneuvers.
