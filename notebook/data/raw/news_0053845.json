while a sustained period of continued-low global energy prices would also be very beneficial to India,\" it said. \nThe IMF said progress on important economic and structural reforms over the last year has been impressive. \n\"Over the past year, big bang reforms, such as the legislation of a new bankruptcy code, formalisation of inflation targeting framework, and a milestone constitutional amendment enabling implementation of the pan-India Goods and Services Tax (GST), have taken place alongside continued steps implementing the gradualist reform agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\" it said. \nNotwithstanding its majority in the lower house of the national parliament, the BJP does not have control of the upper house, thus requiring consensus building for the passage of key legislation. \nAs a result, securing passage of the GST constitutional amendment spanned several parliamentary sessions and entailed compromise with regional parties, it said. \nThe Modi Government, it said, continues to work towards enhanced inclusive growth. \n\"The financial inclusion agenda has broadened over the past two years, evolving from providing greater access to bank accounts and financial services to introducing more remunerative savings vehicles to diminish the luster of traditional gold-based savings,\" it said. \n\"The government's introduction of gold monetization schemes can boost financial intermediation by channeling domestic gold holdings to gold savings accounts, although uptake thus far has been minimal,\" it added.
