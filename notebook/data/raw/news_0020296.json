Just an hour ago, the Sengkang LRT East Loop was put out of service after being hit by a power disruption. \nResidents near Bakau station reported hearing a \"very loud thunder-like sound\" and saw smoke billowing out of the station. SBS Transit has confirmed that the loud sound was caused by a power fault. \nAbout 20 hapless commuters were stranded in one of the trains which stalled in the middle of the track and had to be evacuated. According to eyewitness, the cabin was pitch dark \nThis latest disruption follows two breakdowns on the NS line and the Bukit Panjang LRT earlier in the day and sets a new record for our PTOs. We are waiting for the day when all lines break down simultaneously - like when Ho Ching celebrates her birthday?
