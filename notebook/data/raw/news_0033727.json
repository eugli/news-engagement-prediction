It makes you wonder how many other foreign criminals have sneaked back in Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley \nB ut, at some point in the last eight years, he returned and is now running two businesses under his real name, the Sun reported. \nPhilip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, last night told the paper it was “quite extraordinary” that Cokaj had managed to get back into the country under the watch of Border Force. \n“It shows our weak our border controls are,” he said. “It makes you wonder how many other foreign criminals have sneaked back in.” \nCokaj was convicted of stabbing a man to death in 1994 . He escaped jail three years later. \nHe is believed to have arrived in the UK the following year. Working to get him extradited in 2009, Pellumb Seferi, head of Interpol in Tirana, described him as “one of the most wanted people in Albania”. \nCokaj said it was a case of mistaken identity and tried to claim asylum, alleging he would be in danger if he was sent back to the Eastern European country. Cokaj is one of the most wanted people in Albania Pellumb Seferi, head of Interpol in Tirana, in 2009 \nH e is believed to have been finally extradited in December that year after he featured on ITV’s Tonight programme. \nBut Companies House records now show Cokaj, who previously claimed his real name was Valtron Gashi, is the director of two active firms, Senture and Sela & Sons Consulting. \nThe first was incorporated in November last year, while the second dates back to August 2015. Both are believed to be car valeting services that operate in the Leicester area. \nA source told the Sun he may have entered the UK clandestinely or didn’t disclose his conviction. \nA Home Office spokesman said: “This Government puts the safety of our families, communities and country first. That's why we've taken action like introduce ‘deport first appeal later’ to stop this kind of thing happening.” \nCokaj has been contacted for comment via the car wash.
