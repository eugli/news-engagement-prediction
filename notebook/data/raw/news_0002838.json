Racked with anxiety , she could barely sleep. When she did, horrific memories of being raped, aged 12, by her doctor spilled into nightmares. Then, after a single, experimental treatment, the haunting stopped. \nLouise is one of an increasing number of people who have been helped by techniques that seem to free individuals from the torments of a traumatic memory. Those who have been raped are not the only ones to benefit. Soldiers haunted by visions of war and survivors of terror attacks and natural disasters are being helped by pills, electric shocks, even video games. \nAnd as we continue to learn about how our brains form and maintain memories, far more might be possible. The focus until now has been on removing a memory’s emotional sting, but we might also excise entire memories at will, or even recover ones wiped out by Alzheimer’s disease. “We can break into the time machine and really reverse-engineer it, hijack it or jump-start it,” says Steve Ramirez at Harvard University. “We can really try to fix memories.” \nMemories are physically imprinted on your brain. If you remember any of this article in a few days’ time, it’s down to changes in how your brain is wired. Over a number of hours or a night’s sleep, your initial memory is consolidated for long-term storage by a suite of genes, which switch on to make the proteins that rework and reinforce neural connections. Only when this process is complete does a memory become permanent , like a book shelved To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access. Existing subscribers, please log in .
