The celebrity chef has been criticised for holding his six-month-old son River Rocket while cooking, with many people claiming that the baby is at risk of being scolded by fat. Parenting expert Sue Atkins cautioned: ‘It’s a cute picture but underneath it there are some dangers.

But PLEASE don’t hold your baby near the stove’, while a third branded the chef ‘irresponsible’. However, many praised him for looking so relaxed, and said that he has experience of raising children and should be free from criticism.
