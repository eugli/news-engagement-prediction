Millennials £2,700,000,000,000 worse off because of previous generation’s decisions \nKeith Priestley accused Ben Williams, 24, of ‘braking too quickly’ after asking him to perform an emergency stop in November 2015. \nBen had been in the middle of his third attempt at his driving test, when his examiner stopped it halfway through and told him he had failed as he was ‘unfit to carry on’, asking Ben’s instructor, who was also in the car, to take the wheel instead. \nTwo weeks later, Ben received a letter from solicitors notifying him that Priestley would be making a claim against him. Driving instructor Keith Priestley (Picture: SWNS) \nBut according to Ben’s instructor, Elaine Rose, who had been in the back seat, his emergency stop maneuver was ‘perfect’– despite the complaints from Priestley, who worked at the test centre in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Lesbian couple 'asked to leave McDonald's after they kissed on the cheek' \nBen, an engineer from Birmingham, said: ‘It was an absolute nightmare, it’s nerve racking enough doing a diving test – let alone the instructor trying to sue you afterwards. \n‘The instructor asked me to perform the emergency stop, so I did, and then he started moaning and groaning that I braked too hard and fast. \n‘But I felt fine, and so did my driving instructor who was sitting in the back seat. \n‘I think he was just trying to get money out of me. It’s horrendous to take advantage of a learner driver like that.’ The driving test centre in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham (Picture: SWNS) \nImmediately after performing the emergency stop, Priestley told him he had failed and asked the instructor to drive the car back to the test centre. Toddler unconscious for 40 minutes after dysentery outbreak hits UK \nBen was not even given any major or minor points in the test – and was given a note saying: ‘Test terminated due to examiner not fit to carry on.’ \nBen said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. There was nothing wrong with me. If he had whiplash, I would have and so would my driving instructor, we were all in the car together.’ \nIn December, three weeks after the test, in a weird coincidence, Ben’s instructor caught Priestley strolling down the street turning his head nine days later – proving he wasn’t suffering from whiplash. Ben has now passed his test (Picture: SWNS) \nIn May, the DVSA went in Ben’s favour – and even offered him a free re-test. \nThe letter they sent him also stated that Keith had dropped his claim against Ben and had been disciplined. \nBen says that the examiner was removed from his position in August 2016. \nHe said the whole thing has left him traumatised and adds that his employment suffered, as he was unable to take the test again while the DVSA was investigating. \n‘My job relied on me having a license, I nearly got a demotion because of his lies.’ \nIn December 2016, Ben finally passed his test. \nA DVSA spokesperson confirmed they are aware of the claim and said that ‘Mr Priestley no longer works for DVSA. We can’t comment any further.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:40:03.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
