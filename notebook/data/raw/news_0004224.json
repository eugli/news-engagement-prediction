While Xbox One owners have been able to do this for ages, the only way for owners to expand storage for a PS4 has been to replace the internal drive. To be fair, Sony has tried to make simple as possible to replace the internal storage, but it was still a fairly involved process that required physically unscrewing the drive, reinstalling the system software, and then copying over all your data.\nBut in the upcoming 4.50 software, Sony is finally adding the ability to simply plug in a USB 3.0 hard drive to instantly get more space, and will support hard drives up to 8TB. Content installed on the external drive will show up in the PlayStation 4 software alongside anything on the internal drive. \nAlso getting added in the update are a few more minute features, including custom wallpapers, more simplified notifications, and support to view 3D Blu-rays in virtual reality using a PlayStation VR.\nThe update is rolling out today to users who are signed up for the PS4 beta program, but Sony has yet to announced when it will see a final release for all users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:38:18.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
