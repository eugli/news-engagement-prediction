Two other people sustained minor injuries, police said. Emergency services at the scene (@tinklyboo) \nMinasu Towolawi was on her way to church with her family when she heard screaming coming from near the car wash. Five rushed to hospital after Mercedes hits pedestrians \nShe told the Standard: “I went up there and I just saw carnage. There were two men lying flat on their backs there. \n“There was another lady was being sat upright and people were trying to get her awake. She looked gone to me. \n“They were all just wailing and crying.” \nShe said: \"There was a lot of blood as well. \n\"I didn't notice the car until I came back afterwards. I just thought they'd been stabbed or shot.\" Investigation: Police outside the car wash (PA) \nMs Towolawi said she believed those who were injured work and live at the car wash, and that they had been waiting outside for customers when they were hit. \nShe and her brother went to see if they could help, but could not understand the group as they spoke little English. \n\"They just kept saying something bad had happened and were slapping themselves and pulling their hair out. They just didn't know what to do and were screaming and crying,\" she said. \nThe 26-year-old said: “When I saw the victims they were in front of the car wash. \n“People were around them saying things in a language I didn’t understand.” \nShe claimed several of the men started running after the driver, a “well-dressed black guy”, yelling: “F*** you. Why have you done this?” \n“One of them was injured and bleeding from the forehead and was chasing the guy,” she said. Crash: Five people were injured (Lewisham Licks) \n“I was so shocked,” she said. “I thought they were dead. \n“It was horrific. I was really moved because everyone there was so upset. They were slapping themselves and were distraught.” \nPhotos from the scene appeared to show the Mercedes had come off the road and ploughed through a row of bollards before hitting a low wall at the end of a hedge. \nThe car's bonnet and boot were popped open by the impact, and its airbags all deployed. Debris was left strewn across the pavement. Mercedes: The car was shown crashed into a hedge (PA) \nA neighbour told the Standard: “It seems like the car's ploughed into two bollards and ended up in the hedges by the bus garage. I hope everyone's ok. \n\"It's so sad, this always happens on this strip of road. There's always some accident or the other.\" \n\"It's really heartbreaking because we live here and I'm always seeing these accidents.” \nPolice said the driver of the car was detained at the scene by an off-duty police officer before being arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
