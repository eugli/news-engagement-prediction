In the throwback era, Jack and Rebecca are inching ever nearer to that fateful moment when Jack leaves this world — and we might have just gotten a new hint as to how that might happen, thanks to a small romantic crisis the two endure. Meanwhile, Kate and Toby are finally starting to reevaluate the breakneck speed at which they’re heading to the altar, Kevin and Sophie are doing some soul baring as well, and Randall is starting to suffer the consequences of trying to salvage what’s left of William’s life at the expense of his own (and his family’s) well-being. \nThe wingman \nJack and Rebecca’s children may be teenagers now — which, from the brief flashback we saw of Jack’s funeral, is about the age when they’ll lose him — but they’re still hot for each other. They’re as devoted as ever to traditions like eating bacon cheeseburgers and onion rings at O’Shannon’s and calling each other “cool wife” and “hot hubby.” \nBut Rebecca’s dreaming a little bigger than the mom life lately. The kids aren’t exactly full grown, although since having sex with Sophie, Kevin sure seems to fancy himself an adult. What started as a few nights a week moonlighting at the piano bar has become a full-on touring opportunity, thanks in part to her pianist, Ben, who sees some big-lights potential for her. \nBen tries to suggest that Jack should be understanding “if” he loves her, but Rebecca barks back at that turn of phrase spectacularly by running through the laundry list (which includes actual laundry, probably) of super-heroic dad stuff Jack’s been doing just to keep her on the local stage these days. Her bark is worse than her bite on the subject, though, because she’s definitely interested in the prospect of taking her singing skills to the next level by Ben’s side. \nJack doesn’t like it, though he won’t tell her that… at least not yet. Privately, though, he admits to Miguel that he doesn’t understand why she’s gunning for a singing tour all of a sudden. “Who does she think she is, Janis Freaking Joplin?” he sneers. He also has a sneaking suspicion that this Ben guy has a thing for his wife, but Miguel assures him that not even Jeff Goldblum, despite his clever cellular courtship monologue in Jurassic Park , could attract her attention away from Jack. It’s an odd pop culture reference to serve as a sign of the times, but let’s go with it. \nJack being Jack, he doesn’t betray his disapproval of the situation to Rebecca, even as they’re forced to have “the talk” with Kevin over his relationship with Sophie, assuage Randall’s gnawing perfectionism over a Hamlet essay due at his ultra-competitive school, and who-knows-what-ing about Kate and her suddenly generous application of eyeliner. He’s got this, he assures her. Dream big and go for it. Classic Jack Pearson. \nThe erstwhile marriage of Miguel has Jack’s bestie in desperate need of Valentine’s Day plans, and since Jack’s already going to be attending Rebecca’s show solo, he invites Miguel to tag along and scout the bar for potential new lady friends. This goes well enough — Miguel makes eyes with a lovely woman across the room — but then things get extremely awkward once Rebecca’s set begins and she’s singing, and swooning, in Ben’s direction during her vocal tribute “to all the lovebirds.” Miguel suggests it’s just a bit for the audience, but Jack is already fit to be tied before Ben comes up to make small talk and drops the bomb that he and Rebecca dated when she was younger. Ruh roh. \nJack pulls the plug on his post-show dinner plans with Rebecca and confronts her about the fact that she’s not only been spending all her free time with her ex-boyfriend, but she never revealed their former romance — and now she wants to go on tour with this guy. Yeahhhh, Jack may have been overreacting before tonight, but he’s completely justified in his concern now. Rebecca says she didn’t tell him because she didn’t want him to get the wrong impression about her new career goals, but that does nothing to satisfy Jack’s rage. \nInstead, he takes off and honors that restaurant reservation solo… well, not completely solo. He orders a drink to go with his traditional V-Day dinner. Yikes. \nCould that be a hint at what’s to come? Could Jack’s return to booze become part of his downfall? There’s a hint in this backstory that they don’t really know what’s going on with Kate at the time, and she does seem to be the sibling most consistently affected by his death. Could she have had some kind of personal crisis that left her attentive dad rushing to her side when he didn’t have any business behind the wheel? Another theory for the bucket. \nNEXT: Kate goes to Duke’s cabin, but not for the reason we expect Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:41:46.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
