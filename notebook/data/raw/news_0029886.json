Eric Holcomb a \"big bear hug.\" \nElliot Slosar, Cooper's lawyer, had a much different sentiment for Vice President Mike Pence, Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill and the Elkhart Police Department. \nSlosar accused Pence of political cowardice for not granting a pardon sooner, Hill of continuing to press a flimsy prosecution and the Elkhart Police Department of corruption, saying he believes there are \"many more people in that (Elkhart) county who also faced the same injustice that Keith Cooper faced.\" \n\"We will certainly be back there to expose the truth,\" Slosar said. \nHolcomb on Thursday pardoned Cooper on a felony conviction stemming from an armed robbery in Elkhart about 20 years ago that he did not commit. \nCooper was sentenced in 1997 to 40 years in prison, but after serving more than eight years he reached a deal. He could withdraw his petition that sought exoneration and, in exchange, walk out of jail a free man. Cooper agreed. \nThe deal was offered by the Elkhart County prosecutor, who was then Hill. He was not the county prosecutor when Cooper was wrongly convicted, but later defended Cooper's conviction when Cooper sought a new trial. \nHill on Friday declined comment. Pence's office and the Elkhart Police Department did not return phone messages Friday afternoon. \nHolcomb on Thursday said he was \"very much at peace\" with pardoning Cooper on an armed robbery charge.
