In a conference call with reporters, one official noted, “We do not have the personnel, time or resources to go into communities and round up people and do all kinds of mass throwing folks on buses. That’s entirely a figment of folks’ imagination.” \nYet Trump is moving to actually enforce US law, reversing the across-the-board Obama-era slowdown of enforcement actions. Violent criminals remain the top priority, but are no longer the only priority. \nNow plea-bargaining a felony down to a misdemeanor won’t leave you automatically exempt from immigration enforcement, nor will DHS officials wink at an illegal immigrants’ fraudulent filing for welfare benefits. \nOverall, DHS is pledging to “treat everyone humanely and with dignity” — while making clear its determination to “execute the laws of the United States” and that everything in Trump’s order “is consistent with what Congress put into law.” \nIn short, it’s a promise of vigorous but rationally targeted enforcement, which is what most Americans have long wanted. As long as that’s what it proves in practice, it should be a big political win for Trump.
