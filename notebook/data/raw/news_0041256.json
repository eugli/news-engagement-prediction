And in keeping with the theme, the report also revealed that a six inch radius is the minimum amount of personal space that needs to be afforded to a person in a queue, to avoid increasing stress or anxiety.\nProfessor Adrian Furnham, who co-authored the report, said: “The British have a well-established culture of queuing and a very specific type of queue conduct, one that has been known to confuse many a foreign visitor. “In a time when Britain is changing rapidly, and the ways in which we queue are shifting, the psychology behind British queuing is more important than ever – it a one of the keys to unlocking British culture.”\nThe study was based on a review of academic literature on different types of everyday queuing including at banks, ATMs, and buying food at the supermarket. \nIt found the optimal amount of time a customer is willing to wait in line is 5 minutes 54 seconds. This is the amount of time a customer considers \"reasonable\" before the wait begins to have a detrimental impact on their satisfaction level, it said. After five minutes the customer’s satisfaction has gone from 95pc to 85pc. After five minutes 54 seconds, the satisfaction begins to drops at a much quicker rate, decreasing to around 55pc by 8 minutes.\nThe report also includes a list of queuing \"no-nos\" which no one should ever do in a queue in Britain. At number one, queue skipping is the ultimate faux pas as it goes against the British social system of linear queuing and the nationally recognised \"first come, first served\" principle. According to Prof Furnham, the very public nature of queuing and as such, queue skipping, sparks a huge sense of injustice amongst all members of the queue.\nEngaging in conversation whilst queuing also made the list of social practices that are viewed as completely unacceptable by British people. However perhaps the most confusing to visitors from abroad is number three on the list: accepting a person’s offer to go ahead of them in the queue. In British queueing culture, not only will acceptance be perceived as impoliteness, it will also lose the individual the respect of the remaining queuers, it said. \nThe research was conducted by Privilege Home Insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:09:19.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
