DAP should stop trying to hide it,\" tweeted the Prime Minister on Saturday. \n\"Voters know DAP has the most Opposition seats and Lim Kit Siang calls the shots,\" he said. \nThe identity of the de facto Opposition leader had been widely discussed since DAP's newest member Datuk Zaid Ibrahim said on Friday that there was a silent agreement among the Opposition that it was former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. \nZaid's statement ruffled feathers within DAP, with its central executive committee member Gobind Singh Deo saying that there was no such understanding. \nGobing also criticised Zaid for making the announcement as a DAP member without consulting the party leadership. \nZaid only joined the DAP on Tuesday. \nThe Opposition leader is currently Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who took over from her husband Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim after he was jailed for sodomy.
