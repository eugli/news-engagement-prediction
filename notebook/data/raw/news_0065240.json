Naturally, her imperfections make her the perfect ambassador for Reebok’s #neverperfect campaign. \nWe’ve already seen Gigi starring in the brand’s Club C relaunch , but now sat down for a slightly more relaxed video in which she slips on some comfy Reebok gear to answer 37 quick-fire “this or that” questions. 💥 A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Jan 17, 2017 at 7:37am PST \nHadid reveals many things that make her the person and model she is today.
