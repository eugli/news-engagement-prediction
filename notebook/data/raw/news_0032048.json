He did not say how long this might take. \nThe evacuation was ordered after authorities realised both the spillway and its emergency counterpart were damaged and unable to cope with a deluge of rain and snow. \nOfficials had been telling residents for days that the damage was nothing to be concerned about, but then late on Sunday told nearly 200,000 people to get out in an hour. \nDespite this, acting Water Resources director Bill Croyle said he was \"not sure anything went wrong\" on the damaged spillway. \n'Evacuees welcome at my home' \nThe California Department of Water Resources was releasing as much as 100,000 cubic feet (2,830 cubic metres) of water per second from the main spillway to try to lower the lake's level and relieve the pressure on the spillway. \nMore rain is forecast for Wednesday and Thursday, leading to some concern about whether or not the damaged spillway can withstand the pressure. \nMr Croyle said he expected the storms to be smaller, adding that more water was currently leaving the lake than entering it. Image copyright EPA \nIt is the first time that Lake Oroville, which lies 65 miles (105km) north of Sacramento, has experienced such an emergency in the dam's near 50-year history. \nThe dam's main spillway, also known as an overflow channel, was found to be damaged after the water rose. \nAs it rose even higher, the dam's emergency spillway was activated for the first time since its completion in 1968. \nHowever, this secondary slipway was also found to be damaged, and engineers warned it could fail within an hour, sending a wall of water crashing down on the towns beneath it. Media caption What went wrong with US dam? \nIn a statement posted on social media on Sunday afternoon, Mr Honea ordered residents to evacuate, repeating three times that it was \"NOT a drill\". \nThere was gridlock on roads heading out of Oroville, a town of 16,000 people, with some evacuees complaining that they should have been given more warning. \nSeveral hours after the evacuation order, the emergency spillway was still standing, but California Fire Incident commander Kevin Lawson said officials stood by the decision to evacuate residents, rather than risk thousands of lives. \nHe said if the situation was not dealt with they were looking at \"a 30ft wall of water coming out of the lake\".

Downstream from Oroville Lake, workers have transferred five million baby fish at the state-operated Feather River Hatchery for the endangered Chinook salmon. \nDeadly amounts of silt, sand and mud are spewing into the ponds. The hatchery raises about eight million salmon a year, or 30% of the $4bn salmon-fishing industry in the state, said Andrew Hughan, spokesman for California Department of Fish and Wildlife. About three million of those fish are still at risk because of the eroding spillway. \nWith water visibility at zero, dozens of workers have been scooping up the fish, one net at a time, and moving them by truck to a holding pond. One million steelhead trout eggs have had to be left behind and are unlikely to survive in the turbid water.
