BLAIR OWN GOAL: Has ‘yesterday’s man’ just united Britain FOR Brexit? TONY BLAIR has been dubbed the “enemy of the people” following his desperate pro-EU speech as Twitter users mocked the ex-Labour premier for “uniting” the British people - against him. PUBLISHED: 11:00, Fri, Feb 17, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:05, Fri, Feb 17, 2017 GETTY Tony Blair has been described as the 'enemy of the people' \nThe Remainer was lambasted as “yesterday’s man” by Nigel Farage after he made his bid to derail Brexit by persuading Britain to remain in the EU, during a speech in London today. \nBut instead of persuading people to back his rallying cry to stay in the bureaucratic European Union, angry Twitter users said he had managed to once again “unite” the nation against him. \nEntrepreneur, Duncan Bannatyne OBE tweeted: “Why doesn't Tony Blair just do one? I mean like just shut his big gob?” and Ukip’s Nigel Farage added: “Tony Blair is yesterday’s man”.

In that, everybody unanimously tells him to pipe down.” \nAnother Twitter user simply said: “Tony Blair - Enemy of the people.” \nWhile others suggested his bid to “rise up” against Brexit was a little too late as the 63-year-old failed to make any intervention during the EU referendum campaign. \nA Twitter user said: “Tony Blair says this is the ‘beginning’ of the #Brexit debate. Where was he when the UK voted?” \nOthers were keen to remind the multi-millionaire of his apparent failings during the 2003 Iraq War, following last year’s Chilcot Inquiry. \nOne said: “I voted for Tony Blair without ‘informed knowledge’ he intended to wage a murderous, illegal war. I call on people to ‘rise up’ against him.” \nAnother tweeted: “Tony Blair can crawl back under a rock. I remember about a million people rising up about Iraq and he ignored it.” \nBut it appears Mr Blair was prepared for the backlash - during his speech he addressed criticism, saying “Like me or not like me… you don’t have to listen to me,” to a rapturous round of applause.
