Applicants can return to where they came from at any time, Kovács said Monday. \n“No migrants ― not even those who have already issued their request for asylum ― will be able move freely until there is a primary legal decision whether they are entitled for political asylum, refugee status or anything else, so they are not entitled to move freely in the country,” Kovács said. \nCurrently, asylum seekers in Hungary can move throughout the country while awaiting a decision. In other European countries, like Belgium and Greece , asylum seekers are detained temporarily upon arrival. \nThe EU stipulates that “a person should not be held in detention for the sole reason that he or she is seeking international protection,” and an asylum seeker may only be detained under “ exceptional circumstances .” PETER MUHLY via Getty Images Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has described asylum seekers in Europe as \"poison.\" \nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is the first European leader to openly express support for Trump. \nLike Trump, who plans to build a multibillion dollar wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Orbán has fielded heavy criticism over his strict immigration stance. The populist leader praised Trump’s foreign policy as “ vital ” for Hungary, and celebrated Trump’s election victory as the end of “liberal non-democracy.” \nThe two leaders hold similar views on immigrants and refugees. Just a month after Trump called Syrian refugees America’s “ Trojan horse ,” Orbán described asylum seekers in Europe as “ poison .” The prime minister said diplomatic ties between Hungary and the U.S. could greatly improve under Trump’s leadership. Bloomberg via Getty Images Hungary erected fences along its Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian borders to divert illegal immigrants in 2015 \nAnti-immigrant sentiment has been well-documented in Hungary. Just two weeks after Trump signed an executive order banning travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations, the mayor of a Hungarian village openly expressed his desire to ban Muslims from his community. In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Laszlo Toroczkai said: “We primarily welcome people from Western Europe ― people who wouldn’t like to live in a multicultural society. ... We wouldn’t like to attract Muslims to the village.” \nHungary built razor-wire fences along its borders with Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia to divert undocumented immigrants in 2015. The government held a referendum in which 95 percent of voters rejected Brussels’ mandatory asylum-seeker quotas. \nBudapest’s continued resistance to EU immigration policies ― which Kovács described as “lagging behind reality” ― has drawn ire from the international community. In September, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be expelled from the bloc for treating asylum seekers “ worse than wild animals .” \nHuman rights organization Amnesty International denounced Hungary’s “ appalling treatment ” of asylum seekers in a scathing report released in September. Men, women and children suffered “violent abuse, illegal push backs and unlawful detention at the hands of Hungary’s authorities” while spending months waiting for asylum in “degrading conditions,” the report said. \nHungary is training thousands of “ border hunters ” who will be deployed in May to patrol Hungarian borders with pistols, batons and pepper spray to keep migrants out.
