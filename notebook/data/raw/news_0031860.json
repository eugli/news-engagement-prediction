(Blair Rhodes/CBC)\nAt Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Halifax on Tuesday, Justice Patrick Duncan said Comeau, given his many years of employment at the facility, should have known that residents housed in the ninth floor suffered from mental impairments.\nDuncan said Comeau made no effort to determine whether the woman was capable of consenting. Court was told that her dementia caused the woman to behave in an inappropriate, sexual manner.\nComeau will be sentenced in May. He's free on conditions in the meantime. He no longer works at Northwood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:50:46.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
