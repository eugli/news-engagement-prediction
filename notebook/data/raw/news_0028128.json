We use it, sweepingly, to address crowds, to define historical figures, to sell $300 sunglasses.\nBut when we asked five Twin Cities area men what the word meant to them, they steered the conversation past the trendy and the antiquated definitions to a decidedly inward direction.\nBeing a gentleman simply implies a conscious, carefully considered approach to life, they said. Their tenets? Courtesy, respect and kindness — old-school concepts, applied to modern existence.\n“It’s about the way you treat people, and the way you carry yourself,” said Chris Foster, founder of the Libation Project, a St. Paul-based wine importing and distributing company. “It’s a person who operates with integrity, selflessness and genuineness.”\nWith smartphones and other technological noise constantly vying for our attention and time, abiding by those rules can be harder than it sounds. Our five local gents — Foster, Keith Dorsett, Drew Beson, Keith Wyman and Jon Oulman — helped us create a guide to the up-to-date definition of the “g” word.\nistock\nSOCIAL STUDIES\nMake eye contact\nThe rule: Even when you’re having a seemingly meaningless interaction with the mustachioed dude behind the coffee counter, take a second to actually look at him and smile.\nWhy it matters: “It means you’re attentive,” Dorsett said. “It means whatever you’re saying matters or whoever you’re listening to matters.”\nGet out of your seat\nThe rule: Stand up to greet someone or say goodbye.\nWhy it matters: “Greetings and departures are really important,” Beson said. “They are punctuations in a nice line of prose.”\nThink about your handshake\nThe rule: A handshake should be firm, but not crushing. Do not offer a drooping appendage, aka “the limp fish.”\nWhy it matters: “A bad handshake is like a bad kiss,” Foster said. “It’s so off-putting and distracting. It makes it seem like you’re disinterested or dismissive.”\nMake plans\nThe rule: Don’t text a pal to make last-minute plans on a Friday night because you’re bored. Instead, look two Fridays out and suggest something: a show, an art exhibit, a new restaurant or a sweatpants date in your kitchen with a massive bowl of guacamole.\nWhy it matters: “It’s not about what you do, but it’s about the ritual and showing people you’re interested in spending time with them,” Foster said.\nistock\nCOMMUNICATION\nRemember the big things\nThe rule: Your pregnant gal pal is having an ultrasound? Your buddy is preparing for a big presentation? Remember those things and bring them up.\nWhy it matters: “Asking shows you’re curious about the things that are important to them,” Beson said. “That’s the way to really perpetuate friendships.”\nGive a compliment\nThe rule: When you like someone’s watch/shoes/apartment/light saber collection, say so. (Example: “I love your sweater. I’m really into cashmere right now.”) But stay away from the creepy zone. (Example: “Your sweater looks so cozy I want to lock you away and hug you forever.”)\nWhy it matters: “It makes people feel good,” Foster said. “And it allows you to leave on a high note.”\nRepeat after me: “I’m sorry”\nThe rule: Use those two little words when you make others upset or just do something dumb.\nWhy it matters: “It’s about admitting that you’re not perfect, and it’s about considering the feelings of others,” Dorsett said.\nKeep an even tone\nThe rule: Stay calm, even when your neighbor is blasting Justin Bieber so loudly you want to punch holes through the wall.\nWhy it matters: “You really can get your point across without yelling and screaming,” Dorsett said.\nAsk questions\nThe rule: When you’re chatting with someone at a gathering, come stocked with as many questions as answers.\nCheat-sheet questions:\n• If you were an alcoholic spirit, what would you be?\n• What do you think — is Bigfoot real?\n• Do you know the way to San Jose?\n• Where are you from, what do you do and how do you know [so-and-so] are good, too.\nWhy it matters: “It’s important to contribute to the conversation and make efforts to keep it going,” Oulman said.\nistock\nCOMMITMENT\nBe on time\nThe rule: Be punctual, even for parties and casual get-togethers.\nWhy it matters: “If you say you’re going to come at 9 and you show up at 9:30, it tells me that you clearly don’t value my time,” Wyman said.\nKeep your word\nThe rule: Do what you say you’re going to do, even if it means going to that 6 a.m. Monday running club you were pressured into by your sister.\nWhy it matters: “It’s so meaningful,” Beson said. “It sounds simple, but it’s really hard to do.”\nKeep learning\nThe rule: Be a pupil of life. Always look for inventive skills to add to your repertoire, whether it’s playing an instrument, learning a language or a new way to fix mac and cheese (try it with bacon and Brussels sprouts).\nWhy it matters: “You can better relate to more people that way,” Oulman said. “I think it best not to be an expert at anything, but proficient at many things.”\nistock\nLIFE SKILLS\nKeep a bottle of bubbly in the fridge\n“You never know when there will be an occasion,” Beson said. (For under $40, we suggest Arnoux Cremant de Bourgogne Blanc de Blancs, available at Solo Vino, St. Paul. For over $50, we suggest Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label, available at most wine stores.)\nWrite thank-you notes\n“Take the time to actually write something down,” Beson said. Minnesota’s Old Tom Foolery (­ oldtomfoolery.com ) makes some sassy cards.\nHave a good joke in your pocket\nHere’s one from Oulman:\nQ: What’s invisible and smells like carrots?\nA: Bunny farts!\nKnow how to …\nFold an omelet\nThe key is to use butter and keep the eggs moving.\nClean and filet a fish\nFirst, find a good knife, maybe from Minnesota Fillet Knife ( mnfilletknife.com ).\nBuild something\nHow about a wooden six-pack carrier? Check one out at Upstairs Circus ( upstairscircus.com ), which is supposed to open soon in Minneapolis.\nRoast a chicken\nTo make it more succulent, put duck fat under the skin.", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/2communication.jpg?w=525", "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2lifeskill.jpg?w=525", "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2commitment.jpg?w=525", "http://upstairscircus.com/co/", "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2eye.jpg?w=525", "http://mnfilletknife.com/", "http://www.oldtomfoolery.com/"], "published": "2017-02-13T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:55:02.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
