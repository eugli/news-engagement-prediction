He also has a third-period assist. \nBourque extends his Bruins record to 1,506 points before he's traded to the Colorado Avalanche on March 6, 2000. \n\nMORE MOMENTS \n1947: With his team struggling offensively, New York Rangers goalie Chuck Rayner skates the puck all the way into the Montreal Canadiens zone to try to score a goal. The strategy doesn't work; the Rangers lose 2-1 at the Forum. \n\n1964: Canadiens forward Bobby Rousseau scores five goals in a 9-3 victory against the Detroit Red Wings at the Forum. It's the first time in Rousseau's NHL career that he scores more than two goals in a game, and it's the League's only five-goal game between February 1955 and November 1968. \n\n1970: Terry Sawchuk makes 29 saves for his 447th (and final) NHL victory and 103rd shutout, helping the Rangers defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins 6-0 at Madison Square Garden. Sawchuk retires in April 1970 holding the NHL records in each category. \nVideo: Terry Sawchuk was four-time Vezina-winning goalie \n\n1980: Wayne Gretzky scores three goals for his first NHL hat trick and has an assist to help the Edmonton Oilers defeat the Winnipeg Jets 9-2 at Northlands Coliseum. He scores once in each period, giving him 31 goals for the season. It comes in Gretzky's 50th NHL game and is the first of his NHL-record 50 hat tricks. \n\n1992: Denis Potvin becomes the first member of the New York Islanders to have his number retired. His No. 5 is raised to the rafters of Nassau Coliseum four years after he retires as the highest-scoring defenseman in NHL history. \n\n1993: Gary Bettman officially takes office as the first Commissioner of the NHL. \n\n2001: Patrick Roy becomes the first goaltender in NHL history to play in 40 or more games for 16 straight seasons, extending his own League record. He reaches the milestone by playing in the Colorado Avalanche's 5-3 road loss to the Vancouver Canucks.
