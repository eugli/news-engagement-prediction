It reads: \"Put a small kitten in each box. Close the boxes. After some time open the boxes. What do you see? The kitten inside the box without holes has died.\" \nThe book's publisher has promised it will not appear in the next edition, according to the Indian Express . \nParvesh Gupta of PP Publications said: \"A parent had called us a couple of months ago and asked us to remove the text from the book because it was harmful for children. We recalled books from our distribution channel and will come out with a revised book next year.\" \nShocked Indians shared their disgust online, saying the book was wholly unsuitable for children. \n\"Person who wrote such experiment must be put in instead of animal. Fools\", wrote a tweeter with the handle Thinking Indian. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:38:31.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
