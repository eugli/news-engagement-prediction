Since winning the US presidency last year, Donald Trump has continued to be loathed by many Americans. Chuck Williams, a former sculptor and vocal Trump non-supporter, amplified his spite for the businessman-turned-politician and took “trolling” to a whole new level. The 56-year-old Wisconsin, USA-native created an exact vinyl of Donald Trump “troll doll” with a disturbingly visible penis. ADVERTISEMENT The 4.75-inch tall and 4-inch wide plastic figurine is based on the buggy-eyed, rainbow-haired troll dolls, which have been a fixture for children’s toys since the ’90s. As seen in several photos posted on Williams’ personal website , the Trump troll doll features the President’s likeness, including his trademark blonde hair, bushy eyebrows and his patented scowl. The toy also comes with a tiny Android cellphone in hand—an ode to President Trump’s penchant for using Twitter. “I was as surprised as everyone else that Trump was elected,” Williams detailed his motivations behind the doll to Huffington Post. “I just found myself sculpting a caricature of him to release some steam.” Photo from KickStarter campaign. His experience as former senior staff sculptor for the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, California, for 30 years came in handy, as he was able to create a seemingly profound replica of the unpopular commander-in-chief. After finishing one sample of the Trump doll, Williams posted a photo of it on Facebook and was surprised with the number of people willing to pitch in and cover the manufacturing of the figurines. “I sculpted him NSFW (Not Safe for Work) to make it clear that I sculpted the entire figure and did not simply sculpt a head on an existing toy body,” he explained. “And I wanted to be a bit insulting. Tiny hands you know.” Photo from KickStarter campaign Through the urging of some friends, Williams started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the mass production of his miniature creation. As of this writing, the manufacturing process has already started, and interested buyers can pre-order the dolls on KickStarter for $25 (P1,257) each.
