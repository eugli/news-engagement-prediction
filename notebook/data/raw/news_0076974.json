Violence and abuse \nMs Barron said children were exposed to sexual imagery on a \"daily basis\". \n\"Children themselves, girls in particular, are telling us that they feel they need improved, age-appropriate mandatory sex and relationships education,\" she said. \n\"This would help them navigate these difficult issues.\" \nPlan UK's poll of UK adults, carried out by Opinium, also found that: About 70% of men and 79% of women thought the \"impact of pornography\" should be taught in schools Sexting awareness lessons should be introduced, according to 65% of men and 77% of women Violence and abuse lessons were backed by 79% of men and 86% of women Some 86% of adults surveyed wanted sexual consent as part of lessons \nThe findings come amid growing pressure for sex education to be compulsory in schools. \nThe Local Government Association warned that pupils in England's schools were at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections when they reached adulthood, because they were not being properly prepared. \nLabour has also called for compulsory age-appropriate sex education in all schools in England, claiming that sexting among under-16s is on the rise . \nConservative MP Maria Miller, who has also backed a change in policy, added that most children will already have seen online pornography by the time they leave primary school. \n\"I want compulsory lessons at school to help children better understand the signs of an abusive relationship, issues such as consent and the harm that is done by sexting and underage viewing of pornography,\" she said. \nLast year, a parliamentary inquiry said there were \"alarming inconsistencies\" in the way schools deal with sexual harassment and violence. \nThe cross-party Women and Equalities Committee said in its report last September that compulsory sex education would \"help to significantly reduce the incidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in schools\".
