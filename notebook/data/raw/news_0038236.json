But does someone need to explain to her and her department that they can’t just disappear laws she doesn’t like or understand? \nA Department of Education website explaining the rights of students under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has vanished. [...] The website appeared to stop working shortly before DeVos took office , the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported. \nThe Department of Education site now attributes the broken link to “technical difficulties” and instead sends people to the 159-page text of the very technical, complicated statute . The department site also lists available special education programs. \nMaybe they really are having technical difficulties, but it sure is an interesting coincidence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:01:54.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
