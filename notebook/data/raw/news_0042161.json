But in Broner’s hometown, it wasn’t quite enough as Granados lost a 10-round split decision before a crowd of 6,085, many rooting for Granados at the Cintas Center on the campus of Xavier University. The fight was aired on Showtime Championship Boxing. \nBroner, fighting for the first time in 10 months, and coming off a very difficult 2016 that included 30 days in jail, media boycotts and threats of suicide on social media, won by scores of 97-93 and 96-94 and 97-93 for Granados. \nGranados was definitely the busier fighter, throwing 210 more punches than Broner, but Broner (33-3, 24 KOs) was more accurate, landing 166 to Granados’ 146. \n“I knew that Adrian Granados was going to come tough. At the end of the day, I was beating him up,” said Broner (33-2, 24 KOs), who had said in the leadup to the fight that he was bringing a newfound maturity to his life. “This was an easy one for me. I feel good.” \nIt was far from easy for Broner, who said he tried to make it an inside fight because he hurt his left hand early and couldn’t use his jab. Everytime Broner was able to land anything, however, Granados, who bled from the nose much of the fight, followed up was a flurry of his own, seeming to often get the last word. But his lack of accuracy eventually did him in. \n“Adrian Granados is a world class fighter, a lot of guys duck him but I wanted to fight him because that’s what I’m about,” Broner continued. “I hurt my left hand in the first round, since then I couldn’t throw my jab as much. That’s why I had to stay inside. I couldn’t use my jab but I adjusted.” \nGranados (18-5-2, 12 KOs) didn’t really argue the decision but invited Broner to Chicago to do it a second time. He also complained about the fact that the fight was originally scheduled at a catch weight of 142 pounds, but ended up at 147 at Broner’s insistence. \n“I knew it wouldn’t be a pretty fight but I’m so thankful to my team. Broner knows there were lots of games played leading up to this,” he said. “I just want to be treated fairly. I know I don’t have a perfect record, but I can beat anybody. Let’s do it again. \n“He fought smart and did his thing. If he thinks he did it this time, let’s do it again. I want it at my house.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:38:13.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
