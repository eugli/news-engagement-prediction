Story continues below \nBut people have noted similarities between the novel’s story and the era in which it’s found new popularity. \nThe Handmaid’s Tale tells the story of the Republic of Gilead, a futuristic dictatorship run by religious extremists that’s been created inside the borders of what was once known as the U.S.A. \nIt’s a place where the U.S. constitution has been suspended and women are now considered property. They’re not allowed to read and a specific class of women is exploited for reproductive purposes. \nOffred, a handmaid, lives under the control of the Commander, and is made to lie with him in the hope that she becomes pregnant. \nWATCH BELOW: Margaret Atwood issues tweets as part of the #TwitterFiction Festival. \nThe success of The Handmaid’s Tale comes weeks after Orwell’s 1984 – another story about an authoritarian future society – saw spiking sales after Trump aide Kellyanne Conway coined the term “alternative facts” in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press . \nMany drew comparisons between Conway’s term and concepts raised in Orwell’s novel. The next dystopian novel \nSpeaking to NPR on Tuesday, Atwood talked about how the next major dystopian novel wouldn’t be a book at all. \nEvents, she said, are “evolving so fast” that a novel simply couldn’t keep up with them. \n“I think we might go back to newspaper serials,” she told the radio station. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
