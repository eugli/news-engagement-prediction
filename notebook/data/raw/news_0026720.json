A suspect was also arrested there. \nAlzafny said four employees of the oil and gas company were also arrested last Friday to assist investigation. \n- Bernama \n\nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:14:59.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
