The forward has been limited to just 14 league appearnaces this season which have yielded only two goals for the England international. He was left on the bench for Liverpool's 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, their first league win in 2017. In Sturridge's absence, the Liverpool squad were put through their paces with two training sessions having headed to training on bikes on Thursday morning. Liverpool stopper Loris Karius works at stamping his mark on the No 1 spot for Klopp's side Youngster Yan Dhanda joins in with the team drills during day two in Spain Klopp puts his side through their paces as training ramps up as the week goes on Playmaker Adam Lallana looked right at home on two wheels, leading the way to the session. But Klopp and a few of his players appeared a little less comfortable, with Sadio Mane looking tentative on a bike and James Milner sporting a fetching blue helmet. They did seem to be enjoy themselves once they had their feet back on the ground, however. Klopp and his players shared a joke, while Philippe Coutinho showed off his fancy footwork with some tricks and flicks for the cameras. Manager Klopp oversees his side's players stretching out at the training base in Spain Sadio Mane honing his passing after his eagerly awaited return from the Africa Cup of Nations And Simon Mignolet had time to lie back and enjoy a bit of winter sun in between drills as the goalkeeper was put through his paces. It is a break Liverpool will feel they deserve after their first Premier League win of 2017 against Spurs. Before that they had lost four of their last five games in all competition, including exiting the FA Cup at the hands of Wolves. Liverpool don't play again until February 27, when they travel to Leicester, before a busy March that sees them host Arsenal and Burnley before travelling to Manchester City.
