From the article above: \nPreliminary data released last month by Sweden’s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year , but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups. \nThe NYT then interviewed an expert (a doctoral student?) who goes on to admit that immigrants were “disproportionately represented among crime suspects” but adds that “many of the victims” were immigrants themselves (again, what everyone is talking about, i.e. in Malmo): \nManne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods. \n“Immigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime — but that’s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it’s something we can live with,” he said. “I know everybody won’t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell.” \nGot that? Hey, the immigrants are raping other immigrants so it’s no big deal! Trending James Woods crashed Patton Oswalt's opening monologue at the @WGAWest awards show and it was HILARIOUS \nThe NYT didn’t provide any specifics on the increase in the number of rapes, but Powerline did: Swedish crime stats came out today, and they show that Trump was right about Sweden and refugees: https://t.co/7QiDnit0Tc @powerlineUS \n— John Hinderaker (@jhinderaker) February 21, 2017 \nThat piece quotes from this article on the website, The Local — Sweden . In summary, reported cases of rape are up by 13% and sexual molestations are up 20% when compared to 2015: \nAn example of a figure from Brå’s statistics which paints one picture in isolation but a different one with further context is that the number of rapes reported in Sweden increased by 13 percent in 2016 to 6,560. \nBut when that number is compared to 2014, where the number of reported rapes was 6,700, then a slight decrease can actually be seen. In other words, the number of reported rapes in Sweden dipped in 2015 (down by 12 percent to 5,920) then in 2016 it returned to around the same level as 2014. \nSeen over a ten-year period, the number of reported rapes has gone up from 4,208 in 2006, partly because of legislative changes in the previous year and in 2013 broadening the definition, according to Brå. \nAccording to Brå’s figures, 10,500 incidents of sexual molestation were reported in the country in 2016 – a striking increase of 20 percent on 2015 (when 8,840 were reported). \nBut once again, 2015 was a year when reported sexual molestation had dropped significantly – it was down by eight percent that year compared to 2014, when 9,640 incidents were reported. \nStop with the spin! \n— CNN Lies & Is Hitler (@NolteNC) February 21, 2017 \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:08:17.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
