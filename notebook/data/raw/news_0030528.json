In one sample, PCB levels were 50 times higher than in crabs in one of China's most polluted rivers.\nThe high concentrations may be because trash or the remains of contaminated fish sink and build up even on the remotest seabeds, providing food for tiny scavengers.\nThe scientists caught creatures in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific — the deepest point on the seabed, at 11,033 metres down — and the Kermadec Trench off New Zealand.\nTheir lander took samples of the sea floor then released weights and floated back to the surface.\nInternational efforts In the 2001 Stockholm Convention, governments agreed to outlaw a \"dirty dozen\" of man-made persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including PCBs, linked to cancers and damage to reproductive and immune systems in humans and wildlife.\nIn 2009 Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) were added to the list, which now comprises 26 chemicals. \"POPS are found everywhere,\" said Ana-Maria Witt of the Secretariat of the POPs convention in Geneva.\nAn international meeting in late April in Geneva on \"detoxifying the future\" will decide whether to add two new chemicals, used as flame retardants and in plastics, to the list.\nMany POPs build up in fatty tissues, and some of the highest levels have been found in the Arctic — including in the breast milk of Inuit women — after being swept northwards by winds and ocean currents from industries far to the south.\n\n© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:42:16.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
