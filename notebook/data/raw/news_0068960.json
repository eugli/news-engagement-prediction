Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nThe new Bebe Rexha song is INSANELY fun, so of course we're dancing our butts off to it with The Fitness Marshall. This song's theme is \"casting a love potion on someone to make them fall in love with us,\" so Caleb's choreography will naturally have some hilariously themed moves (read: gathering and snatching ingredients, including cream cheese . . . and the heart of a llama). \nOur favorite line? \"We're missing one ingredient, and that's hair flips.\" Trust us, you won't be able to stop moving to this song, or listening to it, or laughing at the hilarious coaching.
