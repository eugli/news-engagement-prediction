Heist Brewery Heist Brewery is expanding its reach with a new production facility, bakery and butcher shop in Charlotte's North End. Plans call for that facility — dubbed Heist Brewery and Barrel Arts — to open in mid- to late summer. That 22,000-square-foot facility sits on a 2.3-acre parcel off of Woodward Avenue. Heist Brewery and Barrel Arts will add a new facility in Charlotte's North End. Heist Brewery That’s approximately four miles from Heist Brewery’s current space on North Davidson Street, which will remain open. “I always knew the end goal was a production facility,” says Kurt Hogan , founder and president. He declines to share specifics, but adds the cost to transform that former warehouse space will be a “pretty penny.” Roughly 17,000 square feet will serve as the brewing facility, including a 3,200-square-foot taproom. Also planned are a 30-barrel brew house and canning line, patio space and a large beer garden. The remainder of that building will be carved into two spaces. One piece will serve as an independent bake shop. The other, a butcher shop. Both will fill a niche locally when it comes to specialty baked goods and meats and will serve the taproom as well. “It’s all under one roof, so it serves as a hub,” Hogan says. Expect rustic sourdough breads, hearth-baked bagels and items such as breakfast sandwiches from the bakery. Recipes will utilize spent grains and beer in recipes to add a depth of flavor. The old-school butcher shop will offer high-quality, free-range meats. Think dry-aged steaks, specialty cuts and a deli case. Customers will be able to grab a beer and shop around, or snag a sandwich or burger as they hang out at the brewery. Those components also will help meet the needs of Heist’s original brewpub, from beer to food. The new facility will produce up to 4,500 barrels of beer in its first year. By comparison, Heist produced roughly 800 barrels in 2016 — all of that was served in-house. Heist will produce more sour beers and barrel-aged options. “Expect a lot more can runs,” Hogan says. Additional capacity makes it possible to build on the popular — but limited — can releases. It also will allow for some expansion with distribution to craft-centric restaurants, brewpubs and bottle shops.
