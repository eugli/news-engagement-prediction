It is more than 200 times stronger than steel and conducts electricity better than copper About 1% of graphene mixed into plastics could turn them into electrical conductors \nThe new method involves heating soybean oil in ambient air until it breaks down into \"carbon building units that are essential for the synthesis of graphene\", the CSIRO said. \nIt is then rapidly cooled on nickel foil into a thin rectangle. \nDr Han said the process is simpler and safer than existing methods, which use explosive compressed gases and vacuum processing. \nHe said under current technology, a high-quality graphene film with a 10cm (4 inches) diameter costs up to A$1000 (Â£600, $750). \nThe new method could make it \"significantly\" cheaper, he said. Image copyright CSIRO Image caption Graphene has numerous potential practical applications \nDr Han said the discovery, detailed in the journal Nature Communications , was made \"kind of by accident\". \n\"In our lab we have very strict safety rules,\" he told the BBC. \n\"We were trying to figure out if there was a safer way of making this material without using dangerous or explosive gases.\" \nAfter trial and error, the researchers found their solution. \nDr Han said his team hoped to use the material in water filters, solar panels and batteries. \nThe CSIRO-led study also involved researchers from The University of Sydney, University of Technology Sydney and The Queensland University of Technology. \nReporting by the BBC's Greg Dunlop", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:59:38.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
