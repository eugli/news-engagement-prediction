It's like gauging whether you're attracted to someone else in any other situation: You may not known which of the women is definitely it , but you certainly know which ones it's not . \nThe producers, however, are less interested in Nick's journey to find love than they are in producing an highly-rated network television show. Thus, a bargain is struck: Each week, he gets to identify the women he wants to keep, and then the producers tell him which of the other contestants he has to retain. This is how someone like Alexis the Aspiring Dolphin Trainer hangs on for so long—Nick isn't going to marry her, but she's perfectly happy to be there and makes for great TV, so there's no harm in keeping her around. \nI say this because we have reached the inflection point of this season where the dwindling supply of available roses finally means that the also-rans are out of luck. Nick canceled the episode's usual pre-rose ceremony cocktail party, explaining that he already knew which contestants he was going to eliminate, and then sent home—brace yourself, because this got brutal—Alexis, Josephine, Jaimi, Whitney, Jasmine, and Danielle L. That's half the cast deposited into limousines for tearful goodbye confessionals in the span of two hours! The last one was a bit of a surprise, because it seemed apparent every time he gazed unblinkingly at Danielle L.'s chest that he very much wanted to sleep with her. But the others? Monday night's episode was the funeral that they'd been dressing up for for the last three weeks. \nSince Nick sent home so many women, the episode provided a nice opportunity for him to workshop his breakup skills, which will only become more important as the show progresses. Let's take a look and see how he did. \nJosephine, Alexis, and Jaimi. Okay, these don't really count, since Nick got to send them home during the rose ceremony, a sanitized breakup vehicle that allows him to get away with ending things in a setting that limits the time he has to screw things up. This is not at all a bad thing: When you're ready to end a relationship, the smartest thing you can do is just say so , and... make your exit as soon as humanly possible. Don't explain yourself. Don't make excuses. Definitely don't launch into a postmortem or discuss your detailed plans for staying friends. Wish them the best, and move along. All breakups should go like this. \nJasmine. When Nick gets into trouble, of course, is whenever he has to talk . After a very psyched-out Jasmine shared that she felt she was on the chopping block, he promptly confirmed all of her worst fears by breaking up with her mid-conversation. Sure, she didn't help her case when she made a joke (?) about wanting to choke him that fell very, very flat, but Nick's breakup line, delivered with about as many hedges as you can jam into one thought, was not a great response. \nListening to you talk to me and kind of just pour your heart out and talk about how strongly you see a future, and the way you would describe it, I don't know if I feel that. [What felt like 20 minutes of silence.] As hard as it is, I feel like it might be time—the best time—to say goodbye. I've thought a lot about what you said, and you really kind of put me to it. \nNick's problem is that he spent way too much time telling someone he very obviously couldn't wait to dump just how difficult of a decision it was to dump her. This transforms an already-difficult exercise into one that insults Jasmine's intelligence, and she very pointedly called this out, telling him that he should not apologize to her when his mind was already made up. Nick, it makes total sense for you to feel bad about hurting someone's feelings. That's a good thing! But in a situation where that's unavoidable, there's no need to dwell on it. \nWhitney and Danielle L. Whitney got axed during a two-on-one elimination date with Nick and Danielle L.—an entirely expected outcome given that Whitney enjoyed something like 21 seconds of screen time this entire season. However, again, Nick managed to bungle this interaction with a spectacularly incoherent monologue that made me want to leap off the couch, tear the TV off the wall, and hurl it through my window onto the street below. \nWith you and I, I feel like, like I said, every time I'm with you you always have this amazing quality about you that, for me, always—there's this want and desire to make it great, and so, knowing how important this rose is to me, and knowing what's on the line, I feel like as much as I really want to give it to you, I feel like in my heart, I just feel like I can't. I don't know. \nShortly thereafter, our hero (?) also sent Danielle L. home, cribbing from the speech he had just used on Whitney and wearing same vacant, dead fish-eyed expression as the one on Ted Cruz's face when he endorsed Donald Trump. \nIf there was someone I wanted to be it, if there was someone I wanted to be the one , it was definitely you. I think I went into this day hoping and wanting desperately to end today just wanting to give you this rose. But I feel like in my heart, I can't. And maybe it's me, you know, the furthest I've ever gone with someone—getting engaged with someone I wanted to love, before I realized that it was maybe more the idea of something—that's the thing I feel that's holding me back. I'm sorry, and I hope I'm not screwing this all up. \nCongratulations to Nick, who discovered the one way he could have made the Jasmine interaction worse. Talking about how you want to feel a certain way about someone, but can't, is the height of condescension. It's perfectly okay to not be in love, but it's not okay to blame some poorly-described outside force for that result. Never, ever do this. This season is officially down to the ladies who have a legitimate chance at becoming one-half of a C-list celebrity couple, but after last night, unless Nick wants to end this show rejected and alone—you know, again —he's going to have to clean up his breakup bedside manner very quickly.
