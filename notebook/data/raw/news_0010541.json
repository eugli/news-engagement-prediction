He later appeared in 2014's \" Guardians of the Galaxy ,\" and then again post-credits in 2015's \" Avengers: Age of Ultron .\" \nFrom what we've seen so far, he seems like a pretty bad dude -- one who's been nefariously pulling strings for some time. In Marvel comics, he wreaks havoc by harnessing the power of Infinity Stones through his Infinity Gauntlet . \n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" will erupt in theatres around the world on 4 May 2018. The next instalment in the Marvel Comics Universe is \" Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \", out on 5 May this year. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.
