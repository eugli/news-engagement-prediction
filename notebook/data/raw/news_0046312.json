Davis was diplomatic about a rumor that he sort of was not allowed to talk about at all. \nFrom the NBA's official transcript of the news conference: Q: Anthony, you just said that, when the management is looking to acquire a new player, that you will give them your opinion. Now there are reports that the Pelicans might have talks with the Kings about a DeMarcus Cousins trade. What is your opinion on him and on the possibility of just getting him to New Orleans? Davis: He's a great player, dominant in this league, of course, with all the numbers he put up. But I haven't heard anything. So I'm going to let the management, once again, do what they do, and when the time is right, they'll come talk to me about it. Of course, DeMarcus is an elite player in this league. \nDavis and Cousins are Kentucky alumni - separated by two years - and Wildcats coach John Calipari has long made a point of building a community among his NBA-bound pupils. \nAnd by the way, that media room? A lot of stunned silence, and a lot of reporters on their phones.
