Many women - ranging from 20-somethings to those in their sixties - lavish expensive gifts on their favourite hosts, buying them diamond watches, luxury cars, even apartments. \n\"When I was 20 a customer bought me a Porsche\", said former host Sho Takami, who owns a chain of clubs and likens a host's role to that of a psychiatrist, with benefits. \n\"It's a 24-hour job\", insisted the 43-year-old after arriving for work in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. \n\"Our real work starts after hours - going for drinks with customers, crawling into bed at 9am, meeting another one for lunch\", added Takami, who is set to open a host club in Las Vegas next year. \n\"It's important the customer believes there's a chance of love. After all that's how you get her to come to the club and spend money\", Takami explained. \nHost clubs are a US$10 billion industry in Japan with some 800 venues nationwide. \nAround 260 of those are located in Tokyo, most squeezed into Kabukicho's narrow streets where flickering neon signs display the air-brushed faces of hosts outside clubs with names such as Romeo, Gatsby and Avalon. \nHosts have been compared to male geishas and Takami believes the culture, which began in the early 1970s, empowers women. \n\"A host's job is to support a lady's heart\", he said. \"We're here to encourage women's social advancement. It used to be considered a bit vulgar to party with hosts. \n\"But times have changed. These days being able to let your hair down at a host club is a mark of status or success\", he added. \nJapan's hosts, denizens of the night instantly recognisable by their spray tans, crimped long hair and tight-fitting suits, are often accused of preying on women's emotions. \n\"The customers are buying affection,\" shrugged ex-host Ken Ichijo on the terrace of his penthouse flat. \n\"We're selling them dreams, so you lie about loving them in return for serious money\", added the 38-year-old club manager, freshly blow-dried and shirt open to reveal a medallion. \n\"That leaves a bad taste for some people who think we're just ripping girls off\" . \nIchijo argues that it is simply a case of supply and demand. \n\"Hosts exist to fill a void in someone's life\", he said. \"In this business, the host is the product. We pamper to a woman's every need - listen to her problems, tell her she's beautiful, act out her fantasies.\" With harsher restrictions on opening hours, regular police checks and far less 'yakuza' gangster involvement, the host business has cleaned up its shady image in recent years. \nBut the promise of sex is still dangled as bait in a cutthroat industry, admits Ichijo, whose plush apartment screams bling. \n\"Sex is not necessarily part of a host club's service,\" he said. \"But it is part of trying to satisfy the customer's needs.\" Japan's shrinking birthrate has been blamed in part on a growing social trend known as 'herbivore men' - those who shun carnal pleasures and machismo in favour of the quiet life. \nBut libidos rage among the coiffured gigolos at the Top Dandy club, where sex worker Megumi Suzuki is a regular. \n\"Hosts are charming and they understand a woman's feelings\", purred the 27-year-old as a snake-hipped host in leather pants and winklepicker shoes lit her cigarette. \n\"I come here to blow off steam. The men are like sparkly things - I could come every day and never tire of them\" . Sign up for our e-newsletter now! Get all the latest news, lifestyle and trending stories, delivered to your inbox!
