Expectations that the revelations about Flynn’s contact with Russian officials would lead eventually to the impeachment of Trump were boosted after several Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitchell McConnell (R-Ky.), agreed on the need to deepen the probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 general election. They also agreed that Congress must investigate possible contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government during and after the general election, the Washington Post reported . \nSeveral Republican Senators have also stated, specifically, that Trump’s role in the Flynn scandal should be part of a broader investigation into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 general election by the Senate intelligence committee. \nSenator Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), for instance, hinted during an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan, that it was unlikely that Flynn would have discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador without Trump’s knowledge and approval. \nSenator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate intelligence committee, also called for full-scale investigation of the allegations that Trump and his campaign aides colluded with Russia to undermine the election process, according to CNN .

But Sensenbrenner’s words are taken to reflect growing concern among Congressional Republicans about Trump’s connections with Russia. \nWhile it is still considered unlikely that Congressional Democrats will be able to get enough Republican support to impeach Trump, newly emerging information could eventually force Republicans to cave in to calls to broaden the scope of ongoing investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 general election. 3 Members of Trump's Campaign Have Now Resigned due to Russian Ties: Manafort, Page, Flynn.

But Flynn apologized to Trump and Pence in his resignation letter for having lied to them about his contact with the Russian ambassador. Trump's refusal to dismiss Flynn, despite clear evidence that he lied about Russia scandal suggests that Flynn has something on him. pic.twitter.com/fVRpjI95t4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:30:50.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
