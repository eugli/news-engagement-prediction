EMILY FORD/FAIRFAX NZ \nSolange Francois has been giving Olivia Vu advice on work, university and life as part of the mentoring programme at Auckland Airport. \nHer role involves customer service and ensuring passengers have a seamless journey, she says. \nIt has \"surpassed her expectations\" and she says it's been a great learning experience over the past three months before she heads into a commerce and law degree. \n\"It's been really good, I've got a lot of work experience instead of sitting home and watching movies,\" Vu says. \n\"It's really different to what I imagined … every day is different and people are coming in with different challenges.\" \nVu's memorised the map of the airport in her mind, has picked up some phrases in other languages, and had to get used to rosters with 4am starts or 2am finishes. \nShe's also witnessed celebrities like English musician Sam Smith and David Attenborough arrive in New Zealand. \nThere's a lot of emotions involved at airports, she says, like the departure and arrival gates which \"pull at your heartstrings\" or travellers simply becoming overwhelmed. Ad Feedback \n\"I quite like harmony and it's very challenging when some things are out of my hands and I'm not able to help someone,\" Vu says. \n\"Sometimes I wear my heart on my shoulder when I see someone in pain. I just want them to have the easiest journey as possible.\" \nThe scholarship has also provided her a mentor in Solange Francois, who's the airport's marketing manager. \nVu and Francois catch up a few times a week to discuss work, university, and life, with both becoming friends from it. \nFrancois says it's great to see the students challenged and put out of their comfort zones which they have to adapt to quickly. \n\"It's been really good, I've really enjoyed meeting Olivia … she reminds me of what I was like when I was at that stage,\" Francois says. \nAuckland Airport's graduate scholarships are for eight Year 13 south Auckland students heading into full-time tertiary study. \nStudents receive three months' full-time employment, a laptop, and a grant of $2000 towards their first year of tertiary fees. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:47:06.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
