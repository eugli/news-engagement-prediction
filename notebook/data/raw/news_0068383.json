A significant number of the seals are below Ohau Bluff, where about 110,000 cubic metres of material fell during the quake. EMMA DANGERFIELD/FAIRFAX NZ \nDesigns for the rebuild of SH1 are still being finalised but the road may be moved further towards the coast. \nDOC northern South Island operations director Roy Grose said it had to be accepted there may be \"some mortality\" due to the roadworks once they began at Ohau Point, but it had to be put into the context of the number of seals there. \nREAD MORE: \n\"Seals are notoriously hard to relocate, and when you put in the mix that some have got pups with them, it makes it even more complex.\" DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION \nThere are about 2000 seals between Paparoa Point and Half Moon Bay, with many pups living directly below the big slips at Ohau Point. \nGrose said staff had used several hundred metres of electric fencing to control seals at work sites north of Ohau Point over the last week, and were \"pleasantly surprised\" with how well it was going. \nOther seal control options were being trialled, such as herding seals away from the sites. Grose said it could generally be done as long as it was quiet. \n\"It's not the sort of thing where you go in all guns blazing.\" \nNgai Tahu earthquake response and recovery director Robyn Wallace said fixing the road was important to Kaikoura's recovery, but should be done in a way that did not cause unnecessary risk to wildlife. Ad Feedback \n\"As mana whenua we want to see taonga species like the kekeno protected and we expect government agencies to put in appropriate provisions to protect wildlife.\" \nThe road rebuild is being run by the North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery alliance, which includes the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA), KiwiRail, and several infrastructure companies. \nA design for the road around Ohau Point is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks, which could be anything from clearing slip material away to moving the road further out towards the sea, potentially encroaching on the seals' habitat. \n\"There's been no talk about euthanasia; there's been no talk about moving mass seals,\" Grose said. \nNZTA earthquake recovery manager Steve Mutton said he did not think any seals would be euthanised due to roadworks. \n\"There have never been any plans to euthanise seals. We would never euthanise seals to build a road through there.\" \nMutton said the design would consider and protect the coastal marine area. \nThe design for Ohau Point was still emerging as the slopes were still unstable. Sluicing was continuing, and still bringing down big material. \nThe sluicing work was taking \"slightly longer\" than hoped, but it was important to get the slopes to a condition that was safe for staff to work under, Mutton said. \nSH1 is still expected to reopen before the end of the year. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:19:15.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
