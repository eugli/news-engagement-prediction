However, there was no mention of whether he would walk free in Malaysia or be turned over to law enforcement officials in Malaysia. \nAt the time of his sentencing, Justice David Humphrey ordered police to accompany Selva Kumar back to Malaysia and give police here his extensive criminal file. \nSelva Kumar was convicted at two separate trials more than two decades ago of drugging and sexually assaulting 30 women. But the hearing was told that there might have been hundreds more victims. \n“As many as 500 to 1,000 could have been attacked,” said Naima Karimullah, a lawyer for the Canada Border Services Agency. \nSelva Kumar’s criminal file appeared to be more than a foot thick. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
