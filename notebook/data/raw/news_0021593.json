Of course they want to blame it on everybody else. \n\"When they have the biggest heatwave there is no wind and when there is no wind, all of their windmills are not generating electricity. \n\"They haven't planned for that.\" \nBut Mr Weatherill said South Australians were \"not prepared to put up with being ridiculed and have the finger pointed at them by a Federal Government that has abdicated its responsibilities\". \n\"One option is to completely nationalise the system, that is an extraordinary option,\" he said. \n\"It would involve breaking contracts and exposing us to sovereign risk and the South Australian taxpayers to extraordinary sums of money. \n\"It is not a preferred option. We are ruling nothing out at this point.\" \nHe said the State Government's plans were \"well advanced\" and there would be further meetings this afternoon. \n\"What we know at the moment is that we have a national electricity market which is all about dollars and cents,\" he said. \n\"It is not about people, it is not about businesses and jobs. \n\"It is a trading system where people are trying to maximise profit and minimise cost.\" More blackouts to come \nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has since issued an Electricity Market Notice forecasting a \"lack of reserve level 2 in South Australia\". \n\"The contingency capacity reserve required is 200 MW,\" it added. \n\"The minimum reserve available is 156 MW.\" \nLoad shedding could begin from 4:00pm. \nAdelaide's expected top for Thursday is 42C, with Port Augusta, Coober Pedy, Woomera, Marree and Moomba forecast to reach 46C and Tarcoola 47C. \nLast night, as many South Australians arrived home from work and turned on their air conditioners, SA Power Networks announced it would start load shedding to cope with demand, plunging some areas into blackouts for half an hour or more, impacting about 40,000 customers. \nThirty minutes after SA Power Networks announced the outages, it tweeted the load shedding had ended. \nThe reliability of South Australia's electricity supplies has been in the spotlight after a statewide blackout in stormy weather last September , causing the Federal Coalition to criticise the state's renewables-heavy power mix. \nAnother storm in December forced the power distributor to announce compensation payments totalling $20 million to about 75,000 customers after lengthy blackouts. \nAEMO is expected to release a statement soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:25:26.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
