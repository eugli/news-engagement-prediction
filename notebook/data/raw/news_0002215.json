The president of our university sent out a similar message to us, international students, on the campus. He told us how the university will always be a place for people of different cultures to come together and engage in dialogue,“ said a student pursuing law at the University of Miami. \n\nOther institutions, like the University of Michigan and Northeastern University, too, have sent out similar mails to students who may be apprehensive about being subjected to discrimination while at university or being detained at immigration points as witnessed at several US airports over the week. \n\nAnupama Vijay, an education consultant, said: “Indians pursuing professional courses will have no issues as their student visas entitle them to a five-year optional practical training period. Only after this period does secure an H-1B visa become a concern. Their status as students in the US will be untouched by the new policy,“ she says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:31:47.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
