Petrice Tarrant/Stuff.co.nz \nLocals from in and around the South Waikato can't get enough of the treasure that is Putaruru Blue Spring. \nThe panel deemed that daytime activities would have adverse environmental effects on the wider Te Waihou area where the Blue Spring is located. The stance was supported by The Raukawa Settlement Trust. \nREAD MORE: \nHowever, approval was granted for a function centre and restaurant with opening hours from 5pm to 1am for a maximum of 120 people. FAIRFAX NZ \nPutaruru Blue Spring is one of the nation's best kept secrets according to locals who walk it frequently. \nAs was the hiring of a former woolshed for private functions between the hours of 5pm to 1am for a maximum of 60 people was also granted along with accommodation for up to 15 people in the woolshed and three adjacent cabins. \nWaite said there was no point in opening if it wasn't a cafe, because the hours they'd approved wouldn't work in the South Waikato, she said. \nShe planned to now appeal the decision and said she was dumbfounded at the decision as she was attempting to mitigate any adverse effects from the cafe by planting $3000 worth of native trees, providing toilets and rubbish facilities to stop littering from the abundance of tourists who are already visiting the spring. Petrice Tarrant \nPutaruru's Blue Spring. \nThere would also have been a opportunity for local iwi to run guided tours to teach visitors about the cultural significance, sale of Maori souvenirs, and employment for up to 12 people. \nWaite said it's never been about making money for herself, as she doesn't need it. \nShe simply wanted a community crying out for jobs to benefit from it, she said. \"I think they are anti-me because I am a blond Pakeha woman who came up with the idea when they didn't and I didn't offer them any money. \"But I have had to work hard to get to where I am and the opportunities it would create for their people would have generated a lot more money for them in the long run. LUKE KIRKEBY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nVisitor numbers are steady at the Blue Spring due to its unique waters \n\"I thought logic would have prevailed in the decision but for some reason it hasn't. What have I done wrong?\" \nSouth Waikato mayor Jenny Shattock said it was not the outcome she expected either. \n\"We did get an independent panel to hear it as we knew it was a complicated situation but to be honest I am disappointed [with the outcome],\" she said. FAIRFAX NZ \nSwimming in the Blue Spring was banned in 2016 following damage to aquatic plant life. \n\"I understand it was a split decision which shows Resource Management Act hearings are complicated and how tough the process is.\" \nShattock said the council encouragee economic development of businesses and wanted to expand in the area but she also understood the position of iwi. \n\"I do understand the issues for Maori and the impact it would have on the environment,\" she said. \nRaukawa environment group manager Grant Kettle said an increase in visitors was not wanted and Raukawa remained opposed to the application. \n\"The Waihou and Te Puna are of great cultural and environmental significance to Raukawa. The cumulative visitor numbers will exacerbate the degradation of Te Puna, the Waihou and the surrounding area,\" he said. \nKettle said generations of connection between Raukawa and Te Waihou and Te Puna has been recognised and provided for by the Crown in the form of statutory acknowledgements which made its involvement in the process appropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:04:58.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
