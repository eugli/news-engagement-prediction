In addition, a prohibited weapons ban was put in place for 10 years, and Nicholson is also undergoing counselling.\nAnimal rights supporters were quick to comment on the sentence.\n“I’m very happy he got time, and I’m very happy the judge did not listen to his whining about that he is ADHD and that’s the reason that he did this horrific thing,” said Heather Anderson, Daisy Foundation. “People who do these sorts of things to animals should be prosecuted in the highest, and I am glad to see that people are starting to realize that animals are just like us and I believe that they should be protected like we are.”\nAnderson is disappointed the ban on possessing animals was only for five years, but the judge in the case decided that was long enough given the terms of the probation.\nRelated Stories Disturbing details of fatal attack on tenant’s dog recounted during sentencing hearing Charges laid in death of dog found buried in yard Photos The dog was killed with an axe and knife and buried in the back yard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:24:22.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
