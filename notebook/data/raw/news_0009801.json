Yiannopoulos is permanently banned from Twitter due to his role in a campaign against Leslie Jones , a Saturday Night Live actress. \n“We are here to protest the presence of Milo in our campus, which is a public university, and we believe that no hate speech, racism, misogyny and transphobia should be tolerated here,” the group posted. \nAs the Daily Californian , UC-Berkeley’s newspaper, reported , at about 7:30 p.m., police started shooting tear gas into the crowd from a vantage point on the student union building. A half hour later, the protest was still going strong.

The university released a statement regarding the violent protests: \n“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the violence and unlawful behavior that was on display and deeply regret that those tactics will now overshadow the efforts to engage in legitimate and lawful protest against the performer’s presence and perspectives.” \nYiannopoulos went live on Facebook to denounce what he views as the shutting down of his free speech.
