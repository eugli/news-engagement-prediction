Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll will drive for Williams in the 2017 season Williams have launched their new car for the 2017 season, with the challenger carrying a predominantly white livery. \nThe FW-40, which also has red and blue stripes running down its centre, is wider than the 2016 car and has bigger tyres following regulation changes. \nFelipe Massa and Lance Stroll will drive for the team this season. \nMassa reversed his decision to retire at the end of last season following Valtteri Bottas' move to Mercedes. \nThe new car will take to the track for the first time during a pre-season test, which will start with Massa driving it in Barcelona on Monday, 27 February. \n\"Although cosmetically the 2017 cars will look very different to their 2016 predecessors, the core of the car, the power unit and the areas situated around the power unit, have not changed a great deal,\" Williams said in a statement.

There is no question over his motivation - he didn't really want to retire. But he gives away some performance to the best. \nAnd Lance Stroll is an unknown quantity. European Formula Three champion and bringing millions to Williams through billionaire father Lawrence, but with an awful lot to prove.
