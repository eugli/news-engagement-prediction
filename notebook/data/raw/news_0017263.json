Other Mets set to participate include Seth Lugo , Gavin Cecchini , Brandon Nimmo , Hansel Robles , Ty Kelly , Rene Rivera and T.J. Rivera , as well as a quartet of prospects yet to make their big league debuts. \n• World Baseball Classic tickets \nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 6-22. In the U.S., games will air live exclusively in English on MLB Network and on an authenticated basis via MLBNetwork.com/watch , while ESPN Deportes and WatchESPN will provide the exclusive Spanish-language coverage. MLB.TV Premium subscribers in the U.S. will have access to watch every tournament game live on any of the streaming service's 400-plus supported devices. Internationally, the tournament will be distributed across all forms of television, internet, mobile and radio in territories excluding the U.S., Puerto Rico and Japan. Get tickets for games at Marlins Park, Tokyo Dome, Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, Estadio Charros de Jalisco in Mexico, Petco Park, as well as the Championship Round at Dodger Stadium, while complete coverage -- including schedules, video, stats and gear -- is available at WorldBaseballClassic.com . \nThe brightest Mets stars set to compete are Familia and Reyes, who will both play for their native Dominican Republic. Reyes is no stranger to the World Baseball Classic, having appeared in all three previous versions of the tournament. Familia is a first-timer, trying to help the Dominican team defend its 2013 title. \n• Rules for 2017 WBC \nThe Mets will watch Familia's workload in particular, considering their closer's 230 regular-season appearances and 233 innings over the past three seasons. Familia may miss time at the beginning of this season to serve a suspension in accordance with MLB's domestic abuse policy, though the league has not yet announced anything to that end.
