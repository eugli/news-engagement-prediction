DeMarcus Cousins. (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:25 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:25 p.m. ET \nIf last night's trade of DeMarcus Cousins made some Kings fans want to bury their heads in a pillow, Sacramento general manager Vlade Divac's press conference probably didn't help matters. \nDivac acknowledged on Monday afternoon that he received a stronger proposal two days before he eventually dealt Cousins , but that the offer was off the table by Sunday. \n\"I had a better deal two days ago,\" Divac said. \"Talk to those agents. I don't want to go into details. I don't want to discuss about the process. It was a big process for us.\" Yep, Vlade actually said this. pic.twitter.com/CEW7aynAZ2 â€” Dieter Kurtenbach (@dkurtenbach) February 20, 2017 \nThe Kings eventually settled for a package of Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, and 2017 first and second round picks. The Kings also shipped out forward Omri Casspi. \nThe acknowledgment that the Kings had a better offer is a shocking one. \nWhile Divac insinuated the offer was taken off the table, you'd think that Sacramento would be a little less rash in trading their superstar with five days still remaining until the NBA trade deadline, rather than settling for what many believe to be a failure of a haul for an All-Star center.
