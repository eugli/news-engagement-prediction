There's a reason we didn't use it again. It really is the song I skip past” Radiohead John: Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Montclair Film Festival Thom: Photo by Bob Berg/Getty Images \nComedian John Oliver is the latest cover star of Rolling Stone . In an in-depth interview , he discusses the Trump presidency, fatherhood, and more. In one instance, Oliver is asked about the “ Make Donald Drumpf Again ” segment from February 2016, where he tracks down the then-candidate’s ancestral name. The bit went viral, but it didn’t take long for Oliver to become sick of it. “That joke became old for us very quickly. There's a reason we didn't use it again,” he said. “It really is the song I skip past. It's 'Creep.' It's a good song, Thom Yorke! It was a good song when he wrote it.” \nRadiohead , of course, don’t entirely share that view. The band performed their (in)famous Pablo Honey single on the road multiple times last year, after leaving it out of their setlists for 7 years.
