Emma and Dermot host rival shows The Voice and The X Factor \nThe couple have a second son Elias, who is one. \nA source said: “It is a delicate situation due to the nature of Noah’s illness. No pressure was ever put on Michael to fulfil his obligations. \n“He will always be welcome at the BRITs but it’s important that he is with his family. It would not look good to be singing and dancing on stage while his son is so ill.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:19:41.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
