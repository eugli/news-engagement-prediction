So right now, we're building 3 VR games. And what we can do now is to be designing hardware at the same time that we're designing software. This is something that Miyamoto has always had, right?\" \nNewell continued: \"[Miyamoto] has had the ability to think about what the input devices & the design of systems should be like while he's trying to design games. Our sense is that that's going to allow us to actually build much better entertainment experiences for people.\" \n\"So the idea isn't like oh - we suddenly thought we could make more money by building hardware - because hardware's actually traditionally been a lousy low-margin business.\" \nNewell & team did later confirm to Gamasutra that these were not smaller experiments, but intended to be new game titles, as opposed to the vignette-style demonstrations shown in Valve's The Lab . \nGamasutra was present at multiple panels as part of this briefing, and will be posting more detailed stories on Valve's current strategy and work from Newell & colleagues in the near future.
