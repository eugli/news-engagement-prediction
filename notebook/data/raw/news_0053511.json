That only a few months later Sacramento is ready to move on is a telling sign of the signing being a failure from general manager Vlade Divac. \nBarnes has played in 54 of the Kings' 57 games, standing as consistent piece in head coach Dave Joerger's rotation. Joerger previously coached Barnes with the Memphis Grizzlies and was highly complimentary of his leadership. \nLeadership doesn't account for poor performance, and 36-year-old Matt Barnes is having one of his worst seasons. He's averaging 7.6 points in 25.3 minutes per game on 38.4 percent shooting. \nBarnes also has pending misdemeanor charges in New York following an altercation at a club last December. \nThe Kings getting a host of wing players back in their trade with the New Orleans Pelicans, including Buddy Hield and Tyreke Evans, ultimately make Barnes expendable. \nBarnes has become a journeyman after spending five combined seasons in Los Angeles with both the Lakers and Clippers, now moving on from his third team in as many seasons. \nThe good news for Barnes is that, even if he's waived by the Kings, he's still in line to collect the $6.4 million he's owed for the '17-18 season. \nBeing paid to not play on a team in the midst of a massive rebuild isn't the worst silver lining. \nDo you think another team will pick Barnes up, or is the veteran swingman going to have a hard time finding a new home?
