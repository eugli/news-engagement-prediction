Picture: Ethan Miller/Getty Images Man wants fiancee to get ‘wife lessons’ before he will agree to marry her Rebecca Sullivan, news.com.au February 2, 2017 2:13pm \nIF YOU thought Dr Phil couldn’t find a guest more out of touch with reality than 13-year-old Danielle Ann, aka the ‘Cash Me Outside’ girl, you were wrong. (Don’t know who the Cash Me Outside girl is? Watch this , then read this ). \nThis week’s episode features an engaged couple, Josh and Rebecca, who have been together for more than two years. They have an 18-month old daughter together, and another one on the way. \nBut Josh has a bit of a problem. He doesn’t think Rebecca is “wife material”, which is kind of problematic seeing as he proposed to her and knocked her up — twice. \nThe couple appeared on Tuesday’s episode of Dr Phil to work through their issues, but things didn’t really go to plan. \nThe first alarm bells go off when Rebecca says, “Josh makes me feel bad about myself because I don’t do things his way. He requires me to check in with him before leaving. I feel like a prisoner in my own home.” Awful, right? media_camera Just stop speaking, please. \nThe second alarm bell sounds a big old ring-a-ding-ding when Josh responds: “I don’t set the boundaries, I suggest the boundaries.” But wait. It gets worse. \nJosh then goes on to explain his fiancee’s appeal and gives Rebecca possibly the worse backhanded compliment ever. \n“I love Rebecca. She’s a beautiful woman. I love her size — her height, she’s perfectly proportioned. She’s a strong gal. She can pick up two bags of potatoes instead of one,” Josh said. \n“I wanted Rebecca to have my babies because she’s a very healthy gal. I wanted my daughter to look and be built by Rebecca. Physically, Rebecca is the perfect woman. Mentally, she is not. \nOnce Rebecca learns to be a better wife and mother, I think the sky’s the limit.” \nJosh wants Rebecca to attend “wife lessons” and to start thinking like him. \n“He always makes me feel like I’m doing the wrong thing. He yells at me when I want to do things for myself. Josh makes me feel bad about myself because I don’t do things his way. Josh thinks I should have a cooking schedule, he tells me how to clean,” Rebecca said, while also calling her fiance a “controlling narcissist”. media_camera Girl, you need to get out immediately. \nJosh says he prefers traditional relationship roles, with him as the breadwinner and Rebecca as the housekeeper. \n“The house has got to be clean. It’s got to be deep cleaned and it’s got to be cleaned by you,” he said. \n“I am the breadwinner. When I get home from work, I would love a meal. She’s got ample time to organise a feeding schedule for a family. She doesn’t even make a grocery list. She thinks I’m controlling because I tell her she has to do her job. She has to pick up. She has to do her share. \nMaybe her ‘me time’ should be out grocery shopping.” \nDr Phil tries to plough through this mess and get Josh to demonstrate an ounce of self reflection and compassion, but he gets nowhere. \nBy the end of the episode, Josh is asking Rebecca for a separation. And thank goodness really. Rebecca, I’ve got three words for you: Get out now . \nIf you want to make yourself really angry, you can watch the whole episode below: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:28:57.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
