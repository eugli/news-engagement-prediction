Montgomery County property records LexisNexis is seeking someone to sublease one of its Miami Township campus buildings, in a sign that the company is continuing to condense its operations at its local headquarters. The international research and risk management company, with its world headquarters in Miami Township, recently listed an 80,000-square-foot building as available for sublease, which is one of six office buildings at its North Springboro Pike campus. LexisNexis lists one of its six campus buildings as available for sublease. Montgomery County property records \"We routinely review our real estate and facilities requirements in order to identify what’s needed to optimally support customers and improve business operations. As a part of this process, we’ve made the decision to vacate an underutilized office building on the LexisNexis Miamisburg campus,\" the company said in a statement. Employees from the vacated building will move to existing buildings on the Miami Township campus, the company stated. LexisNexis has shed hundreds of employees at its headquarters in recent years, with employment at 3,000 as of last year, down from 3,600 employees reported in 2013, according to the DBJ Book of Lists. The company, founded in 1973 in Dayton, has 10,000 employees in total. LexisNexis has two divisions: Legal & Professional, which employs thousands in the Dayton region; and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which is headquartered in Georgia. The listing by Doug Altemuehle and Darin Armbruster, of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, advertises that a tenant or tenants are sought to sublease the space until the end of 2019. The campus sits along Interstate 75, just south of the Interstate 675 interchange and near Austin Landing.
