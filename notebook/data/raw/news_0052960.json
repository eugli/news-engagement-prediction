One Nation name still on tickets \nThe candidates will now run as independents, but as the disendorsement occurred after nominations to the WA Electoral Commission closed, the pair will continue to appear on the Lower House tickets under the Pauline Hanson One Nation banner. \nOnce nominations close there is no provision under the Electoral Act to remove a candidate's name, or the name of the party which endorsed them. \nPolitical analyst Peter Kennedy said it was an unusual situation. \n\"Once the nominations close the candidates names are locked in on the ballot paper and it's very rare for this sort of thing to happen,\" he said. \n\"In this case I suspect it won't create a huge problem because in one sense the party's name's already on the ballot paper next to the candidates, and that's what people will see when they come to vote,\" he said. \n\"One Nation thrives on controversy and the decision to disendorse the two candidates just a couple of weeks out from the poll just adds to the controversy. \n\"One Nation becomes better known and so do the candidates, it might even boost their votes.\" \nMs Baraiolo could not be reached for comment.
