Other emails revealed contemptous remarks by staff - including the “the strategy of how we coped with the Titcombe attacks.”\nAfter he asked the NMC to be more open, the watchdog revealed that it already had spent £239,871.85 on advice from lawyers about how to answer his questions.\nLast night he said: “I just couldn’t believe such a gross misuse of of resources, and all in an attempt to maintain secrecy. It’s horrific.”\nAn NMC spokesperson said: “We receive hundreds of FOI and DPA requests every year with the vast majority of these requests being dealt with in-house by the NMC, like all public bodies we have a duty to respond to requests as fully and as timely as we can. Each request is assessed individually and in this case, due to the size of the request, it was decided that it would be more appropriate and cost effective to get some support. This request involved information relating to multiple fitness to practise cases over a long period of time and each document needed to be read to ensure that we did not disclose any personal data relating to other individuals. We did not have the internal capacity required to respond to Mr Titcombe, which is why we had to take the decision to get help from an external company.\n“We engaged an external company to help ensure that we met our obligations fully in an open and transparent way. Handling the request in this way has incurred a significant cost to the NMC, however, we believe that the approach taken was the best way of ensuring a full response.\n“As part of this process the NMC provided a significant number of documents to Mr Titcombe. Within these documents there were a small number of cases where staff should have worded their communication more carefully and we apologise to Mr Titcombe for this.\n“The investigation into the tragic events at University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust has been lengthy, complex, and has involved multiple agencies and individuals. These cases have taken far too long, which we regret and we have apologised for. We have committed to carrying out an independent review to identify learning in order to see where we could do things differently should a similar situation arise now. We have been in contact with the families involved and asked them to share their experiences with us as part of this review.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:14:10.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
