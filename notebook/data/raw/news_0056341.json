The latest dump of new info comes courtesy of VentureBeat ’s Evan Blass, who posted the S8+ spec sheet on Twitter this afternoon . The thing that should pop out is the monstrous 6.2-inch display size. Due to the S8’s rumored design, which drops physical buttons in favor of drastically reduced bezels, the phone may not be much larger than the Galaxy Note 7, which packed a 5.7-inch display into a 6.04-inch-tall device. Prior leaks containing photos of the device back up the idea that the S8 will pack an edge-to-edge display that allows for a drastic increase in screen real estate while retaining a relatively compact form.

Impress your friends, confound your enemies...with knowledge. pic.twitter.com/lHrHge8BUa — Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 22, 2017 It’s unclear exactly how the S8+ will differ from the standard S8. Earlier leaks suggest the standard model may come with just a 5.7-inch display, while both could carry a Snapdragon 835 processor, a 12-megapixel rear camera, and a 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The spec sheet does indicate that the S8+ will have rounded corners on the display, an iris scanner for biometric authentication, 64GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and Samsung’s now-standard dust and water-resistant features.
