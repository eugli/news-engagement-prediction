The Argentine star scored both goals, including a 90th minute penalty, as Barca struggled against modest opposition in front of their own fans. The uninspiring performance did little to assuage the fears of their supporters as the fallout continues from their 4-0 hammering by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in midweek. Luis Enrique urges his team on during their 2-1 win over Leganes on Sunday night The Barcelona coach hit out at the home fans for their jeers and whistles during the game Though Messi had given his side the perfect start by opening the scoring after four minutes, they failed to kick on and were brought level when Unai Lopez found the back of the net in second-half.
