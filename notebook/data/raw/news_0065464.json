Motion 37, expected to pass Thursday with the support of all parties, was first tabled last December, and made more urgent after the subsequent mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec, said Des Rosiers.\n“I decided to table this motion as one of my first gestures as a new MPP, partly because in my riding of Ottawa-Vanier, I had the occasion to hear many of the members of the Muslim community who confided in me about the way in which they had suffered different incidents of racism,” said Des Rosiers, who won a byelection last November. \nThose incidents included girls who were spit on for wearing a head scarf or hijab, graffiti on an Islamic school, and adults denied employment because they are Muslim.\nAttorney-General Yasir Naqvi said after last month’s shooting at a Quebec mosque, his constituency office in Ottawa Centre received a call from a Muslim man wondering if it was safe to send his son to school. \nArticle Continued Below “That’s fear,” he told reporters at Queen’s Park. “The staff in my office cried to hear that. That’s not the society we live in; that’s not the society we are building. Parents should not be fearful for a nanosecond whether they should send their children to school, because of their faith.”\nWhile politicians in Ottawa argue over a similar motion and the use of the term Islamophobia, Yaqvi, who is Muslim, said “the tone of the debate is very different in our legislature. I’m proud of that, that we are all standing together.”\n“As a Muslim, as a father, and most importantly as a Canadian, I feel very strongly that we make a statement against all forms of hatred and racism and, in this instance, in particular about Islamophobia,” he also said.\nDes Rosiers said she has heard from people who support her motion, those who wonder why one group is being singled out, and those making offensive or racist comments. \nImmigration Minister Laura Albanese said while more needs to be done, “it starts with standing up for a province where people speak over 200 languages, and that come from over 200 different countries.”\nProgressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown supports the motion. But federally, the issue has divided Conservatives, with some opposing a similar statement because it doesn’t define what Islamophobia is, arguing that may hinder the right to free expression.\nDes Rosiers’ motion will be debated and voted on Thursday afternoon. It reads: In the opinion of this House, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario should reaffirm that diversity has always played an important part in Ontario's culture and heritage; recognize the significant contributions Muslims have made, and continue to make, to Ontario's cultural and social fabric and prosperity; stand against all forms of hatred, hostility, prejudice, racism and intolerance; rebuke the notable growing tide of anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiments; denounce hate-attacks, threats of violence and hate crimes against people of the Muslim faith; condemn all forms of Islamophobia and reaffirm its support for government's efforts, through the Anti-Racism Directorate, to address and prevent systemic racism across government policy, programs and services, and increase anti-racism education and awareness, including Islamophobia, in all parts of the province.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:16:12.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
