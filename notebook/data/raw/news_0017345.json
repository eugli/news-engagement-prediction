The fight pits the top two contenders in the division up against one another as current champion Conor McGregor awaits the birth of his first child (/chases down a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather Jr.) and the winner should be set up for a shot at the real title later in the year. But don’t tell Ferguson that. Though his fight with Nurmagomedov is only for an interim championship, “El Cucuy” believes this fight will determine who the real lightweight champion is, and in a recent interview with Submission Radio , Ferguson went off on the current lightweight champion. \"Well either way, [Nurmagomedov and I are] the toughest sons of b**ches in the division right now, because money made McNugget soft and we all know that” said Ferguson. “That dude, he wants to call himself the ghost, but he’s gonna fade like a ghost cause he’s a f**king buster. Straight up, dude. That dude’s fake as f**k. So regardless of what he decides to do, it’s what myself or Khabib decide to do with the belt. “[McGregor], he’s trying to quit. He’s trying to look for excuses on his way out. He doesn’t want to f**king be in a man’s division. He might as well try to cut to 145 and lost that belt. Now he’s got a bulls**t and try to make excuses for the 155-pound belt. But when one of us has that belt - which is gonna be me - then he’s gonna a hard as f**k time trying to go on his way to victory. Because when you’re facing the boogeyman, you’re facing something kind of different. And both these guys don’t f**king get it. I don’t care who you have around you or who’s holding you back from throwing chairs and water bottles, when you’re locked inside that octagon with me, ain’t nothing gonna hold me back from getting you besides that referee. So I don’t care what belt he’s got. Straight up, I don’t care what belt is in my hands, that will be the real belt no matter what.” This isn’t the first time Ferguson has taken shots at McGregor. Earlier this week, Ferguson responded to a post McGregor made on social media calling himself the ghost, trashing the champion for being “soft.” Ferguson explained he spoke out because he believed McGregor was taking a shot at his “El Cucuy” moniker. \"I got tagged in it. Somebody was like, ‘the only ghost that we know is El Cucuy, well he’s trying to jack your style, dude’. Come on dude, you’re really trying to pay attention to me that much by trying to jock my style? Dude, go play somewhere else. I told you, you have a pass from me. Wait till your kid is born, go enjoy your time. But you want to keep poking your nose at me and try to jack my style, jock my shit, try to rack up some points by being cool – f**king go do that somewhere else, dude. We’re real fighters over here. You ain’t no ghost. The only ghost you are is you’re gonna fade out. That’s why I call him a buster.” Regardless of his beliefs, even if Ferguson beats Nurmagoemdov he won’t be the champion of the world until he beats McGregor, which may be a tough fight to wrangle as McGregor chases more profitable fish in the boxing seas. If McGregor does choose to do that though, Ferguson says he’s fine with it. He’s more concerned with facing the best competition, and right now Nurmagomedov is the only one man who fits that bill. “Mayweather is gonna knock his ass out. Mayweather’s too much for him and he already knows that s**t too and the rest of the boxing world knows that. I know who to put my money on in that one. But the real fight that everyone wants to see – and who doesn’t know who to put their money on – would be the McGregor/Ferguson fight. Why? Cause I’m gonna smash that fool. I’m gonna submit him. You already saw him being submitted. That dude tapped before he even got the choke locked in. So I don’t know, man. I don’t even know if I would want to waste my time on that kind of dude. He doesn’t meet my fight standards. The only dude right now that meets it is Khabib.” Ferguson will get his chance at UFC 209 in Las Vegas, Nev. MUST-READ STORIES Call in.
