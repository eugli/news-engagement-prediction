Members Sign In Colbert apologizes to ISIS for being unseated by Trump as ‘the enemy of the American people’ By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. The Washington Post February 21, 2017 \nTo become the top threat to the United States, the Islamic State has engaged in years of brutality, beheadings and propaganda - manifesting an American nightmare scenario. \nBut as of last week, all that is good for is second place on the list of U.S. enemies, according to ‘‘Late Show’’ host Stephen Colbert. Advertisement \nThe change is due to a tweet - a presidential tweet, but still a tweet. \nLast week, President Trump declared the U.S. news media the ‘‘enemy of the American people.’’ And he called out a few names that he considered particularly egregious: the New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CNN and CBS.

If you want to get on the list, you’ve got to publish photos of Trump’s inauguration crowd. Then he’ll be really, really angry at you. So sad. Hidden victims.’’ \nTrump tweeted: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nColbert’s joke underscores a larger point: Trump has had strong words for the Islamic State, but, of late, his strongest words have been for the media. He has been battling them since he was on the campaign trail, even banning several news organizations, including The Washington Post, from campaign events.

He’s called reporters ‘‘among the most dishonest human beings on earth.’’ Earlier this month, he speculated that the media was covering up terrorist attacks. \nOf course, members of the media have responded, saying they’re not too fond of Trump’s tactics, either. \n‘‘Trump’s attacks on the American press as ‘enemies of the American people’ are more treacherous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press,’’ former Post reporter Carl Bernstein told CNN. Trump’s comments are reminiscent of ‘‘dictators and authoritarians, including Stalin, including Hitler.’’ \nIn an editorial, the New York Times said ‘‘the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.’’ \nIt’s unclear what tactic Trump intends to use to thwart the United States’ new No. 1 enemy, although Colbert pointed out that within days of declaring the media the country’s enemy, Trump announced a new national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. \n‘‘I swear to do everything in my power to protect the nation from America’s enemies, which I am being told are CBS and the failing New York Times,’’ Colbert said, mocking McMaster’s introductory remarks. ‘‘Wow, things have really changed since I was in the Army five minutes ago.’’ You're reading 1 of 5 free articles.
