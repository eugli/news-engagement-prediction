But he doesn’t believe it’s right that the Warriors had four players selected, when the Spurs — who are 41-13 and trail Golden State by five games for the best record in the league — are sending only Leonard to New Orleans. “I’m older, so I’m not going to come home and be mad or anything,” Aldridge, 31, told The Vertical . “But I do think that it was wrong for Golden State to have four [All-Stars] and we’re a few games behind and only have one. It is what it is. I’m in this position and I’m going to enjoy my break and just come back fresh.” \nAldridge is planning on spending the All-Star break in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, so he’s not going to fret about missing a weekend’s worth of obligations. But it’s clear he’d like to see his Spurs teammates get a little more respect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:20:53.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
