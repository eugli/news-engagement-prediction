Bukaty/Associated Press/File 2011 Roxanne Quimby, the founder of Burt's Bees, through her foundation, donated 87,000 acres to the federal government for the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine's North Woods. By Associated Press February 23, 2017 \nPORTLAND, Maine — The governor has asked Republican President Donald Trump to undo Democratic former President Barack Obama’s designation of a national monument and give back the land that was donated for it. \nRepublican Governor Paul LePage asked Trump to take the unprecedented step of returning land in the northern part of the state to private ownership in a Feb. 14 letter. Advertisement \nBurt’s Bees cofounder Roxanne Quimby’s foundation last August donated 87,000 acres to the federal government for the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine’s North Woods. Burt’s Bees is a personal care products company that calls itself ‘‘Earth friendly’’ and says it has a triple bottom line: people, profit, planet. \nLePage said if the land remains a federal monument the state should manage it to avoid economic damage and protect traditional recreational use of it. He said he hopes Trump will create jobs and ‘‘make the Maine woods great again.’’ Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

But supporters, including local businesses and environmental groups, have said the appeal of a national monument would help revitalize a struggling though lovely rural area. ‘Is there a more glorious place on earth than this?’ \nThe governor said he’s hopeful Trump will heed opponents of the monument in Maine’s Second Congressional District, which sent Trump an electoral college vote in the November election. It was unclear what Trump planned to do, if anything. \nRepublican US Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday during a Maine Public Radio interview that it’s a ‘‘real legal question’’ whether Trump can undo the designation.
