His party is small,\" he said, without elaborating on what he meant by DAP being \"small\". \nNajib had previously said that Lim was Pakatan Harapan's de facto leader and that he \"calls the shots\" in the coalition. \nDr Mahathir in his speech at a meeting with Balik Pulau residents at Dataran Muafakat MBPP on Saturday also apologised to the people for having backed Najib to succeed Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as prime minister. \nDr Mahathir, who was at helm of the country for 22 years, also urged voters to utilise their voting power wisely. \nHe expressed sadness for asking the people not to support Umno as he had once been the party president. \n\"Umno is no longer the same party as before,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:00:05.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
