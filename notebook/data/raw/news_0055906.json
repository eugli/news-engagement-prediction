You might have seen your father talking about finances and saving money, but are you aware that your mother also has been keeping some money aside – possibly every month – in a bid to meet any financial emergency in the future?\nTrue, it’s not only fathers who save money but mothers also do so. Yes, that may be a small amount as compared to fathers’ savings, but then they also save in one way or the other. The only difference is that fathers save their money in insurance and bank accounts while mothers keep their savings either at home or in a locker. Eventually, do their savings make them super rich or just rich? Let’s check it out:\nSuppose mothers are saving Rs 5000 per month for 10 years and keeping the money in their lockers or simply at home. In that case the total savings made by them at the end of the 10th year will be only Rs 6 lakh.\nOn the other hand, fathers are saving Rs 5000 a month in a bank account where the assumed rate of return is 4% (almost all banks are providing the same return irrespective of adhering to certain clauses). If they are saving this amount for the last 10 years, that means they also saved Rs 6 lakh, which by the end of 10th year will become approximately Rs 7.38 lakh. In this way, fathers tend to save approximately a lakh rupees more than mothers.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:48:55.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
