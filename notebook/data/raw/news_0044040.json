But I'm not playing games, I'm serious with what I'm doing.\" \nLondon 2012 Olympic champion Joshua has taken the division by storm since turning professional, winning all 18 of his fights inside the distance. \nThe fight is expected to draw the biggest British boxing crowd in nearly 80 years, with an attendance of 90,000 set to watch at Wembley. \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford) Next In Sports News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:48:42.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
