'However, I am not prepared for staff to face this at the end of a school day and for my pupils to witness this behaviour.' From Monday, parents and carers have been asked to wait in designated parent zones to ensure the safety of pupils at the end of the day. If parents do not behave in the correct manner, they have been told they could be issued with a warning that could prevent them from entering school grounds. A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: 'Inappropriate behaviour towards staff is unacceptable, will not be tolerated and action will be taken to set a good example to our children and young people.' Susan Quinn, local association secretary at the Educational Institute of Scotland, said: 'Generally, teachers will work as hard as they can to promote good relationships with parents and carers. It would be an unusual situation when that becomes broken down.' Scottish Tory education spokesman Liz Smith said: 'It is very disappointing to see the breakdown in this relationship but the safety of all individuals has to be paramount. 'Ultimately, it's the school's decision as to how much access parents are granted to staff, but I am sure everyone is wanting to bridge the communication gap as quickly as possible.' The move received online support from local residents. Walter Brown commented: 'What chance have children got when the parents can't behave at school?' Eileen Prior of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council said: 'We have been assured that the letter does not mean parents cannot speak to teachers but the school wants discussions and updates to take place at the right time and place.'
