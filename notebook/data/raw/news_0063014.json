The hardest working nation? Jeremy Clarkson, take note Credit: GaudiLab Oliver Smith , Digital Travel Editor 24 February 2017 • 9:40am \nI t's Work Your Proper Hours Day , an initiative aimed at the five million people in Britain who regularly do unpaid overtime, giving their employers £31.5 billion of free work each year. The website exclaims: \"Take a proper lunchbreak and leave work on time to enjoy your Friday evening – you deserve it!\" Quite right. \nBut are British workers more likely to stay late in the office than their foreign counterparts? Which nationalities work the longest hours – and which the shortest? \nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we're actually relatively fortunate. The average Briton works 1,674 hours a year, according to its data for 2015 – or the equivalent of 32.2 hours per week. Mexico ranks number one, according to the OECD Credit: ALAMY \nThat compares favourably with most of the other 37 countries for which is has statistics. The hardest working country of all? Contrary to what Jeremy Clarkson would have you believe , it's Mexico, according to the OECD. The average citizen of the Central American country works 2,246 hours a year, or 43.2 hours a week. \nIn second place is Costa Rica, often described as the world's happiest country ; South Korea, Greece and Chile complete the top five. Germany's workers toil for the fewest hours Credit: Sean Pavone 2016 \nAt the other end of the table is Germany, a nation stereotypically associated with efficiency. The average German works just 1,371 hours a year – or 26.4 hours a week. Also enjoying plenty of downtime are citizens of The Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and France.
