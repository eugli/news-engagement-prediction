The Hall will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the episode on May 27 during Hall of Fame Classic Weekend. Festivities will include appearances by Wade Boggs and Ozzie Smith — both of whom guest-starred in the episode — at a discussion featuring members of The Simpsons team who put the episode together. And Homer will finally join three of his Hall of Fame teammates — Boggs, Smith and Ken Griffey Jr. — and take his rightful place in Cooperstown. The Hall will open a Simpsons-themed display and “induct” Homer. \nI absolutely, positively LOVE this move. For one, this is probably my favorite episode of The Simpsons. Yeah I know that’s like picking your favorite child (if you had a million kids but they started to suck after 11 years or so). But I think this jusssst tops Scorpio, Lisa The Vegetarian, Cape Feare, A Fish Called Selma, and a slew of others. Fantastic sports cameos/references and writing that was popping on all cylinders. I mean just look at this picture. \nComedic fucking gold. Ken Griffey’s huge ass head. Roger Clemens clucking his dick off. Mike Scioscia ready to keel over and die. Steve Sax handcuffed for every unsolved crime in New York. It’s mind blowing shit that this is the same show that is still on television today. \nIn fact I’m surprised it took so long for this to get inducted to the Hall of Fame. I know even Babe Ruth didn’t get in unanimously, but you cannot tell the the story of baseball without Homer At The Bat in the middle of upstate New York. I guess the same thing goes for Pete Rose, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and a shitload of other players. But the point still stands. \nHowever the best part about this is when Pete Rose finds out that Homer Simpson made the Hall of Fame before him. I needed to see his reaction when he found out. I kinda wish they had saved this news for the postseason so Pete could go crazy as A-Rod subtly chirps him in the background. \nGreatest remix ever? Greatest remix ever.
