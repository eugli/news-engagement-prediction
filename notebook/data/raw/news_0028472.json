That's the essence of this debate. \n“And the bottom line is the president's powers, in this area, represent the apex of executive authority.”\nO n NBC News, he continued to vigorously assert his boss’s point of view, arguing: “We've heard a lot of talk about how all the branches of government are equal.

Great job!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 12 February 2017 M r Trump was evidently impressed by his debut, tweeting: “Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!”\nThe president has promised to fight on, with the next steps possibly announced as early as Monday.\nHe has four options, including returning to the lower courts; asking the full Ninth Circuit, the appeals court which upheld the block on the ban, to hear an appeal; taking it to the Supreme Court; or scrapping the existing executive order and writing another one.\nThe attorney general for Washington state, Bob Ferguson, who sparked Judge Robart’s halting of the ban , also vowed to fight on, saying on Sunday he will use every tool at his disposal to ensure that Mr Trump upholds the constitution.\n“My job as attorney general is to uphold the rule of law in this country,” he said.\n“And I’ll use every tool that I have as attorney general to make sure that the president follows that Constitution.\n“Four federal judges have looked at this case, two appointed by Republican presidents, two appointed by Democrats. All four have complete and utterly rejected the president's arguments in this case, and we anticipate winning as we move forward.”\nBut, flying back to Washington on Sunday night after a weekend hosting Japan’s prime minister in Florida, the travel ban is not the only pressing issue for him to deal with his.\nHis national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is under intense scrutiny following the revelation on Friday that he discussed lifting of sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador prior to Mr Trump taking power.\nMiller won't say if Trump still has confidence in Flynn — WH “did not give me anything to say ... sensitive matter” pic.twitter.com/9DUlKTBR6K \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) 12 February 2017 M r Flynn initially insisted he never talked about sanctions – and was backed up on television by Mike Pence, the vice president.\nMr Flynn now concedes that he has no recollection of discussing sanctions . Mr Pence says he was only relaying what Mr Flynn told him.\nOn Sunday Mr Miller could not reassure Mr Flynn that his job was safe. \n“I don't have any news to make you today on this point,” he would only say. \n“That's a great question for our chief of staff, that's a great question for the office of the vice president.\n“I don't have any information to change anything that has previously already been said by the White House on this matter.”\nTimeline | Donald Trumps travel ban", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:43:26.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
