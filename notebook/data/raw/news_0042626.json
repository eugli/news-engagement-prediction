However, the application will soon expand its functionality to a wider range of products, which might boost its appeal among users.At the moment, Samsung Flow allows Galaxy Tab Pro S users to unlock their tablet with a compatible Galaxy smartphone's fingerprint scanner. Here are the supported smartphones confirmed by Samsung: Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge , Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy A5 (2016), and Galaxy A7 (2016) .The good news is Samsung plans to add support for all Windows 10 PCs, which will enable users to unlock their devices with any of the compatible Galaxy smartphones listed above.The South Korean company confirmed, in reply to a Samsung Flow user, that a major update could be released in early April, which will bring support for all Windows 10 PCs. Samsung Flow does more than allowing users to unlock their Windows 10 devices by scanning their fingerprints. For example, you can transfer content and activity between different devices, as well as enable your mobile hotspot to keep the PC connected, and check and reply directly to your phone's notifications.All these features can only be used after registering at least one fingerprint on the Galaxy smartphone , which is why Samsung Flow is limited to handsets that include this piece of hardware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:59:50.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
