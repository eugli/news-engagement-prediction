AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala (TOI pic by C Suresh Kumar) CHENNAI: AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala may be a few days away from taking charge as the Tamil Nadu chief minister, but public dissent against the move is writ large in the virtual world. An petition started late on Sunday evening on online platform Change.org against Sasikala has garnered close to 19,000 signatures-- with 10,000 being added within a span of 15 minutes. Reasons for signing the petition included the choicest abuse, digging out skeletons that have for long been in the Mannargudi family's backyard and questions over Sasikala's eligibility to lead the state. But the message is clear. People want present chief minister O Panneerselvam to continue to keep the seat warm or elections be held again. \"Please respect democracy. The people of Tamil Nadu want reelection,\" said Kevin Jacob, one of the petitioners in Change.org. \"She doesn't deserve it. This is against people's will,\" said Kamala Sankari, another petitioner. The petition will be submitted to Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, the President and the chief election commissioner. The public also took to Twitter and Facebook to register their protest against Sasikala taking charge. \"We voted for J Jayalalithaa , not her aide. We voted for a government, not a corrupt family. If this happens, RIP Democracy,\" said the status message of a law student in Chennai. Sasikala was on Sunday unanimously elected legislature party leader by MLAs at an AIADMK party meeting, paving the way for her to become the chief minister. The swearing in is likely to take place on Thursday.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:23:44.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
