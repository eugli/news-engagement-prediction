[In the book], I talk about taking a pill and stuff like that, which I did. If you really read it, I only say I got drunk, I got high and I talk about myself. He was there.” \n\nThe reality star also shared when she had enough of Peter’s player ways, saying Tara becoming pregnant while they were married was the last straw. \n“When he had the baby on me [while we were married] and I had just gone through the termination, from that moment on … I still didn’t leave right away, but it was completely broken.” \nCredit: Instagram \nShe continued, “Really from that moment on, it was over with….I’m making the choice NOT to go back because he still asks me all the time to move back to New York.” \nWhen asked why Peter has such a problem with infidelity, Amina speculated, “In general, he just lives in the moment. He just does not plan for the future.” \nCredit: Getty \nMany fans believe Peter’s sex game must be the reason neither Amina nor Tara can completely let him go. \nThe 33-year-old acknowledged these claims, saying her first time with Peter was special, but not the reason she stayed for so long. \nCredit: VH1 \n“It’s not the reason why I couldn’t leave. I just explain how when we did it for the first time and how it just made everything changed for me.” \nShe also admitted people believing she was too “stupid and weak” to leave was bothersome, but understands how she and Tara are portrayed on the show. \nCredit: Instagram \n“It used to bother me… I received so much negativity, I was overwhelmed. Knowing that I’m not stupid, [but] that’s just how I might look on the show… Always remembering who I really am and knowing myself.” \nCredit: Getty \nDo you think Peter will wiggle his way back into Amina’s life?
