Voller 'of consistently poor behaviour' \nCrown prosecutor Trevor Moses submitted progress reports from Voller's time in detention to do with his security classification. \n\"They show that Mr Voller has consistently been of poor behaviour while he's been in prison and that is the reason why NT Corrections has been unable to progress him to a low classification,\" he told the court. \n\"[This] has been one of the key reasons by the parole board as to why parole hasn't been granted.\" \nHowever, his lawyer David Dalton SC disputed the reports. \n\"I object on the basis that these [reports] are allegations [by prison officers] and not deemed to be true,\" he said. Bid to be released BushMob \nVoller has applied to be bailed to the youth diversion program BushMob. \nJustice Peter Barr said if Voller was granted bail, it would be a test to assess whether the last five months of his sentence would then be suspended. \n\"You need to convince me that the sentence imposed ... was not the most appropriate sentence, and another sentence, with the benefit of subsequent hindsight, should have been imposed,\" Justice Peter Barr instructed Voller's lawyers. \nVoller was eligible for parole in October 2015 but his applications for it were rejected. \nMr Dalton said Voller had received unfair treatment in detention, as shown in numerous media reports. Psychiatric reports show Voller has PTSD \nMr Dalton said psychiatric reports showed Voller has post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD). \nHowever, Justice Barr questioned to what extent his onerous treatment, and as a result his PTSD, had been prompted by his own behaviour. \n\"For example, in a completely hypothetical sense, if Mr Voller had been assaulted by an inmate and suffered an injury while in detention then that's been beyond his control,\" he said. \n\"On the other hand, if he had provoked the assault by the fellow inmate in some way I'm not sure it would carry the weight of him being hard done by it.\" \nThe Crown accepted the events in detention contributed to some extent to Voller's PTSD, but said it was up to the judge to decide to what degree that was. \nThe matter continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:44:21.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
