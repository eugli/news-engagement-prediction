That position has broad support inside the administration, including from Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But the biggest hawk on Iran in the White House may have been Mr. Flynn. In his only public appearance as national security adviser, on Feb. 1, he warned Iran that it was being “put on notice” for what he said was a pattern of aggressive behavior in the region. With Mr. Flynn no longer in the picture, and Mr. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson are traveling, the Netanyahu-Trump meeting is likely to include Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon. That lineup, analysts said, could tilt the conversation more toward a potential peace initiative than to additional steps to pressure Iran. Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition is deeply hostile to new peace negotiations with the Palestinians . “The one issue Bibi has no room for maneuver on — the peace process — is the one issue Trump wants to talk about,” Martin S. Indyk, a special envoy for Middle East peace during the Obama administration, said, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname. “On the one issue that Bibi wants to talk about, Iran, he’s missing his wingman, General Flynn. His wingman has just been shot down.” Other analysts, however, said the upheaval in the White House would lower expectations for Mr. Netanyahu. “On the White House side, they’re going to be very distracted,” said Scott B. Lasensky, who was an adviser to the Obama administration’s ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro. “On the prime minister’s side, he wants to project an image of smooth sailing. He wants the same thing every Israeli prime minister wants — a picture of him in the Oval Office on the front page of every Israeli newspaper.” After Mr. Trump’s election, the complicated politics of the American Jewish electorate will pose a challenge to Mr. Netanyahu as well. But at least as far as the White House is concerned, some analysts said, he might be able to take advantage of the chaos. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “With the administration in flux,” said David Makovsky , a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, “you have a better chance of influencing policy before it gets set in stone.” \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
