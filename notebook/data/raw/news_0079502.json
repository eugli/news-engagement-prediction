Kenny and George dated from 1996 until 2011, and this week the 58-year-old Texan finally broke his silence following George's death on Christmas Day. Speaking to the Dallas Morning News , Kenny admitted he was \"in a zone\" when he received a phone call from George's sister Melanie on 25 December to inform him of George's passing. \"We just had a really good, sweet relationship,\" he said of their romance. \"We weren't even mad at each other or anything like that.\" He added: \"He was truly the love of my life. And I think I was the love of his life.\" \nVIEW GALLERY Kenny Goss and George Michael were together from 1996 until 2011 \nTwo months on from the star's death, Kenny said he still listens to his all-time favourite A Different Corner to comfort himself, and admitted he will never be able to fill the void the singer has left. He also said he believes George will live on thanks to his incredible generosity. Referring to the pair's charitable work, he shared: \"We always did that in England and we wanted to bring that to Dallas, and his name helped so much when we were asking people to give. He never understood that. He just wrote huge cheques, enormous ones. He gave away tens of millions of pounds to charity.\" \nSTORY: Andrew Ridgeley admits struggle over George Michael funeral delay - 'We've not had closure' \nIn the interview, Kenny refused to discuss Fadi Fawaz , who had been George's boyfriend for the four years prior to his death, and he also declined to talk about the circumstances surrounding the star's passing, including why he has not yet been buried. \"I know nothing about that,\" he said. \nVIEW GALLERY The former couple pictured together in 2004 \nIn the wake of George's sudden death, Kenny issued a moving statement in honour of his former partner. \"I'm heartbroken with the news that my dear friend and longtime love George Michael has passed,\" it read. \"He was a major part of my life and I loved him very, very much. He was an extremely kind and generous man.
