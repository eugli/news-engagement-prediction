However, her new single, “Boyfriend,” is a swift left-turn—it loudly announces that she’s done playing nice. “I’ve got your boyfriend on my mind/I think you know she stayed with me last night,” she sighs, before twisting the knife: “I held his world in my hands/I threw it out to see where it would land.” Backed by London band the Big Moon, she’s found a muscular sound that feels a world away from the quiet of 2015’s We Slept At Last . All rounded, chiming guitars, squealing string-bends and crunchy choruses, “Boyfriend” recalls Radiohead ’s pained transition from mopey grunge wannabes to spacey alt-rock saviors (this track recalls “My Iron Lung” and Bends -era B-sides like “Maquiladora”). But Hackman is no self-loathing creep—she’s witty, sardonic and coming to steal your lover just because she can. “Boyfriend” is full of little taunts, sarcastic retorts, and audible eye rolls. Despite her deadpan delivery, Hackman makes it clear that’s she’s having a laugh: the song opens with the sound of her chuckling into the mic and toward the end, she screeches for no good reason. Firing back at clueless men has rarely sounded so fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:22:50.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
