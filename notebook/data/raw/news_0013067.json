photos to kick off Vanity Fair ’s new series, “My Grams.” by Twitter *In this new series, celebrities crack open their Instagram accounts and break down the inspiration and meaning behind some of their favorite photos. First up: actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who takes her followers behind the scenes of Scream Queens, pays tribute to her mother Janet Leigh’s famous Psycho shower scene, and goes to the Women’s March in Washington, D.C. The truth is, I invented Instagram. When iPhones were first released I started a blog called IPHONEYS : iPhone photographers sharing their vision! I asked photographer friends of mine to send me photographs that they took on their iPhones, and I posted it onto a blog. It's still there! It ended when Instagram started. #aheadofthecurve Loading My own private Idaho with my now-departed lab, Jay Jay ! Loading View on Instagram Re-created my mother's famous shower scene from Psycho on my TV show Scream Queens. It was a beautiful way to honor her legacy and let the fans of both of our generations enjoy this strange but interesting and wonderful link between my mother and myself. I think she would've loved it. Loading View on Instagram My son is a gamer, and my motto is “If you can't beat them, join them and beat them.” He loves World of Warcraft. I attended BlizzCon 2015 but needed to go incognito. I loved going as an Orc, enjoying the convention, and then retreating back to my room where I revealed myself to the Instaworld. Such fun. Loading [ Scream Queens ] rested on the shoulders of this young, very talented and beautiful actress, Emma Roberts . I took this portrait during the first episode of the first season. It's still as breathtaking as it was then, as is she. Loading On one episode of the show my character, Dean Cathy Munsch, stalks a young woman who stole her husband. I just loved this picture. The actress, Tavi Gevinson, was spectacular and this picture says it all. Loading View on Instagram When I was shooting an interview with Lady Gaga for The Hollywood Reporter, these beautiful women were there, too. I had recently been sent this T-shirt from the Hillary Clinton campaign, but it was an extra large, and so I thought that two heads we're better than one and asked them to participate in the shoot. They all did with great grace. Loading View on Instagram One of the highlights of 2016 was finding my own political voice by becoming a surrogate for __Hillary Clinton.__Traveling the country, speaking to people, and listening to their stories and their reasons for supporting her as their candidate was truly a high point in my life. Loading I now counsel people who are traveling to make sure they bring a red sweater, hat, or a backpack to make their Instagram pictures pop. Photographer Tierney Gearon taught me this trick. Loading View on Instagram I was able to direct an episode of Scream Queens and loved it. I feel like all of my talents coalesced into that job. I was very happy with the results. This was taken while I was trying to suppress a laugh at a talented actor as he was doing a monologue. Loading My daughter has become such an amazing woman. It's like watching a beautiful photograph slowly develop, more details emerging, in developing fluid. Her grace and talent and beauty and love is everything to me. Loading View on Instagram The Women’s March was a turning point for this country. I had the privilege of introducing Helen Reddy to the crowd and stand next to her as she sang, a cappella, “I Am Woman.” It was the high point of my public life. From Emma Stone to Janelle Monáe: See Hollywood’s Wonder Women Photographed by Annie Leibovitz Emma Stone 24 films, including La La Land (2016) and Battle of the Sexes (2017). Acting chops matter most, but adorability never hurts, and this Emma Stone has in tidy supply. A natural blonde, Stone has registered her greatest impact on-screen as a scorchy redhead, first in Superbad , later setting the high-school halls abuzz in Easy A , finding romance in the inexplicably titled Crazy, Stupid, Love , and co-starring in a pair of Woodys (charming Colin Firth in Magic in the Moonlight and jostling Joaquin Phoenix’s moody moods in Irrational Man ). Restored to blondeness, Stone played the uncharacteristically abrasive part of the wounded, resentful daughter in Birdman , a small volcanic eruption that earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. Stone finds herself in the Oscar steeplechase again this year after winning the Golden Globe for best actress in a musical for her swirly, ardent luminance in La La Land , a valentine to Hollywood musicals and the Los Angeles dusk directed by Damien Chazelle ( Whiplash ), which re-teams her with Crazy, Stupid, Love manwich Ryan Gosling. A sensation at the Venice Film Festival, La La Land was named best picture by the New York Film Critics Circle, that finicky tribe of cannibals. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Natalie Portman 37 films, including Jackie (2016); one Academy Award. A super-concentrated packet whose features have the precision of an X-Acto knife, Natalie Portman literally and figuratively blasted out of the box as a pubescent punkette assassin in The Professional (1994) and hasn’t taken a breather since, working with the top stratum of directors in a carousel of genres ranging from costume drama ( The Other Boleyn Girl ) to space opera (the Star Wars prequel trilogy), to mirror-splintering psychodrama ( Black Swan , for which she won the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role). And now, dominating the camera frame while scarcely moving a facial muscle (Garbo-esque close-ups galore), is her command performance as Jackie Kennedy in Pablo Larraín’s Jackie , a master class in how to use deportment, etiquette, feathery enunciation, and impeccable fashion taste to ward off chaos and the howling wolves of grief. From Jackie’s blood-spattered pink Chanel-styled suit to her widow’s black veil and mourning dress as she staggers through the milky-white mist of Arlington National Cemetery, the film is iconography in sleepwalk motion, history as a trance state. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Janelle Monáe 3 films, including Moonlight and Hidden Figures (2016). The Afro-futurist musical artist Janelle Monáe, whose 2010 album, The ArchAndroid , established her pro-android aesthetic and politique (“The ‘android’ represents the new ‘other,’” she explained), enjoyed a rookie year as an actress in 2016 that would be the envy of any humanbot. In the haunting triptych of fragility and identity Moonlight , she is Teresa, the drug dealer’s girlfriend with a consoling heart and keen emotional radar; in Hidden Figures , she’s Mary, the youngest member of a trio of unsung female African-American mathematicians working behind the scenes at NASA to keep John Glenn’s Mercury capsule from collapsing like a soda can on launch and re-entry. Equally at ease with Moonlight ’s elliptical pauses and Hidden Figures ’ expository prose, Monáe showed she could handle anything thrown at her and bat it over the wall. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Dakota Johnson 16 films, including Fifty Shades Darker (2017). Daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, granddaughter of the chillest, most unattainable Hitchcock blonde of them all, Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson has pasted her own star into this Hollywood constellation. Early twinkles in Crazy in Alabama and The Social Network were the prelude to her breakout casting as the demure literary ingénue Anastasia Steele (yowza) in the screen adaptation of E. L. James’s Fifty Shades of Grey , the fiction sensation that got women worldwide thrumming. Following Fifty Shades of Grey is the forthcoming Fifty Shades Darker , and, if civilization prevails, Fifty Shades: The Wrath of Khan . It is outside the pallor and dolor of Fifty Shades that Johnson gets to strut a fuller stride, as Rebel Wilson’s avid sidekick in How to Be Single and as the sun-streaked temptress in Luca Guadagnino’s A Bigger Splash . For her next daredevil mission, Johnson will be en pointe in Guadagnino’s remake of the horror cult classic Suspiria , as a ballerina who joins a mysterioso dance academy presided over by her sub-lunar co-star from A Bigger Splash , Tilda Swinton—it doesn’t get more ooga-booga than that. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Lupita Nyong’o 6 films, including Queen of Katwe (2016); one Academy Award. Lupita Nyong’o is a message amplifier: only a small handful of major screen credits to her name but what a solid thump they’ve made. She seemed to burst out of parts unknown in her feature-film debut as the sadistically mistreated Patsey in Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave , for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress. Fortitude also forms the mortar of her performance in Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe as Nakku Harriet, the Mother Courage of a family of hungry, unschooled children in a teeming, poor, ramshackle township in Uganda where skyscrapers stand in the hazy distance like the Emerald City of Oz. Elsewhere, in a galaxy far, far away, Nyong’o is a member of the revivified Star Wars mod squad, playing the goggle-eyed pirate Maz Kanata in J. J. Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its next billion-dollar chapter. As if that weren’t pop pantheon enough, she is also cast in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s forthcoming Black Panther movie, making her a dual dignitary at any Comic-Con. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Amy Adams 36 films, including Nocturnal Animals and Arrival (2016). An air of expectancy is what Amy Adams has brought to the movies ever since her breakthrough, in Junebug (2005), an avid acceptance of come-what-may that made her exiled princess in Enchanted such a piquant charmer. The most un-showy of actresses, a smooth canvas each time out, Adams buoys nearly every movie she’s in, her ready calm establishing an oasis amid the testosterone sweatbox of The Fighter and the hurly-burly of American Hustle (both directed by David O. Russell), keeping the multi-narrative crisscrosses of Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals on track, and elevating her performance in the critical and box-office hit Arrival —Denis Villeneuve’s Jungian science-fiction meditation, in which the aliens communicate through enso ink circles, as if blowing Zen smoke rings—to a state of grace. She’s been nominated five times for an Oscar: perhaps this will be the year—finally!—that she gets to lug one home. Photo: Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Styled by Jessica Diehl.
