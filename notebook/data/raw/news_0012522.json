Photo: Generic file photo Dog with mouth taped shut reportedly still alive The Courier-Mail February 5, 2017 12:27pm \nA DOG seen running around a southeast Queensland highway with its mouth taped shut almost a month ago is apparently still alive - but not so well. \nThe dog, believed to be a german shepherd cross , ran out in front of a truck last night, according to a post on the Lost Dogs Logan Facebook page. \n“The german sheperd (sic) dog lost on the (Cunningham’s) gap is still alive, ran out in front of the truck tonight, rspca have been called! Poor thing is skinny as and has managed to get tape off its mouth!” the post read. \nExactly where the sighting was has not been confirmed. \nThe dog had previously been spotted with its mouth taped shut running along the Cunningham Highway south-west of Ipswich on January 11. \nRSPCA Queensland spokesman Michael Beatty today said the RSPCA would look into the reported sighting but cautioned that there were many wild dogs in the area and the latest sighting may not be the same dog. \nAnyone who has any information is urged to call 1300 ANIMAL ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:03:52.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
