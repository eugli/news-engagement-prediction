How much does it cost? \nIf you're at the most healthful end of the spectrum, it'll likely be pricey – produce, whole grains and fish are expensive. \n\"The Spectrum,\" an essential guide, is available in paperback, hardcover and e-book format. Will you lose weight? \nPerhaps, perhaps not. There are varying degrees of an Ornish diet. But if you're exercising regularly and have adopted a menu filled with foods from the healthiest three nutrition groups – which emphasize produce, whole grains and fish – it's likely. \nHere's a look at some studies analyzing the potential for weight loss on an Ornish diet: In the extension study to Ornish's landmark heart disease-reversal trial, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998, researchers reported that a small group of Ornish dieters who followed the plan described above had lost an average of 24 pounds after a year. At five years, they still maintained a loss of 13 pounds from their original weight. At one- and five-year check-ins, control-group dieters were on average 3 pounds heavier than when they started. In an analysis published in the American Journal of Health Promotion in 2010, about 1,300 participants on the Ornish plan to reverse heart disease decreased their body mass index, a measure of body fat, from 32 (obese) to 29 1/2 (overweight) after a year. No control group was used. A 2007 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association divided roughly 300 overweight or obese women into groups and assigned them to one of four types of diets: an Ornish approach emphasizing no more than 10 percent of daily calories from fat; low-carb ( Atkins ); low saturated-fat/moderate-carb (LEARN); and roughly equal parts protein, fat and carbs ( Zone ). After 12 months, Ornish dieters had lost an average of 4 4/5 pounds, the Atkins group had lost 10 3/10 pounds, the LEARN group had lost 5 7/10 pounds and the Zone group had lost 3 1/2 pounds. Drawing firm conclusions from this study is risky, however. The differences in weight loss among Ornish, LEARN and Zone participants weren't statistically reliable. And many participants didn't follow their assigned diet. The Ornish group, for example, took in up to 30 percent of calories from fat – hardly close to the recommended 10 percent. In another JAMA study, published in 2005, researchers assigned 160 overweight or obese participants to one of four diets: Atkins, Weight Watchers , Zone and a version of Ornish emphasizing a vegetarian approach with 10 percent of calories from fat. After a year, the Ornish group had lost an average of 7 pounds, which was similar to the range of weight loss (4 1/2 to 7 pounds) in the other groups. Weight loss may not be tied to lower fat intake specifically, however. Many experts maintain that the number of calories you take in – not whether you get them from fat, carbs or protein – drives weight loss, especially in the long run. In one study, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers assigned 811 overweight adults to diets of differing nutrient amounts. At two years, the groups assigned to get 20 percent of their calories from fat had lost about the same as those put on a diet that was 40 percent based on fat. How easy is it to follow? \nDepends on which program you follow. \nIf you're taking the spectrum approach, which allows you to make decisions based on your priorities, tastes and level of commitment, it's pretty easy. \nIf you're aiming to reverse heart disease, the program is more restrictive and therefore can be tougher to follow. Ornish contends, however, that it's easier in the long-term than taking, say, a statin, since the program boosts your quality of life enough to make you want to continue. (A statin, on the other hand, acts more like a Band-Aid.) In fact, close to 80 percent of the nearly 3,000 participants in the 2011 American Journal of Health Promotion study were still enrolled in the program after one year. \nStill, research shows most dieters have a hard time sticking to a plan that restricts fat to 10 percent of daily calories. Our take? If your health doesn't depend on it (i.e., you don't have heart disease), working with a slightly higher fat intake or trying the spectrum approach may help you keep a firm hold on the wagon. \nConvenience: Recipes are abundant, and eating out is OK, if the chef can improvise. Alcohol is allowed in moderation. \nRecipes: \"The Spectrum\" serves up quite a few. While many fall into the most-healthful category, variations are suggested if you prefer the middle of the spectrum. There's also an Ornish-approved cookbook on the market. Once you get the hang of your program, though, any cookbook or internet search will turn up recipes that align. \nEating out: Fine, but try to find restaurants that will cater to special requests. And eat slowly – you'll know when you've had enough, and you'll enjoy your food more. \nAlcohol: If you choose to drink, savor it in moderation. That's generally considered no more than one drink a day for women, two a day for men. (A drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1 1/2 ounces of liquor.) \nTimesavers: None, unless you hire somebody to plan your meals, shop for them and prepare them. \nExtras: Ornish offers a table that details the health benefits of various foods; tips to get through the holidays; the omega-3 content of selected fish; tables showing where various foods fall on the nutrition spectrum; and some cooking lessons. \nFullness: Nutrition experts emphasize the importance of satiety, the satisfied feeling that you've had enough. On Ornish, the large amount of fiber you'll get from whole grains, fruits and veggies should keep you feeling full. \nTaste: You're making everything, so if something doesn't taste good, you know who to blame. Health & Nutrition \nProvided that you obey the limitations on what Dr. Dean Ornish calls group five foods heavy on saturated fat and instead stick with groups one through three at the other end of his spectrum – fish, plants, whole grains – your menu will stay in line with the federal government's recommendations and you won’t risk your health. What is the role of exercise? \nIt's strongly encouraged. \nYou'll use the exercise spectrum to develop a routine that aligns with your goal – weight loss, controlling diabetes or reversing heart disease – and includes a mix of aerobic, strength and flexibility activities. Do what you enjoy, and do it often. Diet Details Balanced Diet These diets contain significantly less than the government’s recommended limit, and are known to be heart-healthy approaches.
