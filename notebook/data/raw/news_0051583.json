After all, they're veterans of the Oscars ceremony, turning out in sweeping and elegant gowns time and time again.\nBut if you're only looking out for those women, you could very well be missing out on the single most interesting dresser the 2017 Oscars has to offer — a woman who's just now making her Oscars red-carpet debut but who's already been quietly killing the fashion game at every turn.\nA woman by the name of Ruth Negga.\nFor us, it was the 2017 Golden Globes where Negga cemented her status as a woman to whom we should absolutely pay attention. She showed up there in a slinky silver-and-gold Louis Vuitton dress that made her look like Betty Boop from the year 2050.\nRuth Negga arrives at the 74th annual Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 8.

Source: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images With her hair in 1920s ringlets and her eyes lined just right, plenty of people saw the event as Negga's coming-out as a fashion icon, someone who doesn't opt for a conventionally pretty dress.\nThe look was interesting, and for a woman who's relatively new to these sorts of award shows , it paid off.\nBut even before that red-carpet appearance, Negga seemed to have her eyes set on a certain charming yet eccentric aesthetic, with plenty of sparkles and ruffles and dresses that make you think: \"Who's that woman?\"\nOne example is Negga's appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2016, during which she was promoting her Oscar-nominated film Loving . She arrived in a glittery pleated dress by Suno with just a hint of animal print.\nActress Ruth Negga attends the 'Loving' photocall during the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival in May 2016.

Source: Valery Hache/AFP It seems Negga just has a knack for wearing unusual but always beautiful outfits that make you want to know more about her. It's something no other actress right now is really capable of.\nMaybe it stems from Negga always looking like she's having a blast — like in July, when she wore pants covered in cat faces.\nActors Graham McTavish, Ruth Negga and Joseph Gilgun attend San Diego Comic-Con 2016.

Source: Getty Images Negga obviously doesn't take herself — or what she wears — too seriously, and that's what makes it so fun to see what she wears to awards shows, which are typically full of pretty, stuffy people who yearn for dresses that are, above all else, photogenic.\nThroughout fall 2016, as she was actively promoting Loving , Negga had a heroic streak of stunning dresses only she could pull off — like this champagne velvet Valentino dress to the opening of a Cartier store in New York City.\nActress Ruth Negga attends the Cartier Fifth Avenue Grand Reopening Event at the Cartier Mansion in September 2016.

Source: Jordan Strauss/AP It was an unexpected mixture of hard and soft, a typical Negga move.\nSo no, maybe someone like Stone or Kidman shouldn't be the one you keep an eye on. Maybe it's not only time to give Negga a chance, but to look forward to her Oscars red-carpet debut.\nA woman who can pull off a cat dress, after all, should never be underestimated.", "external_links": ["http://www.vogue.com/article/ruth-negga-gucci-academy-awards-red-carpet", "http://ap.org/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/ruth-neggas-loving-press-tour-outfits-941808/1-cannes-photocall", "http://tomandlorenzo.com/2016/10/ruth-negga-in-prada-at-peoples-ones-to-watch-event-red-carpet-fashion/", "http://fashionbombdaily.com/hot-or-hmm-ruth-neggas-variety-creative-impact-awards-erdem-pre-fall-2017-floral-embroidered-bell-sleeve-blouse-and-blue-beaded-midi-skirt/", "http://www.vogue.com/article/rosamund-pike-ruth-negga-hannah-bagshawe-gucci-valentino-pink-dressing-celebrity-style", "http://www.independent.ie/style/fashion/style-talk/ruth-negga-steals-the-show-at-palm-springs-international-film-festival-in-sheer-valentino-dress-35337375.html", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/ruth-neggas-loving-press-tour-outfits-941808/2-cannes-film-festival", "http://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/ruth-neggas-best-red-carpet-looks-pics-w460851/cartier-fifth-avenue-mansion-reopening-party-w460874", "http://www.gettyimages.com/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ruth-neggas-golden-globes-2017-dress-961996", "https://twitter.com/RobinGivhan/status/818243853450936325", "http://gettyimages.com/", "http://fashionbombdaily.com/splurge-ruth-neggas-loving-press-conference-fall-2016-dolce-gabbana-cat-print-elbow-length-sleeve-cady-dress/", "http://www.wmagazine.com/story/ruth-negga-miu-miu-oscars-luncheon"], "published": "2017-02-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:46:09.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
