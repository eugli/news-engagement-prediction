LOUIS • With a cellphone ready to record in one hand and her other hand held over her heart Melissa Chatman walked, sometimes climbed, over piles of trash, fallen drywall and plaster inside several abandoned homes in north St. Louis Friday. \nThe 41-year-old Spanish Lake woman was one of about 10 volunteers who, along with three police officers, searched vacant buildings in the city’s Sixth and Fourth police districts in search of missing people, many of whom are young black women, Chatman said. \nShe didn’t know whether to be disappointed or relieved that they didn’t find any bodies. \nTwo of the missing, she said, are her cousins: Shemika Cosey, who went missing in 2008 at the age of 16 in Berkeley and Makayla Jones, 15, who hasn’t been seen since about 6 p.m. Thursday after she got off a bus at Hodiamont Avenue and Skinker Boulevard to go to work after school. \nThe police department issued a press release Friday saying Makayla of the 1600 block of Veronica, was wearing her school uniform, a navy blue polo shirt, navy blue jacket and khaki pants. \n“It’s just nuts, this is our youth and there’s too many coming back-to-back, it has us wondering, ‘Is it the same person doing this?’” Chatman said. “There’s just so many of these buildings out there, all this room to dispose of bodies or do what you want to do with them.” \nDerk Brown, 29, of Jennings organized Friday’s effort through social media. \n“There are just a lot of missing youth and adults right now, and if we can come together as a community with the help of police officers, maybe we can help,” he said. \nBrown said the effort was inspired by the discovery Jan. 13 by police of a 12-year-old girl, barely alive, left in a vacant building after she was kidnapped, assaulted and slashed across the throat. A 20-year-old man has been charged in that case. \nA community outreach officer, Regiana Moore, along with officers Gary Ruffin and Eric Armstead, kept a watchful eye on the group as they moved in and out of buildings. \nThey searched about six buildings near Fairground Park, along the 3800 and 3900 blocks of Labadie Avenue and Greer Place. \n“This is your community, come on, help out,” Moore said as she motioned to a group of onlookers who gathered in the streets to see what brought the volunteers and police to their community. \nNo one joined in. \nBrown said he plans to search more buildings Saturday, and that he would post his plans to his Facebook page .
