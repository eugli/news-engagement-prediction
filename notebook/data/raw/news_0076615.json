It means the people who most needed to hear these messages didn’t.\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nOn the cinematic front, “La La Land” still had a big (if not a record-setting) night, winning six awards including best director for Damien Chazelle and Scottsdale native Emma Stone for best actress. (Stone thanked Bobb Cooper, formerly of Valley Youth Theatre, during her acceptance speech.) While those winners didn't get political, Kimmel did from the start.\nRELATED: Here's how the worst flub in Oscar history went down | Oscars 2017: Every crazy thing we saw backstage — including THAT flub \n“This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us,” he said, and later thanked Trump for taking pressure off the Academy Awards by comparison: “Remember last year when the Oscars were considered racist?”\nGael Garcia Bernal, with Hailee Steinfeld, got political during Academy Awards on Feb. 26, 2017, in Hollywood, Calif.   (Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nSome of the presenters made overt political statements. Gael Garcia Bernal said, “As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I am against any form of a wall that wants to separate us.”\nSome winners did, too. Irianian director Asghar Farhadi, whose “The Salesman” won best foreign film, skipped the ceremony “out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.,” Iranian-American Anousheh Ansari, who accepted the award for him, read from a statement. “Dividing the world into us and our enemies categories creates fear: A deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.”\nBarry Jenkins, accepting the award for best adapted screenplay for \"Moonlight,\" the story of a black boy struggling with poverty and sexual identity growing up in Miami, said, \"All you people out there who feel like your life is not reflected, the Academy has your back, the ACLU has your back. For the next four years, we will not leave you alone. We will not forget you.\"\nViola Davis accepts the award for best supporting actress during the 89th Annual Academy Awards on on Feb. 26, 2017, in Hollywood, Calif.   (Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nBut the Academy made its biggest statements where it counted: with its winners. They didn’t have to make political statements in their speeches (and didn’t). They made them simply by winning. Mahershala Ali won best supporting actor for “Moonlight” while Viola Davis won best supporting actress for “Fences.” That's two black actors in two black-themed films. This after two consecutive years in which no actors of color were even nominated in any acting category.\n?

This was concrete progress.\nSo if you skipped the show because you didn’t want to see someone with a big platform and a massive audience say things you didn’t want to hear, fine. Your loss. The rest of us liked it just fine.\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.
