Image: www.deepreef.org \nA massive undersea landslide, about 30 times the volume of Uluru, has been found on the Great Barrier Reef. \nThe ancient remains, known as the Gloria Knolls Slide, were discovered 75 kilometres off the north Queensland coast by scientists on the research ship Southern Surveyor. \nA debris field of large blocks, or knolls, and numerous smaller blocks, is scattered over 30 kilometres from the main landslide remains, into the Queensland Trough, to a depth of 1350 metres. \n“The oldest fossil corals recovered off the top of the knoll were 302,000 years old — which means the landslide event that caused these knolls must be older,” says researcher Dr Angel Puga-Bernabéu, a former postdoctoral researcher from the University of Sydney and now with the University of Granada.
