[Photo/Xinhua] BUDAPEST --- The Hungarian government announced a decision Wednesday evening on a proposal to withdraw the candidacy from the 2024 Olympic Games in Budapest, addressed to both the Budapest City Hall and the National Olympic Committee, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI. \n\"The Olympic Games are a national cause for Budapest and Hungary. According to our experience, unity is necessary to represent national causes. This unity between the leaders of the country and the parties was real at the time of the presentation of the bid, reflected in the decisions of the Budapest City Hall by a majority of 92%, and of the Parliament by a majority of 80%,\" the resolution of the government said. \nThis unity has been disintegrated in the last months, for which the opposition parties are to blame, according to the Hungarian government. The national cause of the Olympic Games became a political party affair, for which the opposition parties are liable, who turned their backs on the former decision, the government added. \nAs the necessary unity in Budapest has been lost, the bid of Budapest lost all of its chances,the government said. \n\"In such a context, the only responsible decision is that if the city of Budapest and the National Olympic Committee do not maintain their bid. That is why the government of Hungary proposes to withdraw the candidacy from the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic games in Budapest, addressed to both the Budapest City Hall and the National Olympic Committee,\" the government said. \nThe Mayor of Budapest Istvan Tarlos said that the leadership of Budapest would suggest to the Budapest City Hall to revoke the Hungarian bid, in accordance with the government. \nThe decision was announced after a meeting between the Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the Mayor of Budapest Istvan Tarlos and the President of the National Olympic Committee Zsolt Borkai on Wednesday evening.
