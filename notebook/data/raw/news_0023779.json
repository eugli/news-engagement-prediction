I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory.\" \nHe said inviting the Obamas to his island was \"a huge honour\". \nMr Obama spent his first days after leaving Washington vacationing in Palm Springs, California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:40:44.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
