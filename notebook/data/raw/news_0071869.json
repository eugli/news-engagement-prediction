Arizona Ave., Chandler, in 2016. A second is now planned for Tempe. Customers may order food and drink from their seats. This is the full bar in the lobby of the Chandler location.   (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nThe Alamo Drafthouse will be built at the Lake Country Village plaza, near Rural and Baseline roads, which Tempe officials have worked to bolster for years.\nThe plaza also has a vacant theater being torn down and turned into 357 luxury apartments. However, residents wanted to ensure shops and restaurants remained in the area. In response, the city sought commercial proposals that led to the Alamo Drafthouse, as well as restaurant, retail and office space by LGE Design Build, said Ryan Levesque, Tempe's deputy community development director of planning.\nThat's done a lot to alleviate those concerns, he said.\n\"It's a rebirthing,\" Levesque said.\nThe total cost of the plaza upgrades, including the apartment buildings and new commercial spaces, is about $41.5 million, according to the city.\nThe only major hurdle before construction can begin is for the city to issue building permits, Levesque said, noting that should take two to three months. The project should break ground in late summer or early fall and be done in early 2018, he said.\nThe proposed 32,000-square-foot-theater will house six screens, close to 800 seats and an outdoor space for film and beer aficionados.\nEntertainment anchor in downtown Chandler Downtown Chandler is expected to be an entertainment hub, said Chandler Downtown Redevelopment Manager Kim Moyers.   (Photo: LGE Design Build and Brick & West) \nThe Flix Brewhouse in Chandler will be one of only six in the nation and the first in Arizona.\nThe brewhouse is part of a new development dubbed Overstreet, which will occupy a 77,000-square-foot area at the southwest corner of Arizona Avenue and Chandler Boulevard.\nFlix Brewhouse is a chain of theaters with an interesting twist on the beer and film trope. Each theater comes with its own microbrewery.\nThe theater is expected to have 38 beers on tap, with 12 brewed in house.The theater also will accommodate those who just want to stop by for a beer without seeing a film, according to the developer.\nIn addition to the theater, the area will house office, retail and restaurant spaces, Chandler Downtown Redevelopment Manager Kim Moyers said.\n\"We knew we wanted this site to be an entertainment destination,\" Moyers said, adding that the process has \"been a whirlwind.\"\nTwo and a half years ago, Chandler sought a developer to create a unique space in downtown that would feature entertainment as the main anchor, Moyers said.\nWhen a previous plan fell through, the city began working with LGE Design Build, which \"worked around the clock\" on a 90-day deadline to get the city its plans for the area, Moyers said.\n\"We're past most of the major hurdles,\" LGE Design Build President and CEO David Sellers said.\nThe Chandler City Council approved the project in February, and Sellers expects to break ground in mid- to late March with a completion date in December or early January 2018.\nProject expected to bring in jobs The downtown Chandler project is expected to cost $25 million and occupy 77,000 square feet. It is expected to be done by December or early January, LGE Design Build President and CEO David Sellers said.   (Photo: LGE Design Build and Brick & West) \nThe $25 million project is expected to bring jobs to the area, including 100 alone for the brewhouse, Moyers said.\nThe city provided LGE Design Build incentives such as helping with utility upgrades and offering attractive lease rates in order to move the project forward, Moyers said.\nThe Overstreet property is owned by the city. LGE will pay $10 a year for 10 years to lease the property from the city, Moyers said. She said the city \"realized that it can be challenging\" to build in the pricey downtown.\nThe deal is supposed to act as an incentive for LGE to build on and eventually buy the land from the city, Moyers said.\nLGE will have the option to buy the land at its appraised value of $1 million during the 10-year period. If the developer doesn't purchase the land in that time frame, the land will be reappraised with the buildings and LGE will have to pay \"normal lease rates.\"\nThe company aims to fill the other spaces with local businesses that are a mix of retail, fitness and restaurants, Sellers said.\n\"This has the ability to be so much more,\" he said.\nResidents can sign up for updates on the project and enter for a chance to win a $500 package of \"Overstreet experiences\" at overstreetchandler.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:43:43.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
