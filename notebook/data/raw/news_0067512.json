Around one-third of newborns last year –2,447 – had at least one non-Maltese parent \nOthers were born to migrant fathers or foreign nationals who then moved from the island before the baby was even born, leaving the mothers to raise the babies and often unsure of the nationality of the father,” she said. \nThe figures tabled in Parliament by Justice Minister Owen Bonnici earlier this week show that while there has been an upward trend in such cases over the years, the phenomenon barely exists in Gozo. In fact, the only baby born to a parent of unknown nationality on the sister island in the past decade came just weeks ago. \nThe figures are not to be confused with babies born to unknown fathers, who make up around a third of births annually. \nThe data, given in reply to a question from Opposition MP Chris Said on Wednesday, also sheds light on the impact foreigners are having on the nationality of babies born. Around a third of newborns last year had at least one parent who was not Maltese. The figure, 2,447, was more than double that in 2006. \nSome 130 mothers last year were teenagers, while 77 were 45 and older. The risk of pregnancy complications, such as high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, increases drastically after 35 and continues to rise in your 40s. \nThe odds of genetic problems also jump as one gets older. According to the World Health Organisation, at 40, the chances of conceiving a child with Down’s syndrome was one in 100; at 45 it is one in 30. \nMore worrying, however, are babies being born to drug-addicted mothers. In 2016, 14 babies had mothers who were self-confessed drug addicts. « Photos of the week - Times of Malta Mild weather expected for pre-Lent carnival weekend » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&amp;campaign=0&amp;cb=80517898034&amp;n=6a70586e' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&amp;campaign=0&amp;cb=80517898034&amp;n=6a70586e' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
