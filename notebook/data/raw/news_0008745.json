After the Obama family returns from their post-inauguration vacation to Palm Springs , three of them— Barack, Michelle, and Sasha —will readjust to civilian life in Kalorama , a D.C. neighborhood located just two miles from their old digs . The missing family member? That would be 18-year-old Malia , who’s reportedly off to a new adventure: an internship for mega-producer Harvey Weinsten . Page Six first reported Thursday night that the future Harvard undergrad—she’s taking a gap year before beginning college this fall—will begin work with Weinstein “sometime in the future.” The Hollywood Reporter followed with news that Malia “is expected to begin work in the New York office of The Weinstein Co. in February,” shortly after her family’s Palm Springs jaunt. Despite her age, Malia already has a fair amount of experience in the entertainment industry: she spent some of the summer of 2015 assisting crew members on the set of HBO’s Girls , and reportedly had a similar gig on the set of Halle Berry’s sci-fi drama Extant the previous year (where she “fetched coffee and got no special treatment,” at least according to the Daily Mail ). Clearly, there’ll be a lot more for her to learn at the Weinstein Company: Harvey Weinstein is a notorious mover and shaker in Hollywood, a comeback kid whose producing prowess and reputation for waging fierce Oscar campaigns has inspired admiration, envy, and every other emotion on the spectrum. (His former assistant Leslye Headland , now a successful screenwriter and director in her own right, wrote a scathing 2008 play based in part on her experience working for Weinstein, called Assistance .) It’s also a good thing that the internship won’t conflict with Malia’s schoolwork—because we know her parents never would have let that fly .
