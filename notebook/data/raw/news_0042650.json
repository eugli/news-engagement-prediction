We have received support from nearly every major political party.\n\"It really is remarkable but it just speaks to the fact that opening civil partnerships is popular, fair and would be good for families and children.\n\"Whatever happens, the campaign has showed why we need mixed-sex civil partnerships. We hope that the Government will take heed and act soon to open civil partnerships to all.\"\nMr Keidan said that they were \"very hopeful\".\n\"We believe we have not only the law but basic fairness on our side. Whatever happens on Tuesday, we will be looking to the Government to open civil partnerships to all couples at the earliest opportunity.\n\"By doing so, they will be listening to the thousands of people who want to see mixed-sex civil partnerships open to all.
