The video likens sexual orientation to horse-riding. It claims when someone realises they have a 'different' orientation than others and wishes to change, they should receive extensive training and guidance.

The therapy, as the Islamic Development Department Malaysia's (Jakim) family, social and community department describes it, would consist of a blend of psychological treatment and spiritual counseling. Attempting to change a person's sexual orientation is widely regarded as a harmful pseudoscience. The practice has been banned in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US.
