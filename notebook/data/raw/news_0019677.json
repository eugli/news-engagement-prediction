PA 1 Madeleine McCann’s parents have said the drama about the disappearance of Shannon Matthews (pictured was insensitive) \nThe show follows the story of nine-year-old Shannon who “vanished” from The Moorside council estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in February 2008. The schoolgirl’s own mum Karen had callously made it all up. Inspired by the huge Maddie police hunt just nine months before, her sole purpose was to cash in with an relative by grabbing the reward and any media interview fees. \nShe was eventually arrested, charged and jailed for eight years. She had been an accomplice in her daughter’s drugging and kidnapping. \nShannon’s shocking “disappearance” after failing to return home from a school swimming trip bore a chilling similarity to that of three-year-old Maddie, who had been snatched from her bed in a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May 2007. \nMaddie’s plight was highlighted at least three times in the well publicised opening episode. In one scene Karen’s pal and search co-ordinator Julie Bushby, played by Sheridan Smith, is discussing a candelit vigil after the mum’s TV appeal. A friend, viewing the papers the next day, said: “It must be working all this, they are offering a reward of £20,000.” Julie’s young son chips in: “They are offering two and a half million pounds for Maddie McCann. Is that because they’re posher than us?” His mum replies: “It’s not a contest.” \nIn another clip while discussing how best to launch the media plea with a detective Karen tells her: “I’ve got my cuddly bear that you wanted, like Maddie’s mum wants her Cuddle Cat.” The police officer asks: “Is that Shannon’s favourite” and her mum takes a long pause before answering “Probably!” \nKaren’s appearance before cameras clutching the toy was a near carbon copy to Kate’s genuine pleas to her daughter’s abductor. \nMaddie’s favourite soft toy Cuddle Cat had been left lying on her bed when she vanished. In the early days Kate kept the grubby pink animal which she later recalled was dirty and “smelt of suntan lotion” close to her. The grief stricken mum was photographed carrying the toy everywhere. \nDuring the show’s appeal Karen shed crocodile tears as she echoed some of Kate’s words, begging: “I need her home. If anyone’s got my beautiful princess, bring her home.” \nA source close to Kate and Gerry said: “The whole Shannon Matthews saga only came about because of Madeleine’s disappearance and what the family wrongly thought they could claw through rewards and interviews. The BBC have been trailing it for a few weeks. Kate and Gerry think the whole thing is appalling, and in really poor taste and bad timing.

Hundreds of neighbours joined in the 24-day hunt unaware that her mum, inspired by the outpouring of grief and huge public donations to help find Maddie, was an elaborate hoax. \nShannon was eventually discovered just a mile away, drugged inside the wooden base of a double bed at the home of Michael Donovan, the uncle of step dad Craig Meehan, Karen’s boyfriend at the time. They had orchestrated the plot to bag the £50,000 reward money. \nAs well as re-telling the search the two-parter deals with the fallout of the community after they discovered they had been lied to. \nThe Moorside writer Neil McKay defended not making contact with Shannon’s family, insisting he didn’t want to put Karen back in the public eye. He said: “We don’t defend her or condemn her, and we don’t make an apology for her crime.” \nMaddie’s mum, a former GP, and heart doctor dad Gerry, believe their daughter – who would now be 13, could still be alive. The couple, both 48, from Rothley, Leics, are hoping “a miracle” reunites them with their daughter soon. \nScotland Yard are working on one last “throw of the dice” lead which Kate and Gerry are praying could solve the mystery. \nWe pay for your stories!
