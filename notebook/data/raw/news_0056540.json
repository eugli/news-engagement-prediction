Share on Twitter Print This Post \nPresident Trump raved like a crazy man at CPAC against all of the imaginary injustices committed against him by the free press, and in the process, this president made sure that he will zero credibility with anyone outside of the Republican Party. \nVideo: \nDonald Trump ranted against media stories that were negative towards him, polls that are negative towards him, press that uses unnamed sources, even though his own White House often refuses to go on record and provides information to reporters on a background only basis, which means that their names can’t be used in any reporting. \nTrump claimed that nobody loves the First Amendment more than him, but the First Amendment also gives him the right to rant about press stories that he doesn’t like. What the First Amendment doesn’t do is give a president the right to delegitimize facts and the free press. \nThe President destroyed any hope that Republicans may have still held that the rest of the country will ever take him seriously. Donald Trump continues to behave like a small man who is obsessed with his media coverage. \nThe man who is occupying the White House is completely unable to behave like a president. \nAt a time when polls show that 54%-55% of Americans believe that the President is dishonest and that nearly 60% of Americans are embarrassed by his behavior , Donald Trump continues to try to paint others as being “fake.” \nThe American people see through Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found that the media is trusted more than Trump by a margin of 52%-37%. \nPresident Trump’s ravings against the press play into a mythology of liberal media bias in the conservative movement that dates back to Richard Nixon, but not non-Trump supporters watching these performances, the President looks like a lunatic who has zero credibility. \nEvery time that Trump opens his mouth, he brings his presidency another step closer to the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:28:06.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
