She chose to take a personal leave from the bank in September, bank spokeswoman Mary Eshet said. Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe others fired by the bank were Pamela Conboy, Arizona lead regional president; Shelley Freeman, former Los Angeles regional president and now head of consumer credit solutions; and Matthew Raphaelson, head of community bank strategy and initiatives. None of them could immediately be reached for comment. \nThe four executives will not get bonuses for 2016 and will forfeit unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options. \nA spokesman for the Wells Fargo board of directors, Paul Scarpetta at Sard Verbinnen & Co, declined to comment further. \nThe scandal led to the departure of former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf last October. \nWells Fargo said on Tuesday the board's investigation was ongoing and was expected to be completed before the company's annual shareholder meeting in April. \n(Reporting by Dan Freed in New York and Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Lisa Shumaker) Next In Money ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:27:52.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
