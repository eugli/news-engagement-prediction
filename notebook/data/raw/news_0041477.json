Prior to modeling for NativesMY, she only posed for selfies, she said. \n“I suddenly found myself in front of (another person’s) camera. I needed to know how to pose as well as the correct angles.” \nAt 39, the youthful Fariesha ( photo ) did not only get to fulfill her dreams in a fashion shoot. \nShe also found herself walking down a catwalk thanks to coaching from former Miss World Malaysia, Thanuja Ananthan - an experience she believes has pushed her out of her shell. \n“I was quite shy before this, now I can talk to people more openly. I’ve never had an opportunity like this, so I’m thankful to Sharmila,” she said with a smile. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
