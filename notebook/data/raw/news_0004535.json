I would’ve liked to have stayed in Spain but unfortunately Valenica saw those clubs as rivals and were reluctant to let me go there. \n“When it came to my playing future I spoke to him (Postecoglou) about a few of my options and also spoke to my agent and of course my family. \n“However, in the end Genk was the best fit for me and I really want to do my best and help the club achieve success.” \nWANDERERS STRIKER SIGNING REJECTED \nMacedonian and Italian press has reported that another Western Sydney Wanderers striker target was knocked back by FFA after agreeing to terms. \nTutto Mercato reported former Inter Milan, Lazio and Napoli attacker Goran Pandev had accepted a two-year deal with Tony Popovic’s side.
