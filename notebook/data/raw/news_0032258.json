Names such as Paul Millsap and Serge Ibaka - who are both free agents in the summer - have been mentioned as potential captures for them. \nTheir slide has seen them drop out of the number two spot in the Eastern Conference and fall below the improving Boston Celtics. DeMar DeRozan's injury problems made it clear that the Raps don't have enough options offensively outside of their All-Star backcourt. \nGeneral manager Masai Ujiri must work his magic again to give the franchise the best chance of going toe-to-toe with the defending champions and the best team in the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Oklahoma City Thunder \nAs good as Russell Westbrook has been this year, it's obvious he needs some help. That was apparent in OKC's loss to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday as Kevin Durant and his stellar supporting cast proved to be too good for his former team once again. \nThat game was a clear indication of why KD decided to move on as the Thunder just don't have enough to contend for a championship. \nWestbrook scored 47 points and they still lost the game, largely due to the fact that many of his teammates struggled to knock down the open shots he was constantly giving them. \nThey need another scorer that can fill the gap left by Durant. Of course, they won't find a player of that calibre, but somebody who can put the ball in the basket and create his own shot is required. Sam Presti must reward Westbrook's loyalty by getting him the help he needs. New Orleans Pelicans \nRecent reports have suggested that the Pelicans are in the market for a center they can pair with superstar Anthony Davis. The plan is to put AD at the four spot and to bring in a traditional pivot in order for the All-Star to play in his favoured position. \nThey have been heavily linked with Jahlil Okafor and are rumoured to be in trade discussions with the Philadelphia 76ers already. The second-year big man was left out of Philly's last game as his departure seems imminent. \nPer Oleh Kosel of the Bird Writes: \"This interesting development—trading an asset to land a center—appears to favour Anthony Davis more than furthering Alvin Gentry's run-and-gun style of attack because it should allow AD to move back to power forward on a more regular basis. \n\"Davis has stated on multiple occasions that he views himself as a four, but for the good of the team, has agreed to man the five for the time being.\" Topics: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:26:48.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
