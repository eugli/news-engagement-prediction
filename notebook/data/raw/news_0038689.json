I have to continue every day being a mother and dealing with the loss of a child and it's hard. I just want some sort of answers,\" she said.\nMarce has been told an autopsy on her son was completed, but there's been an extreme and unexplained delay having the B.C. Coroners Service produce a report on Kolten's death.\n\"I have my son's ashes. I have recently picked up more ashes of his because they held onto some tissue for some testing,\" Marce said. \"They have nothing left to test. All of the tests are complete, but [they] won't write the report.\"\nThe mom did receive some preliminary information about her son's death in June 2015. When Kolten was taken to BC Children's Hospital, Marce was told he'd suffered severe trauma to his head.\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team was called to probe what happened, and deemed the baby’s death suspicious.\n\"I don't know exactly what happened but I feel like I know who's responsible for it,\" Marce said. \"But without an autopsy report that's never going to be proven. Nobody's ever going to be held accountable.\"\nOn Wednesday, the B.C. Coroners Service said it does not comment on suspicious deaths or homicides, and referred to CTV News to IHIT. IHIT has not responded to a request for an update on the case.\nIn an email sent to Marce earlier this month, child death coroner Adele Lambert offered an apology, but no concrete answers about when the report will be ready.\n\"I do want to assure you that Kolten’s death is a priority and I apologize again for the significant delay in receipt of the final autopsy report,\" Lambert wrote on Feb. 2.\nShe added that the chief coroner intended to meet with the pathologist responsible for the report shortly.\n\"Options will be discussed to ensure that the report is completed as soon as possible. Unfortunately I do not have a timeline to give you as I do not want to make a promise that is out of my control,\" Lambert said.\nThat's of little comfort to Marce, who is filing a lawsuit against the province.\nWith a report from CTV Vancouver's Mi-Jung Lee   \nRelated Stories Mom awaiting answers months after baby died in government care B.C. children's ministry in line for budget boost, says finance minister", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:13:41.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
