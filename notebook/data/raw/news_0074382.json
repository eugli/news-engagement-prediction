Clement was happy with what his side showed at Stamford Bridge (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \n“There’s arguably more pressure. The players know that but they’ve coped with it very well recently. I think we’ve continued to improve our performances, our shape, we don’t leave here with damaged confidence. \n“Based on chances created they deserved to win. But we had a big moment at 1-1. Who knows what would have happened had that penalty been awarded. It didn’t go our way at Chelsea. We move on.” Llorente scored again against Chelsea - having been persuaded to stay (Photo: REUTERS) \nClement also revealed that a heart-to-heart with Fernando Llorente when he first took charge persuaded the Spanish striker to stay at Swansea. \nLlorente has been instrumental in their climb to safety and Swansea had to fend off interest from Chelsea to keep him in January. \nClement added: “I just told him I want him to stay here. It was a very short conversation. There’s a lot of things involved when a player potentially moves. \n“Bottom line is he’s here as a Swansea player, fully committed, you’ve seen that again and he’ll be very important for us moving forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:27.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
