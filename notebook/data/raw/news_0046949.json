However, more erosion of the main spillway was expected, according to the Sacramento Bee.\nA levee breech occurred on the San Joaquin River around 4 p.m. PST on Monday. The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said evacuations were ordered for about 500 residents who live south of the Manteca, California. The evacuation area consisted of mostly farms and ranches.\nBy 8:45 p.m. local time Monday night, the breech had been halted thanks to emergency actions of the local Reclamation District.\nThousands were left without power, and lengthy flight delays were reported at San Francisco International Airport. At one point early Monday, delays were over three hours.\nThe international airports both in San Francisco and San Jose set new daily records for rainfall on Monday. San Francisco received 2.16 inches of rain, surpassing the 1980 record of 1.06 inches. San Jose received 1.87 inches of rain, beating the more than 100-year-old record of 0.89 inches in 1914.\nIn the Sierra Nevada, several feet of snow caused travel disruptions along Interstate 80. Due to multiple vehicle collisions, I-80 westbound was closed from the Nevada state line through Donner Pass.\nA major storm wreaked havoc across much of Northern California, resulting in damaged roadways and traffic delays.
