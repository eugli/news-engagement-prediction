Earlier this week, Iran said it would take retaliatory action. More on this... \nGhasemi said the policy of the new U.S. administration left Iran no other choice but to ban the wrestlers. \nThe competition in the western Iranian city of Kermanshah is scheduled for Feb. 16-17. \nUSA Wrestling had said it would send a team to the Freestyle World Cup, one of the most prestigious competitions in international wrestling. \nU.S. freestyle wrestlers have competed in Iran since the 1998 Takhti Cup in Tehran following an absence of nearly 20 years. Since then, Americans have attended Iran-hosted wrestling competitions 15 times. Iranians, for their part, have made 16 visits to the U.S. as guests of USA Wrestling since the 1990s. The American athletes were warmly welcomed by Iranians and sport centers were packed as they appeared on the mats to compete. \nWrestling is extremely popular in Iran and is rooted in an ancient practice of combining the sport with other physical education and meditation.
