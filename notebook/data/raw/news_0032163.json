Certainly he will not be available in the next six weeks that is for sure.\" \nWatch our Arsenal what could have been XI video: \nAt the time the Frenchman was optimistic that his midfielder would be back in action this season but four weeks later and things still don't look good for the 32 year old. \nWhat position will Arsenal finish this season?
