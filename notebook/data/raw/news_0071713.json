Or vice versa? Maybe you have a wide table that you need to use in a report or a picture that looks better in landscape orientation? \nIn Microsoft Word 2010, you can either insert section breaks manually at the top and the bottom of the page that you want in the other orientation, or you can select your text and allow Microsoft Word to insert the new sections for you. FatCamera / Getty Images Insert Section Breaks and Set the Orientation \nI prefer to set my section breaks first and then set my orientation. \nI like to tell Microsoft Word where to break the page instead of letting Word decide for me. In order to accomplish this, I insert a Next Page Section Break at the start and end of the text, table, picture, or other object for which I'll be changing the orientation. \nInsert a section break at the beginning of the area that you want to rotate: Select the Page Layout tab. Click the Breaks dropdown menu on the Page Setup section. Select Next Page in the Section Breaks section. Repeat the above steps at the end of the area you want to rotate. Open the Page Setup details window by clicking the small arrow located in the lower right corner of the section. Click the Margins tab. In the Orientation section, select Portrait or Landscape . At the bottom of the window, in the \"Apply to:\" dropdown list, choose Selected Text. Click the OK button. \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: Overview of the Ribbon Let Word Insert Section Breaks and Set the Orientation \nBy letting Microsoft Word 2010 insert section breaks, you do save mouse clicks. However, Word will place the section breaks where it decides they should be. \nYou can see these breaks and other formatting elements that are hidden by going to the Home tab in the Paragraph section and clicking the the Show/Hide buttonâ€”it is labeled with a paragraph symbol, which looks like a backward \"P.\" \nThe difficulty with letting Word place your section breaks comes when you select text. If you do not highlight the entire paragraph, multiple paragraphs, images, tables or other items, Microsoft Word 2010 moves the unselected items onto another page. Make sure you are careful when selecting the items you want in the new portrait or landscape layout orientation! \nSelect all text, images and pages that you want to switch to the new orientation. Click the Layout tab. In the Page Setup section, open the Page Setup details window by clicking the small arrow located in the lower right corner of the section. Click the Margins tab. In the Orientation section, select Portrait or Landscape . At the bottom of the window, in the \"Apply to:\" dropdown list, choose Selected Text. Click the OK button. Give It a Try! \nNow that you have seen how to apply a page orientation to a selected section in a document, give it a try. Both methods are pretty simple once you understand how to do it! \nFor more tips and tutorials for Microsoft Word from experts, visit our section devoted to Word Processing !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:45:30.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
