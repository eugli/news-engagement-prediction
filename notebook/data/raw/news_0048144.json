Lynch would be his man. \n“(Lynch) is the best player in the comp,” Brereton told SEN. \n“If you gave me an open chequebook and said start a club, who do you want to buy first? Tom Lynch is my number one target. Bar none … The best player at your club to build around, it is Tom Lynch.” \nKEY FORWARDS: ROUGHY THE FORWARD KING DESPITE HIS YEAR OUT \nBrereton is right about Lynch’s importance to the Suns. \nRodney Eade’s team targeted the key forward with 36 per cent of kicks inside 50 last year, ranked No. 1 in the AFL. There was good reason for this, though. The ex-Dandenong Stingray took a competition-high 63 contested marks and finished third in the Coleman Medal. \nAll this in a team that was missing its three best midfielders for the vast majority of the year. \n“Lynch is extraordinary,” he said. \n“He took the most contested marks last year in a team which was in the bottom four and they kicked it into the forward line like puff bags, they were hopeless. \n“He works the hardest out of every key forward, he has the best hands. He is a bit robotic in his kicking nature but he runs hard, works hard, he’s aggressive and just marks anything above head height in his area.” media_camera Tom Lynch.

Mine was the first time they ever operated on that area for a footballer. \n“I’d feel confident that he’ll come back, but being a big hip injury that I’ve got first-hand experience of, I feel for the lad. I would say there is no hope of him coming back this year.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:27:39.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
