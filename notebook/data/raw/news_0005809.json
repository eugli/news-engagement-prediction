He's not afraid to get after his guys to challenge them to be better even if it takes raising his voice to hammer a point home. \nIn Tuesday night's game against Maryland , Matta was using the same tactic to try and get to his guys in a huddle during a timeout. But during the process of finger-waving and voice-raisin', he spit his gum out -- and right into his hand. It's OK, Thad Matta, we've all done this. ðŸ˜‰ https://t.co/mNCJSQQhX0 â€” Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) February 1, 2017 \nThis is the composure of a seasoned coach. Sure, he loses his gum in front of his team. But he spits it right into his hand and, without even breaking character, continues coaching and calmly throws his gum back into his mouth. No smirk. Not even a crack of a grin. Almost like he had been practicing that trick for showtime. \nAt halftime, Ohio State was down 42-36 to Maryland in the Big Ten matchup being played in Columbus.
