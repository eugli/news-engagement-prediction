The game surrounded him growing up as the son of an Indiana high school Hall of Famer, and it has remained a fixture in his life as a high school coach for the past 22 seasons. \nHeady also knows success. In his seventh season with Carmel, he has posted a 137-37 record and won two Class 4A state championships and four sectional titles. \nA quick look around the foyer of Marian’s Physical Education Center proves the Knights know success, too. Two display cases are filled with trophies and plaques awarded in football, volleyball, golf – even bowling. One of the largest and most recent is the basketball netting from the women’s basketball team’s 2016 national championship. \nNot one visible award reads \"men’s basketball,\" though the Knights have been to the NAIA tournament four times, reaching the Elite Eight in 2001. \nAfter being named Marian’s new men’s basketball coach last Thursday , though, Heady does not expect the lack of success to last much longer. \n\"We're going to build a championship program,” Heady said Monday at his introductory news conference in a room filled with his future colleagues in the Marian athletic department. “We want to start right now building a championship culture.

All the more reason Downing, too, wants the men’s basketball to grow into a national contender. \nDowning originally considered Heady for the position when it was last available in 2015 after former Butler coach Todd Lickliter resigned with a 49-36 record after three seasons. Heady got to know the Marian program through the process and came away understanding the Knights better despite Downing going in another direction. \nTwo years later, Heady’s familiarity helped make Downing’s decision easy. Even easier considering what Downing already knew and admired about Heady. \n“I’ve had my most success with people that haven’t coached at all or were high school coaches,” Downing said. “I just think they tend to be a lot more hungrier because they do have a desire maybe to get to where some of these (other college) guys are. That’s what I wanted to do with basketball was to get a guy who was hungry.” \nDowning also conceded the obvious about bringing in a highly-respected local coach: recruiting. He expects Heady’s connections to area high school and AAU coaches and players will enhance his ability to build a “winning program” at Marian, and Heady doesn’t disagree.

Night in and night out in the MIC, you’ve got four or five Division I players at one time on the floor, so it’s not like I’m coming in and I’m not used to coaching against some talented players.” \nHeady anticipates the transition to be a challenge. Right now, he is essentially balancing two jobs – both guiding the No. 10 Greyhounds (17-4) into the state tournament and getting started on building the future of Marian basketball. \nAfter speaking with the media, Heady will take his first step into the latter territory and meet with his future players for the first time. He won’t talk about the past during their meeting. Instead, he hopes to impart a few words about what he expects. \n“It’s all about today and moving forward,” Heady said. “That’s all we’re focusing on.” \nFollow IndyStar reporter Jordan J.
