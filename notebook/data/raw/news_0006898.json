JUST WATCHED The secret cost of travel 08:19 Story highlights A la carte fares mean paying for every other upgrade to a plane ticket Hotels often charge additional resort fees to supposedly cover hotel upkeep (CNN) Baggage fees, late check-out fees, extra legroom. Everywhere you look, ancillary fees from airlines to hotels are nibbling into travel budgets. The days are gone when buying a flight or a hotel stay meant you'd purchased the full experience. Having been lured in by that attractive basic fare, you can be stung for everything from inflight headset rental to a $6 bottle of water in your suite. So how does the savvy traveler combat hidden charges and get value for money? It's time to take charge, says consumer behavior expert Jen Drexler. \"You can no longer just show up at the airport, get on whatever seat was chosen for you, show up at any hotel that was chosen for you. Read More \"You still have to be a really aggressive consumer.\" Ancillary airline fees By one estimate , global airlines raked in more than $59 billion in fees in 2015. And while the trend for ancillary fees began with low-cost carriers, full-service airlines have followed suit. \"I think one of the worst ones is the change fees,\" says George Hobica, president of airfarewatchdog.com . In North America, \"it used to cost nothing to change a ticket or a schedule. Now it's $200. \"It doesn't cost the airline $200 to change the ticket. You actually do it yourself.\" This push to cash in at every opportunity has led to carriers devising more categories of seats, allowing for more a la carte fees. Adds Hobica, \"Now what we're seeing is about five different strata of cabins,\" from first-class downwards. If you buy one of the super-cheap fares, \"you're going to be in the last row by the bathroom.\" MORE: Low-cost airlines: They changed the world -- but what next? Loyalty programs Frequent travelers have long relied on loyalty programs to bring in sweet perks, from free upgrades to checked bags. \"You think if you get to this next level of status you're going to be treated better,\" says Brian Whitney, senior vice president of sales at Allure Global and a regular business traveler. But elite status doesn't buy what it used to. Explains Hobica, \"It used to be that the number one reason to be loyal to a particular airline was the free upgrade.\" With airlines selling more of these seats -- and some airlines routinely overselling -- \"it's almost impossible now to get an upgrade.\" Ancillary hotel fees Hyatt is relaunching its loyalty program in 2017. And while airlines might be the biggest culprits, the hotel industry has also been upping their game. It's an approach that's been paying off -- global hotel industry revenue was predicted to reach $550 billion in 2016.
