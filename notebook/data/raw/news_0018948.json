We caught up with Ashley Henry , who'll lead the group's advocacy and partnership development efforts, to find out a bit more about Business for a Better Portland's plans. Is the intention of BBP to compete directly with the Portland Business Alliance? We’ve found that our approach and culture attracts a different type of business than would be part of a traditional chamber of commerce. We see ourselves not as a trade association but as a community-building organization, built on the premise that a thriving city supports thriving businesses. That’s why we’ve set out to collaborate with government and nonprofits on community-wide problems like housing affordability, shared prosperity and workforce diversity. We’re hopeful that we’ll find ways to collaborate with PBA and other business groups on the priority issues we’ve identified. Are you planning to hire more staffers? How many? This organization is young and functions more like a start-up. Right now, we’re figuring out the best way to structure staffing so that we can have maximum impact while still operating in a nimble manner. What's your role in it? I am focusing on what I do best, which is connecting people in the business community with government and nonprofit leaders who want to make Portland a better place, sort of like a Chief Collaboration Officer. I expect Business For A Better Portland will engage other consultants as the membership grows to compliment my contributions and add new expertise. It certainly does take human capital to make an organization work — but we’re confident we’ll find new ways of leveraging different people’s strengths, as well as harnessing technology, all in service to a better city. How are you funded? I see you're a 501(c)6, but, does that mean using membership dues, fundraising, for-profit programs, etc? Right now, we’re funded by our members, all of whom have stepped up to forge collaborative relationships between the business community, non-profit organizations, and government so we can advocate for an equitable and prosperous Portland. The organization was incorporated by the great women of Catalyst Law as a 501(c)6 because we wanted to be clear that this is indeed a business organization. Portland already has a lot of wonderful 501(c03s working on a wide variety of social and environmental issues, but is lacking a business organization that clearly articulates the connection between the health of business and the health of the community. In other words, our members see social and environmental issues as business issues. For example, If an employee cannot make it to work because their family was evicted without cause or their child was injured on an unsafe street, stable housing and safe streets become business issues very quickly.
