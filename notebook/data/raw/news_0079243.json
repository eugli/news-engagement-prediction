Credit: PA 28 February 2017 • 6:09pm \nR onald Koeman has admitted that Everton are ready to offer Wayne Rooney an emotional return. \nKoeman will step up his interest in the Manchester United striker at the end of the season, insisting the 31-year-old could become a crucial player in his Goodison Park revolution. \nRooney has snubbed offers from China to stay with United for the rest of the season but a future under Jose Mourinho appears unlikely. \nAnd Everton are weighing up a renewed move to bring the England star back to Merseyside, nearly 13 years after he left for United in a £27million deal. \n“I believe that Wayne Rooney is still playing at a high level,” said the Everton manager. Rooney has turned down offers from China \n“I think he made a good choice to stay at Manchester United and in the Premier League because he has still two or three years in front of him to play on a high level. \n“What will happen at the end of the season? I don’t know but in my opinion he is one of the players who can make Everton more stronger. It’s all about what the player likes, what Manchester United needs to do, and we are not involved in that project. \n“But every player that we at Everton think can make the team stronger is welcome to Everton.” \nR ooney came through the Everton academy to make his debut in 2002 at the age of 16, scoring his first league goal against Arsenal in just his tenth appearance.
