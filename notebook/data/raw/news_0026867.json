They have to lose three games, and we have to win all our games.

So we have to go game by game, narrow the gap. \n“We are second now, the gap between second and sixth is nothing, but we're so happy to be second and in this position, and to make the difference a little narrower from Chelsea.” \nAguero made an impact after starting on the bench for the third league game running but coming on in the 15th minute. Sergio Aguero claims the goal later given to Tyrone Mings (Photo: Getty Images) \nTyrone Mings got the final touch on Sterling's cross for City's second under pressure from Aguero who wheeled off celebrating. \nGuardiola said: “I'm happy for him. For how he played, how he tried, and I thought he scored. He's an important player. \n\"He didn't play the last few games because the three guys were amazing. Now it's the FA Cup then the Champions League. That's why we need a contribution from Sergio. He's so important for us.” Pep Guardiola was delighted with Sergio Aguero's performance (Photo: Getty Images) \nJesus was forced off early on with an ankle injury and Guardiola added: \"In the morning we will know exactly. Hopefully – I will pray tonight – it will not be a big issue.\" \nBournemouth's hopes of stunning City to end their wait for a league win in 2017 were undermined by first half injuries to captain Simon Francis and midfielder Jack Wilshere. \nCherries boss Eddie Howe said: “Jack is just feeling his ankle. I don't think there's a major injury there. Aguero got his chance when Gabriel Jesus went down (Photo: Getty Images) \n“He just felt he couldn't move as freely as he wanted to and had a pain in his ankle, so we took him off. \n“Simon is feeling his hamstring again, similar pain to the first time. Any injuries we get to established first-team players are going to be difficult to manage. \n“We needed a positive response to the Everton game, and got that. The attitude and motivation to the team was a very good level. \n“We need to get our bounce back, and that will only come from a win, but that was a positive step forward.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:36:15.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
