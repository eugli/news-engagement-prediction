Roads have become obstructed as they disappear under fast-flowing water. \nCars have fallen prey to the floods. \nFlood warnings remain in place as widespread showers are expected across much of the country. \nGauteng Weather has issued the following reminder; 20cm of water can sweep a car off the road; half a metre can float a car; and you should never drive around barricades. Precaution: Never drive into water covering the road as you may not know how deep it is or if the road has been washed away. — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) February 21, 2017 Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
