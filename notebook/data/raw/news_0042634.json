He was last seen wearing dark bottoms and a dark jacket. \nThe gunman is described as having his face covered and was wearing white shoes, grey tracksuit bottoms with a stripe down each side, a grey hoody and a dark coat. \nThe second man, who was believed to be armed with a knife, is described as having his face covered and he was wearing a green coat, dark Nike trainers and grey tracksuit bottoms. \nA manhunt is now under way and police are carrying out an extensive search of the area. \nThe public are being warned not to approach the killer - described as dangerous - as he could also be in the company of the armed men who ambushed the car. \nAn investigation into the full circumstances of the incident is ongoing and Merseyside Police is working with the Ministry of Justice and other forces across the country to establish Walmsley's whereabouts. \nPolice are asking who has seen him, or knows where he is, to contact them on 999 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
