His father made a call to 911 only after two hours of prayer (Pictures: Global News) Alexandru had previously been taken by social services only to be taken back by his parents a year later who refused to believe he had diabetes. ‘Mr. and Mrs. Radita intended to and did isolate Alex from anyone who could intervene or monitor his insulin treatment aside from themselves,’ said Horner. Mike Pence uses the Nicaraguan flag to tweet support for Israel Adding: ‘They knew he was dying.’ The devout Romanian Pentecostal churchgoers, who have seven other children, told friends that their son had died but had been ‘brought back’ by God. In a call to the emergency services his father said that he had come home from work and found his son ‘not breathing’. His mother allegedly told friends her son had died but come back to life (Picture: Global News) Alexandru died in 2013 but his parents have only been brought to justice now – neither showed any emotion when sentenced. His declining health was not sudden but took ‘probably years’ the judge said. Dose so high Kim Jong-nam died within 20 minutes of being poisoned The boy’s neglect had been so bad even his teeth had rotted away, according to the Alberta Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jeffery Gofton. Gofton added that fat and muscles reserves were so low he could not fight the sepsis that eventually killed him, the Calgary Sun said. Patricia MacDonald, a social worker that tried to stop the boy being returned to his parents, was in court for the verdict.

I think that it really is justice for Alex. He went through a horrible ending to his life and I’m glad to see his parents being held accountable.’ Alexandru’s former Kindergarten teacher wrote to children’s ministries: ‘He is free of his suffering now and resting in peace.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:55:56.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
