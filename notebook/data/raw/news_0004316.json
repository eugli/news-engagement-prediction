If you want to cut the cord completely from your next pair of wireless headphones, but don't like the look of the new Apple AirPods, what are your options? We've rounded-up all the truly wireless alternatives, so you don't have to... \nApple’s AirPods represent a cord-cutting ideal for the company. Since removing the headphone jack from its new flagship smartphones the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , Apple is hoping that the £159 AirPods - its first ever wireless in-ear headphones - will set a new benchmark for the product category. \nThe AirPods are certainly a tempting prospect. They boast unique features and functionality, including super-quick pairing thanks to Apple's new W1 wireless chip, the ability to activate Siri with just a simple tap of one of the earpods, and infrared sensors that allow them to stop and start music when they're removed from your ears. \nBut the AirPods aren't without competition. A number of manufacturers have produced or are in the process of producing their own cord-cutting in-ear buds. While they may not have all the same features as the AirPods, they're still worth investigating, even if it's purely because of their looks. You don't have to take our word for it - have a look below and see for yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:53:48.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
