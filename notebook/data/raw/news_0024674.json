And it was on this big grid, and if we hit our goal, then our line was green. If it was 5 percent under, we were yellow. If it was 10 percent under, it was red. That’s when we needed to have a corrective action plan — why we didn’t hit the goal, what we were going to do differently next time.” \nShe also said employees were trained to manipulate women into choosing to abort their children by bringing up the costs associated with raising a family. \n“We would say things like, ‘Your pregnancy test, your visit today is X number of dollars, how much are you going to be able to pay toward that?’” Ms. Thayer said. “If they say, ‘I’m not able to pay today,’ then we would say something like, ‘Well, if you can’t pay $10 today, how are you going to take care of a baby? Have you priced diapers? Do you know how much it costs to buy a car seat?’” \n“‘So, really, don’t you think your smartest choice is termination?’” she would say. “‘We can take care of that, set it up for you.’” \nMarianne Anderson, a former nurse at Planned Parenthood, says she felt more like an “abortion salesman” than a medical professional sometimes. \n“I felt like I was more of a salesman sometimes, to sell abortions,” Ms. Anderson says in the video. “We were told on a regular basis that you have a quota to meet to keep this clinic open. \n“We were constantly told you have quotas to meet to stay open,” she continues. “It was just, like I said, I felt more like I was selling abortion sometimes than treating people.” \nMs. Thayer says Planned Parenthood also offers perks for clinics that exceeded their abortion quota, including pizza parties and paid time off. \n“It is true, we would have things like pizza parties,” Ms. Thayer says. “Occasionally they would say things like, you can have 2 hours of PTO. If your center consistently hit goals and you were green all the time, three months in a row, you might be center manager of the month and get to go to Des Moines and have lunch with the upper management or something.” \nThe Live Action video is the latest in its Abortion Corporation series, which highlights the ways in which Planned Parenthood promotes abortion at the expense of women’s health. \nRepublican lawmakers have vowed to defund the abortion giant and redirect its more than $500 million taxpayer budget to women’s health centers that do not perform abortions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:42:34.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
