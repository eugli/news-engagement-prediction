By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 17:18 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Ace comedienne Bharti Singh is ready to take the next big step in her life very soon. The 32-year-old comedienne is all set to tie the knot with longtime boyfriend Haarsh Limbhachiyaa. \n\"I am very excited for the wedding but more so for all the ceremonies, like 'mehandi' and 'sangeet'. I want to do it all because all throughout the year we work hard and don't get to do these things,\" Bharti told PTI. \n\"Haarsh is so simple that he doesn't like all this 'shor-sharaba' but I am opposite, I like all these things. He had to agree with me because I am his would-be wife,\" she quipped. MUST READ Comedian Bharti Singh secretly engaged? Here's the truth \n\"By November-December, we will get married. We haven't decided a date yet because there are a lot of shows we are working on. When I want to get married, I wouldn't like to do anything for one month before that. I want to just get busy with pre-wedding preparations. Shootings will keep happening but marriage happens only once.\" \nAt present Bharti is busy shooting for 'Bittu Bak Bak' along with Krushna Abhishek. The show is a comic relief filler, formulated as spoofs on iconic scenes from Bollywood. \nTalking about working with Krushna, she revealed that having collaborated several times in the past, makes things absolutely at ease. \n\"I get so comfortable when Krushna is around. There are certain things which if I can't do, he will handle. He doesn't have any ego that 'I am the star so don't give any lines to Bittu where he takes my case'.\" \nBharti says she realised the reach of the show when she was approached by a fan in Maldives who called out her name as 'Bittu' and credits the entire team, including Haarsh who has written the gags. \n\"We shoot all the gags together and the experience on set is lively. Right from the light 'dada' to actors, we have a ball shooting it. There is a lot of improvisation and comfort zone. I am friends with all the unit and on top of it, Haarsh is writing it. So it is very peaceful.\" \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 17:18 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:57:26.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
