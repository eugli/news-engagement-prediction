Image copyright James Barnard Image caption Separated at birth? Colum Eastwood (top) and James Barnard could easily be mistaken for one another It's been a busy few weeks on the assembly election trail, and the party leaders have been hopping from one end of Northern Ireland to the other on a daily basis. \nThe leader of the SDLP has used his Eastwood Express to tour the constituencies , but has he also been employing a body double to head out on the canvass? \nIt appears that Colum Eastwood has a striking doppelganger, who could come in handy in the final furlong of this campaign. \nLondon-based James Barnard has jokingly offered to stand in for the nationalist candidate at pre-election parties, should he be required. \nMr Barnard was at a gym on Tuesday night when he spotted an election report on the BBC News at Ten, featuring Mr Eastwood. Image copyright James Barnard Image caption Mr Barnard's wife once mistook a photo of Colum Eastwood for her husband \nHe decided to put together a spot-the-difference series of photos, recreating some of the SDLP leader's poses from the campaign trail and tweeted it to him. \nThe resemblance is so striking that Mr Barnard's wife once mistook a photo of Mr Eastwood for her husband. \nHe is, however, missing a couple of key features. \nFirstly, he can't replicate that distinctive Londonderry accent - he's originally from Lincolnshire, and that won't cut the mustard when it comes to political grillings from the press. \nAnd then there's that peculiar little white patch on Mr Eastwood's beard. \nThe graphic designer said he wouldn't be dying his beard, but he has another solution, as he could use a bit of digital trickery to complete the Eastwood look. Creating a healthier Belfast Image caption Dozens of people were at the MAC ion Belfast for an election debate on health issues \nAlways one of the primary issues at polling time, health has been high on the agenda again in this election campaign. \nIn Belfast on Wednesday, health charities, support bodies and trade unions put their questions to candidates at a hustings event hosted by the Belfast Healthy Cities organisation. \nThe focus was on changing lifestyles - greater freedom for breastfeeding mothers and wider access to green spaces, for example - and on adding sustainability to the health service, through social care reform and investment in mental health services. \nJoan Devlin, the health policy and promotion organisation's chief executive, said Stormont needed to commit to long-term plans to tackle inequality in the health system. \nShe said that instability at Stormont could hamper plans to press forward on those plans, adding that it was \"essential\" for parties to agree on health matters. \n\"Having the assembly obviously gives us much closer contact to our ministers and they obviously have a much greater understanding of the key issues,\" she said. \n\"But if we can work with civil servants in developing those long-term strategies that will have an impact on improved living that would be an acceptable way forward as an interim.\" \nRachelle Adams, a masters student in sustainable development at Queen's University in the city, said she still had to be convinced that words from prospective politicians would ultimately become action. \n\"I really question how it's going to be implemented in practice,\" she said. \n\"I don't know if sustainability is really on their agenda, and the social detriments of health, like the increase in the number of people with lifestyle diseases and the focus on preventative care. \n\"I just hope it's not aspirational, and they're really going to implement it in practice.\" \nBBC News NI's Campaign Catch-up will keep you across the Northern Ireland Assembly election trail with a daily dose of the main stories, the minor ones and the lighter moments in the run up to polling day on Thursday 2 March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:39:58.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
