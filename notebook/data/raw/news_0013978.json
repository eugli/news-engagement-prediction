Congress released its fourth list of candidates on Saturday, taking its tally to 104 candidates, so far. As part of their pre-poll alliance, Congress and SP had agreed to contest 105 and 298 seats, respectively, in UP’s 403 seat assembly. \n\nThe Congress has so far fielded candidates on three assembly seats in the Amethi Lok Sabha - Tiloi, Salon and Jagdishpur, and four under the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha -Bachhrawan, Harchandpur, Rae Bareli, and Sareni seats. SP MLAs from Gauriganj, Rakesh Pratap Singh and Unchahar MLA Manoj Pandey, have already filed their nominations. \n\nThe final name for the Amethi assembly seat, where SP announced the candidature of legislator-minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati, however, remains in limbo. \n\nCongress campaign committee chairman Sanjay Singh is attempting to wrest control of the Amethi seat for wife Amita. With Saturday’s list leaving only one seat open, the scales appear to have been tipped in Akhilesh’ favour. Congress’ fourth list also accommodated SP MLA Ram Chandra Chaudhary’s son Angad from the reserved Kadipur assembly in Sultanpur, while runner-up in the Campiyarganj seat in 2012, SP’s Chinta Yadav, will contest on hand symbol this time. \n\nFormer SP MLA Samad Ansari, denied a SP ticket, has been fielded by Congress from Varanasi North. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:33:59.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
