Video provided by Newsy Newslook \nSAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk has made it quite clear that serving as an advisor to President Trump is better than attacking him. \nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO used that argument recently in explaining why he would remain on the president's new economic advisory council with more than a dozen other top CEOs. \nBut now his own companies have taken a bolder stand against the administration, as part of 31 new signatories to an amicus brief that opposes Trump's controversial immigration ban. \nThat makes more than 125 overwhelmingly tech-focused companies that have signed the brief, which was filed Sunday evening in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The brief, signed by the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, supports a lawsuit filed in federal court last Monday by Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson that asked that key provisions of the executive order be declared unconstitutional. \nLate Monday, Justice Department officials urged the appeals court judge to reinstate the ban on grounds that not doing so endangered national security. \nFile photo taken on Feb. 3, 2017 shows President Trump talking with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, center, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon during a White House meeting with business leaders. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) \nMusk, a prolific tweeter, had not commented on his company's actions as of late Monday. On Sunday, Musk noted that \"activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?\" \nThat comment was retweeted by AOL founder turned investor Steve Case, who added a link to a self-penned Medium post echoing the same refrain while lamenting the absence of former President Roland Reagan. At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017 \nThat said, Musk's views on the immigration ban are not unknown. On Jan. 28, he tweeted that \"the blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges.\" \nAfter last Friday's debut meeting of Trump's business council, Musk noted that thanks to his insistance, the travel ban issue went from \"not mentioning (it) to having it be first and foremost.\" \nTrump's executive order, signed a week after he took office, halted entry of all refugees for 120 days, banned admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and barred entry for three months of citizens from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The three non-tech companies on that tech amicus brief \nIn response to that suit, Senior Judge James Robart of U.S. District Court in Seattle on Friday issued a nationwide restraining order on the immigration order. On Sunday, the 9th Circuit appeals court, considered the nation's most liberal, declined to reinstate the restrictions. \nTrump has sharply criticized the court decisions, and his Administration says the ban is necessary to weed out immigrants with intentions of terrorism. Eventually, the Supreme Court may decide. Courts do take note of who files friends-of-the-court briefs. Elon Musk's dance with Trump courts controversy, but could pack rewards \nTech companies have been vocal about how the ban has affected some of their employees, and many have offered to help staffers with legal issues and fees. \nGoogle set up a $4 million crisis fund aimed at four organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, that were working on immigration causes. \nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.
