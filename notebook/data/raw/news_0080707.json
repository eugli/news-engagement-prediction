DISNEY \nDigital painters also had to remove Forest Whitaker's feet in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. \n\"I was the lead paint artist on the show for London so the paint work coming out of London was my baby. I felt really protective over it and was incredibly proud of the calibre of work we produced.\" \nThe characters her team worked on have earned a place in Star Wars lore, such as droll robot K-2SO and resistance leader Saw Gerrera, played by Whitaker. \n\"Some of the bigger work I did was removing Saw Gerrera's foot in the introductory shot of him. Tricky, tricky work but satisfying to see in the final film,\" de Schot said. \nHer team also did a lot of the paint work for the sequence set on the planet of Jedha. Ad Feedback \nK-2SO actor Alan Tudyk was acting on stilts and it was the team's job to remove him from the footage so the computer-generated robot could appear in his place. \nReflecting on being a part of the Star Wars legacy, de Schot said she was \"pretty blown away\". \n\"Watching the final film with my team was surreal. Seeing my name in the credits of a Star Wars film was surreal. I had a moment where I thought, how did a little s... from Masterton end up souping [up] a Star Wars film? It's incredible.\" \nAlthough there are usually big-name stars involved in each production, de Schot's digital effects teams tend to spend most of their time sitting in semi-dark rooms, staring at computer monitors. \n\"So there is no real glamour in our day-to-day working lives,\" she said, although she did manage to get Rogue One director Gareth Edwards' autograph. \nBefore joining Industrial Light and Magic she worked at visual effects company Double Negative. There, she was part of a team that won an Oscar and a Bafta award for their visual effects work on the the Christopher Nolan sci-fi movie Interstellar . \nComing home to visit was always special, she said. \n\"There is nothing on earth that can replace the utter peace and joy of sitting with your mum on her back porch with a glass of New Zealand wine.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:21:53.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
