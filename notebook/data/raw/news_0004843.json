Reddish Vale High School (Photo: Google) Read More Reddish Vale High School is removed from special measures \nMr Short informed school governors of his decision on Tuesday night. He will stay on as head until the end of the end of the school term. \nThe head told the M.E.N. he had resigned due to personal reasons. He said his decision was not related to the resignations of the other staff. \nIn a newsletter due to be sent out to parents Thursday, the chair of Governors, Pete McCaldon, said: “This is a sad day as Mr Short has been at the school as a teacher and Headteacher for 15 years and has been unstinting in his hard work, loyalty and contribution both to the school and the local community. \n“Over the last few years he has overseen the improvement to the school including the excellent exam results last summer. I am sure you will wish to join me to thank him for his dedication to the school and to wish him the very best in his new endeavours. Reddish Vale High School Reddish Vale Technology College put into special measures after 'inadequate' Ofsted report \n“The school have also seen a number of other staff changes who have for personal reasons chosen to leave the school including Mr Tipping, Mr Thomas-Lowde, Ms Cox and Mr Ablett. “Again the school have been grateful for their devotion to the children, school and the local community over their years of service to the school; they will be sorely missed but again we wish them well in their future undertakings.” \nReddish Vale High School, an independent academy, was the subject of a damming Ofsted report in February 2015. \nInspectors put the school in special measures after it was judged to be criticial in all areas. \nBut subsequent follow up visits had revealed signs of improvement at the school. \nIt was formally taken out of special measures in February 2016 but is still rated as ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted. \nMr Short and Mr McCaldon did not wish to issue a separate statement to the M.E.N. regarding the matter.
