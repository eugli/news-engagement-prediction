David Richardson demanded action following a series of surprise visits over the past 18 months, the private prison operator that runs the facility — Management Training Corp . of Centerville, Utah — received approval from the state to repair and replace the water heater, at a cost to taxpayers of nearly $10,000. But Warden Shelly Sonberg never authorized the work. \nRichardson, a Miami Beach Democrat, announced another inspection this month, this time with Chad Poppell, the head of the Department of Management Services, the state agency that oversees private prisons, and two other state legislators. \nIn the two days before they arrived, four work crews descended on the prison and made many of the repairs. The vice president of the private prison operator, Management Training Corp., also arrived in town to meet with state officials. The state’s chief inspector general, Melinda Miguel, dispatched inspectors to assess the safety and welfare of the inmates. \nFor Richardson, who has been on a one-man mission to force change in Florida’s troubled prison system, it’s another frustrating example of the failure of the state to monitor and hold accountable its prison operators.

Why is it that I’m out there fixing water heaters?” he said. \nIn a letter to Richardson Thursday, Poppell said he has since removed the state-paid official in charge of monitoring conditions at the prison and has also launched his own investigation. \nHe said the 22-year-old prison, like other private prisons built by the state, are “now beginning to show their age and present problems associated with older buildings.” He said he has asked the Legislature to fund a full-time staff person to monitor “evolving infrastructure issues.” Lisa Graybill \nWhen the U.S. Justice Department announced its plan to phase out the use of private prisons, it confirmed what critics have long known and many states are just beginning to comprehend: It doesn't pay to put this vital government function into the hands of profit-making ventures. \nPrivate prisons... \nWhen the U.S. Justice Department announced its plan to phase out the use of private prisons, it confirmed what critics have long known and many states are just beginning to comprehend: It doesn't pay to put this vital government function into the hands of profit-making ventures. \nPrivate prisons... (Lisa Graybill) \nWhen Richardson returned Thursday with two investigators from the Florida Department of Corrections as requested by Miguel, other problems emerged at the prison, which houses 1,530 inmates in four dorms. They learned that there are 495 open work orders for repairs. Inmates said they had been pressured not to speak to inspectors and feared retaliation.
