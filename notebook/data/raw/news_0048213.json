Whether they consider themselves lucky probably depends on how much space they have... \nThe store in question is currently selling mattresses which have cleverly been compressed into rolls so they can be easily transported, the Bath Chronicle reported. Lidl, Lower Bristol Road, Bath (Photo: Bath Chronicle) \nAt £59.99 for a single and £79.99 for a double, the Meradiso mattress is pretty good value for money. \nOnce opened, the instructions say the mattresses will expand into their actual size within 24 to 36 hours. \nAll of which is a wonderful feat of engineering, designed to make the lives of shoppers a lot easier. \nHowever, a 'Lidl' advertising error saw king-sized mattresses labelled as being regular double ones, meaning there have been plenty of shoppers who, a day after liberating their mattresses from their packaging, found they don't fit their beds. \nNor can they be easily returned, with mattresses being awkward and heavy to move around. D'oh (Photo: Bath Chronicle) \nThe Bath store has since put up a notice saying the mattresses were wrongly advertised and apologised for the error. \nBut now the customers stuck with their jumbo mattresses don't necessarily have the transportation means to return them. \nA shopper who called customer services said she was happy to return the mattress but pointed out that, as it had been opened, it would no longer fit into the boot of her Nissan Micra. \nShe can't be the only one facing this conundrum.
