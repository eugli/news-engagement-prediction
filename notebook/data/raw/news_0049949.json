(Credit: Facebook / Ryan Brady) \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nA Massapequa man is being praised for tipping cops off to an ATM card skimmer at a 7-Eleven in Seaford. \nRyan Brady, 33, alerted Nassau County police to a card skimmer installed in the store’s ATM, and posted video to Facebook of cops removing the device on Feb. 17. His post has since been shared more than 200,000 times. Most Popular \nBrady said he went to the 7-Eleven on Sunrise Highway at about 6:30 p.m. Before using the ATM to withdraw cash, Brady pulled on the card reader — something he does before using any ATM to check for skimmers. \nBrady said he became suspicious when he squeezed the card reader and it “flexed a little bit.” \nUpon further inspection, Brady says he saw a piece of plastic behind the card reader as well as a small hole above the ATM’s keypad, which he guessed was a camera. \nHe called police, who came to the store and quickly removed the skimming device and camera. \nFacebook users have used the comment section to thank Brady for his actions. \n“I was hoping this would be popular because it’s the kind of thing people should know about,” Brady said of the post. \nPolice said they’re actively investigating the incident. \n7-Eleven manager Fazli Subhan said they do not know who installed the skimmers and are working with police in the investigation.
