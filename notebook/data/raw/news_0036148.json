I am a dedicated worker of the party,” he said. \nThe RPI (A) is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP and its chief Athawale is minister of state for social justice and empowerment in the Modi government. Pathak is contesting on a ticket from RPI(A), an ally of NDA. (Adarsh Gupta/HTPhoto) \nPathak however dismissed notions that his contesting polls—against BJP MLA Ravindra Jaiswal—would affect the alliance. \n“My candidature will not affect our alliance. I am the admirer of PM Modi who is doing a great job,” Pathak, who will hit the campaign trail on Friday, said. \nConfident of victory, Pathak claimed the RPI(A) will play a crucial role in the formation of the government in UP after the assembly polls and his candidature would not affect BJP’s alliance with the party. \nInspired by Modi’s journey from ‘chaiwala’ (tea vendor) to Prime Minister, Pathak hopes to make it big in politics. “I believe in karma and I am here with full commitment. Hard work and karma together yield desired results.” \nVaranasi has eight assembly seats. BJP has won three seats: Cantt, Varanasi south, Varanasi north in the last elections. This time, the party has trusted new faces on four seats and has denied ticket to seven-time MLA Shyamdeo Roy Chaudhary.
