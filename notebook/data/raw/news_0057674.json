A five-station outdoor batting cage is in the works for Humboldt Park. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Leonor Vivanco on Wednesday proposed covering half the cost of the $656,000 project by using $325,000 in tax-increment financing assistance. Use of the funds still requires City Council approval. The remaining cost would be funded by the Chicago Park District, spokeswoman Jessica Maxey-Faulkner said. She said construction would start this spring on the batting cage. \nThe mechanical machines serving up pitches ranging from 40 mph to 70 mph would be available to baseball and softball leagues and to the public. The park is already home to the Little Cubs Field featuring a scoreboard resembling the marquee at Wrigley Field, and a future honorary street designation for Cubs World Series champion Javier Baez, approved by the city in January. \nThe Humboldt Park outdoor batting cage would be the third one on Park District property. Two others are located on the South Side at West Lawn Park and on the North Side at Warren Park in West Rogers Park, according to the Park District's website. \nThe new facility would be dedicated in honor of Nancy Franco-Maldonado, the alderman's wife who died in December 2015 following a battle with cancer. Ald. Roberto Maldonado of the 26th ward led the community-driven request for the project, according to the Park District.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:00:54.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
