Up to 70 people threw stones and other objects, including 20 to 30 masked men, according to the New York Times .\nA newspaper photographer was attacked by a dozen men and his camera was stolen.\nPolice confirmed that an officer fired a warning shot at the scene.\nNobody was reportedly arrested beyond the initial drug-related arrest.\nRiots such as this one have occurred in Stockholm's suburbs in the past, but officials said they are infrequent.\nThe riots gained special media attention in the U.S. because they came after Trump said at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday that Sweden has experienced growing turmoil amid a surge of immigration, especially from refugees.\n\" When you look at what's happening in Germany, when you look at what's happening last night in Sweden, Sweden!\" Trump said. \"Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nTrump later clarified that he was not referring to a specific security incident, which did not occur, but rather a Fox News report he saw on a general increase of crime in Sweden.\nThere is still debate over whether there has been an increase in crime in Sweden since the country began taking in a large number of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa.\n  Issues and tagged Donald Trump , Immigration , Police  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:57:35.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
