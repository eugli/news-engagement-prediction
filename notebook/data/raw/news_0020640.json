They have aliens up front. It would be a dream.\" He told Canal+. \nBarca's potent attacking trident is no doubt the greatest strikeforce in football, but despite them having 'aliens', Lacazette remains hopeful he will one day grace their iconic shirt. \n\" If that happens, great, but I am not here to say that I will take a place from Luis Suarez. But I would like to play for them one day.\" \nThe Frenchman has been attracting plenty of attention with Arsenal, West Ham, PSG and Barca all reportedly keen on snapping him up. \nThough he won't come cheap. \nAccording to L'Equipe , Lacazette's contract, which expires in 2019, sees him have a Â£60 million release clause, which could put off potential suitors. \nIs Lacazette to Barca a good fit?
