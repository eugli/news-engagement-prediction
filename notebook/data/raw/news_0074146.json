Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 THIS IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. @POTUS ACTS OUT OF FEAR AND HATRED OF EVERYTHING HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. #RESIST https://t.co/SG9UgSH7R1 \n— Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) February 23, 2017 \nClick inside to read more reactions from celebs… What an asshole!
