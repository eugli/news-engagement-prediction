Analysis revealed he met a brutal end, Metro reported. \nUniversity of Dundee anthropologist Professor Dame Sue Black detailed his terrible injuries. \nThe man's skeleton was found in a cross-legged position, with large stones holding down his legs and arms \n\"As you can see from the facial reconstruction, he was a striking young man but he met a very brutal end, suffering a minimum of five severe injuries to his head. \n\"The fourth impact was intended to end his life as probably the same weapon was driven through his skull from one side and out the other as he lay on the ground,\" she said. \nThe young man suffered terrible injuries more than 1000 years ago. UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE \nThe man's skeleton was found by archaeologists excavating the hideaway in the Black Isle. \nThe bones were sent to University of Dundee's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) for analysis. Experts painstakingly reconstructed the man's face from his battered skull. \nRadiocarbon dating indicated he died some time between 430 and 630 AD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:57:07.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
