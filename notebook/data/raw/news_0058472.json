They obey, snipping away at critical parts of a cell until it implodes. The command structure is called the wheel of death, or, if you’re a scientist, the apoptosome. \nBut the process, called programmed cell death, or apoptosis—from the Greek for “leaves falling from a tree”—is a normal part of life. Apoptosis is perhaps best known for its role in cancer, either killing cancer cells as they start to proliferate or failing to kill them. \nAt the center of all this destruction is the apop­tosome, the cellular structure that facilitates programmed cell death. Scientists have known of its existence for decades, and over time they have slowly, painstakingly, built models of its structure to better understand its function. In October 2016, a team led by Christopher Akey , a School of Medicine professor of physiology and biophysics , revealed the most detailed three-dimensional model of the apoptosome to date. The model, published in the journal eLife , answers some questions and raises others. Ultimately, a better understanding of how cell death occurs may lead to treatment options that can enhance or suppress it. \nApoptosis is an elegant process. When a wayward cell is marked for death, either by internal or external signals, proteins puncture the mitochondria—those jelly bean-shaped structures that supply cells with fuel—causing a small mol­ecule called cytochrome c to leak out. The liberated cytochrome c, drifting through the cell, connects with another protein, called Apaf-1, causing it to assemble into the wheel-shaped apoptosome. \nThe central hub of the wheel docks with a protein-cutting enzyme called procaspase-9, which, once activated, tells other proteins to dismantle the cell. Akey’s new image of the apoptosome—also called the wheel of death. A key feature is the spiral disk on the central hub, shown here in four-colored protein pairs, which helps activate a critical protein-cutting enzyme. Image courtesy of Christopher Akey “The proteins that become activated then go throughout the cell—not indiscriminately at all, they have a few hundred targets—they cleave these things, and it leads to cell destruction,” says Akey, corresponding author on the eLife paper. “The cell starts to collapse from the inside out.”\nAkey has been studying the structure of the apoptosome for 18 years. The question he sought to answer this time: how is procaspase-9 activated? \nTo find out, the team used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, in which biological samples are cooled rapidly, before the water molecules within them can form damaging ice crystals. “The cooling rate is so high that the water molecules just stop moving. They don’t have time to crystallize,” says Akey. “You freeze-frame it, literally.” This technique, along with better stabilizers, detectors, and computing power, has allowed Akey and his team to capture increasingly detailed photographs of the apoptosome. “Our first structure, which was published in 2002, was at about 25-angstrom resolution,” says Akey. An angstrom is a unit of length equal to one ten-billionth of a meter; a hydrogen atom measures about half an angstrom across. “We could see the wheel, we could see some details. But now we’re at 4-angstrom resolution. So that’s a huge difference.” \nThe new pictures appear to show that a disk on the central hub of the wheel of death—not the whole superstructure—is the key. Shaped like a spiral, the disk can dock three to four procaspase-9 enzymes, and each pair of enzymes can then activate itself. “It’s weird,” says Tat Cheung Cheng, lead author on the eLife paper and a former postdoctoral fellow under Akey. “It means the whole platform underneath is not really necessary. It seems to be just to help form the disk, and that’s it.” \nUltimately, even higher resolution photos may give scientists still more definitive answers. “If you get really high resolution, you can see the actual atoms. That requires something like two-angstrom resolution,” says Akey, whose work is funded by the National Institutes of Health . About the author: Barbara Moran \nBarbara Moran can be reached at .
