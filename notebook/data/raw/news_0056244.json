The Trump News Network, of course. \nOn The Tonight Show Tuesday, Jimmy Fallon introduced a \"YouTube livestream\" available to watch 24/7, while doing his hilarious Trump impression. \nWhat does the news look like when Fallon's Trump takes it into his own \"abnormally, gigantic hands\"? Well, it becomes \"the only news network that is 100% fair and 112% factual.\" Its top story is also the \"incident\" that happened Friday in Sweden, so kindly send thoughts and prayers to all the \"Swedish men, women and fish.\" Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert ridicule President Trump for remarks on Sweden \nAlso, education secretary \"Betsy DeVos\" delivered an enthusiastic weather report. \"Hello, sun!\" \nHow does Fallon's Trump get the scoop on the next tragedy? He utilizes his \"bad things button,\" which activates a \"wheel of bad things\" that randomly pairs a country and an event together. Look out for that Godzilla attack, Finland.
