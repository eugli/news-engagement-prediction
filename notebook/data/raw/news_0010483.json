Twins Anna and Lucy DeCinque have opened up about their battle with body dysmorphia\nThe pair said they have been taking anti-depressants every day after being diagnosed with body dysmorphia a few months ago.\nThey revealed that it started when their father died, but they didn’t realise how serious the issue was until last year – and the turning point came after they lost a job.\n‘I don’t know what we were thinking. We wanted things to look bigger, be more extreme.\n‘It clicked in after we lost our father seven years ago,’ they explained.\n‘We kind of knew back then but we did not want to admit it.’\nObsessed? The pair spent $250,000 on cosmetic surgery to look as identical as possible\nRgeret: They say they are now trying to go back tot heir natural appearance (above, before surgery)\nIt had got so bad that the twins would scrutinise each other in the mirror and would forgo leaving the house if one had even the tiniest of imperfections.\nThey added: ‘The doctor realised that we had something wrong.\n‘We embraced it and now we are just working towards positive things in our life and trying to get over this thing that we are dealing with.\n‘To be honest, she saved our life.’\nThey added: ‘I don’t know what would have happened to us, we had a monster in the brain, constantly with these negative thoughts.\n‘It’s going to take some time, but we are on the mend, we definitely are.’\nThey added that they want to raise awareness about the mental illness, urging young people to be wary of social media.\nExtreme: The pair had breast implants, lip fillers as well as tattooed eyeliner and eyebrows\nInfluence: They blamed social media to perpetuating unrealistic body expectations\n‘A message to the young people, men and women, is that you can get help. We got help. Don’t be ashamed, just own it.\n‘We are on the mend now. We are proud of what we’re doing.’\nThey added: ‘The world can be a nasty place. Social media can kill young people.\n‘It can be evil, Facebook sometimes and Instagram. You see these perfect images of women and you think that everyone is perfect. It's not, you know?\n‘We had a negative monster constantly in our brain every day. We were staying at home. It was not good for us at all. It took over our life.’\nBut although the women admit they have been targeted by online trolls, they refuse to quit social media as they ‘love the limelight.’\nSpreading awareness: The twins spoke to Sunrise hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch\nSharing: The pair have the same boyfriend (above, Ben with the twins) and claimed they both intended to marry him and have his children at the same time\n‘We have got our lovers and our haters and the inbetweeners,’ they said.\nWhile some see them as inspirational, others have written cruel messages, they said.\n‘We have been a bit quiet [on social media] but we love this limelight,’ they said.\n‘We have been in it for so long. We love our fans and getting to know them. We just want to grow.’\nBut although they won’t be indulging in further surgery, the twins still keep to a strict skincare regime to maintain their appearance.\nAnd last year, they also revealed that they have a shared boyfriend, called Ben, and that they both intend to marry him.\nIn a video on their YouTube channel, they also claimed they wanted to both become pregnant with Ben's children at exactly the same time - and were planning to do so with IVF treatment.", "external_links": ["https://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunrise/#page4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:06:30.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
