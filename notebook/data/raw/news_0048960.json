Having also produced a revised engine the team is anticipating a significant improvement in form. \nIt will be driven by new recruit Nico Hulkenberg and Jolyon Palmer, who stays on for a second year, while Sergey Sirotkin retains his reserve driver job. Alain Prost, who has been a Renault ambassador for many years, now has a more formal role as an advisor to the team’s executive committee. \n“For 2017 we are perfectly placed to take the step forward we all desire,” said managing director Cyril Abiteboul. “The R.S.17 is the result of many long working hours spent over our two integrated locations and the result is a car we can be proud of. We have a strong line-up of personnel at all levels of the team and we’re proud to see Nico and Sergey join Jolyon in 2017. We are the fastest growing F1 team and we now need to prove our performance on track. Our objective is to score points at every round.” \n“The R.S.17 is the first car which Enstone and Viry have been able to plan and develop from the outset,” said Renault Sport President Jerome Stoll. “And we’re satisfied by the fruits of this interaction. It’s a beautiful car. For 2017 our performance targets are clear. We want to take a definite, tangible step forward in performance and results. Fifth position in the Constructors’ Championship is our goal.” And with the drivers, isn't she a beauty?! #RS17Launch pic.twitter.com/A75NfShiuh \n— Renault Sport F1 (@RenaultSportF1) February 21, 2017 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:26:25.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
