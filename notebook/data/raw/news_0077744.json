The 45-year-old later suffered a seizure and died before he reached hospital. \nLarge sections of the terminal's departures hall were cordoned off with police tape in preparation for a 75-minute sweep for traces of the highly potent toxin as a few curious onlookers watched. \nAuthorities said two female toilets and other relevant areas were checked in the terminal. \nStudent Hariz Syafiq, 21, who was due to take a domestic flight later, told AFP: \"Yes, I'm worried a bit. Why didn't they quarantine the airport? It's a bit strange.\" \nState police chief Abdul Samah Mat told reporters after the screening that authorities found nothing harmful, adding that the terminal was found to be \"free from any hazardous materials.\" \nNational police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said on Friday experts would sweep the airport terminal as well as other locations the two female suspects visited to ensure that there would be no risk to the public from the toxic agent. - AFP/ec", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:37:56.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
