'Invasive species' \nRhododendrons are a non-native shrub that can grow taller than 25ft (8m) if they are not controlled. \nMr Healy-Rae requested a Dáil debate on the issue, in which he warned the plants were \"taking over completely, despite programmes of work over the years to cut them\". Image copyright Houses of the Oireachtas Image caption Michael Healy-Rae said 'nothing short of calling in the army' could solve the rhododendron problem \nThe minister agreed that the management of the \"aggressive rhododendron is a long-standing, ongoing programme in the national park\". \nHowever, Mr Ring rejected the suggestion that the government had neglected the public facility or its flowery foreign foes. \n\"My department has invested heavily in tackling this invasive species, the control of which is difficult, costly and labour-intensive,\" he said. \nMr Ring added that more than 700,000 euros (£590,000) had been spent on rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park over the past six years. \nHe said this work had made \"significant inroads into the problem\". 565% red deer increase \nThe minister added that his department was working on an \"updated strategic rhododendron management plan\" and had appointed a \"specialist\" to assist with the shrub situation. \nIn respect of the exploding deer, Mr Healy-Rae referred to a 2008 study which he said was the most up to date he could find. \nThis research, he said, showed red deer numbers had \"increased by 565%\" over a 30-year period while and the sika deer population had risen by 353%. \nMr Ring said staff from his department are \"currently undertaking a cull of deer\" in the national park. \nThe cull, which is due to end next month, followed a \"comprehensive survey\" on the park's deer population carried out at the end of last year.
