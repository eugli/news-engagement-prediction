Well, they made good on their word, as the stunning shooting brake conversion kit, which can be fitted on any C7 variant aside from the convertible including the Z06, Grand Sport, and Callaway’s own SC627, will soon be available for order. \nCallaway unveiled the production AeroWagen kit, which was designed entirely in-house and is built in Santa Ana, California, at Chuckwalla Valley Raceway during the filming of an upcoming Mothers commercial ahead of its official debut at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky on April 27. \nStretching from the Corvette’s T-tops, the AeroWagen’s roof and hatch cut a line straight out until the end of the car’s bumper. The roof is built out of lightweight carbon fiber and may even increase the car’s overall rigidity. According to Callaway, the kit is a part-for-part replacement for the Corvette’s factory hatch and uses the original hardware and latches, meaning that you can easily convert back to stock, while the rear window retains defrost functionality. \nThose wanting to turn their own Corvette into an AeroWagen will need to part with at least $14,990 for an unpainted carbon-fiber shell and $17,970 for a painted one, while the optional AeroSpoiler runs $1,995. \nSource: Callaway Cars", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:59:10.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
