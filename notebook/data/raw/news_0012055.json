The 47-year-old South Australian was first elected to the Senate in 2006 after becoming the youngest ever Liberal Party state president aged 29.\nThe son of an Italian immigrant father and fourth-generation Australian mother, Mr Bernardi was a stockbroker, financial adviser and elite rower before entering politics.\nMr Bernardi gives his speech in the Senate on Tuesday Backed by powerbrokers on the Liberal Party's right, Mr Bernardi was appointed a shadow parliamentary secretary, but resigned in 2012 after making controversial comments linking same-sex marriage to bestiality .\nHe has maintained a high profile on the backbench, making regular forays into public debate.\nMr Bernardi has his own website and blog, a podcast, and is the self-published author of seven books - including two for children.\nWhat does he believe? In an email to supporters in March 2016, Senator Bernardi said his mission was to build a movement \"to fight against the tyranny of political correctness\".\n\"Unless the mainstream parties connect with the 'forgotten people' they will choose a different path,\" Mr Bernardi wrote.\n\"It's a global phenomenon and would be foolish to think it won't emerge in Australia.\"\nMr Bernardi has pointed to Brexit and the rise of far-right politics in Europe as evidence of the public losing faith in major parties.\nThe senator has drawn inspiration from international political events After spending time in New York observing Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Mr Bernardi wrote he had learned \"what needs to be done\".\n\"My time in the United States has been invaluable not only in identifying some of the common problems evident in global politics but also formulating solutions,\" he wrote.\nAmong his views that have attracted controversy, Mr Bernardi has been critical of abortion and questioned whether climate change was caused by human activity.\n\"We will be united by the desire to create stronger families, to foster free enterprise, to limit the size and scope and reach of government while seeking to rebuild civil society,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\"We will give hope to those who despair at the current state of Australian politics and who demand a better way for themselves, for their children and for the nation.\"\nHow have his old colleagues reacted? Senior Liberal Party figures have been increasingly strong in their attacks on Mr Bernardi since reports he would defect emerged on Monday.\n\"The Liberal Party's values are not limited to conservatism. We are Liberals because we are open to new ideas; tolerant of difference,\" tweeted Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne.\nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo said: \"With one or two exceptions he's never laid a glove on the Labor Party. Every time he's been in the headlines it's been about criticism of his own parties.\"\nPM Malcolm Turnbull now faces an additional challenge in the Senate Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said voters would be \"angry about the betrayal\" of Liberal values.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said: \"A government which can't govern itself, can't govern the nation.\"\nWhat does this mean for Mr Turnbull's government? The ruling Liberal-National coalition governs with a wafer-thin majority of 76 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives.\nMr Turnbull's advantage is greater in the Senate, but Mr Bernardi's defection leaves him with 29 seats compared to Labor's 26.\nThe government needs 39 votes in the upper house to pass legislation, meaning it relies on support from crossbenchers.\nMr Bernardi takes the number of crossbenchers to 12, although two positions are currently vacant. The left-wing Greens have nine seats.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10C8E/production/_94005786_a20a20b6-0cfd-43ab-81ff-a7e121559574.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8B4C/production/_94006653_47128480-d325-46cd-8547-4919577d57f9.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E0C1/production/_93973575_f497a2d8-8169-4ee8-a44d-13327c07dd41.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/EE0F/production/_89534906_turnbull_epa.jpg", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-19/controversy-over-cory-bernardi-bestiality-comments/4269604"], "published": "2017-02-07T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:46:05.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
