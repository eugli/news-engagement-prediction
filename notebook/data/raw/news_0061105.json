(AP) Congress Vice president Rahul Gandhi On Friday ridiculed the ‘ Make in India ’ campaign of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying while a big lion was made the mascot of the campaign, it ended in a whimper of a rat.\nThere is nothing called ‘Make in India’, he said, noting that if this was the case, then why were mobile phones in India still coming with a ‘Made in China’ tag.\nAccusing Modi of spreading hatred and dividing the society in the name of religion, Gandhi told a gathering in this Uttar Pradesh town that while the Prime Minister had initially promised people the moon and gave them a “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” type feeling, he ended up donning the role of Gabbar himself.\nSeeking votes for the Congress candidate Ali Akbar Pappu in Mahsi assembly constituency, he also said that Modi’s face was writ large with the fear of an imminent electoral defeat in Uttar Pradesh. “A government of Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance will be formed in UP and the Prime Minister is upset thinking of this prospect,” he added.\nYou may also like to watch this video :\nAttacking Modi for doing nothing for the youth and the farmers, Gandhi said time had come when people should ask him where are the two crore jobs he promised. He also slammed the ‘Swach Bharat Abhiyan’, saying that Modi gave everyone a broom to do the cleaning while he flew to Washington to meet (then) US President Barack Obama .\nHe also came down heavily on demonetisation and said that 94 per cent of the back money had been invested in real estate or stashed in Swiss banks and the remaining six per cent was with 50 rich families of India but Modi had no guts to bring that ill-gotten money out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:33:56.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
