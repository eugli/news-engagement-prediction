Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has admitted that an offer of €80m would tempt the club to sell the former St. Etienne man in the summer. \nAccording to Radio Marca , 22-year-old Athletic Club striker Inaki Williams is top of the Dortmund board's wanted list, with the young Spanish striker available for €50million. \nWilliams made his debut for the Spanish national team in May and has remained on the radar of several top European sides, ever since. \nHowever, after an impressive showing last season, where he netted 13 times in in 37 games, Williams has struggled to make much of an impact this term, scoring just four times in 27 appearances. Is Inaki Williams the man to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goals at Borussia Dortmund? Image: PA \nAs for Aubameyang, in a recent radio interview he stated that Real Madrid would be a dream move for him, but he was keeping his options open, even hinting that Paris Saint-Germain could be a tempting destnation for him. \n\"If I want to go to the next level, I need to leave in the summer. Real Madrid is still a dream, but there has been too much noise. \n\"I have an important choice to make. Many people would like to see me in England. The Premier League is] not necessarily the championship that attracts me the most. I like La Liga a lot. Paris is also an attraction. French is, of course, my first language.\" \nWhile losing a player of Aubameyang's calibre will undoubtedly be a blow for Dortmund, given the way Thomas Tuchel is planning ahead, with the likes of Ousmane Dembele, Christian Pulisic and Alexander Isak, it looks as though the future is bright at the Westfalenstadion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:16:21.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
