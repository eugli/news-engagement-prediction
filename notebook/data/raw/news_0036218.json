From crotch-skimming pirate boots to Swarovski crystal–laden “naked dresses,” the pop singer and style icon’s wardrobe choices are a veritable visual feast. But it should also be noted that one of the singer’s most mind-boggling style skills is her ability to layer practical elements atop said ensembles with finesse. One cover-up in particular seems to add just the perfect amount of depth and insouciant cool to each look: her trademark power puffer. From Balenciaga to Vetements’s Canada Goose collaborative coats, the singer’s signature exaggerated silhouettes are reminiscent of the hip-hop swag of the ’90s, but also telegraph a techno-sporty activewear flair that feels very much of the now. Balenciaga’s fire-engine-red oversize quilted shell jacket, for instance, is the perfect fashion-forward defense against freezing winds, while Canada Goose’s camouflage bomber will have you prepared for chic adventures in the great outdoors and the city. Michelin Man style has never looked better. Vogue may earn compensation on these sales through affiliate programs.
