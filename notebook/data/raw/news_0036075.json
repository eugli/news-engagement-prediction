Jahlil Okafor (AP Photo) \nUpdated at 5:54 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:54 p.m. ET \nMaybe Jahlil Okafor isn't leaving Philadelphia after all. \nAfter being held out of competition in the 76ers' previous two contests while reportedly being shopped in potential trades, the 6-11 big man out of Duke is rejoining the 76ers and could be available for their matchup on the road against the Celtics Wednesday, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer . \nLast week, ESPN's The Undefeated reported serious talks were being had to send Okafor, the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, to New Orleans in exchange for a first-round pick and Pelicans center Alexis Ajinca. \nOkafor was a healthy scratch in Philadelphia's 117-109 victory against the Heat this past Saturday and its 105-99 triumph over the Hornets Monday. Okafor, whose 2015-16 season was cut short due to a knee injury, has seen a stark decline in production in 2016-17 with the emergence of rookie Joel Embiid (20.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.5 bpg). Okafor is averaging 11.6 points and 4.8 rebounds a huge dropoff from the 17.5 points and seven rebounds he put up every night a a season ago. \nPerhaps, the 76ers are reconsidering dealing Okafor as Embiid is nursing an injury that will, at least, keep the crowd pleaser from joining in on the fun on the court during Alll-Star weekend.
