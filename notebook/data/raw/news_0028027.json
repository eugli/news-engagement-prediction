Roddy White (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:58 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:58 p.m. ET \nFormer Falcons receiver Roddy White blew $100,000 in Las Vegas over Super Bowl weekend, and it still didn't hurt as much as watching his Falcons suffer a historic meltdown in Super Bowl 51. \nWhite on Tuesday blasted former Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan for his overly aggressive play-calling late in the game, which helped the Patriots send the game into overtime. \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft 2017 \n“I’m glad I wasn’t a part of that team, because I probably literally would’ve fought him,” White said in a podcast interview with WSB-TV sports director Zach Klein and Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Jeff Schultz. \nWhite had already blown $60,000 at the blackjack tables when he sat down in a Las Vegas casino to watch the Super Bowl (he bet $40,000 on a Falcons win). He was certain his former team would finally get its first Super Bowl win after Julio Jones pulled down an incredible sideline catch late in the fourth quarter. The reception put the Falcons in field goal range with a 28-20 lead. \n\"I was like, ‘That’s it. Game’s over. We’re going to have a parade,'\" White said. \"I’m going to fly back to Georgia. We’re going to have fun.\" \nThen he watched Matt Ryan take a 12-yard sack. Then he watched Jake Matthews get called for holding. All of a sudden, the Falcons punted, and Tom Brady had the ball with 3:30 remaining in the game. Of course, the Pats tied it at 28-28, sent the game to overtime and won on the lone offensive drive of the period, 34-28. \nMORE: Falcons take after Russell Wilson in Super Bowl recovery \nWhite knew exactly who to blame for the loss. \n“You destroyed a dream for a city,” White said of Shanahan. “It’s bigger than me. The city of Atlanta needed that championship and you had it. (Falcons owner) Arthur Blank needed that championship and he deserved to win that game, with everything he’s been through. It was finally our time to win and it just hurt me that we didn’t get it done.” \nWhile he was critical of Shanahan's play-calling, he also called out the other coaches who didn't challenge his play calls and lobby for the offense run the ball to put the game out of reach. \n\"To not finish — and that’s what you preach,” White said. “You have a kicker in a dome (Matt Bryant) and he don’t miss.” \nWhite may eventually watch his Falcons may their first Super Bowl. But until then, all bets are off. Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:21:48.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
