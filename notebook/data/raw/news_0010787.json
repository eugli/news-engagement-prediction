push for the government to abandon its proposed marriage equality plebiscite in favour of a free vote are “fake news”, treasurer Scott Morrison has said.\nOn Saturday Fairfax Media reported a group of moderate MPs will call for reconsideration of a free vote on marriage equality in the next two weeks.\nThe call has drawn criticism from key conservative figures Tony Abbott and Josh Frydenberg who have moved to shut it down, while others including the leader of the House, Christopher Pyne , seem open to a change in policy.\nOn Monday Morrison told a press conference in Canberra the issue was not a focus of the government and its policy remains a plebiscite.\nAsked about the push by Liberal senator Dean Smith, who has described the plebiscite policy as “dead” , and a group of moderates including Warren Entsch, Tim Wilson and Trent Zimmerman, Morrison replied: “I will leave the fake news to others.”\nOn Monday special minister of state Scott Ryan told Radio National the government is “committed” to the plebiscite and should not let Labor and the Greens “opportunism” in blocking it define Coalition policy.\nMarriage equality: Tony Abbott says Turnbull would be breaking promise if free vote held Read more \nA new poll by ReachTel shows that in a group of seven Coalition marginal seats voters want a free vote in parliament to determine the issue.\nOn Monday Pyne told ABC’s AM that Labor defeated the plebiscite bill “in a very cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face move”.\n\n“We could’ve had marriage equality after this Saturday, probably within a matter of weeks, if Labor hadn’t been so bloody-minded.”\nPyne said there was “no Coalition bill before the House at the moment to deal with marriage equality and until and if there is, it’s a moot point”.\nA Senate inquiry, to report by 13 February, is examining the government’s exposure draft bill to legislate marriage equality that was produced to accompany the plebiscite proposal which may develop into a cross-party bill.\nOn Monday Ryan said marriage equality was not a distraction, adding that he “spent a lot of time last year working on a comprehensive plebiscite proposal”.\nDean Smith: prospect of a parliamentary vote on marriage equality 'brighter than ever' Read more \n“I’m not going to let [Labor and the Greens’s] opportunism define Coalition policy,” he said, citing Bill Shorten earlier saying he was “comfortable” with the prospect of a plebiscite.\n“We’re committed to the plebiscite, I’m committed to the plebiscite.”\nRyan said arguments against the plebiscite were “absolutely reprehensible” because they amounted to saying the Australian people couldn’t be trusted to conduct the debate responsibly.\n“We took a policy to the election that this an issue that can go to a plebiscite ... Our policy is still for a plebiscite.”\nAbbott has warned that abandoning the plebiscite in favour of a free vote would be breaking a promise. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has also backed the plebiscite .\n“I actually do think that the Labor party will inevitably blink on this issue because if they’re serious about giving people of the same sex the opportunity to marry, then the best way to do that is through a plebiscite,” he said.\n\nOn Sunday Malcolm Turnbull said his party’s policy was for a plebiscite , but did not detail how he would respond to the push by Liberal backbenchers for reconsideration of marriage equality in the party room.\n“I took to the last election the policy of my party and my government which was to have a plebiscite,” he told Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes.\n“We are calling on Bill Shorten to rethink his position and if he supports the plebiscite, then it’ll pass through the Senate, then it will be held and every Australian will have a say.”\nA ReachTel poll commissioned by the Australians for Equality campaign, released on Monday, found that 62% of voters want their federal member to “be allowed to vote for same-sex marriage when the issues comes to parliament”.\nThat compared with 25% who opposed a free vote and 13% who were undecided.\nThe poll of 4,742 residents in the Coalition-held electorates of Chisholm, Corangamite, Durak, Gilmore, LaTrobe, Murray and Page found that majorities in all seven seats wanted their MPs to have a free vote.\nAsked how it would affect their vote if the Coalition blocked a free vote, 18% said it made them more likely to vote for the Coalition, 41% said it made them less likely to and 41% said it wouldn’t affect their vote.\nHow Australia's political parties fell out of love with the marriage equality plebiscite Read more \nAsked how important it was to resolve same-sex marriage this year, 41% said it was “very important”, 41% said it was “not important at all” and 19% said it was “somewhat important”.\nThe Australian Marriage Equality co-chairman, Alex Greenwich, told Radio National on Monday the “political reality is that [the plebiscite] is dead”.\n“This was a policy that I don’t think anyone is missing – it was not a popular policy.”\nGreenwich said a new ad blitz by the marriage equality campaign would remind politicians that marriage equality is “about real people who aspire to marry the people they love in the country they love”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:11:16.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
