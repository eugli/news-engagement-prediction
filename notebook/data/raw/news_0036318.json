(He died). \nThe stories are being shared with the hashtag #FixOurHealthSystem by Fadzayi Mahere, the lawyer and University of Zimbabwe lecturer who's become one of the most visible faces of the #ThisFlag movement started by protest pastor Evan Mawarire in 2016. \nOne Zimbabwean writes in to share how her sister, a trainee nurse at Chitungwiza General Hospital, works without gloves. Another details the way that the children of a woman were given her cut-out tumour to take for testing themselves \"because the person who carried such material didn't have fuel.\" \nBetter on-call allowance \nOf course, there's no way of verifying each individual story: writers have posted anonymously for fear of victimisation.But some commenters are sharing their own experiences under each story, proving these tragic tales are by no means unique. \n\"Same thing happened to me 2 years back. Unfortunately for me it spent 48 hrs on the patient's bed because I didn't have cash for the test,\" wrote Andrew Mbizo of the tumour story. \n\"For as long as our leaders do not use the same health facilities with ordinary citizens we will have problems they will never appreciate let alone know how it feels to stand in a [queue] with a patient or cry for help to a helpless nurse or doctor,\" wrote Lovely Tinashe Msara. President Robert Mugabe and his family have previously sought medical treatment in Singapore. \nOn Thursday the Zimbabwe Medical Association said it was \"facilitating dialogue\" between the authorities and hospital doctors after Noah Madziva, the clinical director at Harare's Parirenyatwa Hospital, said doctors who didn't report for duty by 9 am would not be paid and would have to re-apply to be admitted back on shift. \nBesides Parirenyatwa, Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo was reported to have been badly affected by the strike, with 31 doctors there downing tools on Wednesday, the Chronicle reported. \nThe doctors want a better on-call allowance (up from the $1.20 per hour it's currently reported to be) and permission to import cars duty-free. They also want guarantees that junior doctors who can't be given employment at government hospitals after internships will still be given the practising certificates they need to work elsewhere. \n  Read our comments policy  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:21:14.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
