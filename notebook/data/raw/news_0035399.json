The 33-year-old Kremer, who has Down syndrome, tells his story in Fifth Third’s (Nasdaq: FITB) news release announcing its new ABLE accounts. Fifth Third will launch the accounts that are part of the Achieving a Better Life Experience program by March 30 in several states. Fifth Third employee and Cincinnati resident Teddy Kremer, shown with his parents, Cheryl… more William Philpott, Fifth Third Bank The accounts tie in to the federal ABLE law passed in 2014 that allows people with disabilities to save up to $14,000 a year in special accounts. The amount they save through the program doesn’t affect their eligibility for Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid or other government programs. The accounts are similar to 520 college savings programs. Fifth Third’s ABLE Checking Option is the nation’s first checking account option for an ABLE plan, the bank said in the release. It includes a debit card, checks and free access to more than 45,000 ATMs nationwide. The accounts allow families to save money without putting their family members with disabilities at risk of losing their benefits. The money can be used for emergencies, medical expenses, housing, transportation, technology to help the disabled person and a variety of other purposes. In the past, a person with a disability couldn’t have more than $2,000 in their name and still be eligible for government benefits. Kremer, who lives with his parents in White Oak, is saving money so he can plan for housing after he can’t live with his parents any longer. “This will help me save money for my future,” Kremer said in the news release. “Then one day I can go to live with my brother.” That’s the plan his parents, Dave and Cheryl, have. “A big worry for parents of children with a disability is who will help care for them when we are gone,” Cheryl Kremer said. “The ABLE account helps us plan for Teddy’s future beyond us.” The accounts also help those with disabilities live a more independent lifestyle. “You want to raise your child to be independent, to work and to do as much as they can,” Dave Kremer said in the release. “And the ABLE accounts help encourage these skills in people with disabilities. Before ABLE, some families discouraged a person with a disability from working because they didn’t want to lose their benefits.” Fifth Third introduced the first ABLE checking option in January through a savings plan in Nebraska. It will make the plan available in Illinois, North Carolina and several other states by March 30. It also plans to add Indiana and others as they launch their state plans later this summer. Kremer first gained fame in 2013 when he served as a Reds batboy and befriended many of the players. He still works part-time for the Reds in Fan Accommodations at its guest relations booths on the Terrace Level and View Level. He also wrote a book, “Stealing First: The Teddy Kremer Story,” and was a Courier Forty Under 40 winner in 2015.
