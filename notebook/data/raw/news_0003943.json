Image: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesGetty Images By Sasha Lekach 2017-02-04 01:23:30 UTC \nA Twitter thread is offering some hope for Muslims and others disheartened in the week since Donald Trump's immigration and travel ban was signed. SEE ALSO: Actors' acceptance speeches at SAG awards turn into protest against Trump Muslim ban \nThe True American author Anand Giridharadas shared a story Friday in tweet form, prefacing that his 14-tweet thread \"will solve none of our large problems but might make you smile.\" Some joy is a welcome relief as social media becomes an ever darker place in Trump's America. \nA Muslim friend recently told Giridharadas about one of her relatives who joked, \"Trump is the best thing ever to happen to their community.\" His friend was predictably shocked. But the lesson Giridharadas learned from the encounter shows Trump's divisive rhetoric has unearthed everyday kindnesses. 1. A Muslim friend just told me a story that will solve none of our large problems but might make you smile. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 2. She said a Muslim relative of hers joked that Trump is the best thing ever to happen to their community. She was like, \"What???\" \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 3. He said, People used to be neutral about us at best. But recently he landed at an airport, and people were thanking him for being Muslim. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 4. He couldn't believe it. After all this time, Americans were *thanking* him for being Muslim. Talk about unintended consequences, Donald. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 5. It made my friend think. Despite living in a tolerant city, her headscarf always got glares. Since the ban, smiles began replacing them. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 6. When you try to lead a decent and loving nation into the gutter of hate, some will follow you. But many others will do the opposite. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 7. Many of us are like the people at the airport or the ones giving glares: not hateful but not as consciously inclusive as we could be. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 8. We, too, are given a sense of permission by Trump. A permission to forge love out of mere tolerance, compassion out of mere curiosity. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 9. My friend and her relative weren't amazed by the shift away from hatred. They were amazed by the shift away from neutrality. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 10. What I take from the story is that tolerance and inclusion are not adequate responses to hate. A thick, vigorous, proactive love is. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 11. Love is not merely letting a Muslim enter your country. Love is feeling delighted that Muslims are part of your country. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 12. @kristatippett once wrote this so brilliantly about how we waste love by confining it largely to family and interpersonal relationships. pic.twitter.com/12XcaByByb \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 13. Trump may revive in us a lost connotation of love: love as an act that crosses tribal lines. Love that is more than \"live and let live.\" \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 14. Tolerance isn't going to save us. It's no longer about live and let live. It's about love and get love. Go to it. \n— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) February 3, 2017 \nGo to it is right.
