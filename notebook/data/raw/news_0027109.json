That means the people who shop at Victoria's Secret are unlikely to be swayed by low prices, and find value in other things, like service and product quality. Instead, Amazon's strategy looks almost the same as what Walmart or Target are doing. \n\"Given Walmart and Target's similar price points to Amazon's supposed $10 offering (Walmart $8-15, Target $10-20, vs. Victoria's Secret's ~$35) as well as a similar ‘no to little service’ model, we suspect these retailers are likely to be more negatively impacted than Victoria's Secret should Amazon persuade consumers to start buying intimates on its site,\" the note said. \nGiven big box retailers account for roughly 50% of the US intimate apparel market, Amazon is certainly tapping into a huge market. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley notes, intimate apparel products have to meet stringent fit requirements, high quality standards, and multiple style needs (bras typically come in 5+ cup sizes, 4+ band sizes, and 5-10 difference colors), making it a tough category to win. \nIntimates is also the second least popular apparel category on Amazon, according to Morgan Stanley's survey, which suggests that it's an uphill battle to sell bras online: \nMorgan Stanley ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:46:50.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
