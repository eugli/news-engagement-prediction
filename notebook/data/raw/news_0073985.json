The star has now taken his message on gender equality to a bigger platform — he features in a women empowerment promo for a leading television channel.\nFor this video titled Shooon Te Shaaan, Aamir teamed up with his Dangal director, Nitesh Tiwari, and acting coach, Prakash Bhardwaj, again.\nRecalling the shoot, Tiwari tells mid-day, \"It was a delight to work with Aamir sir once again. I have directed many commercials in the past, but never had the opportunity to work with him. So, this time, I was really excited.\"\n\nActing coach Prakash Bharadwaj and director Nitesh Tiwari \nWhether it's a 150-minute film or a 50-second commercial, the filmmaker says Aamir is always thoroughly prepared for his role. \"Right from the script to his character and dialogues, he needs to be taken through the entire process and that is why he knows what he needs to do. He always walks into the shoot fully prepared,\" says Tiwari.\nThe director adds the success of Dangal was a big reason he was approached for the commercial. \"I am happy that the client and creative team thought I was the right guy for this job. I wanted to do justice to the script. Looking at the response, I think I have achieved it,\" he signs off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:16:04.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
