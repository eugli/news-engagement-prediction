An emotional farewell Bill Keveney , USA TODAY 10:02 p.m. ET Feb. 21, 2017 Terminally ill William (Ron Cephas Jones) gets a chance to play with the band during Tuesday's episode of NBC's 'This Is Us.' (Photo: Ron Batzdorff, NBC) \nSpoiler alert: This story contains details from Tuesday's episode of This Is Us . \nIn the end, there was no miracle cure for William Hill. \nRandall's biological father on This Is Us (Ron Cephas Jones), who has been battling cancer throughout the NBC drama’s first season, died at the end of Tuesday’s episode during an emotional trip to Memphis — and his past — with Randall (Sterling K. Brown). But we may not have seen the last of him. \nThe episode, which stands out emotionally even for a series that regularly embraces strong feelings, reveals many details about William’s early years, including his close relationship with his mother, Dorothy (Amanda Warren). \nIn the present day, the terminally ill man hits the road for Memphis to show his son where he started his musical career. The urgency of the trip is underlined by William’s decision in an earlier episode to end cancer treatments. \nRecent episodes have been “more about him passing, and accepting the fact that they’re not going to have a cure for him,” Jones says. \nWilliam (Ron Cephas Jones), left, and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) go on a father-son road trip on NBC's 'This Is Us.' (Photo: Ron Batzdorff, NBC) \nWhile most episodes toggle between members of the Pearson family, Tuesday's focused exclusively on William and Randall, who needed a doctor's permission for the road trip after suffering an emotional breakdown in the previous episode. \nFlashbacks reveal the father's musical talent, including a well-crafted song, We Can Always Come Back to This (written by Us composer Siddhartha Khosla), that the younger William (Jermel Nakia) composes and performs with his cousin Ricky's (Brian Tyree Henry) band. The older William, reuniting with his cousin, joyously plays with the band again just before his death. \nThe fate of William, who was tracked down by Randall in the series opener, wasn’t locked in from the start, but Jones says he learned after a few episodes that his character would die this season.
