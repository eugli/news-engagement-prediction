Daily Edition Conan O'Brien Builds Bridges (Not Walls) With Mexico Show 5:08 PM PST 2/22/2017 by John Hecht Courtesy of Televisa Conan O'Brien in Televisa's 'Mi Adorable Maldicion' Guest Diego Luna ('Rogue One') called President Trump \"a nightmare\" during the late-night host's latest trip. \n[This article contains spoilers for the March 1 primetime special Conan Without Borders: Made in Mexico. ] \nAt a time when the U.S. seems to be ramping up legislation to deport Mexican immigrants, late-night host Conan O'Brien has taped a special that depicts Mexico and its people in a positive light. \nConan Without Borders: Made in Mexico , which airs March 1 on TBS, was taped in Mexico City with the help of an all Mexican staff, crew, guests and studio audience. \nAmong the show's guests were Rogue One star Diego Luna, who called President Trump and his immigration policy \"a nightmare.\" \n\"But this nightmare can bring something great, which is the reaction to it,\" Luna said. \"There's a resistance happening in the States.\" \nAlso appearing on the show was former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has made headlines for repeatedly tweeting that \"Mexico will not pay for that #F—ingWall\" (that being Trump's border wall proposal). \nIn an interview earlier this week with Televisa, O'Brien said of Fox: \"He's not afraid to speak his mind so we thought it might be interesting to have a quick interview with him and get him to say 'f—ing wall' three times.\" \nDuring the one-hour special, O'Brien pulls out all the stops: he plays a masked Mexican wrestler called \"The Crazy Rooster\" while in another bit he attempts to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with a suitcase packed with Taco Bell items, loads of sun block and a Trump Hotel towel. \nO'Brien also made a guest appearance on the Televisa soap opera Mi Adorable Maldicion ( My Adorable Curse ), in which he plays a flirtatious businessman looking to import Mexican cheese. The episode airs on the Televisa network in mid-April. \nConan Without Borders: Made in Mexico was recorded hours before U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly arrived in Mexico to hold talks on security, immigration and trade with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
