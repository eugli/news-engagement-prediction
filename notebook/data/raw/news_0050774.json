Divine Child. The 6-foot-5, 197-pound Day is a strong-armed passer with a smooth delivery and accurate touch. Michigan State is going to be tough to beat for the four-star recruit who plans to visit this weekend if his basketball schedule allows. \nTop running back: Dayton (Ohio) Dunbar four-star running back Tavion Thomas brings great size to the position, was fluid in drills, blocked extremely well and had some eye-popping plays as a pass catcher. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound Thomas visits Alabama this weekend and besides the Crimson Tide is high on his offers from Ohio State, Wisconsin and West Virginia. The Buckeyes are the 247Sports Crystal Ball favorite. \nTop receiver: Brownsburg (Ind.) High’s Bryce Kirtz went through position drills with ease, was a smooth route runner and showcased strong hands. The 2019 recruit has the traits of a Power Five player. \nTop offensive lineman : Detroit (Mich.) East English Village four-star Tyrone Sampson Jr. had the most dominant 1-on-1 wins of any offensive linemen. A ferocious center recruit, Sampson plays through the whistle and absolutely attacks defensive linemen. Good feet, moves well laterally, sticks on defenders, wide-bodied and strong. Syracuse among others has offered to date. \nTwo way standouts: Indianapolis (Ind.) Ben Davis athlete Reese Taylor and Belleville (Mich.) High 2019 receiver/defensive back Julian Barnett both showed tremendous potential on both sides of the ball. Taylor was one of the best athletes in the building, a blanket at corner and got his hand on the football with the acceleration to explode away from defensive backs while playing offense. Barnett was one of the fastest players in the building, just glides on the field, is a deep threat on offense and a shadow in the secondary. Taylor is high on his offers from Indiana and Wisconsin while Barnett’s scholarship count includes Iowa State, Kentucky and Missouri. \nTop defensive lineman: Nobody took more reps than Canada Prep’s Samuel Obiang who consistently dominated interior offensive linemen with his get off, great pad level and strong hands. The 6-foot, 280-pound Obiang is a high-motor player with early MAC interest. \nTop linebacker: Louisville (Ky.) Ballard 2019 linebacker Jared Casey was one of the most glaring specimen’s in the building. A rocked up 6-foot-3, 220-pound prospect that cruised through position work, runs well and was physical with running backs. In this venue he did well in coverage. \nTop defensive back: Belleville (Mich.) High cornerback Patrick Lupro continues to flourish on the camp circuit winning MVP at this event for a second year in the row. Has an ease about him as he back pedals, breaks on the football well and can also live in the receiver’s pocket. Syracuse among others has offered. \nMore Eye-Catchers \nThe most explosive defensive end in the venue was Indianapolis (Ind.) Ben Davis standout Willie Ervin who holds offers from the likes of Purdue and Cincinnati among others. \nFishers (Ind.) Hamilton Southeastern defensive end Madison Norris is a uniquely long pass rusher that also was a handful for offensive tackles off the edge. Norris is a plus athlete that is being recruited as a stand-up edge guy by all the programs recruiting him. A talented high-hurdler that finished 13th in the state as a sophomore, Norris is high on his offers from Indiana and N.C. State at this point. Will visit Louisville next. \nDearborn (Mich.) High Top247 defensive end Aidan Hutchinson was dominant at times taking reps on the inside and on the edge, while Belleville (Mich.) High 2019 defensive end Jalen Hunt and Reynoldsburg (Ohio) High’s Elijah Ratliff both flashed a lot as well. Michigan remains the program to beat for Hutchinson. \nDetroit (Mich.) Cass Tech 2019 running back Jaren Mangham brings a physical prowess to the position and showed the tools in this setting to be an every-down back. Indiana offered following the event and Mississippi State among others have also extended a scholarship to the potential blue-chipper. Indianapolis (Ind.) Ben Davis 2018 running back Johnny Adams had the most burst in the running back group. Explodes after the catch. Adams is a complete back and hungry competitor. Syracuse and several others have offered. \nIt won’t be long before Reynoldsburg (Ohio) High 2019 linebacker Dezman Cooper is sifting through a nice stack of offers. Has the frame coveted at the position and his athleticism was evident as well. Indianpolis (Ind.) Ben Davis linebacker Sir'Zion Dance broke up a lot of passes in 1-on-1s, a sideline to sideline player that couldn't hide his tone-setter mentality. \nIndianapolis (Ind.) Franklin Central offensive lineman Payton Ditchley had himself one of the best days of his group, racking up his fair share of wins in 1-on-1s against several defensive ends already holding a Division-I offer. Ditchley is talking regularly with Indiana and Purdue. Belleville (Ind.) High Top247 2019 offensive tackle Devontae Dobbs may best project on the inside. He showed he could run well during the combine portion and when he got his hands on defensive linemen during 1-on-1s the four-star recruit finished them off. Recent offers for Dobbs include Alabama and Florida State. He said nobody is recruiting him harder than the Spartans. Belleville (Mich.) High 2021 offensive lineman Damon Payne took a lot of reps at guard and flashed major potential. Will be fun to watch his future unfold moving forward. \nDayton (Ohio) Dunbar four-star receiver and Michigan State commit Joseph Scates emerged at this event last year. This go-round he continued to move at a different speed than the other pass-catchers and had defensive backs in disarray most of the afternoon. Scates is softening on his verbal to the Spartans and mentioned Penn State as a school he’s interested in. Springfield (Ohio) High 2020 receiver Larry Stephens was one that seemed to keep popping up. Frankfort (Ky.) Western Hills 2019 all-purpose back Wandale Robinson ran extremely well, and could be a dynamic slot receiver type. Indianapolis (Ind.) Ben Davis receiver Broc Thompson made a couple defensive backs look silly in 1-on-1s. \nSpringfield (Ohio) High 2019 cornerback Moses Douglass showed why he has several early offers just skating through footwork drills. At 6-foot-2, 185-pounds Douglass is a good-looking athlete on the hoof. Kokomo (Ind.) High safety Luke Cameron is a downhill player on film who in this arena showed he can cover. Indianapolis (Ind.) Ben Davis defensive back Elijah Ball displayed his traits in the secondary as well. Ball really likes Purdue early in the cycle. \nIndianapolis (Ind.) Howe running back/linebacker Alfred Armour was one of the more intriguing guys at the camp. A pretty athlete that could project at a number of spots on the next level. \nMVPs awarded by the camp staff. \nQuarterback – Westerville (Ohio) Central’s Isaiah Healy and Kokomo (Ind.) High’s Kyle Wade . \nRunning Back – Thomas and Mangham \nTight End – Cincinnati (Ohio) Moeller’s Jack McCracken \nReceiver – Lansing (Mich.) Sexton’s Cody Blankenburg and Columbus (Ohio) Academy’s Jerome Buckner \nLinebacker – Cooper, Dance and Hilliard (Ohio) Bradley 2019 Cannon Blauser . \nDefensive Back – Lupro and Cameron \nDefensive Line - Obiang and Ecorse (Mich.) High Ahmed Weathers . Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:47:17.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
