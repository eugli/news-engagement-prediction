Image copyright Paulo Lemos Image caption The knotty sand grasshopper is threatened by tourist development \nJean-Christophe Vié, deputy director, IUCN Global Species Programme, said to bring these species back from the brink of extinction, more needs to be done to protect and restore their habitats. \n\"This can be done through sustainable grassland management using traditional agricultural practices, for example,\" he said. \n\"If we do not act now, the sound of crickets in European grasslands could soon become a thing of the past.\" \nThe assessment took place over two years and involved more than 150 scientists. \nAxel Hochkirch is chair of the IUCN invertebrate conservation sub-committee and lead author of the report . \n\"If we lose grasshoppers and other Orthoptera like crickets and bush crickets, we will lose diversity,\" he told BBC News. \"They are very good indicators of biodiversity in open ecosystems.\" Image copyright Axel Hochkirch Image caption The Adriatic marbled bush cricket is classed as endangered \nThe experts are particularly concerned about species that occupy small ranges, such as the Crau plain grasshopper, which lives only on the Crau plain in the South of France. \nSome populations are also being lost through wildfires, particularly in Greece and on the Canary Islands. \n\"The results from this IUCN Red List are deeply worrying,\" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. \nThe report recommends the setting up of a monitoring programme across Europe to obtain information on population trends. \nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:57:21.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
