Smith, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPicture yourself at a five-star restaurant, the kind where reservations are hard to come by on any night but especially when it’s a special holiday like this. \nThen, amid all that bliss and build-up, this sordid sequence of events unfolds: your better half can’t make it, and somehow you wind up at a table with the ex – and their friends – not long after you both endured the most bitter of breakups. Awkward… \nThat’s what Russell Westbrook is facing this weekend, when the Oklahoma City Thunder star will be sharing locker rooms, social scenes, minutes and – if the fans have their way – even some court time with the bevy of Golden State Warriors who will surround him. As if it’s not enough that Westbrook is outnumbered, with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and his former Thunder teammate, Kevin Durant, making up a third of the Western Conference team’s roster, or that Warriors coach Steve Kerr is calling the shots, Westbrook has only had less than a week to recover from the reunion game. \nOn Saturday at Chesapeake Energy Arena, where Durant was booed mercilessly amid chants of “Cupcake” in his first return to the place where he played for eight seasons, Westbrook and Durant did nothing to quell this storm. There was trash talking between the two, and another dust-up between Durant and former teammate, Andre Roberson. Long before then, just a few minutes into the first quarter of the Warriors’ 130-114 win, Westbrook had claimed to official Marc Davis that Green was hurling expletives his way. \nAfterward, as the Warriors headed for the exits with a noticeable decline in political correctness, Green – as the kids would say – trolled Westbrook hard. He conducted his postgame interview in one of the Westbrook-inspired ‘Cupcake’ t-shirts that so many fans had worn that night, the attire serving as their way of calling Durant soft for leaving town. The backstory involved Westbrook posting a picture of cupcakes on Instagram not long after Durant’s decision as a way of expressing what he thought of it. A post shared by Russell Westbrook (@russwest44) on Jul 4, 2016 at 10:40am PDT \nAdd this to the photographer outfit that Westbrook wore to the first Warriors-Thunder affair at Oracle Arena on Nov. 3 (another coded, perceived slight), and his edginess that ensued on Jan. 18 when he took offense to Zaza Pachulia’s style and vowed to “get his ass back,” and the list grows longer with every matchup. All of which begs a fair question as we head into All-Star weekend: are the Warriors, after all these Westbrook-involved subplots, upset with how he has handled Durant’s exit? \n“I think he’s been great (this season),” Green told USA TODAY Sports in a matter-of-fact tone when asked the question. “He’s played his ass off all year.” \nBut about the cupcake subplot… \n“The off the court stuff is what it is,” he continued. “I think everybody handles stuff differently. To say he’s handled something wrong, I’m not in a position to (say that). It’s not up to me to say how he should handle something, or if he’s right in what he said or if he’s wrong. I’m not in that position. I’m gonna ride for my guys. You in this blue and gold with me, we rock together.” \nMORE NBA:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:03:50.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
