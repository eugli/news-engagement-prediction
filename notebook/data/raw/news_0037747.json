It is the first major Tube line extension since the Jubilee line in the late 1990s. \nThey were named, thanks to a vote by local schoolchildren, in honour of astronaut Helen Sharman and aviation pioneer Amy Johnson. Lowered into place: One of the two giant machines \nWhen fully assembled the two 650-tonne machines, each the length of a football pitch, will begin their onward journey towards Kennington in March. \nMore than 300,000 tonnes of earth will have to be excavated and transferred onto Thames barges where it will be taken down river to East Tilbury for use on farmland. \nTransport for London said the two station extension will create up to 25,000 jobs and 20,000 new homes. Extension: The Northern line will run to Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms from 2020 (Transport for London) \nJourney times from Nine Elms or Battersea to the West End and City could take less than 15 minutes making a huge economic impact on the designated regeneration area of the South Bank. \nIt will also help relieve major congestion at Vauxhall Station on the Victoria line. \nOf the cost, £1 billion in funding will be provided by the private sector.
