(Photo: Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sport) \nLeBron James did this on Tuesday night. It's a no-look nutmeg assist and it's phenomenal and wow, there is just so much going on here. This. Pass. WHAT?! pic.twitter.com/QM2LKCJvC1 — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) February 15, 2017 It's a two-handed between-the-legs pass. LeBron turned his head to even further throw off all the Timberwolves defenders. Kyle Korver was chilling at the 3-point line. LeBron didn't have to make that pass. He had options. \nThis is probably the greatest pass LeBron has ever made. Yes, he has pulled off no-look over-the-head passes and other incredible no-look passes, but do any of these compete with the no-look nutmeg? \nI don't think so. None of those seem better - and yet somehow, I feel like he can do even better, though. I don't know how, but he's LeBron James. \nOne more thing to note: LeBron is averaging a career-high 8.8 assists per game this season.
