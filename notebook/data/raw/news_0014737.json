The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev John Mann, who completed his sixth Black Santa Sit-out in December, said the annual Good Samaritans Service was one of the most comprehensive gatherings in Northern Ireland of groups doing charitable work.\n“These range from organisations aiding young people to those supporting the elderly, from those struggling with medical conditions to those working in reconciliation and healing in its broadest sense,” the Dean said.\n“They include many cross-community initiatives and those working in places of social deprivation.\n“It is a celebration of much that is good and praiseworthy in our community, and an opportunity to thank those who turn money into action and goodwill into improving the lives of others.”\nDean Mann announced earlier that he is leaving St Anne's Cathedral to take up a new post in England.\nLast updated Sun 5 Feb 2017 Religion charity Northern Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:28:56.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
