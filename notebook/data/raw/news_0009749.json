Speidi will be laughing all the way to the bank (Photo: Lia Toby/WENN) Ray J showed his love for the UK while entering the house (Photo: WireImage) \nAccording to reports, American musician Ray J was earning a huge $1 million (£810,000) to appear which, if true, makes him the highest paid CBB housemate in history. \nAccording to TMZ , producers have also thrown in $30,000 (£24,000) to cover the musician's travel and hotel costs in the UK. (Though Ray J's manager declined to comment.) \nMeanwhile, former Strictly Come Dancing star James Jordan is thought to have got a six-figure sum to appear. \nOf course, big paydays are nothing new when it comes to CBB , which has shown itself willing to dig deep when it comes to securing its dream housemates. \nAs you’d expect, none of the housemates ever actually discuss their salary or confirm the rumours about who is paid what so there’s no word on whether all the reported six-figure deals are actually accurate. \nBut a quick search through the archives shows plenty of celebrity housemates linked to eye-watering salaries over the years ranging from Ray J’s record breaking seven-figure sum to a more modest but still amazing £150,000. \nHere’s the rumoured Top 10 salaries for CBB housemates: Ray J - Series 19, 2017 Ray J's raking in the big bucks!

He's famous for being Brandy's brother, dating Whitney Houston, and making that infamous sex tape with then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian.
