Wendell Miller, a graduate of Grinnell College and Harvard Law School who practiced law in Des Moines and Chicago. Upon his death in 1995, Miller left his entire estate jointly to Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. The Miller Faculty Fellowship is a program of Iowa State’s Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching . \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:14:35.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
