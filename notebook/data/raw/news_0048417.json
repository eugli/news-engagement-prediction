All are treated same. Whoever comes will join almost half a million international students who come in the UK to access word-class education in the world-class universities,\" he said here. \n\nAsquith was speaking at the India launch of the report of the UN Secretary General's High Level Panel on Women's Economic Empowerment. \n\nIndia has time and again asked Britain to relax student visa rules for greater mobility of students. \n\nUK's visa policy requires students to return home after their courses end -- a move that has led to fall of Indian students enrolling in British universities by 50 per cent. \n\nAs per estimates, the number of study visas issued to Indian nationals have fallen drastically. \n\nAsquith also said that the UK is participating in several initiatives of the Indian government to promote skilling. \n\nHe said the UK is already investing and supporting about 75 start-up businesses and they provided access to financial services to women in India. \n\nBritish companies, on an average, are spending 7 per cent of their revenues on training and skilling employees in India and are also creating more opportunities for women, Asquith said.
