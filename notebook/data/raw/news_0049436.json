McMaster is in. by Twitter By Mark Wilson/Getty. One week after national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned after it was revealed that he had not been fully honest about discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Donald Trump ’s inauguration, the president has named his replacement to fill the critical White House post. Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster , a career Army officer and military strategist, will take over the job, Trump announced at an impromptu press conference at Mar-A-Lago on Monday afternoon. “He’s a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience,” Trump said. “He is highly respected by everybody in the military.” Considered a leading intellectual in the military, McMaster is in many ways more experienced than Flynn. In 1997, McMaster wrote a book critical of the Vietnam War, called Dereliction of Duty, which outlines how Lyndon B. Johnson’s obsessions with deference and leaks led the United States to deepen that conflict. He later criticized former President George W. Bush ’s administration for going to war in Iraq more than a decade ago. (CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr notes that since McMaster is actively serving in the military, he likely couldn’t turn down the nomination .) “I look forward to joining the national security team and doing everything that I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people,” McMaster said in remarks Monday. Retired Vice Admiral and Navy SEAL Robert Harward, who was Trump’s first pick for national security adviser, previously turned down the job “for personal reasons,” ABC News reported last week, including the fact that Trump denied his request to replace some of Trump’s political appointees to the council. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg , who had served as interim acting national security adviser in the wake of Flynn’s departure, will stay on Trump’s national security council as McMaster’s chief of staff. Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton , who had been considered for the job, will also be working with the national security council “in a somewhat different capacity,” Trump said. “John is a terrific guy.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:53:55.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
