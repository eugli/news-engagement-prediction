Speaking to OK! at a Grammy Awards press conference, the 'Hello' singer revealed: \"I'm raising him [Angelo] to respect women. He knows I'm a powerful force.\n\"He feels it at home, let alone when he comes to work with me. And he comes everywhere with me anyway!\"\n The star – who scooped all five awards she was nominated for at the ceremony – also let slip during an acceptance speech that her partner Simon Koneki was now her \"husband\" .\n\"Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you're the only reason I do it,\" she said as she held one of her Grammys on-stage.\nThe couple welcomed Angelo, their first child together, back in 2013, and became engaged in October last year during Adele's world tour.\nOn famously breaking her Album Of The Year Grammy into two pieces to share with Beyoncé, Adele continued: \"I am of course very grateful to have won it.\n\"But I felt the need to say that because I love her and I felt like she was more worthy.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/culture/culture-news/news/a39868/adele-confirms-her-marriage-to-simon-konecki/", "http://www.ok.co.uk/"], "published": "2017-02-21T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:18:44.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
