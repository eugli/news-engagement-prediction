It looks like it could be more like six or seven months, March or April 2017, before we hear anything.\" \nHe added: \"The Supreme Court agreed with us that the intrusive sharing of private information which was at the heart of the Named Person scheme was unlawful. \n\"The court granted our appeal, and ordered the Scottish government to pay all our costs . It was a total defeat for the Scottish government. \n\"The substantial delay in announcing their plans to try to navigate a way around the ruling indicates that reality is finally beginning to bite.\" Come into force \nAfter the legal challenge, Mr Swinney was forced to act to halt the roll-out of the named person scheme, which has already been trialled in some parts of Scotland. \nIt had been due to be introduced across the country on August 31 2016, but Mr Swinney said he hoped the named person policy can now come into force a year on from that. \nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The engagement involved more than 50 meetings with some 250 organisations and groups - and included around 700 young people, parents/carers, practitioners and professionals. \n\"This included leaders from health, education, local authorities, police, faith communities, charities, unions and professional bodies. \n\"The deputy first minister will update parliament in due course.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:36:11.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
