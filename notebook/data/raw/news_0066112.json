And over the past several temperate months, I have curated quite a list of cocktail recipe ideas that are just waiting to be mixed up and leisurely sipped post-baby. But I couldn't wait any longer to share this simple lavender margarita (which my sister-in-law and husband willingly taste tested in my place). \nThe lavender margarita is a little bit French and a little bit Texan and the kind of thing I imagine Parisian diplomats might sip in coupe glasses on the lawn of the former French Embassy in downtown Austin. We Texans have a long history with France – including the famous 17th century French explorer La Salle, various military alliances, trade, and more – and we take pride in our own sweeping provincial fields of lavender that drape the Texas Hill Country. Add a handful of Rio Grande Valley limes and a bottle of Texas-made tequila, and this cocktail combines the best of Texas foodways and our Republic's history in one glass. Too bad the margarita wasn't around during La Salle's adventures along the Brazos River; it might have made his men less mutinous. \nTequila, lime, and lavender might seem like an odd combination, but the tart citrus creates a natural foil to the floral sweetness of the lavender and a bright, clean silver tequila brings the two together. And, if you're in a position like me, the tequila can stay on the shelf and be replaced with a generous pour of tonic or seltzer, creating a very lovely glass of lavender limeade.
