Experts say it’s not as likely to cause overdoses and remains in the person’s system longer, making it less likely a patient who misses a dose will go into the painful throes of withdrawal. \nThe drug is available in several forms, including pill and the film, which the patient dissolves under his or her tongue. The problem is that the film version has proved easy to slip past prison officials. \nSuboxone’s popularity in prison is likely two-fold – and for very different reasons. Some, who enter addicted, may view it as the only way they can ease the withdrawal that they will face without access to an opioid. For others, suboxone’s lure is that it can also be used in a way that provides a high. \nOne way to curtail the flow of illicit Suboxone film into prison, some believe, would be to decrease its legal use in the general population – and one way to do that would be to stop offering it to those on Medicaid. \nOn Friday the therapeutics committee, which provides recommendation to Indiana Medicaid on which drugs to cover and drop, voted unanimously to continue covering the drug, at least for now, after hearing public testimony from both sides. \nThe four members present did not question that Suboxone film poses a challenge for corrections officers in the state, but they said they wanted more evidence that the diverted Suboxone making its way into jails and prisons originated with legal prescriptions for the Medicaid population. \n“I’m hearing Suboxone film represents a problem within the corrections system,” said Dr. Michael Sha, committee chair. “I’m not sure I’m ready to make or support recommendations that might jeopardize the treatment of individual patients.” \nCommittee members said that they would be willing to revisit the issue if evidence could be presented that the majority of people prescribed Suboxone film in Indiana are covered by Medicaid. \n“I’m all for solving this problem. I just want to make sure we take the right steps,” said committee member Dr. Risheet Patel. \nAt least one other state, Maryland, has removed Suboxone film from its Medicaid formulary for similar reasons. \nIn Indiana, corrections officials say that Suboxone use in their facilities has soared in the recent past. A Suboxone film strip, which costs less than $10 with insurance, can yield up to $100 in jail, said Cindy Costello, sales and marketing for Witham Toxicology Laboratory, which conducts drug testing for schools, prisons, employer and others. \nIn an effort to prevent illicit Suboxone strips from entering the facility, Johnson County jail staff have been sifting through the mail, holding envelopes up to a flashlight to detect any enclosed contraband, said Doug Cox, the Johnson County sheriff. \nOthers have tried to smuggle the strips in the soles of their shoes. On one recent day, he said, jail staff caught three people trying to get Suboxone to inmates. \n“There’s other drug problems in our jail,\" Cox said, \"but I will tell you this is the big one.” \nBut removing Suboxone film could wind up hurting those trying to shed their addictions, without having much of an impact on the situation in jails, said Carol Ott, a pharmacist who serves on the Mental Health Quality Advisory Committee for Medicaid. \nWhile she said that film is easily snuck into jails, in the absence of this form, people could switch to dissolving tablets, putting the drug on paper and sneaking it into prison that way. \n“Given the crisis we have with opioid addictions, there’s a need for us to focus on getting more people into treatment,” she said. \nStill, the debate may not be over. \nCostello, who said she has spent nearly four decades working to curb drug abuse, said she will continue to try to persuade the state to stop covering film Suboxone. \n“Where does this end?” she asked. “I’m not going to stop here. I’m going to find a way to end this madness.” \nCall IndyStar reporter Shari Rudavsky at (317) 444-6354.
