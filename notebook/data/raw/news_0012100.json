Photo by Alex Milan Tracy/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images \nSilicon Valley is standing up to the White House over Donald Trump’s January 27 executive order closing the U.S. border to people from seven largely Muslim countries— Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen—for at least the next 90 days. (A week later, on February 3, a federal judge put the policy on temporary hold nationwide.) Last night, 97 companies filed a legal brief opposing Trump’s order, Bloomberg reports. The companies include Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Kickstarter, Airbnb, Snap, Uber, Lyft, eBay, Etsy, Indiegogo, Intel, PayPal, Pinterest, Reddit, Microsoft, Wikipedia, and Yelp. Non-tech companies, including Chobani Yogurt and Levi's, also signed it. \nThe brief, filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, says: \nImmigrants make many of the Nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies. Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, and philanthropists. The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children—to pursue the “American Dream”—are woven throughout the social, political, and economic fabric of the Nation. \nFor decades, stable U.S. immigration policy has embodied the principles that we are a people descended from immigrants, that we welcome new immigrants, and that we provide a home for refugees seeking protection. America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants—through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country. \nSee the full list of participating companies at TechCrunch .
