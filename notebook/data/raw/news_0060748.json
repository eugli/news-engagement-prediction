Kim Jong Nam has reportedly been assassinated \nCCTV footage, reportedly from the airport, appears to show two women approach Mr Kim from behind wiping fast-acting poison on his face. \nThe poison, a VX nerve agent, has been classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, Malaysian police said on Friday. \nAfter grabbing at his face the two women quickly walk away in different directions. \nMr Kim, a heavy-set man in his 40s, died soon after the attack en route to hospital. \nThe other woman, who is Vietnamese, was also arrested and has been questioned by Vietnamese officials. They have so far declined to comment. \nMalaysian police have said the two women had rehearsed the attack before carrying it out and had been instructed to wash their hands afterwards. \nOne of the women is believed to have suffered from the effects of highly toxic poison and has been vomiting. Kim Jong Nam assassins 'used nerve agent VX to kill him' \nMalaysian authorities said they were looking for eight North Korean nationals in connection with Mr Kim’s murder, including a high-level North Korean diplomat and an employee of North Korea’s state-owned airline Air Koryo. \nOn Saturday Malaysian authorities said they would issue an arrest warrant for Hyon Kwang Song, 44, a second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, if he didn’t voluntarily cooperate with police. \nIt was unclear if the embassy official can be detained since police have said he has diplomatic immunity. \nMalaysian police said they believed four of the eight North Koreans they were looking for, were already back in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. \nThose four are believed to have provided the women with the poison.
