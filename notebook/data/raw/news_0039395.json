The restaurants include Charleston, both Petite Louis locations, Johnny's, Bar Vasquez and Cinghiale. Foreman Wolf restaurant group announced all of its restaurants will be closed Thursday in… more Foreman Wolf \"Day Without Immigrants\" calls for immigrants to show what the country would be like if immigrants weren't here by not going to school or work and not shopping on Thursday. The social media-driven effort stems from President Donald Trump 's push to ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S., as well as build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. We will not operate today in support of our staff, without whom it would be impossible to operate at all. #adaywithoutimmigrants https://t.co/pkkKMKM6f1 \">pic.twitter.com/pkkKMKM6f1 — CharlestonRestaurant (@charlestoncw) February 16, 2017 In an email Thursday, Foreman said the company wanted to show support for immigrants that work for the restaurant group. “This is personal, not political, and in support of our team, the many hard-working individuals in the Foreman Wolf restaurants,\" he said. There don't appear to be as many restaurants closing in Baltimore compared to Washington, D.C., but there are other restaurants joining Foreman Wolf and other protestors. Ekiben in Fells Point, which was named one of the hottest new restaurants in Baltimore by Eater, posted on its Facebook page it would be closed Thursday, citing the move was not political, but as \"immigrants and son of immigrants,\" they wanted to stand in solidarity against Trump's recent travel ban. Alma Cocina Latina in Canton and Cafe Cito in Hampden will also be closed in support of the cause Thursday while BMore Cocina in Upper Fells Point announced it will serve free coffee until noon and then close.
