But if ever football was the way to a woman's heart, there are some presents you should avoid surprising your partner with this year. Here, Sportsmail picks the worst (and yes, if you're still thinking of a gift, you've left it pretty late...) Stoke City - Heart T-Shirt £7.50 Kicking off the list is Stoke City's attempt to woo the ladies with this club-branded Valentine's T-Shirt. It's red, features a heart and includes the club crest - perhaps the perfect present for female Potters fans. Not for us... Stoke City have attempted to woo the ladies with this club-branded Valentine's T-Shirt West Ham - Women's garter £6.50 For West Ham fans looking for a bit of romance in the bedroom - or perhaps you want to provide the perfect gift for a hen party - this Hammers garter could be the answer. The white with blue lace detail only costs £6.50, too. West Ham supporters can purchase this women's garter for £6.50 from the club shop Watford - Valentine's card £2.50 On a budget this year? Fear not, Watford are on hand with cut-price gifts including this Be My Valentines Day Balloon's Card. It may feature the Hornets' colours but we can't promise the other half will like it. If you're a Watford fan on a budget, you can purchase this bizarre card for just £2.50 Liverpool - Ladies briefs (pack of 2) £10 What better way to surprise your partner than with these Liverpool-branded women's briefs? They come in two different designs and colours; the first is red with contrasting grey waistband and the second is a reverse of the colours with heart print with large red stars throughout. Not a bad deal for £10 but whether they'll be worn is another question... These Liverpool women's briefs come in two different designs and colours; and cost £10 Crystal Palace - Loves me more mug £9.50 If you're a romantic and want to remind the other half that she's above your beloved Crystal Palace, this personalised mug is the ideal Valentine's Day gift. Can't imagine it'll go down well with the lads, though. Crystal Palace supporters can surprise their loved ones with this personalised mug for £9.50 Hull City - Flip Flops £9.99 Perhaps not the obvious Valentine's Day treat but these flip flops in Hull City's club shop could earn you brownie points with your husband/boyfriend. If we're honest, we don't mind the tiger print design. Can imagine you'd get a few dodgy looks when you're wandering down the beach, though. If you're heading for some sun, why not surprise your husband with these Hull City flip flops? Tottenham - Love T-Shirt £10 The second T-Shirt to feature on our list, Tottenham's ladies' v-neck is loosely inspired by the 'Love' sculpture in New York. Not wanting to ruin the design too much, they've wriggled Spurs inside the 'E'. Reduced by £10 though be warned; it's very pink... This Tottenham ladies' T-Shirt is loosely inspired by the 'Love' sculpture in New York Arsenal - Sparkle pink scarf £12 Across the other side of north London, and keeping with the theme of pink, Arsenal have made available a product suitable for this weather. Opting to win over their female followers, they've ditched the traditional red and white and launched this sparkle pink, 100% acrylic Arsenal scarf. Across the other side of north London, Arsenal fans can buy this sparkle pink scarf for £12 Manchester City - Salmon Pink bath robe £18 A bath robe is undoubtedly up there with one of the best gifts for your other half. Sadly for Manchester City, they've got it all wrong with this choice of colour. Perhaps a reason they've dropped the price to £18... One of the worst items on Sportsmail's list is this salmon pink Manchester City bath robe AFC Wimbledon - Romance at the Dons £60 Want to enjoy a football match on Valentine's Day? Well League One side AFC Wimbledon think this is a great idea and have offered fans the opportunity to enjoy a two-course candlelight dinner for just £60 on the evening they play Coventry. The 'Lovers Package' includes a personal table, two-course meal, match ticket (Paul Strank Stand) and a free bottle of prosecco. We just worry there's more romantic places to spend Valentine's Day than Kingsmeadow. League One outfit AFC Wimbledon have offered fans a chance to treat their significant others RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:46:55.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
