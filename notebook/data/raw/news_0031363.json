The film's star, Keisha Castle-Hughes, received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress at 13 years old. \nAccording to THR, Caro will be the second woman at Disney to direct a film with a budget of more than $100 million. (Ava DuVernay's \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" scheduled for 2018, was the first.) \nDisney's upcoming production is just one of the \"Mulan\" films expected in the coming years. In September, Sony announced plans to produce its own \"Mulan\" film, which will be directed by Alex Graves (\"The West Wing,\"\"Game of Thrones\"). \nTHR also reported that Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee and \"Rogue One\" director Jiang Wen both met with Disney last year about directing the film.
