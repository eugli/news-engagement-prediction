A group of men in a tempo traveller followed the actress as she was returning to Kochi from Thrissur on Friday night in her car. Near Nedumbassery International Airport in Athani, the tempo hit the car in which the actress was travelling. After a brawl ensued, the men in the tempo pushed aside Martin, driver of Bhavana’s car, and got into the car. It is reported that the men, keeping the actress hostage in the car, drove around for at least one-and-a-half hours in the city during which they took photos and videos of the actress. The gang dropped her at Palarivattom junction and fled away after which the actress herself drove the car to the home to a film producer who stayed nearby. \nPolice sources told IEmalayalam.com that Martin, the man who was driving Bhavana’s car, has been taken into custody as he is also suspected to be a part of the plot. Police said the act was planned two months in advance by Martin and his associates. Sunilkumar, the driver who was employed by the actress earlier, is suspected to be the main conspirator. Sunilkumar, who has criminal charges against him, was fired by Bhavana from his job post which he is suspected to have held a grouse against her. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:55:38.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
