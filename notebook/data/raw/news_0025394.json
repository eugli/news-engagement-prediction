Close share panel Image caption Kareena uses a walker to get around but hopes an operation will allow her to walk unaided A nine-year-old disabled girl says she is devastated after a thief stole a collection box with money earmarked for treatment to help her walk. \nKareena Hayes of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, needs to raise £30,000 for an operation and physiotherapy to treat complications caused by cerebral palsy. \nShe said the thief was \"horrible\", adding: \"I hope they are sorry for what they've done.\" \nThe charity box was stolen from a café in Borrowash several days ago. 'Lowest of low' \nHer father Craig Hammond, who is her full-time carer, said the operation was her only chance to ever walk unaided again. Image caption Kareena said she thinks the thief was \"horrible\" to steal the money earmarked for her treatment \n\"I just don't understand how anyone could do that. They are just the lowest of the low.\" \nHe said the operation, which cannot be provided on the NHS, at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre would be \"hugely life changing for her ... it would improve her mobility and hopefully she would walk much better\". \nThe family's appeal had already been boosted by a donation from the charity Caudwell Children, which helps transform the lives of disabled children across the UK. \nKareena, who uses a walker to get around, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was two years old. \nThe family was advised that an operation called selective dorsal rhizotomy would improve her mobility. \nThe treatment involves cutting some of the nerves in the lower spinal column an requires \"extensive physiotherapy lasting several months\", an NHS website said. \nThe operation only became available in the UK 18 months ago, but is not yet offered free of charge by the NHS. \nMr Hammond said Derbyshire Police were investigating the theft of the collection box.
