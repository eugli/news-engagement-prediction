Just look at former Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny who's Instagram was updated with several x-rated snaps yesterday. \nLionel Messi was involved in another perfect example of social media overreacting when the Barcelona forward posted a video of his kid learning English, \nDoes it really mean he is on his way to the Premier League?
