The author and illustrator, who professes to hate Christmas despite animations of his work The Snowman being a fixture on festive TV schedules, added: “Being awarded the BookTrust lifetime achievement award is an incredible honour and I’m so glad I’ve been able to make such an impression on people.” \nHis comments were in contrast to those made to the Guardian at the end of 2016. Speaking to Decca Aitkenhead , Briggs said: “If you say you’ve got a lifetime achievement award, it’s like – well come on, get dead, man!” A still from the TV adaptation The Snowman.

Judith Kerr, whose many books include The Tiger Who Came to Tea, took the 2016 honour. \nThough probably most famous for his children’s books The Snowman and Father Christmas, as well as Fungus the Bogeyman, Biggs has never shied away from political statements in his work. His 1982 graphic novel When the Wind Blows tackled nuclear war from the point of view of retired couple Jim and Hilda Bloggs. \nBorn in 1934 to Ernest, a milkman, and Ethel, a former lady’s maid, Briggs began cartooning at an early age and attended various art schools, before settling on a life as an illustrator and writer. His parents appeared in the moving 1998 graphic novel Ethel and Ernest, which chronicled their lives from their first meeting in 1928 to their deaths in 1971. A film adaptation of Ernest and Ethel was released in 2016 with actors Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn playing Briggs’s parents. A still from the 2016 film version of Ethel and Ernest.

It sounded awful,” he told Aitkenhead in December. “You go all over the country. Imagine it! The hotels and bed-and-breakfasts and taxis and trains, and really you just think: for God’s sake, what for? I suppose if you like that kind of public appearance, it’s alright, but I’d hate it.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:44:41.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
