After ranking No. 2 a year earlier, the Texas capital took the top spot in the magazine's 2017 edition of its Best Places to Live in the U.S. list , which ranks major metro areas on a number of factors including unemployment, annual household income, cost of living, education, health care and migration. Austin's high score on the U.S. News ranking is partly due to a strong showing in a… more Arnold Wells/ABJ Denver ranked No. 1 on the list in 2016, dropped to No. 2 this year. San Jose, California was ranked No. 3, followed by Washington, D.C., at No. 4 and Fayetteville, Arkansas at No. 5. Austin's high score is due to its booming population growth as well as a strong showing in U.S. News' desirability survey, which asked 2,000 internet users where in the U.S. they would prefer to live. Over the past five years, Austin has averaged annual population growth of about 3 percent. Further, in 2016 the regional population estimate increased above 2 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Putting Austin over the top this year was growth in the region's median salary and the continued improvement in the regional unemployment rate, which has hovered at around 3 percent for the past 12 months. But as Austin scores highly on other livability rankings trotted out by city boosters, regional economic grown has begun to slow . According to economic indicators tracked by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , Austin's economic growth reached its post-recession peak in early 2015 . Since then, the economy has continued to grow, but that growth rate is now slower than the 10-year, long-term regional economic growth rate. The U.S. News list's authors say the rankings are intended to help people better decide where to relocate. The rankings are based on a weighted index that uses publicly-available data from the U.S. Census Bureau socio-economic stats, the FBI's crime statistics, or the Department of Labor's wage and economic data and mixes it with proprietary data, such as polling on market desirability.
