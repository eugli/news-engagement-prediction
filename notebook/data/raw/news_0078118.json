Navigation is certainly going to be impacted.\"\nTownsend's group is hoping the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] in the United States will hold public hearings before making a decision on the proposal.\n'We're not happy about this.' - Scott Beal, Wood Pulp LLC FERC has licensed the dam to Woodland Pulp LLC, of Baileyville, Me., to allow a water impoundment for the company's hydro power generation system further downriver.\nIn November, Woodland Pulp, which is owned by a Hong Kong-based holding company, applied to surrender the licence, remove the gates to the dam, and allow the water to drain to natural levels.\n'It's a business decision' \"We're not happy about this, we've worked hard to avoid it,\" said Woodland Pulp's communications manager, Scott Beal. \"It's a business decision.\"\nEast Grand Lake borders both New Brunswick and Maine. It's estimated removing the dam at Forest City would lower lake levels by six feet during summer months. (CBC)\nBeal says a recent order prepared by FERC would force the company to fund \"multiple\" studies to comply with the terms of its licence for the dam.\nThe research would be on top of maintaining and operating the dam.\n\"There's a lot of work involved,\" said Beal. \"We didn't know what the new order would look like, we weren't expecting everything that came at us.\"\nBeal says it is less expensive for the company to buy the electricity than to comply with all the conditions of the license.\nStaff at FERC are reviewing Woodland Pulp's application to surrender the license.\nNo decision has been made on whether the commission will opt for a public hearing.\nPublic wants input \nForest City, N.B., residents Sherrill and George Guimond are hoping there is an opportunity for as much public input as possible.\n\nTheir home is a couple of hundred metres from the dam.\n'This whole area will just become a creek.' - Sherrill Guimond, Forest City, NB They worry Patterson Cove, the body of water just above the structure, will disappear entirely if the gates are removed.\nOrient, Maine resident Bill Walton says some of East Grand Lake's coves will have no water in them if the dam is removed. (CBC)\n\"If we lose the dam this whole area will just become a creek,\" said Sherrill Guimond. \"You can't swim, you can't boat. So it's serious.\"\nFurther up the lake, on the opposite side, American Bill Walton lives year-round in his waterfront home and understands exactly what the Guimonds are saying.\nWalton estimates the shoreline off his dock would move out as much as 40 feet, or about 12 metres.\n\"Everything you can see over there is Canada. Every house you see over there is going to have the same problem that I have if they open those gates and lower this lake,\" said Walton.\n\"Some of these coves are only three or four feet deep.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:21:18.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
