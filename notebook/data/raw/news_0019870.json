ITV will continue to produce and broadcast the six part series, which will come to air in 2017. \n\"We are grateful to Lynda for allowing us to adapt her brilliant book Tennison.\" \nLa Plante created and wrote the original programme, but left after the third series after growing unhappy for how the character of Tennison was developing. \nIn regards to the prequel, she had also previously been vocal about the fact that she didn’t want to see a “known actress” in the role. \nPrime Suspect aired from 1991 sporadically until 2006 when the final series saw Tennison retire from policing. \nPrime Suspect: 1973 comes to ITV in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T13:40:02.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
