A negative verdict in the disproportionate assets case may scuttle the chances of VK Sasikala's elevation as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The case dates back to 1996. J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and two of her relatives - Ilavarasi and Sudhagaran - had been convicted in the case that alleged that the former Chief Minister owned assets far exceeding her known sources of income. After they were acquitted in 2015, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the verdict of which is likely to be delivered today. Since Jayalalithaa died in December, the court won't pass orders against her. Its verdict will involve Sasikala and her relatives. Sasikala was accused of abetment and criminal conspiracy in the matter. The trial had been shifted from Tamil Nadu to Karnataka following concerns about undue influence, since Jayalalithaa was still the Chief Minister. In September 2014, all four were sentenced to a 4-year-jail term and a fine of Rs. 100 crore by a special court in Bengaluru. In May 2015, the Karnataka High reversed the verdict and acquitted them all. The court had held that the charges against them was not sustainable. After the special court verdict, Jayalalithaa had stepped down as Chief Minister. The High Court's verdict cleared the decks for her return as the Chief Minister. Soon after, the Karnataka government, DMK leader K Anbazhagan and BJP's Subramanian Swamy had challenged their acquittal in the Supreme Court. The Karnataka government had argued that if the ruling of the high court was not set aside, the Prevention of Corruption Act will fail to stop corruption among politicians and public servants and that will send a wrong signal. The state had also said that there were mathematical errors in calculating the assets by the High Court, which acquitted Jayalalithaa and Sasikala. In her response, Jayalalithaa had claimed that there was no \"mathematical error\". She said all her income between 1991 and 1996 were through lawful sources. After hearing the arguments till June, the Supreme Court had reserved its verdict. If the Supreme Court upholds the order of the High Court, acquitting Sasikala, there will be no legal hurdles to her becoming the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. If convicted, she would not be able to stand for elections for 6 years and hold public office.
