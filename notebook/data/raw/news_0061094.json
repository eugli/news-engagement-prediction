Blough says his wife and young daughter saw the three hurting the turtle near their apartment. They told him and he confronted the men. But they attacked Blough. \nMarine veteran Paula Mongeon heard about Blough's plight and contacted the dealership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:37:16.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
