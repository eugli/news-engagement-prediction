I just went to the bank, the bank manager said 'yeah, I know your parents, it'll be sweet.' \n\"I don't think it works like that anymore.\" \nThe years hadn't dulled her passion for confectionery, but she felt it was time for a change. \n\"I get people saying 'you must be sick of it by now', but I'm quite dedicated to sweet things. Ad Feedback \n\"I see people who've lost the passion for their business, and I don't want to get to that.\" \nWells hoped to sell to a successor who loved sweets and would continue to add new and unexpected flavours to Munchkins' range. \nThe imaginative flavours and keeping the taste and texture consistent from batch to batch is a point of pride for Wells, and she'll pass her recipes to the new owner. \n\"I'll help them along and teach them [how to make the fudge]. I'll part with all my secrets.\" \nShe'll pass on the tricks behind the bestselling flavours like creme brulee and salted caramel and Kiwiana favourites like pineapple lumps and jelly tip. \nThey'll even get the recipe for her latest creation a fish'n chip flavoured fudge, which has been puzzling people since it came out late last year. \n\"A lot of people are coming in and asking how are you doing that?\" Wells said. \nBut she wasn't parting with that particular secret just yet. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:03:48.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
