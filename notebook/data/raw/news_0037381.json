Some of the stories seemed to directly reference A Cure for Wellness, while others were much more tangential. \nResponding to criticism, Fox and producer New Regency initially defended the stunt , explaining that “ A Cure for Wellness ‪ is a movie about a ‘fake’ cure that makes people sicker.” \nBut Thursday’s statement said, “The digital campaign was inappropriate on every level, especially given the trust we work to build every day with our consumers. We have reviewed our internal approval process and made appropriate changes to ensure that every part of a campaign is elevated to and vetted by management in order to avoid this type of mistake in the future. We sincerely apologize.” \nA Cure for Wellness opens Friday.
