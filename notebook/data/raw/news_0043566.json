Slavery is wicked and evil. \n“Removing the biggest window in the cathedral would be hugely difficult for me. If I can find a way of doing that, I would be perfectly prepared to have that conversation.” \nThe Cathedral says it is caught in the horns of a difficult dilemma; attempting to satisfy modern sensibilities about slavery while trying to preserve its own history and that of the city. \nFollowing requests from campaigners it has already changed the format of an annual service held in November for Colston’s Girls School, during which sections of the slave trader’s last will and testament is read out. \nNow, following the reading of the will, the congregation is told about Colston’s activities in transporting slaves from Africa to the Americas. \nBut Rev Doyle pointed out any decision to remove the window would be extremely expensive, potentially costing “many thousands of pounds”. \nSeveral buildings and streets in Bristol are named named after Edward Colston, who was deputy governor of the Royal African Company - which between 1672 and 1698 transported around 100,000 slaves. Thousands died and were thrown overboard during the passage.

Doyle told Premier Christian Radio: \"Colston was a major benefactor, a man of charity. He was also involved in a trade that wasn't considered evil at the time, but we now know to be wicked. I think that's a complicated conversation to have. \n“This is a conversation the city is now having about the relationship of the city with its own past.” \nColston Hall is being boycotted by several artists, including Bristol trip-hop band Massive Attack, in protest at the name. \nIn response to the campaign Colston Hall has indicated it may be willing to consider renaming the venue as part of its £45m anniversary year plans to remodel the hall and restore original features. \nLouise Mitchell, chief executive of Bristol Music Trust, which runs the venue, said: “We were clear right from the start of our campaign to raise funding to transform the Hall, that we had listened to people's’ concerns regarding negative associations with Edward Colston and that we would be reviewing the name as part of our redevelopment. \n“Changing our identity is a major move that requires careful consideration. We need to go through a thorough process that takes into account views from local, national and even international stakeholders and partners.” \nThe row echoes the Rhodes Must Fall campaign , in which students in Oxford demanded the removal of a statue to the British colonialist Cecil Rhodes erected at Oriel College.
