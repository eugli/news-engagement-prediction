In a letter to the Chairman, House Committee on Marine Transport, a copy of which Vanguard has, the Managing Director of NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, said Intels is indebted to the NPA in the Onne and Warri ports in respect of rents, lease and throughput fees. \nShe stated: “Intels has been collecting dues and charges on behalf of the agency since 2010. It is Intels that is rather indebted to NPA in respects of rents at its Onne base which currently stands at N3.3 billion.” \nThe letter also stated: “The total agency commission to Intels computed in line with the executed agreement was $353 million for the period under review. This amount was deemed to have been deducted electronically from service boat revenue by Intels in accordance with subsisting agreement. The total sum of $68million is currently in Intels custody, pending the issuance of credit notes for project and finance costs.” \nMeanwhile, efforts to get the NPA to comment yielded no fruit as at the time of filing this report. Its General Manager, Public Affairs, Mr Mike Ajayi, who promised to get back never did. \nAlso, efforts to get comments from Intels failed as its media consultant, Bolaji Akiola, could not get back with a response after a telephone contact with Vanguard.
