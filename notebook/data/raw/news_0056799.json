Robert Charles/Fairfax NZ \nPhilip Murray Kinraid during his first appearance in the Hawera District Court after Esme's death. \nIn doing so, Esme became part of the country's bleakest statistic - its child death toll. \nOn average, nine children are killed every year in New Zealand, usually by someone who is meant to provide them with love and care. \nREAD MORE: * March for Moko brings together all sides of the domestic violence debate \nOn Wednesday, Philip Kinraid was jailed for four years and three months after he caused Esme's death on June 26, 2015. The 29-year-old previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter. \nAfter trying to settle Esme to sleep for the night, he restrained her in bed, pushing her face into a pillow for up to ten minutes. \nHe left the room, thinking she was still alive, but when he checked back hours later, she was not breathing or moving. Attempts to revive her failed. Deena Coster \nThe Hawera house the Kinraid family lived in at the time of Esme's death. \nPrior to his arrest, Philip Kinraid appeared to have a lot going right for him. Ad Feedback \nIn 2010, he graduated from the University of Otago with a Bachelor of Science with Honours degree, majoring in chemistry. \nHis career path eventually landed him in Hawera, South Taranaki where he lived with his young family - his partner and two children. \nAs the breadwinner for the family, he worked as a chemical engineer for Fonterra, a job which can attract a salary of up to $120,000 a year. \nThere were no outward signs of what was to come, people have said. They were just a normal family, living on a quiet street in a small town. \nSo news of Esme's sudden death was a massive blow for those who knew the family. \nA friend of the Kinraids, who asked not to be named, said it had shattered the close knit Hawera community. \n\"It all came as a real, big shock,\" she said. \n\"She was just a really lively two-year-old, who absolutely loved her family to bits.\" \nShe said the Kinraid family appeared to be stable and there were no outwards signs of any problems. \nIt had been especially difficult to explain Esme's death to her own children, who used to play with the little girl from time to time. \n\"She (Esme) was just starting to come out of her shell and socialise with other children,\" she said. \nWhen she first heard about what happened, she thought a stranger had to have been responsible for Esme's death - someone must have broken into the home and hurt the child. \n\"In no way did I think it was her own father,\" she said. \n\"He seemed like a solid bloke, with a solid job. He was a family man.\" \nShe said she last had contact with Esme's mother and older brother about a year ago. They were coping as best they could in an attempt to re-build their lives, she said. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:04:01.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
