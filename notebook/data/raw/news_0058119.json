Reuters | Posted by Natasha Singh New Zealand secured a series-levelling six-run victory in the second ODI against South Africa 2 Trent Boult took the prized wicket of AB de Villiers then bowled Dwaine Pretorious 3 Ross Taylor scored 102 not out to become New Zealand's most prolific ODI century-maker \nTrent Boult took the prized wicket of AB de Villiers then bowled Dwaine Pretorious in the penultimate over as New Zealand secured a series-levelling six-run victory in the second one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday. \nThe visitors had been set 290 to win in Christchurch after Ross Taylor scored 102 not out to become New Zealand's most prolific ODI century-maker in leading his side to 289 for four wickets in their 50 overs at Hagley Oval. \nSouth Africa, who won the opener of the five-match series in Hamilton on Sunday, appeared set for victory courtesy of a half century by Quinton de Kock (57) and solid partnerships through the middle order but were unable to finish off the job. \nThe chase faltered when David Miller's dismissal for 28 by leg-spinner Ish Sodhi reduced South Africa to 192-5, triggering a lower-order collapse. \nBoult then had South Africa's captain de Villiers caught behind by Tom Latham for 45 before Chris Morris was brilliantly run out with a backhand flip by Dean Brownlie. \nMitchell Santner stepped up to trap Wayne Parnell in front for a duck to leave the visitors stuttering at 214-8 as the hosts closed in on what appeared to be a comfortable victory. \nDwaine Pretorius (50 from 27 balls) and Andile Phehlukwayo (29 not out), who had helped de Villiers through to the four-wicket victory in Hamilton, however, then combined for 61 runs in 7.2 overs to put New Zealand's nerves on edge. ( 1st ODI: Quinton De Kock, AB de Villiers lead South Africa to win over New Zealand ) \nSouth Africa fought back well to require 20 runs from the final two overs but some excellent death bowling by Boult (3-63), who ended Pretorius' resistance, and Tim Southee (1-60) ensured the hosts were able to restrict the visitors to 283-9. \nEarlier, Taylor's 17th century was perfectly paced, with the 32-year-old hitting his eighth four from the final delivery of the innings from Parnell to reach the milestone. \nThe batsman also became the fourth New Zealander to surpass 6,000 ODI runs when he reached 50.
