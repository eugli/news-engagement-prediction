The woman was filming the trio on Facebook Live when the shooting occurred. \nThe video begins with the woman singing and dancing with the man in the car. A child, whom police identified as Lavontay White Jr., can be seen in the back seat. \nAfter a minute and a half, gunfire can be heard as the woman screams. \nThe screen goes dark after the woman runs out of the car and into a house, apparently looking for help. She can be heard yelling, “Call 911! They killed him,” apparently referring to the car’s other passenger. She then tells people in the house, “I have a bullet in my stomach!” \nThe full video, which is graphic, has been removed from Facebook but can still be found on YouTube . \nBoth Lavontay and the older male passenger, whom police have not publicly identified, were shot in the head, the Tribune reports.

Johnson, superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, said during a press conference following the shooting that the adult male victim was a documented gang member who died of his injuries, adding that the attack appeared to be targeted. Paramedics revived the child for some time, but he was later pronounced dead at Stroger Hospital . \nThe woman, who is in her 20s, and her fetus are expected to survive. \n“ This has just got to stop somewhere ,” Johnson told news reporters after the shooting. “Our children shouldn’t have to keep paying the price for our inability to hold repeat gun offenders accountable for their actions,” as well as first-time gun offenders, he added. \nJohnson said he was confident CPD would find the suspect in Tuesday’s shooting, citing “promising leads” and video of the shooting. \nThe woman told police that she, the man and the child were driving through an alley behind AC Delco Auto Electronics shop when a car blocked them and a gunman exited the vehicle and opened fire, according to police. \nPhotos of the crime scene show a dark red Oldsmobile Alero with bullet holes near a fence in an alley.

Kamari Gentry-Bowers, 12, was also hit with a bullet at a Chicago playground on Saturday night. \nShe died Wednesday at Stroger Hospital after four days on life support, according to the Chicago Sun Times.

Five people were killed that day, including 2-year-old Lavontay. \nOne day before Tuesday’s shootings, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel met with newly appointed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, seeking federal aid to combat the violence in the city . \n“ One victim of one shooting is one too many ,” Emanuel said in a statement following Tuesday’s deaths. “But when innocent children are caught in the crossfire of gun violence ... our consciences are shaken and our hearts are broken.” \nThe mayor said Tuesday’s shootings “ must be a turning point for our city ” and called for “meaningful gun control and sentencing legislation” to keep guns away from criminals and “keep repeat offenders off our streets.” Statement: These shootings - of our precious children - must be a turning point for our city. pic.twitter.com/8oZPRtXvu9", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:25:41.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
