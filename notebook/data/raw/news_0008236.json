And few trials have actually tested the effects of \"assigning\" people to eat breakfast, the AHA says.\nContinued Based on what studies have been done, adding breakfast doesn't seem to aid weight loss , the report said.\nOf course, if breakfast skippers simply add an extra meal to their day, they'll gain weight , St-Onge pointed out.\nA few small trials have, however, suggested that breakfast can help regulate blood sugar and insulin levels, according to the AHA.\nSonya Angelone is a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. And she was clear in her support of eating breakfast.\n\"I think it's very important to eat breakfast every day,\" Angelone said.\nJust as important, she said, is to hydrate after a long liquid-free night. Coffee does \"count,\" she noted, but a glass of water is better.\nAccording to Angelone, breakfast is critical because it's hard to get all the nutrients you need in just two meals a day -- even if you snack .\nThat raises another question: Should people eat \"three square meals,\" or is it better to stick with small, but more-frequent meals?\nThat's not clear, according to the AHA.\nStudies that track people in the real world have found that those who eat more often during the day have a lower risk of obesity and better cholesterol levels .\nOn the other hand, the AHA says, small trials that have tested the effects of altering meal frequency have mostly come up empty. When daily calories are kept constant, meal frequency may not affect people's weight , levels of \"good\" HDL cholesterol or other factors that affect heart health.\nOf course, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to eating, St-Onge said.\nSome people, she noted, do well with \"grazing\" throughout the day -- as long as the food choices are healthy, and they do not keep grazing until midnight.\n\"If you're someone with good control over your diet, maybe grazing is a good idea,\" St-Onge said. \"But if it's difficult for you to stop eating once you start, it's probably not a good idea.\"\nAccording to Angelone, frequent eating may not be wise for people with resistance to insulin -- the hormone that regulates blood sugar . Insulin resistance is seen in people with type 2 diabetes or \"pre-diabetes.\"\nContinued If those people eat often, Angelone explained, their insulin levels may never have a chance to drop.\nIn general, St-Onge said, \"mindfulness\" is critical. Often, people eat not because they're hungry, but to deal with emotions, she said.\n\"Ask yourself why you're eating,\" St-Onge said. \"Is it because you're stressed or sad or bored? Ask yourself whether you're really hungry right now.\"\nThe statement was published online Jan. 30 in the AHA journal Circulation .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T20:18:04.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
