He’s ready to be a man with a budget. And what better person to whip him into shape than a person who likes to control other people and steal their joy? Say hello to Raj’s new accountant, Sheldon Cooper! Raj is forced to cease and desist from all superfluous spending. This includes his emergency credit card and his intimate waxing account at Pink Cheeks. He’s also going to have to say goodbye to his surrogate penguin at the LA Zoo. With a pencil, calculator, and an old-timey green visor at his side, Sheldon makes Raj promise that he won’t spend another cent without Sheldon’s consent. The pain of this reality hits Raj hard — especially when Sheldon reminds the group that Comic-Con tickets will be going on sale at the end of the week and Raj will NOT be joining them. But guess who will be joining in on the fun this year? Penny. She’s not excited about attending, but if squeezing into an Ewok costume makes her husband happy, who is she to miss out on that experience? (P.S.: Since when did Amy become the cool one of the group?) Unbeknownst to Penny, Leonard is struggling with Penny’s willingness to join him at Comic-Con. She hates lines, crowds, and panels. She will be miserable; therefore, Leonard will be miserable. The guys suggest that Leonard make it sound horrific so she won’t want to go. Challenge accepted. Raj is determined to figure out a way to earn money so he can attend the convention. Howard suggests he charge people to punch him. Howard may be ribbing him, but Raj quickly points out that as a new father with a tiny baby, Bernadette may not want her husband traipsing off to Sand Diego for five days. He can’t very well co-parent from an Avengers panel, now can he? While Howard offers to do all of the chores and housework for Bernadette in exchange for a five-day boys’ trip in the summer, Leonard attempt to dissuade Penny from joining them. He shows her pictures of jam-packed convention rooms, camping on the sidewalk, and the bed she will share with him and Sheldon in their hotel room. Penny remains firm. Even Raj’s trick to keep warm using a bottle full of pee doesn’t make her cave. She’s a stronger woman than I am.
