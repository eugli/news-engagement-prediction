In short, it was a shit show. \nBut just as every cloud has a silver lining, the dedicated Britney fans of Twitter made the most of their two-hour torture fest by commentating on the film's worst moments, for us all to enjoy. SEE ALSO: The trailer for Lifetime's Britney Spears movie will just make you sad \nFrom it's ridiculous casting, LOL dialogue (we're looking at you, Justin Timberlake impersonator, with your \"bomb diggity\" youth speak), and costume design atrocities — it seems this movie may replace Glitter as the go-to pop star biopic of choice, for hungover/still drunk people everywhere. \nEven celebrities are not immune. Omg is anyone else watching #britneyeverafter ?? \"Get out the crackers because Joey is bringing the cheese\" that's a direct quote!! \n— Sarah Michelle (@SarahMGellar) February 19, 2017 the only character in #BritneyEverAfter that was cast well was banana 🐍 \n— Tyler Oakley (@tyleroakley) February 19, 2017 \nWho could forget that historic post-break up dance off between Britney and Justin in the club that ~fateful~ night? A BRITNEY/JUSTIN DANCE OFF IN THE CLUB YA'LL I CANNOT DO THIS 😂😂 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀 #BritneyEverAfter pic.twitter.com/LOXlXFI3F8 \nAnd speaking of the costumes...
