Latvala was smiling again in Sweden ¬© Jaanus Ree/Red Bull Content Pool By Greg Stuart on 12 February 2017 \nJari-Matti Latvala has claimed an amazing first win as a Toyota driver at Rally Sweden. In only his second round for the team, who are returning to the WRC for the first time since 1999, the Finn drove an assured rally in his Yaris WRC, lying second for much of the event before inheriting the lead after a crash for Thierry Neuville on Stage 15. \n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing feeling,‚Äù said Latvala, who claimed a full 30 points from the rally and the overall championship lead after winning the Power Stage as well. ‚ÄúThis victory [felt] the same as when I won my first rally in 2008. That victory came as a surprise, just like this one came as a surprise.\" \nAsked where his assured performance had come from, Latvala joked: ‚ÄúI think too much. When I stop thinking, I do a good performance!\" \nWhen I got the chance to get in the Toyota team, it was a big motivation boost Jari-Matti Latvala \nLatvala added, referring to his difficult end to 2016: ‚ÄúIn the second half of the season last year, I was not performing well. Last year, I lost the confidence and when I got the chance to get in the Toyota team after Volkswagen pulled out, it was a big motivation boost. There‚Äôs a very nice spirit in the team, and that has been lifting me back to the level I was at some years ago.‚Äù \nLatvala was joined on the podium by the M-Sport pairing of Ott T√§nak and S√©bastien Ogier , the second double podium for the team-mates in as many rallies. \nNeuville‚Äôs crash meant that Dani Sordo was the highest-placed Hyundai driver in fourth, while Craig Breen finished fifth in his first event in Citro√´n‚Äôs 2017-spec C3 WRC. \nA puncture for Elfyn Evans after clipping a rock in a stage lost him time, but he still managed to bring his car home in sixth, ahead of the Hyundai of Hayden Paddon . Neuville was out of luck again ¬© Jaanus Ree/Red Bull Content Pool \nDriving a 2016-spec Citro√´n DS3 WRC, St√©phane Lefebvre was eighth, while ninth and 10th places were occupied by the top two WRC2 drivers, Pontus Tidemand and Teemu Suninen . \nMeanwhile, Kris Meeke went off the road on Saturday and finished the rally in 12th, one place ahead of Neuville. \nHere are the main stories from Rally Sweden 2017‚Ä¶ Latvala‚Äôs amazing triumph \nIt‚Äôs fair to say that no one expected Toyota to win this early in their WRC return. Ahead of the season start, the PR line was that this was a learning year, while there were mutterings in the press about the team being unprepared. That myth was dispelled at Rally Monte-Carlo, where both Jari-Matti Latvala and Juho H√§nninen showed great pace from the off, and Latvala claimed a podium. And now Latvala‚Äôs win ‚Äì albeit that he inherited the lead after Neuville‚Äôs mistake ‚Äì has totally debunked the theory. \nThe victory is Toyota‚Äôs first since Didier Auriol won at Rally China 1999. But should we read anything into the similarities between Toyota's win and Volkswagen‚Äôs re-arrival in the WRC in 2013, when they triumphed on only their second event in ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì Sweden? Jari-Matti Latvala chases down Toyota's first win ¬© Jaanus Ree/Red Bull Content Pool M-Sport's revival of fortunes continues \nMalcolm Wilson has made no secret of the fact that he had had to dig deep into his pockets to bring four-time champ S√©bastien Ogier into his privateer M-Sport team. But the investment is bringing the team exactly the sort of results he desired, and the squad seem to have a newfound spring in their step. \nOgier battled through Friday‚Äôs stages, often struggling with a lack of grip while running first on the road. But, classy performer that he is, he pressed on to bring the car home third ‚Äì although a spin on Sunday morning, which Ogier called ‚Äúthe most stupid mistake of my career‚Äù, ultimately cost him a shot of victory. \nMalcolm Wilson will also be delighted that Ott T√§nak, a driver he‚Äôs had faith in for so many years but who has often been frustratingly crash-prone, seems to have taken a leap in his performances, with the Estonian claiming his second podium of the season. S√©bastien Ogier powers through the powder ¬© Jaanus Ree/Red Bull Content Pool Another Neuville near-miss \nPoor Thierry Neuville must be spitting feathers. For the second rally in a row, the Belgian has shown startling pace in his Hyundai i20 WRC, establishing a comfortable lead only for a small mistake ‚Äì in Sweden, it was clipping a concrete block at the mostly-for-punters super special in Karlstad and damaging his steering column ‚Äì to rob him of victory. Neuville will doubtless be encouraged by his speed ‚Äì he was 43.3 seconds to the good over Latvala the stage before his crash ‚Äì but will be desperate to get some points on the board next time out in Mexico. √òstberg takes off \nNo records were set this year at the iconic Colin‚Äôs Crest, the Colin McRae-monikered jump towards the end of the Varg√•sen stage. In fact, most of the drivers took it easy through the crowd-lined leap ‚Äì save for Mads √òstberg, that is, who launched his new Ford Fiesta WRC 44 metres (the record, set in 2016 by WRC2 driver Eyvind Brynildsen, stands at 46m), much to the delight of the crowd. \nSee √òstberg's (slightly) tamer 42m jump from his fast pass through the stage in the video below‚Ä¶ . @MadsOstberg flying 42 meters at Colin's üëäüèº pic.twitter.com/onxHMiNXOj ‚Äî Rally Sweden (@RallySweden) February 11, 2017 Spoiler alert \nIt might have been √òstberg's exuberance that cost him his spoiler, which alarmingly fell off when he was at full chat through Stage Five and ruined his car‚Äôs handling. A hasty appeal from his team on Twitter led to a local returning the mammoth carbon fibre wing, so all is well! Help us retrieve the spoiler Mads lost on SS5 R√∏jden!

We had good preparation, good focus‚Ä¶ It feels like it was quite easy, but it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù \nMeanwhile, Tidemand's step-brother Oscar Solberg was also competing in the rally in a Ford Fiesta R2. And, unfortunately for Henning Solberg, his son beat him too, finishing the rally 28th overall, compared to Henning's 31st position.
