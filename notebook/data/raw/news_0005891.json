Andy Silver \nPublished on Feb. 1, 2017 \nFeb. 1, 2017 \nFormer Warriors captain Ryan Hoffman will leave the club after the 2017 season. \nThe news comes less than 24 hours after the club announced Roger Tuivasa-Sheck would assume the captaincy and that Storm and Kiwis forward Tohu Harris will join next year. \n\"It's difficult with the way the salary cap is,\" coach Stephen Kearney told Radio Sport . \n\"We won't be able to offer Ryan a contract in 2018.\" \nHoffman joined the Warriors after a long and successful career at the Storm and was promoted to captain last season after Simon Mannering stepped down. \nKearney and Hoffman were briefly teammates in Melbourne, with the coach saying it was a tough decision to make. \n\"I've known Ryan a long time and have the utmost respect for him,\" he said. \n\"In a tough time last year I thought - watching from afar - I thought he did a wonderful job. \n\"When I called Ryan into my office to tell him the news it was tough but it was an easier decision knowing how Ryan was going to take it. \n\"He's been wonderfully supportive of the decision and he can see why.\" \nIt is still unknown whether Hoffman - who hasn't commented on the situation - will play on next season.
