Editor Advertisement \nJust recently, it was announced that all NS men, whether the current ones or those who have already done their NS, will each get $100 in vouchers, which can be used at retail and food and beverage outlets. Today, The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said the token of recognition can never repay servicemen for sacrifices made in serving the nation. \nMindef's director of manpower Lee Chung Wei said focusing on the dollar value of the vouchers and other initiatives rolled out this year to celebrate NS \"cheapens\" the institution. He said: \"NS is priceless - you can't put a dollar value to it... If you focus on a dollar value, you are actually cheapening NS.\" So, why then is he contradicting himself? Why announce Mindef giving the $100 vouchers? Even reported that the vouchers funded by the government. \nIt's like saying you cannot put value in monetary terms to NS, but we are going to do it anyway, and claim credit for it, so everyone knows Government takes care of its NS men. So full of contradiction \nPat Ho \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
