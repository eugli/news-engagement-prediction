In fact, the two scenes shown in the edited video were filmed at different times.\" \nThat conclusion was based on viewing unedited footage from the set and on eyewitness accounts, group spokesman Mark Stubis said. \nWho may have leaked the video was not addressed in the report, and American Humane does not know who is responsible, he said. Dog's handling could have been gentler: American Humane \nAmerican Humane, which had an animal safety representative on the set, acknowledged that \"the handling of the dog in the first scene in the video should have been gentler and signs of stress recognised earlier\". \n\"That being said, it is important to note that this was recognised and the scene did not proceed as insinuated by the misleadingly edited video,\" the group added. \nThe dog was immediately taken to a warming tent, an examination found no signs of stress, and the dog later was returned to filming, it said. \nThe on-set representative, who American Humane said was joined by three trainers, a safety coordinator and a water safety diver throughout the scene, was suspended after the video's release. \nLisa Lange, senior vice president for the animal rights group PETA, called the report's findings incomplete and said the video still shows \"a frightened dog who did not wish to go into the water\". \n\"The fact that the dog did not get injured or die is not at issue, but questions remain\", including why the dog was checked at the time, Lange said in a statement. \n\"In the making of a film, no animal should be frightened at all. It is a film.\" \nAmerican Humane is the sole industry-sanctioned animal safety group on film and TV production sets. \nThe video's release had an immediate impact on A Dog's Purpose, which stars Dennis Quaid and features Josh Gad's voice, as a planned press day and premiere were cancelled. \nBut producer Amblin Entertainment and distributor Universal Pictures stuck to plans to release the PG-rated film a week ago in more than 3,000 North American theatres. \nDespite the controversy, the film, which had been pegged to open in the mid-$20-million range, still managed to earn an estimated $18.4 million and place second at the box office, behind psychological thriller Split. Studio representatives said that was in line with their hopes. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:47:58.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
