This is the direction a country such as Nigeria, that started oil and gas operations in the 1950s, should be taking,” he said. \nErikume explained that the government needs to encourage investments in the petroleum industry, by providing the enabling environment and respecting some of the agreements and concessions it has with operators. “When this is sorted out, investors would be more comfortable to invest,” he said. \nErikume also called for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), so as to get investors’ confidence in the industry. . \nHe stated: “From the national perspective, what most investors are looking forward to is the final decision on the PIB, which has taken too much time to complete. It has implications on the fiscal quality which will impact on how much dollar an investor would be able to recover if he embarked on crude oil exploration and production.” To address the issue, he said, the National Assembly, in consultation with stakeholders, has to expunge the portion of the bill that is related to corporate governance and administration from the fiscal and commercial aspects of the bill. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:34:48.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
