The trailer starts of showing the life one Poorna Malavath, a thirteen year old girl who comes from a very humble background and a regressive one at that. Story takes a turn when she decides to runaway from her house and joins a rock climbing club, where Rahul Bose is the coach. She turns out to be the best at mountaineering and Rahul Bose’s character wants her to conquer the Mount Everest. How he faces several obstacles on the way and how he succeeds and Poorna becomes the youngest girl to climb the mount everest, forms the crux of the trailer and I think of the film as well. It’s a perfect underdog story, that if executed well will surely resonate with the audience. As there is a dialogue in the trailer, when an official says to Rahul Bose, “We all know you have a weakness for underdogs”. And that is true with general public around the world. I mean who doesn’t like a perfect underdog story. \nThe trailer however reminds me of several other films in this genre, mainly last year’s Manoj Bajpayee starrer Budhia Singh- Born To Run , Shah Rukh Khan starrer Chak De! India etc. As mentioned above, it all depends on the way Rahul Bose executes the film. Considering his debut was Everybody Says I’m Fine, I don’t doubt it. \nCheck out the trailer below: \nDirected by Rahul Bose, the film stars child actor Aditi Inamdar in the titular role, along with Heeba Shah and Rahul Bose, himself. The film is up for a March 31 release. \nApart from this Rahul Bose will also be seen acting as main antagonist in Kamal Haasan’s Vishwaroopam 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:28:31.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
