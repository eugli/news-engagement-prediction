You know, it was not easy.\" \nA conservative political action committee called American Rising ridiculed her comments, stating: \n\"Hillary Clinton JUST said her family struggled ' ... to piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses,' after they left the White House. What she didnâ€™t mention? She had two houses, both mansions, AND in 2013 rented a $100,000 per WEEK summer home in the Hamptons. While American families are struggling to put food on the table, Hillary thinks her situation was bad.\" Sources of Income \nThe Clintons are said to have earned at least $100 million since leaving the White House in 2001, according to published reports. Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton told The Guardian in 2014 that she didn't consider herself \"truly well off.\" \nOf Americans who might see the Clintons as part of the elite 1 percent amid a growing wealth disparity in the United States, she said: \"They don't see me as part of the problem because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we've done it through dint of hard work.\" \nSo how does Hillary Clinton earn her money? \nSpeaking and writing books. \nHillary Clinton is said to have gotten paid $200,000 for each speech she's given since leaving her post as secretary of the Department of State under President Barack Obama. \nShe's also earned millions from writing books. \nHillary Clinton was paid an $8 million advance for her 2003 autobiography Living History , according to published reports.
