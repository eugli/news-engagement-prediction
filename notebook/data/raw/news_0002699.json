An Atlanta restaurant proprietor and Atlanta career musician partnered to open Atlanta’s newest entertainment venue. Sean Keenan and Mike Rizzi recently opened the doors to the 4,500-square-foot music venue and private event space The Vista Room in Oak Grove. 32 photos The Vista Room owners Sean Keenan and Mike Rizzi. Keenan, owner of Front Page News, Tijuana Garage and Napoleon’s Grill (a restaurant adjacent to The Vista Room), has become synonymous with live music in Atlanta. After partnering with Josh Sagarin to open Front Page News in Midtown in July 1996, Keenan and Sagarin opened a second location in 2002 in Little Five Points. With more room and an outdoor parking area at the new location, Keenan began throwing annual neighborhood music festivals — including the annual L5P Mardi Gras Music & Food Festival. But, in 2010, Keenan had an opportunity to take over an old grocery store in his neighborhood and convert it to a restaurant, which became known as Napoleon’s Grill. The restaurant began hiring pub bands and developed a reputation around Decatur as the place to go aside from the iconic Eddie’s Attic. Enter Rizzi , the drummer of the Atlanta-based band Ed Roland & The Sweet Tea Project and John Driskell Hopkins of Zac Brown Band. Rizzi has also played with and for numerous other bands and artists including Five Eight and Sonia Leigh . Keenan and Rizzi became fast friends as Rizzi , who said it’s been a lifelong dream of his to be a music venue owner, would frequently sit-in with bands at Keenan’s restaurant and the two would discuss their passion for and the history of music. “I grew up playing guitar and in some local bands and always had a strong passion for live music,” Keenan said. “However, while Front Page News, Tijuana Garage and Napoleon’s were good outlets for cover style bar bands, they were not equipped to host original acts that required full stage and production necessary to experience a band as it should be.” Keenan remembers how the two would talk about what they thought made for a good venue. \"We'd talk about how we wanted a place that would be a good experience for both the listener and the musicians,” Keenan said. “I saw Rizzi was a go-getter and wasn’t afraid to be aggressive to get the right talent for the club.” With Keenan’s experience running restaurants and bars as well as hiring local bands and regional acts combined with Rizzi ’s knowledge of a touring musician and the experience on the road, the duo began planning The Vista Room in late 2015. “When I met Sean, immediately I knew he shared the same passion as I did for music, and understands musicians,” Rizzi said. “This made it easier for me to come in and execute shows creatively with nontraditional, out of the box ideas.” While in Los Angles working on numerous projects, Rizzi said he felt there was a disconnect between the movie and film communities. “The Vista is a multi-use venue, and we wanted to build something that could be shared by all arts including our booming music and movie industry here in Atlanta,” Rizzi said. “I know it takes more work but I'd like to put on special types of shows here.” Rizzi notes the conceptual idea for The Vista Room was to build something that felt like yesteryear. “A place to enjoy yourself, make memories, be a part of the community and celebrate life,” Rizzi said. “The Vista was built under those rules… I love the Atlanta music scene. I'm proud to be a part of it in more ways than one. It's a special venue.” But, Rizzi and Keenan understand they’ll need to curate shows that people will talk about for years if they want to become live-music titans in Atlanta like the late iconic concert promoter Alex Cooley and his partner the now Live Nation Atlanta President Peter Conlon — the duo behind Atlanta's storied Concert/Southern Promotions. “We are dedicated to keeping the live music experience alive and well for the next generation and provide a venue that hosts seasoned national acts to the next legends of music,” Keenan said. “We want to be the next Conlon and Cooley music team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:38:47.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
