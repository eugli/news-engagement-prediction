Carl Snelgrove has said he was parked on the night of the alleged assault.\nThe walkabout is a chance for the jury to view the area where the woman, who was 21 at the time of the alleged assault in December 2014, says she was offered a ride by Snelgrove.\nShe testified earlier that the officer helped her get into her basement apartment through a window because she couldn't find her keys.\nCarl Snelgrove talks to his lawyer, Randy Piercey. (Glenn Payette/CBC)\nThe next thing she remembers is not having any clothes on and Snelgrove having sex with her. She said she had been drinking and didn't think she consented to sex.\nSnelgrove testified the woman asked for a ride, invited him in to her apartment, and initiated sex. He said she was aware of everything while it was happening.\n'I just wanted to go home and sleep,' testifies woman accusing cop of sexual assault\nSex was consensual, tearful police officer tells sexual assault trial Woman may have blacked out, says expert A toxicologist from Nova Scotia, who testified by video link Tuesday, said the woman may have experienced a \"blackout\" after drinking alcohol.\nDr. Peter Mullen was called as a defence witness. While he did not speak with the complainant or with Snelgrove, he was given copies of their statements to police as well as statements made at a preliminary hearing.\nDr. Peter Mullen testified by video link from Nova Scotia. (Glenn Payette/CBC)\nHe said prior to a blackout, a person may appear normal, or \"the life of the party,\" showing no signs of intoxication â€” but not remember details afterward, until they are questioned about what happened.\nAccording to Mullen, women experience more blackouts than men.\nHis written opinion to the court is that \"consistent with her inability to recollect certain events (including sexual activity), [the complainant] could have suffered an alcohol-induced blackout on Dec. 21, 2014.\"\nWith files from Glenn Payette", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:58:52.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
