The president's decision to defund NASA's Earth Science divisions —and more recently to censor environmental agencies such as the EPA, the National Parks Service, and the Department of Agriculture over climate change data—has spurred scientists around the world to speak out against the administration.

An open letter to President Trump signed by over 150 science agencies and societies argues that this limitation of free travel is broadly harmful to the scientific community, and the United States suffers directly from such a policy. \nThe Executive Order will discourage many of the best and brightest international students, scholars, engineers and scientists from studying and working, attending academic and scientific conferences, or seeking to build new businesses in the United States.
