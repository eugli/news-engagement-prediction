Jabrill Peppers, Christian McCaffrey (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:08 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:08 p.m. ET \nIt's February, so 2017 NFL mock drafts are on the clock. \nWith the real draft still more than two months away and both NFL free agency and the Combine still yet to take place, a lot will change. \nBut for now, based on what we know, here's a first shot at the first-round projections. NFL Mock Draft 2017 1. Browns: Myles Garrett, DE/OLB, Texas A&M \nCleveland needs plenty beyond a quarterback, a position it can acquire several other ways, including a later draft pick. So why not take the best all-around prospect in the class, a player who can emerge soon as one of the league's dominant pass rushers? Keep in mind what former Aggie Von Miller brought to the Broncos. 2. 49ers: Jonathan Allen, DT/DE, Alabama \nThis is based on San Francisco making an aggressive, pre-draft move to land a veteran QB ( hello, Jimmy Garoppolo ). Going to a base 4-3 under new defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, the Niners must keep building their line despite recently addressing it with DeForest Buckner and Arik Armstread, who were drafted for a 3-4. 3. Bears: Mitch Trubisky, QB, North Carolina \nIs Trubisky is the best QB in the draft? No , but he will look the part with his accuracy to vie to be the first off the board to the right team. Chicago, with Jay Cutler done, is that team, because Trubisky really feels like the anti-Cutler. \nMORE: Top 10 QBs in 2017 NFL Draft 4. Jaguars: Jamal Adams, S, LSU \nJacksonville found a good safety early in the 2013 draft in Johnathan Cyprien, but just as he has emerged as a force, he's now a free agent. Adams is right there with Garrett and Allen as potential immediate defensive impact players. 5. Titans (from Rams): Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State \nTennessee with its two first-round picks needs to take advantage of some strong secondary talent near the top of the board. It can get the best corner here, ahead of the corner-desperate Jets. Lattimore has great size and big-time coverage skills. 6. Jets: Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson \nNew York has made a habit of drafting struggling pro QBs in later rounds, so it's about time the Jets go after somebody who can be the franchise's answer. Watson's winning experience is as attractive as his athletic skill set. He's the complete package. 7. Chargers: Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State \nSan Diego could reach for some offensive line help here, but this point in the draft lines up with its glaring need for a ballhawking safety. With Joey Bosa wreaking havoc on the front end, they can get another Buckeye to clean up on the back end. 8. Panthers: Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU \nThis mock pick is developing into a consensus because it makes a ton of sense for Carolina. The time is right to land a young, explosive feature back to replace Jonathan Stewart and complement Cam Newton with a runner of this caliber. \nWATCH: Fournette is a \"freak show\" 9. Bengals: Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford \nCincinnati has to rebuild its defense to have any chance of returning to the playoffs in the near future. An edge rusher is the highest priority on that side of the ball, and Thomas is a seamless fit for the Bengals' scheme with a good chance at immediate flash. 10. Bills: Mike Williams, WR, Clemson \nThey'll be on standby for Watson, but if the national champs' QB isn't available, the Bills can simply take his former college go-to guy. Williams, despite some concerns about his true gamebreaking ability, is the best wideout in the class and is the ideal outside type to pair with speedy fellow former Tiger Sammy Watkins. 11. Saints: Reuben Foster, ILB, Alabama \nIn order to keep up with other teams in the NFC South, New Orleans needs a thumper who can clean up everything in the middle of the field. Atlanta (Deion Jones), Carolina (Luke Kuechly) and Tampa Bay (Kwon Alexander) are way ahead. Foster will make the Saints catch up fast with his rangy playmaking skills. 12. Browns (from Eagles): DeShone Kizer, QB, Notre Dame \nCleveland has watched Kizer with great interest for a long time. He has many of the traits offensive-minded coach Hue Jackson likes, and Kizer's raw talents can convert into something special with the right coaching. This pick sounds more surprising than it actually would be. 13. Cardinals: Quincy Wilson, CB, Florida \nArizona often got torched opposite Patrick Peterson last season. Wilson is one of two terrific Gator cornerback prospects who are pretty close on most teams' boards, and his size and stability can be the tiebreaker for this selection. 14. Eagles (from Vikings): Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan \nPhiladelphia took Carson Wentz in last year's first-round â€” now the Sam Bradford trade can help it get his true No. 1 receiver in 2017. Davis has good size (6-2, 205 pounds) and speed, but what stands out is his precise route-running, which is critical for Doug Pederson's offense. 15. Colts: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State \nThere's no doubt from a production, durability and receiving perspective, Cook has some edges over Fournette. Indianapolis isn't settling at all for the second back off the board, because he's the young, all-around feature back perfect to succeed Frank Gore and take more pressure off Andrew Luck. 16. Ravens: Jalen \"Teez\" Tabor, CB, Florida \nTabor has great natural ball skills, but he will need to coached up to be more consistent in staying with receivers downfield and improve as a tackler. Baltimore is a good place for that, with Jimmy Smith being a terrific current case in point. 17. Redskins: Jabrill Peppers, S, Michigan \nWashingon needs help at both safety and inside linebacker. Some teams might be off Peppers because of his \"tweener\" status and the challenge of trying to fit him in a defense. The Redskins should welcome that kind of versatility. 18. Titans: John Ross, WR, Washington \nThere's no way Tennessee, with two first-round picks, won't tap into this draft's top wideout talent. The Titans are missing a speedy home-run hitter who can take the top off a defense, which in turn would help open up the running game even more. Vertical and versatile are the buzzwords for Ross. 19. Buccaneers: Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee \nTampa Bay has loaded up at linebacker, and it still has Gerald McCoy as the inside anchor of its defensive line. But the Buccaneers need to get better at the ends in order to have more pass-rush pop in a division with Matt Ryan, Cam Newton and Drew Brees. Barnett fits the bill with his power and production. \nMORE: Edge rushers to watch at the Combine 20. Broncos: Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin \nDenver will be tempted by a tight end here, given this isn't the strongest class for offensive linemen. But tackle is a real position of need, and Ramczyk is the best option early. 21. Lions: Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan \nDetroit needs to spark its pass rush, too, and needing to go just a little down the road for Charlton at Michigan is a nice bonus. The Lions see what Ziggy Ansah has become, so there's some freakish familiarity here. 22. Dolphins: O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama \nSure, Miami is getting Julius Thomas, but it's also losing two tight ends in free agency, Jordan Cameron and Dion Sims. Thomas' durability in Jacksonville was iffy, and much of his production came in the red zone. Howard provides a different element as a field-stretching athlete, and the combination of the two would be fun in Adam Gase's offense. 23. Giants: David Njoku, TE, Miami \nNew York kept Will Tye but cut No. 3 wideout Victor Cruz and won't re-sign free agent Larry Donnell. The Giants might think offensive line here if the prospect is right, but they should be fine with taking the next great Hurricanes tight end. Although New York had some good years from Jeremy Shockey, Njoku is more of the Greg Olsen type they've been missing. \nMORE: Meet the next great TE from Miami 24. Raiders: Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama \nOakland thought it was fine at corner last season, but aging Sean Smith was a massive free-agent bust in working with David Amerson. The Raiders need some stability and playmaking potential in the secondary to play off their front seven attack, and Humphrey can provide both. 25. Texans: Garett Bolles, OT, Utah \nNo matter how they proceed at quarterback, the Texans need to bring in another athletic offensive lineman as a blocking anchor. Bolles is a good fit all-around for coach Bill O'Brien. 26. Seahawks: Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama \nSeattle has been trying to come up with makeshift answers at offensive tackle, and none have worked. Robinson has slipped a little in the draft evaluation process, but he still projects as a strong, long-term run blocker for the right side. 27. Chiefs: Sidney Jones, CB, Washington \nKansas City has enjoyed the dynamic play of former Huskies corner Marcus Peters. Jones has developed into a bit of a Peters clone in the same program, and the Chiefs shouldn't mind having two aggressive on-ball playmakers in their secondary. 28. Cowboys: Charles Harris, DE, Missouri \nHarris also fits a 3-4, but Dallas with its 4-3 isn't about to ignore an explosive edge rusher who falls into its lap. The Cowboys have taken too many chances with the position. Harris brings good energy with his quickness and agility, and he can be productive from multiple spots. 29. Packers: Takkarist McKinley, OLB, UCLA \nFormer Bruin Datone Jones and former Trojan Nick Perry are both free agents from Green Bay's 3-4 edge, and the potential of losing both makes pass-rush production a high priority for the Packers. McKinley is a high-effort player who would mesh nicely with the relentless Clay Matthews. 30. Steelers: Tim Williams, OLB, Alabama \nPittsburgh can keep adding to its young, swarming defense with yet another first round-worthy Crimson Tide stud. Williams' quickness and explosiveness matches what the Steelers have piled up at the position. 31. Falcons: Carl Lawson, DE, Auburn \nDespite Vic Beasley Jr. going off in 2016 , Atlanta's pass rush didn't have much else. Now that Beasley is flying around on the second level, too, the Falcons need some more edge help up front. Lawson is the best 4-3 talent left for them at this point. 32. Patriots: Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford \nLeGarrette Blount is a free agent, and Dion Lewis remains a durability concern. James White was the Super Bowl hero, but McCaffrey would be the ultimate luxury Swiss Army Knife for Josh McDaniels' offense. It doesn't hurt that he can improve the Patriots' return game, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:38:37.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
