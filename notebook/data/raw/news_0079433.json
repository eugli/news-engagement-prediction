Raptor persecution \nAll 14 countries are able to revoke hunting licences if the legislation is contravened and most also penalise serious breaches of hunting law. \nIn Scotland, game birds can be shot during their open season, which vary according to the species. \nOther than the firearms legislation, which provides the necessary control for access to firearms, there is very little regulation associated with hunting game birds. \nEnvironment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: \"We will be looking very carefully at these different management approaches to see whether they offer the means to address issues such as raptor persecution. \n\"Already we have committed to a number of new measures to tackle wildlife crime within Scotland including; increases in criminal penalties, a prevention review and the creation of a dedicated investigative support unit within Police Scotland.\" Sustainable hunting \nThe Scottish government requested the report as part of a package of work to tackle wildlife crime and, particularly, the illegal killing of raptors. \nIt also forms part of an ongoing, broader discussion about how land is owned and managed for public benefit. \nThe 14 countries reviewed were Germany, Norway, Sweden, Spain, France, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Slovakia, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Denmark, with five chosen as case studies. \nAll the case-study countries drew a link between the regulation of sustainable hunting and the conservation of game bird species. \nEarlier research found the countries with the most significant problem with the illegal killing of predatory birds included the UK and Spain. 'Tougher sentences' \nSNH chairman Ian Ross said: \"This review provides an in-depth look at how other countries in Europe control game bird hunting to make sure it's safe and sustainable. \n\"It can also inform our thinking on tackling wildlife crime.\" \nDuncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: \"We are clear that the failure by grouse moor owners over decades to self-regulate and put a stop to the illegal killing of raptors and the carrying-out of other unsustainable land management practices has led us to this point. \n\"We support the licensing of 'driven' grouse shooting, with clear sanctions to remove such licences on individual landholdings if there is evidence of illegal practice.\" \nA spokesman for Scottish Land & Estates said: \"The research demonstrates that although a licensing system may be in operation, the nature of what that licensing regime entails varies significantly from country to country, and is frequently determined by historical traditions and government structures. \n\"We have and continue to support tougher sentences for wildlife crime in Scotland, but what this research also makes clear is that wildlife crime remains a concern in many countries that have licensing regulation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:42:13.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
