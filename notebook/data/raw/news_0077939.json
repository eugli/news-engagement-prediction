We were chugging along, and then, all of a sudden out of nowhere, it turned into a Maury Povich paternity test show. It was the weirdest TV finale since ‘Lost,'” Kimmel said. “I’m sure you’ve at least heard, ‘La La Land’ was simultaneously the biggest winner and loser last night…You know it’s a strange night when the word ‘envelope’ is trending on Twitter.” \nDuring his funny monologue, Kimmel also explained how the show was supposed to end: the plan was for him to finish the show from the audience, sitting next to Matt Damon . \n“The plan is for me to end the show from the audience next to Matt Damon, who, make no mistake — whatever confusion there was about who won — Matt Damon lost. He was a loser. He is a loser,” Kimmel joked. “But we’re sitting there and we notice some commotion going on and Matt says, ‘I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong,’ which is unusual, but you figure, well, the host will go onstage and clear this up. And then I remember, ‘Oh I’m the host!'” \n(Watch Kimmel’s full monologue from “Jimmy Kimmel Live” above.) \nIn the final moments of the Academy Awards ceremony, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway presented the last award, but they were incorrectly given the best actress award envelope. Beatty, who was clearly confused and knew something was wrong, saw Emma Stone’s name and “La La Land” on the card, and then handed the envelope to Dunaway, who incorrectly announced the musical as the Best Picture winner. It wasn’t until a few minutes later — after “La La Land” producers had given their acceptance speeches — that word of the monumental mix-up got to the stage, prompting the cast and crew of “Moonlight” to head to the podium to accept the biggest prize of the night. \nDuring the fiasco, Kimmel came up to the stage and jokingly took responsibility, quipping, “I knew I would screw this show up.” The first-time Oscars host looked shaken and upset, as did the rest of the A-list audience, but nonetheless, Kimmel was well-reviewed for putting on an entertaining show with creative bits and a spot-on monologue . \nToday, PricewaterhouseCooper, the company that handles the Oscar envelopes, took responsibility for the history-making fail, stating that the Best Picture envelope was pulled from the wrong pile . (There are two envelopes for each category.) A partner from PwC said, “We clearly made a mistake and once the mistake was made we corrected it and owned up to it.” \nThe Academy still has yet to apologize to the “La La Land” and “Moonlight” filmmakers. \nHere’s the moment the “La La Land” filmmakers realized there was a mistake at the Oscars: Watch the moment #LaLaLand 's filmmakers realized there was a mistake. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/mXQt6lv2aX", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:46:33.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
