Where's Matti?' \nDeb Conley and Jeanette McEachen met through Facebook soon after and the families bonded over their shared grief, corresponding many times a year. This is the first time Conley and Stewart have visited Christchurch. They are staying with the McEachens. \n\"It's nice to have a connection in Christchurch,\" Stewart said. \"Being so far away and not being in the city and experiencing it as everybody here has. It's kind of helped us keep a little more connected. JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nStewart, Jeanette McEachen and Conley throw scented petals into the Avon River. \n\"We had talked about coming out for the five-year [anniversary], but then we knew that the memorial wouldn't be completed so we decided to wait for year six. It would just mean a little bit more to us.\" \nThe families visited the memorial at a private ceremony on Tuesday night, and again after Wednesday's unveiling. \"I thought it was lovely,\" Stewart said. \n\"The fact that you can go up and touch your loved one's name and you've got a place to sit and reflect. There's so much life going on around the wall itself. It's just peaceful. It's nice that it's a living space and that people can continue to use the space.\" SUPPLIED \nMatti McEachen died trying to escape the tattoo parlour he worked in, Southern Ink. \nConley and Stewart end their week-long inaugural visit on Friday. They plan to return. They have friends here now. Ad Feedback \n\"It's always interesting to meet another family,\" Bruce McEachenâ€‹ said. \n\"Particularly one from overseas because they don't have the same shared experience that we've got. We've got other families to talk to. \n\"It's very strange conditions to form a friendship under. That is the sole defining thing that's made us friends. You'd never want to make friends the same way again.\" SUPPLIED \nRachel Conley, 27, was leaving the Southern Ink tattoo parlour when the earthquake hit. She was killed by falling rubble. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:05:59.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
