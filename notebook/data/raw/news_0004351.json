'Security reasons' \nA higher number of postboxes are being installed in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain. \nThe Royal Mail said this is because \"the rural nature \" of Northern Ireland \"meant that the postbox density was lower than elsewhere\". \n\"In urban areas, postboxes may have been previously removed due to security reasons,\" it added. \nThere are approximately 115,300 postboxes currently in service across the UK. \nAfter installation of the first 700 new boxes, 98% of all households in the UK will be within half a mile of a postbox. \nSpeaking about the announcement Kellin McCloskey, head of postal services at the Consumer Council said: \"We welcome today's announcement by Royal Mail regarding the installation of approximately 280 new postboxes across Northern Ireland. \n\"We have been involved in early discussions with Royal Mail to ensure consumers can more easily access postal services through increasing its post box coverage. \n\"Given NI had the lowest level of post boxes of all UK nations, this is good news for consumers in NI,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:06:41.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
