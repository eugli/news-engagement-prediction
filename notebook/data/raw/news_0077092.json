There was repeated criticism of the government throughout the winter for the crisis in social care which NHS and council chiefs have said is chronically underfunded. \nThe Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence and legal commitments to spend 0.7% of GDP on international aid will also continue to be met, the Treasury said. \n“We are committed to a modern, high-quality public sector that delivers the services people need in the most efficient way possible,” Gauke said. \n“There has been considerable progress, but there is further to go and the whole of government is working together to consider how we can live within our means while delivering maximum value for every pound of taxpayers’ money.” \nMcDonnell said the chancellor “urgently needs to explain why this announcement was made in the way it was and why after seven years of failed austerity he thinks more of the same will now work”. \nHe said: “For all Hammond’s talk of ‘resetting’ the Tory government’s economic policy last summer it is now beyond doubt that Hammond represents more of the same Tory austerity. \n“Sneaking out an announcement asking departments to model cuts of 3% and 6% for 2019/20 is no way to manage public spending.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:07:50.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
