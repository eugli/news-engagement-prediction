A group of men walk into the Ace Cafe. Sam Cooke's Chain Gang is playing on the jukebox while the combs come out to redress the gelled crew cut. Dressed in clean cut suits swathed with a dash of psychedelic as the sound of a tiny two-stroke from a distance reveals a light a blue scooter pulling up in the parking lot. \nThese were the mods. A British subculture that now needs a \"revival\" every year. What also needs a revival are scooters that can stand apart from being handy grocery-shopping tools. And that seems to be Piaggio's prerogative being Italian and owners of the famed Vespa brand. The Vespa is a timeless design, unimpeded from demographic shifts or change in fashion. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nBut wait, there's another brand under their umbrella, one that has been selling scooters as much as they've been eyeing the SBK world championship titles. That ladies and gentlemen, is Aprilia for you. Come 2016 and we now have two all-Italian 150cc scooters (and they're the only ones) in India that are lifestyle products more than a utilitarian necessity. \nDesign: \nThe Vespa is a timeless design, unimpeded from demographic shifts or change in fashion, yet adoption of newer technology was imminent. This particular example is called the SXL150 and visually, it's a spitting image of the Vespa S. It's a throwback to generations of Vespa scooters and defines retro as far as scooter designs are concerned. The Vespa is a timeless design, unimpeded from demographic shifts or change in fashion. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nThe more important aspect is the kind of build quality that the SXL150 exudes. From the plush feel of the handlebar grips to the cold touch of metal that the panels are built of, even the switchgear, everything feels premium and scores above anything else out there. Lots of chrome, like back in the day. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nThe Aprilia on the other hand, doesn't impress as much. Plastics, lots of it, comprise the body of the SR150 but look beyond the cover and solid build quality is what shines through. There were no rattles from the panels to speak of during our test. Plastics, lots of it, comprise the body of the SR150 but look beyond the cover and solid build quality is what shines through.(Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nPolar opposites are what both these scooters are. One standing tall for the hipsters while the other dons the sportiest attire a scooter can for even motorcycle loyalist to go weak in the knees. Turn indicators integrated neatly on the cowl. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nEngine: \nThere is one thing that binds the two together though - the engine. The 150cc engine on the Vespa develops nearly a bhp more than the 154cc Aprilia but the latter equates the torque figure and also manages to peak it 500rpms lower. The Aprilia uses altered ratios in its CVT gearbox and with the bigger 14-inch wheels covering more distance than the smaller 11 and 10-inch combination of the Vespa, it surges forth on standstill starts. The Vespa will be hot on its heels but always an arms-length away. Both pull cleanly and effortlessly off the line but the SR150 seems evidently faster, making a spirited exhaust note while the SXL150's smoothness extends to its mellow note making no fuss about the quick progress. Twist-and-go, it doesn't get any simpler or quicker, at least by scooter standards in the Indian market. The smoother mill of the two, refinement is top notch. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nDrop the anchors and the Aprilia is eager to halt, maintaining its full composure and the twin-piston calliper bites the 220mm disc with feedback akin to motorcycles than scooters. Thanks to the tyres as the wider 120mm front section finds more rubber to bite into the tarmac than the Vespa. But thinner tyres aren't the ones holding the Vespa back. It's \"anti-dive\" suspension does dive under heavy braking and seems clumsy enough to load the front tyre threatening to washout the front end. Mr Hipster would've accounted for emergency braking situations, or so I'm hoping. Lower bhp but grunty low-end power sets 0-60kmph in under 7 seconds. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nHandling: \nTalking about stability, it's the handling characteristics that make the two scooters look in opposite directions again. The Vespa boasts of a monocoque construction and you'd be rightfully expecting taut handling but there are visible body vibrations while going over undulated roads. Retro from the front to the back.(Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nFollowing the Vespa, I could see a slight quiver at the rear and that's discomforting for your confidence in its stability. But straight-line stability? No problem as the chassis is taut but roundabouts do bother the Vespa, the front end of which is eager to buck into the turn. I did have a hairy moment while testing when once I nearly lost the front and another occasion where the rear ran out of ground clearance. Turning it down a notch was the only solution as quick inputs didn't go down well with the Vespa. In traffic though, there's definite agility with the lighter, more nimble front end. No LEDs here mister. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nThe Aprilia on the other hand relies much on its quickness. It's a tad lazier to turn in traffic and likes a clear line for quick squirts of the throttle to keep yourself ahead. But forget that this is a scooter and actively throw it into a roundabout, the SR150 rewards with stability and grip from the chassis and tyres respectively. Post testing, I also noticed that the chicken strip on the front tyre was wider than the rear making me think if a thinner front tyre would've sufficed and also aided in quicker steering. Ana-digi clocks feature trip meters, clock, fuel gauge, odometer. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nBut if Aprilia chose the wider profile for looks alone, I'm not going to complain. I do have complaints about the ride quality though. The SR's stiff setup definitely helps it on smooth surfaces and corners but it's almost jarring at low speeds. Damping is nearly non-existent and only starts working as speeds build up, which is when the ride becomes a bit acceptable. I'd suspect inferior suspension to curb costs but wouldn't be able to verify that till we know the components used in the European markets. The Vespa remains plush throughout, the softer suspension setup soaks bumps well at low speeds and undulations are flattened well as speeds climb higher. Barebones clocks are disappointing. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nWhat we like? \nSo it's clear isn't it? If you want a sporty, motorcycle-like scooter that aces the handling department and packs a punch with its motor then the SR150 it is for you. If swagger seems too hip-hop and you'd rather swing to the Beach Boys, then you're definitely picking up the Vespa for all of its suave styling, quality components and the backup of its healthy performance. Right? Well... I wish things were as simple. The SXL150 (left) has a larger storage space under the seat. The SR150 likes to keep it light. Good for riding gloves and a jacket but none could fit our full-size lids. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nVerdict \nLest you forget, you're going to be paying top dollar for the Vespa while Aprilia is putting up a very reasonable asking for the SR making it terrific value for money. But your choice will not just be dictated by a difference of nearly twenty five thousand rupees, in cash-stricken currency (at least Vespa is accepting Paytm for bookings). Let me also remind you that modern utilities are restricted with both scooters. The Vespa will be hot on the apriliaâ€™s heels but always an arms-length away. Both pull effortlessly off the line. (Photo: Nishant Jhamb) \nApart from underseat storage, the Vespa's floorboard tunnel hinders its usage to carry something there and real estate is also at a premium with the Aprilia. Of course there are no charging sockets or USB port like other 110cc scooters. \nBut hey, these aren't \"other\" scooters. They're special and if you're considering them then you're already past those hurdles. But a lakh rupees on road for the Vespa SXL150? I'm already feeling a little hot under the collar. Keys to the SR150 please.
