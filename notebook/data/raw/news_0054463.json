A sometimes food. \nOh the horror. \nThe food police found the contraband item hidden in the lunch box of four-year-old Isabel. \nWhether Isabel was in on the elaborate plan to smuggle the item into Lonsdale Heights School K-7 it isn’t clear, but authorities were quick to swoop in and confiscate the offending piece of cake. was it chocolate cake? Source: iStock Source: istock \nThe guilty party — Isabel’s mum, Jessica Gianoni — faced disciplinary action in the form that schools and preschools tend to favour these days. \nA note placed in the lunchbox. Right there, where just hours earlier, sat a delicious piece of homemade cake. \nThe Advertiser reports that Jessica, upon unpacking her daughter’s launch box one afternoon last week, came across the note. \nThe shame Jessica. The shame. The note sent home in the lunchbox of a child at a Lonsdale school about a ‘sometimes food’. Source: Supplied. Source: Supplied \n“WHOOPS!!” the note read. \n“Sorry, cake is a sometimes food,” \n“Today your child was packed a ‘sometimes’ food in their lunch box that doesn’t align with our Healthy Eating Policy.” \nThe note said that Isabel was offered “a healthy alternative instead (smiley face).” \n“If you need suggestions for healthy food alternatives please feel free to speak to the Kindy Staff.” \nJessica told The Advertiser the tone of the note was “very condescending.” \n“As a parent, I should be able to choose what my child should have,” she said. \n“She had a container of fruit including a banana, a sandwich and rice crackers. It wasn’t like the cake was the only thing she had to eat. \n“Instead of putting the note in her lunch box, she (the teacher) could have spoken to me when I picked Isabel up.” Another mum found this note just weeks ago. Source: Supplied. Source: Supplied \nBut a teacher at the school, Bianca Clothier stood up for the action taken saying parents helped devise the healthy eating policy last year after staff noticed students’ behaviour worsened when they ate sugary foods. \nShe said the “little reminder notes” used language consistent with what students were taught in the curriculum. \nIt seems like lunch shaming notes are quite popular in South Australia. \nThe initial lunch box note — first published by Kidspot went viral and made headlines right across the world, prompting the Education Department to announce to The Advertiser that placing notes in lunch boxes was “not a standard practice” \nThe Department said preschools had to have healthy eating policies “under national law”, with parent engagement a key aspect. \nIt said preschool staff were “able to review their communication practices about how they promote” the healthy eating policies. \nWe just want to know who got to eat Isabel’s piece of cake?
