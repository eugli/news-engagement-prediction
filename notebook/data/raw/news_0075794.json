Stein said he understood why Trump didn’t want to go be a “punching bag” for the media again. Conversely, Brianna Keilar then asked him how he felt about Trump slamming the press and calling them “the enemy” in recent days. \nUnamused, Stein began to scold CNN (and the media at large), stating that many people view the press as an “unelected aristocracy” of “snobs” determined to negatively cover the president at every turn. \nI wouldn’t say all the media are the enemy, but look, every day you pick up The New York Times . Everyday they’re slamming, slamming, slamming him. I’m a great fan of CNN. I watch it quite faithfully every day. CNN is slamming him, slamming him, slamming him. Every day they are looking for a scandal. They are turning the woods upside down looking for a scandal. They are hoping, I think, to do what they did to Nixon a long time ago…I don’t blame him for being furious at them. \nKeilar referenced moments where CNN covered Trump in a positive light, though Stein kept slamming the network’s critical coverage of the president saying, “I don’t blame [Trump] for wanting to fire back at them.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:48:49.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
