Maine (23 percent) and Massachusetts (25 percent) also had a smaller number of residents identifying as very religious. \nGallup’s results were derived from 174,969 interviews conducted between January and December 2016. The research company has been collecting data about the religiosity of American states annually since 2008 . The first analysis of this data was released in 2009. \nOverall, Gallup found that the percentage of U.S. adults identifying as very religious has shrunk, from 41 percent in 2008 to 38 percent in 2016. The number of nonreligious has increased slightly, from 30 percent in 2008 to 32 percent in 2016. \nHowever, there has been relatively little change in how American states ranked in terms of religiosity since Gallup started tracking this data. Mississippi was also the most religious state in 2015, with 63 percent of residents identifying as very religious. New Hampshire was the least religious state in 2015, but Vermont was just 2 percentage points behind. \nSince 2008, most of the top 10 most religious states have been in the South, except for Utah, the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The regions with the least number of people identifying strongly with religion have been the upper Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest.

Pew found that 83 percent of adults in Mississippi are Christian. Most Christians in the state are evangelical Protestant (41 percent), with many identifying as part of the Southern Baptist tradition (21 percent). \nIt’s a completely different scenario in Vermont. Pew found that 54 percent of adults in Vermont were Christian. Most of Vermont’s Christians are Catholic (22 percent). On the other hand, 37 percent of people in Vermont were religiously unaffiliated. Twenty-two percent said they were “nothing in particular.” \nNewport wrote in Gallup’s report that there’s “no clear-cut answer” that explains these state-to-state differences in religiosity. One possible explanation is how religion interacts with culture in each state. People moving into more religious states may end up attending religious services more often because their neighbors are doing the same. Children growing up in Mississippi may end up being more religious than people growing up in states where religion isn’t as strongly a part of the culture. \n“These cultures can be self-sustaining and extend beyond the life of any one resident,” Newport wrote.

One of Germany's most famous landmarks, Cologne Cathedral, was plunged into darkness in early January in protest over a march planned by a growing grass-roots anti-Muslim movement in the country. \"By switching off the floodlighting we want to make those on the march stop and think. It is a challenge: consider who you are marching alongside,\" Cathedral Dean Norbert Feldhoff told Reuters at the time.
