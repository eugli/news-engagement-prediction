A police officer found her body “in a wooded area near Bastimentos’ shore” on Sunday, La Prensa said. \nMs Johannet was no naive tourist but a seasoned world traveller who had recently completed a stint steaching English in Vietnam. Her last social media post suggested she was having the time of her life in Panama when tragedy struck. \n“I found paradise and it’s called Isla Ina,” she wrote on Instagram on January 28 alongside a selfie of her beaming on a beach. \nTributes for the young woman have started flowing, with family and friends posting moving tributes on Facebook. \n“We love and miss her dearly,” her brother Paul wrote. \n“She was a world traveller — by the age of 23, she had already visited 6 continents and innumerable countries, including a recent 18-month trip to Vietnam where she taught English Literature to local students.

I’ll always look up to my youngest sister.” \nMs Johannet’s older sister Laura posted details of a funeral service to be held at Scarsdale Congregational Church in New York on Saturday. \nHer parents have left a sign addressed to the media on the front door of the family home that reads: “Our family is in the midst of grieving. We ask you to respect our privacy. We respectfully decline to comment any further at this time. Please vacate the premises.” Catherine Johannet had recently spent 18 months teaching English in Vietnam.
