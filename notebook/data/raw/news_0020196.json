While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. “The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together,” said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers’ digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany’s vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany’s historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world. The experience of Volkswagen is a case in point. The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal , is the world’s biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That is where Mr. Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Mr. Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. “The whole mobility market — transportation as a service — is just at the beginning,” Mr. Harms said. Volkswagen’s recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Müller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal . Under Mr. Müller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London. But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers’ best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry — and other traditional sectors — to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. “A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can’t put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update,” he said. “We are the ones who already know how to do it very well.” \nFollow Jack Ewing @JackEwingNYT and Mark Scott @markscott82 on Twitter.
