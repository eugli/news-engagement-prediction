He indicated that he is not perturbed about turn of events as they stay in opposition in the next four years adding that he is still the outspoken person with tough skin and nothing can tame him. Speaking with Lantam Papanko host of Ultimate Breakfast Show, he warned that no member of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) can attempt to besiege his house talk less of seizing his properties. The vociferous general secretary indicated that successive governments are pushed into opposition based on the first step they take immediately they assume power. ‘I am not living fear at all, maybe you don’t know the name Asiedu Nketia, nobody and nothing can calm me down, I have lived through this thing before. I lived through erstwhile Kufuor’s administration, the brutalities and harassment were worse than this. I survived, and we mobilised and overthrew that government in a subsequent election. So let them bring it on. Me, I think that every dark cloud has a silver lining. And every party that wins power, the very first step they take in power leaves them towards opposition. So let them continue,’ he cautioned. Asked the action he take if his cars are confiscated, he retorted ‘please I don’t engage in speculation’.
