That was eight months worse than the gap between well-off and bright but poor boys. For reading there was a similar gap of three years for the girls, some nine months worse than between boys.\n“While England’s brightest pupils score around average in international tests – and better in science – this analysis shows that there are some very big socio-economic gaps in attainment between the brightest pupils from poor and better-off homes,” said John Jerrim of the UCL Institute of Education, which carried out the analysis for the Sutton Trust.\nEnglish pupils improve results in international maths and science exams Read more \nJerrim’s review of results from last year’s Pisa study also found a wide spread of results in different parts of the UK, which he described as showing “very big challenges” in Scotland and Wales.\nWhile England’s highest achievers beat the median international scores in maths, science and reading, bright pupils in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland performed worse than the OECD average. High performers in Wales fared better only than those in Mexico, Turkey and Chile in Pisa’s reading and maths results.\nThe Sutton Trust, which commissioned the work, said the figures showed worrying gaps between children with similar levels of ability but divided by household income.\nSir Peter Lampl, the trust’s founder, called for the government to establish special funding to allow pupils with high potential to be monitored and supported. \n“It is staggering that at age 16 bright but poor pupils lag behind their rich classmates by almost three years. This results in a huge waste of talent, which is why we at the Sutton Trust are calling on government to establish a highly able fund,” he said. \n“This would improve social mobility at the top by widening access to leading universities and to top jobs.”\nAll four UK countries had wide achievement gaps between rich and poor, but the gaps were widest in England because of the stronger performance by its highest achievers.\nIn reading, the gap in performance between pupils from advantaged and disadvantaged households in England was the equivalent of two years and nine months’ worth of schooling, while in Wales and Northern Ireland it was two years.\nA spokesperson for the Russell Group of leading research universities said its members were already trying to encourage pupils to aspire to higher education. \n“However, action across many areas is required to have a demonstrable effect on attainment. This includes things like school funding and early years interventions that ministers will need to look at closely,” said Sarah Stevens, the group’s head of policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:34:00.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
