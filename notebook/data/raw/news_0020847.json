The steady but slow decline into the abyss of polarisation has resulted in overwhelming suspicion of each other and our increasing unwillingness to accept diversity. \nHow can we accept diversity when leaders in Putrajaya - who ought to show good examples, are simply too busy doing everything else but governing this nation? \nFor the past few months, we find ourselves in situations that test our loyalty, patience and understanding. Issues ranging from political opinions (Bersih, ‘Muslim ban’, Dr Mahathir Mohamad) to religious matters (halal cake, Act 355, pig bristle brushes,) display one thing in common - Malaysians are no longer able to carry legitimate opinions any more because the ability to carry rational discourse is simply lacking. \nExpressing differing views are often seen as an act of abandoning one’s principles and betraying one’s race (or in most cases, these days, religious beliefs); those who speak out are immediately ostracised and demonised. \nYes, this is the new Malaysia. \nWhat we are today is made possible by those who sit comfortably in the corridors of power in Putrajaya; these are the ones who have mastered the art of control - exploiting issues relating to race and religion by rousing stereotypes and our innermost insecurities or fear. \nFor most, religion has become more than just guidelines for human beings. For us, religion has become more of an identity for a group of people, taking over ancient traditional cultures and replacing it with beliefs that prioritise the after-life rather than the present real world. When religion is accepted as a form of identity, it becomes inextricable because it legitimises exclusivity and shapes a person’s self-understanding of nationality. \nWith the presence of different sects, differing schools of thoughts and the ever-volatile mix of ignorance and insecurities - religion becomes an easy political tool to keep people in line. \nBut what does this all mean for present day Malaysians? Oversimplification of issues and dismissing them without understanding the crux of the problem will not provide us a clearer picture. Our society is simply moving in the opposite direction - back towards the credulous, the obedient and the compliant. \nIssues relating to a well known franchise’s decision to disallow non-halal cakes in their premises, a peaceful demonstration in front of a certain embassy and paint brushes made from questionable material, display levels of intolerance, bigotry and unrelenting inflexibility, perfect elements to solidify divisive tactics and justify those who champion politics of fear. \nNajib Abdul Razak’s ‘National Transformation 2050' and ‘1Malaysia’ were created to foster unity and promote diversity but lacked the sincerity and drive Malaysians needed. Both utopian concepts were too far-fetched and detached. Both utopian concepts unravel bogus and hollow visions that simply fail to provide true nation-building. The accurate kind we need today because of the damage caused by years of neglect and partiality. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:22:06.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
