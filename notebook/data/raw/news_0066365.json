Instead, it will likely launch new tablets instead . Meanwhile, its vice chairman is sleeping in a jail cell . \nAt the same time, Apple's Asian supply chain is raising rumors of a very cool redesigned iPhone, with a better screen, longer battery life, and next-generation 3D selfie sensor. \n(Apple was briefly listed as a exhibitor at Mobile World Congress last fall , and employees will attend the conference and the company will have meeting space, but it's not going to announce anything.) \nWhite writes: Although Apple does not officially attend Mobile World Congress, the company's presence is always felt and competitors launch a host of new mobile devices. Although leading smartphone vendors such as Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Oppo, Sony, ZTE and others are anticipated to unveil new smartphones, we expect Samsung to divert from its modus operandi. In past years, Samsung hosted its traditional UNPACKED event at Mobile World Congress that included the unveiling of its latest iteration of its flagship Galaxy \"S\" smartphone (e.g., last year was the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge); however, the company is not holding an UNPACKED event this year but rather a more toned down press conference (2/26) that is expected to focus on a new tablet. Given the Note 7 debacle, last week's arrest of Samsung's heir apparent (Lee Jae-yong; Vice Chairman) and an non-traditional Mobile World Congress for Samsung, combined with the iPhone \"X\" expected to be unveiled this fall, we believe Apple has Samsung on the ropes like never before in recent memory.
