Attawapiskat has long occupied headlines for the rash of social problems plaguing the community on the shores of James Bay.\nThe community has grappled with a long-term housing shortage for years, as well as a lack of educational facilities.\nAttawapiskat's previous elementary school, which was located on the site of a large diesel spill, was shuttered permanently in 2000. Council members gave diesel contamination and structural issues as the reason for the closure.\nLessons were taught in portable classrooms with limited protection from the elements while band leadership and the federal government locked horns over funding agreements.\nLocal youth took to lobbying the government themselves and pushing for a new school, which finally opened in 2014 with an estimated price tag of $30 million.\nBand leadership contends the recent flood came about as a result of a construction error when installing the sprinkler system in the two-story building. The claim has not been independently verified.\nMeanwhile, other social issues have plagued the beleaguered Cree community.\nLast April, Attawapiskat's chief declared a state of emergency after a spike in suicide attempts by the community's youth. At one point officials said they thwarted what they called a suicide pact by 13 young people, including a nine-year-old.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-24T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:43:49.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
