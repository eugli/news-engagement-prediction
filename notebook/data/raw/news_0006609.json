Former Tottenham man Younes Kaboul stuck a long range effort following a free kick and his effort deflected off Aaron Ramsey and into the back of the net. \n\n\n\n\nArsenal really struggled to find their normal rhythm as Watford continued to cause them major problems and  just two minutes after breaking the deadlock, they scored a surprise second through top goal scorer Troy Deeney. \nâ€‹\nThe Gunners were all over the place defensively. They showed no urgency to close down Etienne Capoue who picked up the ball following a throw in. Dancing his way into the area before having a shot at Petr Cech's goal, his shot was parried by the Arsenal keeper, who spilled the ball straight into the path of Deeney. \n\nMaking no mistake, Deeney put the ball into the back of the net. It was probably the easiest goal he will score all season. \n\n\n\n\nWith 20 minutes played, it went from bad to worse for the Gunners. Aaron Ramsey, who was at fault for the first goal, was forced off the pitch due to a calf problem. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and took the Welshman's place.\nâ€‹\nThe Gunners were well and truly up against the ropes. It was wave after wave of Watford attack,and the Gunners were lucky not to concede a third - only a superb save from Petr Cech denied Daryl Janmaat from scoring and claiming a third for the Hornets. \nðŸ—£ â€œThey were sharper than us and better in the duels. We didn't start the way we wanted and then we lost patience towards the end\" #AFCvWFC pic.twitter.com/TDo4Jf9ixf \nâ€” Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) January 31, 2017 \nMoments later, in the 25th minute, Arsenal were running forward in numbers desperately trying to find their way back into the game and Nacho Monreal went flying to the floor in the Watford box after dinking his way past Craig Cathcart - the Gunners fans appealed for a penalty. The referee wasnâ€™t impressed and booked the Arsenal left back for diving. \n\n\nThe visitors ended the first half with five shots on goal and four of those were on target. Arsenal on the other hand, only managed one shot on goal, none on target. The frustration was growing around north London. \nNot good enough. #AFCvWFC pic.twitter.com/Yodb9HFMdn \nâ€” Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) January 31, 2017 \n\n\n\nArsene Wenger looked to inject some more pace into the game in search for their first goal, and d uring the half time interval, Arsenal brought on Theo Walcott for Olivier Giroud. \nThis time, it was Arsenal who started the half positively.\nâ€‹\nTheo Walcott made an instant impact after coming on.  First, he planted a shot in the side netting after being picked out by Laurent Koscielny before then seeing his low drive held by Heurelho Gomes. \n\n\nAnother belting save from Heurelho Gomes denied an attempted shot from Alex Iwobi. The forward then played a nice one-two with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain before attempting to squeeze a shot in at Gomes near post, but the Watford keeper reacted quickly to stick out a hand and push the ball away. \nâ€‹\nArsenal manged to get a goal back 59 minutes in. Alexis Sanchez created the opportunity with a clever flick across the face of goal to pick out Alex Iwobi, who steered his shot into the far corner. \n\n\n\n\nThe fans around the Emirates Stadium started to believe, the atmosphere was getting louder and louder. The tempo and passing accuracy improved tremendously from the first half.\nâ€‹\nWith 23 minutes remaining on the clock, Arsenal made their second substitution of the game. Defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin departed for forward Luca Perez as the Gunners searched for the equaliser.\n\n\nWatford started to panic a bit and switched to fighting at the back. The visitors responded to the Arsenal substitution and decided to make one of their own, Abdoulaye Doucoure coming on for Valon Behrami. \nâ€‹\nIn the dying embers of the game, Arsenal were throwing men forward, and an incredible strike on the volley from Lucas Perez rattled the cross bar - but, d espite some last ditch attempts to salvage an equaliser, Arsenal failed to find a second goal and the score remained as it was. \n\nMATCH STATS  \nâ€‹\nARSENAL \n\nTotal shots : 18 Shots on target: 4 Corners: 9 Possession: 76\nâ€‹\nWATFORD:\nTotal Shots: 10 Shots on target: 6 Corners: 5 Possession: 26\nHere it is - our starting lineup to face @WatfordFC in the @premierleague #AFCvWFC pic.twitter.com/7SAEadPSPK \nâ€” Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) January 31, 2017 â€‹â€‹\n#watfordfc line-up v @Arsenal : Gomes (GK); Cathcart, Kaboul, PrÃ¶dl, Britos; Behrami; Janmaat, Cleverley, Capoue, Niang; Deeney (c).\nâ€” Watford FC (@WatfordFC) January 31, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:00:27.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
