Of course. Source: Supplied \nThe study suggested areas of the face that can be easily controlled by the individual — such as hairstyle and dress sense — may be sufficient enough to produce this effect. \n“Each name has associated characteristics, behaviours, and a look, and as such, it has a meaning and a shared schema within a society,” explained Dr Zwebner. \n“These name stereotypes include a prototypical facial appearance such that we have a shared representation for the ‘right’ look associated with each name.” \nTo prove it, the researchers conducted tests on hundreds of participants, who were shown photographs of single faces and a list of four or five names. \nThey were then asked to pick the name they thought best “corresponded” with that face. \nAccording to their findings, most people had a 40 per cent success rate with identifying the right name. \nWhile this may not sound enormous, it’s much bigger than the 20 to 25 per cent success rate you’d expect if it were done by random chance. \n“Together these findings suggest facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a particular name should look,” said co-author Dr Ruth Mayo. \n“In this way a social tag may influence one’s facial appearance. We are subject to social structuring from the minute we are born, not only by gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status, but by the simple choice others make in giving us our name.” \nThe study offered a few examples of names and perceptions. \nFor one, society typically expects men named “Bob” to have rounder faces, because the word is round in appearance. \nLikewise for whatever reason, we assume a woman named “Katherine” will be more successful in life than a woman named “Scarlett”. Scarlett Johansson must be the exception to this otherwise ~totally scientific~ finding. Source: AFP \nThe association of the name “Rose” with the flower means women with this name may be more feminine, with higher expectations of beauty. \nMeanwhile, someone with a royal name like “Elizabeth” is expected to be more serious and proper. \nThe study noted that this doesn’t apply to babies, as they don’t yet subconsciosuly comprehend the concept of stereotypes. That and they all look kind of similar. \nRather, as we grow up, the research suggests we subconsciously begin to adopt the physical traits associated with our name as we age. \nIn one experiment, students from both France and Israel were given a mix of French and Israeli names and faces. \nThe study found the French students were better than random chance at matching French names and faces, while Israeli students did well at matching Hebrew names and Israeli faces. \nIn another, researchers trained a computer to match faces to names using a set algorithm. \nIn an experiment using over 94,000 facial images, the computer achieved a success rate of up to 64 per cent. The experiment used heat maps to reveal the most important parts of the face for recognition.
