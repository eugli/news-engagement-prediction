It set out to ease anxieties with an emphasis on goodwill, phased changes and a deal that would be good for both Britain and Europe. \nFor business leaders fretting about an immigration clampdown, the White Paper pledged to keep the doors open to “international talent”. For the City, it stressed the importance of London staying “a pre-eminent global financial centre”, vowing to seek “the freest possible trade in financial services between the UK and EU member states”. \nBritain’s EU exit door was thrown open last night as MPs gave the Prime Minister a sweeping mandate to move Article 50 and kick-start negotiations on divorce terms. The Commons vote was 498 to 114 — with Jeremy Corbyn suffering a revolt by 47 Labour MPs. \nWriting in the White Paper foreword, Mrs May declared: “We do not approach these negotiations expecting failure, but anticipating success. Brexit revolt: Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is split over Brexit (PA) \n“Because we are a great, global nation with so much to offer Europe and so much to offer the world.” \nShe told of a new mood in business to make a success of Brexit rather than try to reverse it. “The House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it,” she wrote. “And the overwhelming majority of people — however they voted — want us to get on with it too. So that is what we will do.” Find out how your MP voted in the Brexit debate \nDavid Davis, the Brexit Secretary, told MPs in a Commons statement this afternoon: “Delivering a smooth, mutually beneficial exit, avoiding a disruptive cliff-edge, will be key.” \nThe document was expected to make clear that the UK will not seek some unlimited transitional status but a phased process implementing new arrangements likely to be in the interests of both sides. \nOne section was headed “a smooth and orderly exit from the EU”. Theresa May announces Brexit white paper \nMr Davis said: “The UK wants the EU to succeed. Indeed it is in our interests for it to prosper politically and economically and we will seek to persuade our allies that a strong new partnership with the UK will help to that end.” \nThe document was expected to set out a plan for a “new, positive and constructive partnership”. Titled “The United Kingdom’s Exit from and New Partnership with the European Union”, the White Paper closely mirrored the 12 principles set out by the Prime Minister in her recent speech and which will guide EU exit negotiations.
