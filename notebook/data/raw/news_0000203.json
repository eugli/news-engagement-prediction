From the NBA to PayPal, entertainers and company’s have turned away from North Carolina, the bill has cost the state $450 million , according to PolitiFact.\nVoters in North Carolina had a hard choice this election: vote for well-liked Republicans who crafted the bathroom bill or try and put an end to the problems caused by the law by voting for less popular Democrats. They chose the latter option — but now the Democrats are faced with a hard choice because the bathroom bill still can’t be repealed.\nSo, do North Carolina Democrats support progressive calls for an economic boycott or oppose them so they can try and get some more political capital?
