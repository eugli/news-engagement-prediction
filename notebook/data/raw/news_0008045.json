During his campaign, Mr. Trump mused that the United States could save money if nations like South Korea and Japan developed their own nuclear weapons — comments that ran counter to decades of American nonproliferation policy. Mr. Trump said on Twitter last month that North Korea would be stopped from developing the capability to reach the United States with a nuclear weapon. But he did not say whether he was referring to taking military or diplomatic steps. “It won’t happen,” he tersely declared of a North Korean missile test. One of Mr. Trump’s first acts as president was to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement , which had been an important pillar of the Obama administration’s trade policy in the region. Critics say the withdrawal by the United States will give China an opportunity to expand its influence. More recently, Mr. Trump reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in a phone call on Saturday of the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to his nation’s security, according to a statement from the White House. He made the same assurance on Monday in a call with the acting president of South Korea, Hwang Kyo-ahn. The various messages — some spontaneous, some premeditated — have made Mr. Mattis’s otherwise traditional statements of support for South Korea and Japan a message with strategic importance. “It is a priority for President Trump’s administration to pay attention to the northwest Pacific,” Mr. Mattis said. “I am going to get current by listening to them, finding out where their issues are and then we are going to work together and strengthen our alliance.” Photo North Korean soldiers during a ceremony in 2013 in Pyongyang, the capital, honoring the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice. Credit Wong Maye-E/Associated Press In South Korea, Mr. Mattis’s choice to visit it and Japan for his first official trip abroad was seen as a reflection of the new administration’s seriousness in dealing with North Korea’s growing nuclear threat. His trip was also reassuring for South Koreans, who have become anxious over Mr. Trump’s accusations during his campaign that their nation and Japan were getting a free ride in their national defense by not paying enough for the American military presence. \nAdvertisement   “In less than two weeks since taking office, President Trump has been almost daily issuing executive orders upending not only his predecessor Obama’s policies, but also some of the longstanding American policy lines,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, the capital. “In this context, Secretary Mattis’s trip, which serves to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to its allies, is an unexpected present.” The fraught political situation in South Korea — President Park Geun-hye faces an impeachment trial — also poses a challenge, given that a presidential election may be held as early as the spring.
