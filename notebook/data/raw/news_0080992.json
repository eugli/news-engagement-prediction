CPI (M) politburo member Brinda Karat told ANI that people like Pratap Simha are echoing their masters’ voice and using the ABVP to unleash ‘gundaism’ on the campuses of India. “They are only doing what their leaders want them to do. That is why I am saying that this is immaterial. They are echoing their masters’ voice and that voice is from Nagpur and that voice is the voice of the RSS which cannot tolerate dissent and they want to capture the universities of India because of simple reason is that they cannot reason, they have no logic and that is why they use ABVP to unleash ‘gundaism’ on the campuses of India,” she added.\nEchoing similar sentiments, another CPI (M) leader D. Raja said the BJP is trying to intimidate people who are against its policies. Retorting to Rijiju’s statement that ‘anyone who wants to break India and supports terrorists can be branded as an “anti-national”’, Raja urged the BJP to put an end to such hate campaign. After Simha courted controversy by comparing Gurmehar Kaur, whose social media post against the ABVP has gone viral, with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim political leaders are seen to be taking positions for and against her.\nAlso Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:05:09.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
