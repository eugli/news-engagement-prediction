Azahar, the sister of another victim, Muhammad Firdauz Danish M. Azahar, said her 16-year-old brother was supposed to register for an automotive training course at the E-Access International College in Kulai this Monday. \n\"Prior to today, my brother said he would leave the family soon, but we did not think much of it as he was due to register at the college's hostel,\" she said. \nShe said her brother was a friendly boy who loved cycling since Form One and often cycled in Taman Damai Jaya. \n\"My brother, who went out yesterday, around 10pm, said he wanted to go out cycling. \n\"He also reminded my mother to lock the doors fearing that he would probably not come home that night. \n\"However, we were shocked to receive a call at 3am from his friends, informing us that my brother had been involved in an accident,\" she said. \nMuhammad Firdauz Danish remains were buried at the Jalan Kebun Teh Muslim Cemetery also after Asar prayers. - Bernama \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:51:08.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
