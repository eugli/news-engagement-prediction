The record high for that day is 70, which has remained the highest temperature for any Feb. 24 since 1906.\nNew high temperature records are expected to be set on Friday throughout the Northeast.\nHigh temperatures are expected to approach or exceed current records in areas such as Philadelphia; New York City; Washington, D.C. and Columbus, Ohio.\nAs the storm tracks over the Great Lakes, it will spark severe storms in the Midwest on Friday and Friday night.\nThis feature will bring an end to springlike weather from Des Moines, Iowa, to Columbus.\nAccuWeather Winter Weather Center\nPhotos: Storm unleashes travel-disrupting snow, mudslides across Northern California\nShedding winter weight: Is biology or human habit to blame for seasonal gain?\nThe system will pass to the north of New England on Saturday, dragging a soaking cold front into the eastern U.S.\nWhile temperatures are expected to drop by up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit between Saturday and Sunday in the Northeast, they will be dropping back to average in most locations.\nThe forecast high for Pittsburgh drops to 60 for Saturday, and only 41 on Sunday, which is right around the average for that day of 42.\nDespite the seasonality of the upcoming weather, the cold will feel especially sharp after the May-like conditions.\nHowever, in line with the recent pattern, another surge of warmth is in the works for later next week.\nAccuWeather long-range forecasters predict spring will take its time to truly sink into the Northeast. This suggests that alternating warmth and chill will continue to plague the region.", "external_links": ["http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/blizzard-to-clog-travel-with-up-to-a-foot-of-snow-from-colorado-to-michigan/70000916?partner=foxnews", "https://accuweather.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b53da1/2147483647/resize/590x/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Faccuweather-bsp.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F35%2F8a60e7344c2a93407afecd8b407d%2Feastern-warmth-wed.jpg", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/winter-weather?partner=foxnews", "http://www.accuweather.com/", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/winter-weight-gain-biology-vs-bad-habits-overeating-holidays/56100932?partner=foxnews", "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/share/source/accuweather.png", "https://accuweather.brightspotcdn.com/resource/esi/ooyala-player-v4/4.10.6/skin-plugin/skin.84d501355d266e7ae92e3f749b9cec0b.json", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/photos-storm-unleashes-travel-disrupting-snow-mudslides-across-northern-california/70000918?partner=foxnews", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=400x300&iu=/6581/accuwx.us.newsandvideo/video-embed&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&url=", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/2017-us-spring-forecast-winter-wont-quit-in-northeast-severe-weather-to-explode-across-plains/70000757?partner=foxnews", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/severe-thunderstorms-may-threaten-midwestern-northeastern-us-to-end-the-week/70000906?partner=foxnews"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:08:32.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
