In Ducks star Dillon Brooks’ case, not even two rim protectors in the way can do the trick. \nIn the first half of Thursday’s top 10 Pac-12 matchup between No. 5 Oregon and No. 10 UCLA, Brooks drove in the lane and slammed home a powerful two-handed dunk over UCLA forwards Ike Anigbogu and Gyorgy Goloman. \nAnigbogu is 6-10 while Goloman stands at 6-11. \nBrooks’ dunk set the tone in a dominating first half so far for the Ducks, who lead by double figures early. Ultimately, it wasn't enough though as UCLA would storm back in the second half to claim an 82-79 win.
