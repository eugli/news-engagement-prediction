'I'd sign now for this!' he said. He was less clear-cut about whether Terry might be able to continue into next season, given the inevitable addition of Champions League football. Conte has made no guarantees on picking his fringe players in the cup competition Terry rises to head clear during a solid performance at Molineux in the FA Cup fifth round 'The most important thing is the present â€” to work and build a good future. Then for sure we will see the situation of every single player.' Michy Batshuayi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek were both omitted from the starting line-up against Wolves, in favour of Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, despite featuring in each of the previous rounds. Chelsea survived an early scare when George Saville hit the post but their quality told with Pedro scoring on 65 minutes and Costa adding a late second. 'It was important to continue to play with Costa, Willian and Hazard. Our target is to win, not to try to make all the players happy,' said Conte. 'In the first game I made nine changes, the second game I made nine and against Wolves I made seven but I tried to make the best decision to win, and then when we have the game in the quarter-final I'll decide the line-up. 'I repeat, it is important to find the best solution, so then why not start the next game with Ruben or Michy?' Asmir Begovic was unequivocal about Terry. 'Absolutely he's still got it, he's the best defender in Premier League history,' said the stand-in keeper. Pedro continued his run of scoring in each of Chelsea's FA Cup games so far this campaign Asmir Begovic believes Terry is capable of remaining at the highest level beyond this season SUPER STAT Pedro has now scored in the third, fourth and fifth rounds of this season's FA Cup 'We don't play regularly so when we are called upon we have to show what we can bring to the team. 'He trains like he always has. I can see him continuing to play and I don't see why he should quit but maybe if he lifts two trophies that's a great way to go out as well.' Conte said Lincoln's victory at Burnley helped concentrate the minds of his players and Begovic stressed that Chelsea always approach lower-league opponents seriously. 'I think the competition is getting tougher every year because every year all the divisions are improving,' said Begovic. 'We have a very good squad so any changes that are made, we have ready-made players to come in. I think it's important to give it the respect it deserves because it's one of the best cup competitions in the world.'
