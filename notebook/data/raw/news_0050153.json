Well on a day-to-day basis you’ll simply see less of these sites appear in Google or Bing’s search results when you try and find them. \nIt means those who search for content such as music videos, digital books and football coverage will more likely to be taken to bona fide providers rather than pirate sites where a user’s security may be at risk. \nEddy Leviten, director general at the Alliance for Intellectual Property, said: “Sometimes people will search for something and they will end up unwittingly being taken to a pirated piece of content. \n“What we want to ensure is that the results at the top of the search engines are the genuine ones. \n“It is about protecting people who use the internet, but also protecting the creators of that material too.

These include court ordered site blocking, work with brands to reduce advertising on illegal sites and the Get it Right From A Genuine Site consumer education campaign, which encourages fans to value the creative process and directs them to legal sources of content. \nMr Leviten said: “The alliance has been present throughout the discussions and has consistently made the case for a collaborative process that works for all rights holders and creators and starts to help the UK’s intellectual property generators to promote and sell their works without unfair competition. \nStan McCoy, of the Motion Picture Association in Europe, said: “Pirate websites are currently much too easy to find via search, so we appreciate the parties’ willingness to try to improve that situation. \nThe changes are expected to be rolled out by the summer. \nGeoff Taylor, chief executive of BPI, representative body for UK record labels, and the Brit Awards, said: “Successful and dynamic online innovation requires an ecosystem that works for everyone, users, technology companies, and artists and creators. \n“BPI has long campaigned for search engines to do more to ensure fans are directed to legal sources for music or other entertainment. \n“There is much work still to do to achieve this. \n“The code will not be a silver bullet fix, but it will mean that illegal sites are demoted more quickly from search results and that fans searching for music are more likely to find a fair site.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:43:38.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
