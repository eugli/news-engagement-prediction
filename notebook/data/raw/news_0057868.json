He was third after the skate-style portion of the race but made up a 20-second deficit in the classic-style second leg. He finished with a combined pursuit time of 28:23.2, nine seconds ahead of runner-up Patrick Acton of Eagan. Minneapolis Southwest senior William Foss Kerker was third. The three are close friends and teammates on the Loppet Nordic Ski team, which trains out of Minneapolis. The three even formed a relay team that won a national title last year. “All year, I knew it was going to be the three of us fighting it out,” Mansfield said. They are so close that contact between Mansfield and Kerker midway through the race, which resulted in Kerker falling, was brushed off by Kerker as “just racing.” Mansfield admitted he made a mistake, taking a wrong track. “I went to the middle track when I should have stayed left,” he said. “But we all race hard. We’re good friends, but we all want to win.” KENDALL COLEY St. Louis Park • basketball The eighth-grade guard had the best game of her high school career on the seventh anniversary of her mother’s death, scoring 27 points — making seven of 11 three-point shots — and blocking three shots in a 72-66 victory over Bloomington Jefferson.
