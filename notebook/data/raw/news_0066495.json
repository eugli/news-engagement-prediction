Unified will remain protected regardless of the new directive by the Trump administration pertaining to access to restrooms and locker rooms,” Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Michelle King said in a statement . “The District embraces all students and remains committed to affirming a safe, productive learning environment for everyone.” \nPhiladelphia School District Superintendent William Hite echoed the sentiment in a statement to CBS News . \n“This announcement will not change any school district policy or city law that protects our students,” Hite said. \nChris Reykdal, state superintendent in Washington, said the protections would remain in place in the state. In a series of tweets, his office said the federal government hadn’t hurt “transgender students’ longstanding rights in WA.” [1/4] Feds rolled back @usedgov protections for transgender students; OSPI will stand strong to protect the legal rights of those students. — WA State OSPI (@waOSPI) February 23, 2017 [2/4] WA laws protect transgender students: https://t.co/jpRDD6ZjlQ .

He said PSU prides itself on offering extensive services to LGBTQ students and being ranked as one of the most LGBTQ-friendly colleges in the country. \n“We’re certainly not going to be affected,” Broderick told the publication. “There’s just not an issue at all on who can use what bathroom and that’s not going to change at PSU.” Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?
