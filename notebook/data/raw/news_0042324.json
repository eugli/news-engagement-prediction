He said: “The Democrats are the party of Lena Dunham. These people are hideous, mental people. The more the American people see of Lena Dunham, the fewer votes the Democratic party is going to get.” \nYiannopoulos added that Schumer and Silverman “used to be funny before they contracted feminism”. \nOne the abuse of Leslie Jones that saw him banned from Twitter, he said: “I simply don’t accept that an A-list Hollywood celebrity is sitting at home crying over mean words on the internet.” \nMaher, a free speech advocate, told Yiannopoulos he thought he was “colossally wrong” on most issues \nThe show was followed by an expletive-ridden online segment with three panellists: comedian Larry Wilmore, author and counterterrorism expert Malcolm Nance and Georgia Republican Jack Kingston. \nThis month the University of California, Berkeley had to cancel a speech by Yiannopoulos after thousands of students gathered in protest and a group of black-clad activists shot fireworks at the speech venue.
