He was 84. \nSchickel’s career spanned five decades through Hollywood Golden Age, making him one of the most respected in his profession. \n“He was one of the fathers of American film criticism,” said his daughter Erika Schickel, a writer. “He had a singular voice. When he wrote or spoke, he had an old-fashioned way of turning a phrase. He was blunt and succinct both on the page and in life.” \nSchickel served as film critic for Life magazine from 1965 to 1972, when it folded, and then moved to Time magazine 38 years.
