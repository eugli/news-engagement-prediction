The show wrapped up on a high note, having been given a new lease of life in its fourth season by the death of tragic girl-next-door Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), and the impact her absence had on the rest of the Newport Beach gang.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below But overall, its four-year run was a rocky one. The show's meteoric overnight success, combined with very young stars and scarcely-older showrunners — co-creator Josh Schwartz was about to turn 27 when the show premiered — was a surefire recipe for some backstage drama. Here are 9 tidbits about what went down behind the scenes.\n1. The producers initially hated Adam Brody… If you're a die-hard OC fan, you've probably heard this one before. Schwartz was extremely unimpressed by the man who would be Seth Cohen when he first came into audition. \"It was pilot season and he was going on dozens of auditions,\" Schwartz explained to The Daily Beast , \"and he didn't really bother to learn the lines, so he just came in and I was like, 'What scene is he doing? Is this even from our show?'\" Our casting director, Patrick Rush, told me, \"I'm telling you, this Adam Brody is very special.\" And I thought, \"That guy? I kind of hated that guy. He didn't even learn any of the words!\" But he came back, learned the words, and he was great.\"\n2 …and the network hated Seth Cohen. Though he became arguably the show's breakout character, the early draft of Seth was so disliked by Fox that they quite literally wanted to abort him. \"I was told at one point that they really did not like the Seth character early on in the pilot process,\" Schwartz told TV Guide , \"and the way the note was relayed to me was, 'Could the Cohens have had an abortion?' In the network's defense, the character of Seth may have been a little bit more annoying than he ended up being ultimately, but it was a bit harsh.\"\n[asset removed due to syndication rights]\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 3. Mischa Barton gave some pretty unfortunate interviews early in the show's run. In her defense, Barton was young and maybe didn't realize that \"cool\" can easily come off as callous in print. But a 2004 interview she gave to ELLE became legendary online, for reasons that will become obvious once you read its most famous passage:\nWhen I ask what kind of fan mail she receives, Barton says, \"It's fascinating the stories you'll get.\" For example? In a weary, singsong voice, she says, \"Like, 'I was in the war and my leg got cut off and I'm in the hospital. I'll never walk again, but all I can do is lie in bed and watch your TV show.' It's just—stuff you get.\" She shrugs and takes another bite of swordfish. I ask if that letter came from a soldier in Iraq, and she says, \"I don't remember. But that one was big on the list of, like, heart-wrenching stories. Are you joking? The O.C.? Surely there are more important things in life than my stupid show. But, like, okay, if you feel that way. I'm like, that's\"—she chuckles and rolls her eyes—\"nice.\" Thankfully for Barton, this interview was published in a pre-social media age, when outrage didn't spread so easily and offensive off-the-cuff remarks didn't stick to celebrities in the same way they do now. Still. Yikes.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x1063/gallery-1487877473-hbz-oc-season-3.jpg?resize=640:*", "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1487871349-mischa-barton-elle-2004.jpg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x1063/gallery-1487877473-hbz-oc-season-3.jpg?resize=480:*", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/05/remembering-the-o-c-creator-josh-schwartz-on-the-show-s-10th-anniversary.html", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x1063/gallery-1487877473-hbz-oc-season-3.jpg?resize=768:*", "http://www.tvguide.com/news/the-oc-secrets-josh-schwartz-1068879/"], "published": "2017-02-23T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:54:47.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
