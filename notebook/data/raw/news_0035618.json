Photo: GSA Today \nThe bits that aren't waterlogged are commonly referred to as New Zealand and New Caledonia. \nAt 4.9 million square kilometres of land mass, Zealandia would be the world's eighth and smallest continent. Related Content Kosciuszko explained: mystery of the Snowy Mountains solved \nThe scientists presented their findings in the study Zealandia: Earth's Hidden Continent, which was published in GSA Today , the journal of The Geological Society Of America. \nThey say Zealandia and Australia come remarkably close to each other across the Cato Trough, off the coast of Queensland. Advertisement \nAt that point the continental crusts of the two continents are just 25 kilometres apart. \nAccording to the study, the 94 per cent of Zealandia currently submerged broke away from Australia and sank 60 to 85 million years ago. \nThe scientists contend the data shows a substantial part of the south-west Pacific consists of a continuous expanse of continental crust. \nThey say it is large and separate enough to be considered a continent in its own right. \nThe name Zealandia was coined by geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk in 1995 as a collective name for New Zealand, the Chatham Rise, Campbell Plateau and Lord Howe Rise. \nAt the time it was believed to possess three of the four necessary qualities required for continent status. \nThese include the presence of different rock types and crucially \"the high elevation relative to regions floored by oceanic crust\". \nA recent discovery using satellite technology and gravity maps of the sea floor have revealed that Zealandia is a large unified area, fulfilling all four requirements. \n\"This is not a sudden discovery but a gradual realisation; as recently as 10 years ago we would not have had the accumulated data or confidence in interpretation to write this paper,\" they say. \nZealandia has a continental crust thickness ranging from 10 to 30 kilometres, getting up to more than 40 kilometres under parts of New Zealand's South Island. \nWhile most of it is thinner than the 30 to 46 kilometres typical of most continents, it is everywhere thicker than the crust of the ocean basins, which is about seven kilometres. \n\"Being more than 1 million sq km in area, and bounded by well-defined geologic and geographic limits, Zealandia is, by our definition, large enough to be termed a continent,\" the paper says. \nIt is 12 times bigger than Mauritia and six times bigger than Madagascar, and about the same area as greater India. \nZealandia is not unique among continents in being mostly submerged. \n\"An ice-free, isostatically corrected West Antarctica would also largely be submerged,\" the authors say. \nZealandia once made up about 5 per cent of the area of Gondwana, from which it started to separate as a ribbon continent about 4000 kilometres long, the paper says. \nIt has since gone through substantial deformation to end up in its present shape and position. \n\"Based on various lines of geological and geophysical evidence, particularly those accumulated in the last two decades, we argue that Zealandia is not a collection of partly submerged continental fragments but is a coherent 4.9 MkmÂ² continent,\" the authors say. \n\"Currently used conventions and definitions of continental crust, continents, and microcontinents require no modification to accommodate Zealandia.\" \nThe political and economic implications of a new continent would be manifold, with the question of clearly defining what belongs to New Zealand and Australia particularly salient in light of offshore mining in the area. \nA six-year study by the GNS Science research institute in New Zealand has revealed that tens of billions of dollars worth of fossil fuels could be located off-shore in the region. \nAs well as GNS staff who contributed to the paper, other authors come from the University of Sydney, Victoria University and the Service Geologique de Nouvelle Caledonie. \nAn elevation map of Zealandia and nearby Australia.
