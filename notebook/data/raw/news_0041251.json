Few have access to outside media sources and reports here are generally limited to the ruling line of Kims.

He also reportedly attended a large meeting on Wednesday.

National founder and \"eternal president\" Kim Il Sung's birthday in April - the \"Day of the Sun\" - is the most important. \nIn central Pyongyang, from early morning thousands of people climbed Mansu Hill to lay flowers and bow below giant statues of Kim Jong-il and Kim Il Sung.

The Kimjongilia flower is a kind of begonia, originally bred by a Japanese botanist, according to North Korean authorities.

People can expect presents of cooking oil or other food and drink from their employers, and they get time off to spend with their families. \nOn Thursday, Pyongyang residents also took part in large public dances, filed through displays of ice sculptures. \nThe finale of the day was to be a fireworks show.
