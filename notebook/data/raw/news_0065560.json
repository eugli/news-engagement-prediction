News. Sadie was born in summer 2016 to Bryan's wife's brother and battled health issues throughout much of her young life. She had been undergoing several treatments, including dialysis.   \nBryan tweeted a message of thanks to his fans on Feb. 21 after Sadie's passing.   \n\"We thank all of you for your prayers,\" Bryan wrote on Twitter. \"Love y'all.\" \nOn Feb. 19, Sadie's health took a turn for the worse, as she faced possible blood infection, sepsis and severely low blood pressure, according to a Facebook post from her mom, Ellen Boyer. Sadie was on antibiotics for the infection, but her condition rapidly declined, causing her liver to fail. \n\"Please pray for the team as they work hard to help our girl,\" Boyer wrote in the Facebook post. \nBryan has faced many tragedies in his life, including the death of his brother, Chris, who died in a car accident in 1996, according to The Boot. In 2007, Bryan's sister, Kelly, died suddenly, followed by Kelly's widower, Ben, seven years later. \nBryan and his wife, Caroline, adopted Kelly and Ben's teenage son, Til, after Ben's death. \n\"We feel honored that we are so blessed to take him in,\" the country star said in 2015, according to The Boot. \"He has two older [adult] sisters, too, so now I'm kind of like, I've gotta do the whole 'scare whoever, the boys that they are talking to.' I have to play that role, too.\" \nThe Bryans also have two sons, Bo and Tate. \n\"We feel like if we just stay positive through this, maybe we'll be a positive inspiration for people that had these things happen to them,\" added the CMT award winner. \"You just have to plow on and play the hand thatâ€™s dealt.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
