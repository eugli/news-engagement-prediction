My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nNordstrom dropped Ivanka Trump's fashion line following pressure from a left-leaning campaign called \"Grab Your Wallet\" to convince major department stores to abandon the first daughter's products in protest of her father's policies. Nordstrom said the decision had to do with a decline in sales .\n\"There is clearly a targeting of her brand. She is not directly running the company, but her name is still on it,\" Spicer said on Wednesday. \"This is a direct attack on his policies and [his tweet] is clearly an attempt for him to stand up for her because they have a problem with his policies.\"\n\"There's clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father's positions on particular policies that he's taken,\" Spicer added.\nThe White House press secretary rejected the suggestion that Trump had tweeted about his daughter's company during his daily intelligence briefing. The tweet was done 21 minutes after the briefing was scheduled to start.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sessions 'disappointed' in confirmation attacks Sessions called the contentious fight over his nomination \"the least of my worries at this point.\"\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 02/09/17 4:21 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:39:28.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
