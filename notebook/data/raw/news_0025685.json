Woman who paid assassin to kill her sues killer for failing to deliver \nAccording to the court, the woman paid the killer some money upfront and promised the killer to take her car as part of the payment arrangement when the job is done but that the killer varnished without “delivering the service,” court papers reavelaed. \nHowever, making his judgment on the case, the judge said the agreement lacks legal backing since it was not signed at a public notary office. \nAnd he said document they signed in which ownership of the woman’s car was passed to the alleged assassin wasn’t proof that he had received the vehicle as payment for killing her. \nHe therefore dismissed the case saying, even if the agreement was entered through the legal process, it would still had been regarded illegal because the act under negotiation was in itself, illegal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:46:09.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
