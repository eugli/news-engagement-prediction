Which city in the world boasts its own pigeon warmer? Credit: Credit: Jesse Kraft / Alamy Stock Photo/Jesse Kraft / Alamy Stock Photo 7 February 2017 • 1:23pm \nA field of corn made of cement, a magic roundabout and a giant phallic owl sculpture. \nThese are just some of the oddities celebrated in a discussion on the weirdest things native to hometowns around the world - and people are immensely proud of them... mostly. \n“We have this field of corn,” one user wrote on Reddit . “It’s not just any corn, though. In fact, it is made of cement. So yeah. We have a field of corn made of cement.” A photo posted by Doctor X. (@attraversiamo_vibes) on Nov 10, 2016 at 11:56am PST \nAnyone keen to see this bizarre spectacle should head to Dublin, Ohio, where there is indeed a field of corn made of cement, the product of a grant for public art. \nSo what else around the world are residents chuffed about/mildly ashamed of? If you think your place of birth can do better, add it in the comments below. 1. Hobo pigeons \nIt is in Chicago where feckless birds use the city’s eternal flame memorial to keep warm. One user wrote: “I’m around that area pretty often and I’ve heard tonnes of tourists observing the eternal flame say: ‘Oh, that’s nice. They have a pigeon warmer’.” Dec 16, 2016 at 3:29pm PST 2. A magic roundabout \nSwindon’s Magic Roundabout has something of an iconic status in the UK. The five roundabouts within one giant roundabout were built in 1972, later becoming the blueprints for other traffic merry-go-rounds across Britain. One Reddit user retold how he once spent 10 minutes driving around it for fun: “Amazing.” Erm. What? Credit: Credit: Stephen Barnes / Alamy Stock Photo/Stephen Barnes / Alamy Stock Photo 3. A giant metal bean \n“We have this giant reflective metal bean that thousands of people come every year to see,” wrote one user. Another chimed in: “And the sculptor is p that it’s called a bean… even though it’s obviously a f bean.” The “bean” is actually the Cloud Gate in Chicago, the work of sculptor Anish Kapoor. One of the nicest beans we've ever seen Credit: Credit: Felix Choo / Alamy Stock Photo/Felix Choo / Alamy Stock Photo 4. A terrifying massive blue horse that killed its creator \nThe giant blue sculpture with illuminated red eyes at Denver airport actually killed its El Paso-based creator Luis Jiménez. A section fell on him, severing an artery in his leg. A Reddit user described it as “the demon horse from hell”. It's also locally known as Blucifer. Read more about the statue, the airport and its many conspiracy theories here . Aug 29, 2016 at 4:42pm PDT 5. The world’s least successful politician? \n“There’s this guy that runs for mayor every year,” wrote a Memphis resident. “He claims he is an alien prince and he wants us to worship him. He calls himself Prince Mongo.” 6. A big pile of balls \nAnother public art gem. Introducing Edmonton’s big pile of silver balls. Otherwise known as the Talus Dome, the sculpture apparently cost $600,000 to make. It looks like someone fly-tipped their giant ball bearing collection. Anyone lost their marbles?

The Womb \nThe Womb is in fact a psychedelic arts museum founded by Wayne Coyne, lead singer of the Flaming Lips. In downtown Oklahoma City, the complex that hosts contemporary art shows, music performance and a creative agency, is pretty trippy. Dec 30, 2016 at 10:53pm PST 8. A phallic owl \nHead to the Australian capital of Canberra to see a lovely sculpture of an owl. Charming from the front, however, viewed from the back some critics say it looks a little like a penis. Judge for yourself. Feb 15, 2016 at 2:25am PST 9. Batman \nYep, really, Batman. “We have a guy called the Brampton Batman,” one user from Brampton explained. “Basically a guy dresses up in a very well-made Batman costume, drives a Batmobile and walks around downtown.” It’s true. This city in southern Ontario does indeed have its own Batman. Oct 17, 2016 at 8:15pm PDT 10. All of New Orleans, apparently \nOne user’s contribution was simply: “All of New Orleans is the weirdest thing.” Funnily enough, many agreed with him: “As someone currently living here, can confirm.” Watch | Why you should visit New Orleans in 2017 02:08", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:29:59.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
