I'm going to play the lottery now,” he said.\nEight people suffered minor injuries, police said. The highway was completely shut down for several hours before reopening.\nGov. Charlie Baker announced a 2-hour delay for all non-emergency state employees due to the icy road conditions and highway closures.\n“We urge all drivers to exercise extreme caution as driving is very difficult due to icy conditions and to be patient as public safety officials respond to multiple incidents impacting our highways,\" Baker said.\nState Highway Administrator Tom Tinlin said the freezing rain that moved in at 4:30 a.m. caught the state by surprise.\n“I think the forecast was caught by surprise. No one forecasted that quick burst of rain that came through that washed away all that salt and the pretreat,” Tinlin said.\nIn Newton, 20 vehicles were involved in two separate crashes on Route 128 northbound, police said.\n“It seemed to have snuck up on everybody. Most everything is slick and coated with ice. We need everybody to slow down and plan for some extra time this morning,” Newton Fire Department Lt. Eric Fricke said.\nA school bus was involved in a crash at Vinton Street and the Fellways in Medford. Luckily, no injuries were reported.\nA crash involving at least six vehicles was reported in Medford on Interstate 93 north at Roosevelt Circle.\nA tractor-trailer rolled over on the Massachusetts Turnpike in Millbury at exit 11 and landed in the median. Two lanes of travel in both directions have been shut down.\nMassachusetts State Police said Interstate 93 near Interstate 495 in Methuen was closed due to another multi-vehicle crash.\nFreezing rain is making roads across the state slick. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation urged motorists to allow extra travel time.\nDozens of spin-outs were also reported on secondary roads.\nNewton fire officials said the department responded to 12 crashes in 45 minutes. Police in Dedham reported several accidents within an hour, as well.\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority urged commuters to use extra care in parking lots and on train platforms.\nIcy roads this morning. #SlowDown\n— Mass State Police (@MassStatePolice) February 8, 2017\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MassStatePolice/status/829286900489916417", "http://www.wcvb.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJQeb?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJQeb?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/6691673d-", "http://www.wcvb.com/weather/closings", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJQeb?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://cbslocal-download.s3.amazonaws.com/anv-playlists/feeds/xml/154.xml&quot;}", "http://www.wcvb.com/article/hour-by-hour-futurecast/8289442", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/6691673d-6624-4b12-b93f-bf1f07458731/309dfe65-924c-49ee-8ed6-0ab2aeb63cf5.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://www.wcvb.com/traffic", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmJQeb%3focid%3dsl&title=Icy+Roads+Cause+55-Car+Pileup+In+Mass.&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmJQeb%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmJJQ7.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJQeb?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJQeb?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmJNDD.img&quot;}}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmJQeb&lang=en-us&flow_id=c10347dc-78c0-44a5-bf92-3a5534788d9e", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SlowDown?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmJQeb%3focid%3dst&text=Icy+Roads+Cause+55-Car+Pileup+In+Mass.&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmJQeb%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:07:36.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
