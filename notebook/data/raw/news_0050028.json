He remembered having seen organizations that help people with these types of projects, so he took it upon himself to call a few of them to explain the story.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > Thomas Mitchell and his friends pose after working hard to build the ramp together. (From left: Nick Puckett, Randall Puckett, Mike Greene, Anthony Puckett and Thomas Mitchell) Â© Courtesy of Thomas and Jennifer Mitchell Unfortunately, due to tight budgets, a new ramp wasn't going to be a possibility ... not without their help, it seemed. But Mitchell was determined.\n\"I decided to call Lowe's to see if they would help,\" explained Mitchell. \"I got to the manager, David Adams ... he didn't even bat an eye, he just asked me to get a list together.\"\nRELATED: Mailman builds ramp for aging dog so they can continue their sweet daily greeting\nAfter picking up his supplies, Mitchell reached out to some friends who were more than excited to pitch in.\nMitchell then gave Lydia's mother, Verna DeSpain, a call to let her know what he had arranged.\n\"You know, I wasn't expecting anyone to just call and volunteer to do that,\" DeSpain told TODAY. \"After we got off the phone I was so happy I was just crying happy tears.\"\nMitchell explained that he and his crew showed up and built the ramp in one day. DeSpain and her daughter made sure to come out and express their appreciation.\nWhile Lydia is nonverbal, her elation was apparent.\n\"I told her, 'This is all about you,'\" DeSpain said. \"'They're here for you.' She just gets really excited.\"\nAnd we're excited, too. It's always good to remember that there are people out there who care.\nRELATED: Meet the second-grade class that came to the aid of an injured pup\n\"I'm just so glad that this is touching people and inspiring them,\" said DeSpain. \"And maybe making them more aware of the special-needs community and what they take for granted.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn1sCx?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn1sCx?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;424&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;240&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://www.today.com/pets/second-grade-class-raises-money-help-injured-dog-t107993", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn1sCx?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://www.today.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn1sCx?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn1qda.img&quot;}}", "http://www.today.com/news/school-bus-driver-builds-ramp-girl-need-t108250http://playback.nbcnews.com/videoredirect/h264/low/tdy_janet_dog_170128.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.today.com/news/school-bus-driver-builds-ramp-girl-need-t108250&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;TODAY&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBph6Sm.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;School", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBhb5Hu.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn1sCx%3focid%3dst&text=School+bus+driver+builds+wheelchair+ramp+for+girl+on+his+route&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn1sCx%3focid%3dst", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn1sCx&lang=en-us&flow_id=70ecbf59-9841-42d9-a8d5-b5c53a34ca1b", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/f08059e7-bd0f-46e0-ada1-a8aeee7d35a6/d2c9bd18-4bac-42fe-a6e1-cd842c6cf8ae.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/f08059e7-bd0f-46e0-ada1-a8aeee7d35a6/d2c9bd18-4bac-42fe-a6e1-cd842c6cf8ae.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://data.nbcnews.com/drone/api/query/MSN/today/1.0/lifestyle&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn1sCx%3focid%3dsl&title=School+bus+driver+builds+wheelchair+ramp+for+girl+on+his+route&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn1sCx%3focid%3dsl", "http://www.today.com/pets/mailman-builds-ramp-aging-dog-after-forging-special-bond-t107603"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:49:41.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
