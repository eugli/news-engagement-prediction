Tenant advocates say they are sometimes used to push out low-income tenants so landlords can renovate and jack up the rent.\n  Brent Merrill, president of MetCap, said renovations and repairs to the balconies and the garage, a condensation unit, boilers and a fire retrofit, were needed to keep the 65-year-old building in safe and working order. The change to balcony railings, he said, was ordered by the city and current building codes meant additional renovations were required. The work happened in 2014 and cost more than $1 million, according to tribunal documents.\n“In regards to the 3 per cent increase, I am entitled to it under the law, and they are entitled to go and make their arguments,” said Merrill.\nBoth sides agreed to mediation, but an agreement could not be reached and a hearing is expected to be scheduled. “Maybe with a breather a fair deal can be worked out. We are still hopeful,” Merrill said, via email. \nMeanwhile, some of the tenants say they are not paying rent until their demands are met.\nFor Incorvaia, the proposed rent hike, on top of the 1.5 per cent already approved by the province for 2017, means a serious strain on her budget. She says she already stretched to the limit on her $1,100 disability pension, and, even at her current rent of $915, she’s had to borrow from friends and family to make ends meet.\nMerrill said he visited the building on Tuesday and there were four outstanding work orders and a tenant hotline has recorded 11 complaints, since June 2016.\nHe also sent the Star a copy of a maintenance form recently distributed to tenants, encouraging them to report issues. “We are willing to fix anything in any apartment. No item too small or too big. We just need to be informed,” he said.\nAmong the tenant complaints is that people must hike steep stairs to get into the building, or hoist themselves up a small incline, when a ramp is needed. Merrill told the Star they are working with an architect to find solutions to that issue.\nThe building is partially owned by the Alberta Investment Management Corp. A company spokesperson said in an email they employ the “expertise and local knowledge of top-tier property managers that operate using best in class processes” to manage buildings on their behalf and “are pleased with the quality of management provided by MetCap.”\nTenant Diane Ragaram, 63, a personal support worker, said she has lived in the building since 1977 and has watched her rent rise to $1,000 from $150.\nShe said the heat fluctuates and is sometimes so “low we have to call the city. Every couple of days we don't get water, we don’t get heat,” she said. Merrill sent the Star inspection records from Feb. 1, showing the temperature in all accessible units was at about 24C, or above.\nIncorvaia showed the Star 16 notices informing tenants water would be shut down, from just the last two years. “You can’t shower, you can’t clean, you can’t cook,” she said. “If you get up late in the morning you can’t even have a cup of coffee.”\nMerrill said three of the notices were to install four new boilers in 2016, something he doesn’t consider unusual for an old building. \nSimon Wallace, with McCarten Wallace Litigation, represented the tenants at the hearing.\n“The tenants know that a rent increase of this size is an eviction by another name, especially for people with fixed incomes and so they are prepared to vigorously protect their housing,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:54:01.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
