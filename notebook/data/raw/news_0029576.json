As a result, the government had tried to argue, it could not have known the harm that might have been done to the children.\n\"Canada's submission misses the point,\" Belobaba said. \"The issue is not what was known in the 1960s about the harm of trans-racial adoption or the risk of abuse in the foster home.\"\nInstead, the justice said, there can be \"no doubt\" that what was well known even then was the importance to First Nations peoples of protecting and preserving their distinctive cultures and traditions, including their concept of the extended family.\nThe lead plaintiff in the Ontario action, Marcia Brown Martel, 53, is a member of the Temagami First Nation near Kirkland Lake, Ont. She was adopted by a non-aboriginal couple in 1972 at age nine and later discovered the Canadian government had declared her original identity dead.\n\"I feel like a great weight has been lifted from my heart,\" Brown Martel said in a statement. \"Our voices were finally heard and listened to. Our pain was acknowledged.\"\nThe government did not immediately comment on the decision.\nBelobaba said that while the 1965 agreement, strictly speaking, applied to the Indian bands and not the children, he hoped the government would not now try to make such a \"formalistic argument\" given the First Nations context.\nThe Liberal government indicated last week it was going to try to block Belobaba from releasing his ruling after Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett announced an intention to negotiate with '60s Scoop survivors across the country. The government relented amid outrage by the plaintiffs and critics, who called the attempt to stop the ruling an unprecedented political interference.\nSimilar legal actions in several provinces other than Ontario are pending but none has been certified.\nRelated Stories Feds back off on last-ditch attempt to delay judge's '60s-Scoop ruling Feds' attempt to block '60s Scoop ruling slammed as 'unprecedented', galling Federal government seeking to settle suits from '60s Scoop 'dark chapter' Photos A 60s Scoop survivor cries at the Manitoba Legislature on June 18, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:22:52.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
