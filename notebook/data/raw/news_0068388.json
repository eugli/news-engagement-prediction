Orlando Soria of Homepolish \nOrlando serves as the West Coast Creative Director for Homepolish. He also works as an interior designer and writer. You can read more about his work on Homepolish Magazine . He lives in Los Angeles. \nMy sister and her wife did a great upgrade on their San Francisco rental kitchen. It previously had dated 80s pine cabinetry that they hand-sanded and painted a sophisticated grey. It made their kitchen look so much more polished and modern. \nIn my first LA apartment, the linoleum flooring in the kitchen was tattered and worn. So I applied a fresh new floor of peel-and-stick linoleum tiles in a super-cute white and black stripe pattern. \nOther ideas: Changing out hardware on cabinetry can be an easy way to add some quick sophistication. If your fridge is a little dated, a fun way to make it feel fresh is to add a patterned removable wallpaper . (I love the Keith Haring patterns from Blik wallpaper.) People often overestimate how hard is is to change lighting , but many rentals have awful overhead dome lights, or worse, large boxy fluorescents. Changing these out for an inexpensive yet tasteful ceiling mount makes all the difference in the world. Changing out faucets and other hardware can make a huge difference in how you feel about your kitchen. You touch these things every day, and having nice ones greatly improves the experience of using your kitchen. Floor rugs . You think you don't need them, but they make a kitchen feel so much cozier. Buy the kind you can stick in the wash so they don't get disgusting. 2. Holly Becker of Decor8 \nHolly runs the award-winning blog Decor8 .

She lives in Hannover, Germany. \nWhen I rented one of my first apartments in Boston, it had dark wood paneling, vinyl flooring that was at least 50 years old, dark brown cabinets, and a horrible light fixture in the center of the room. I was single, going to college at night, working full-time during the day, and 23 years old. I saw potential, though; signed the lease; and moved in with plans to renovate my kitchen for under $500. \nAfter first getting written permission from my landlord, I worked with my friend to: Fill in the grooves of the paneling with plaster and rented an electric sander to smooth the seams after the plaster had dried. This was before painted white paneling was considered a good look in the kitchen. I painted the paneling four times! I primed, sanded, and painted the cabinets in white, too. I added new and very affordable brass hardware . My friend, a carpenter, then helped me lay a very inexpensive plank wood floor . The kitchen wasn't very large, but it was an eat-in kitchen so I wanted to still put some money into the flooring. Because labor was free, and we used wood planks he had leftover in his shed from previous jobs, the costs were kept very low. \nIn the end, the new walls, flooring, and refreshed cabinetry made the ugly countertops seem to disappear, along with the old white \"seen better days\" oven and sink. \nIf you're in a rental and your landlord doesn't mind, you might not be able to install new flooring (throw rugs work wonders!), but you may be able to paint the walls and cabinets. New hardware, especially something clean and modern, can make the whole kitchen look great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:36:02.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
