Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.co \nUncle Joe came first. \nA Russian Jew, Joe Schneider came to America around the turn of the 20th century. \nHe settled in University City. \n“Uncle Joe came, worked, saved money and sent for more relatives,” remembers Alan Baker. The 74-year-old Richmond Heights lawyer is leaning against a headstone at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City. More than 180 headstones, and as many as 200, were toppled by vandals over the weekend. On Tuesday, Baker and dozens of others who have relatives buried there wandered the rows of headstones, some of them dating to the 1800s, looking for names, mourning those they knew and those they didn’t. \nUncle Joe is buried here. And his sister, Ethel Zlepper. That wasn’t her name when she came from Russia, but at Ellis Island, unable to speak much English, that’s how it came to be. Zlepper’s daughter is Barbara Baker, Alan Baker’s mother. \n“In those days, before you could come to America, somebody had to sponsor you,” Baker says. Joe sent for some relatives. They came and worked and sent for others. “They did that until the entire family came to America. All of that history is here in this cemetery.” \nUncle Joe had six siblings. Besides Ethel there were Harry and Jake, Sarah, Jennie and Abe. They became Schneiders and Zleppers, Diamonds, Rotmans, Seltzers and Bakers.

A retired history teacher from Clayton High School, Lary was buried here a year ago. \nBaker found out about the vandalism Tuesday morning. He was driving to work when he picked up his nephew, who shared the news. \n“It’s beyond horrible how people could have such hate,” Baker says. \nThat’s the word many Jewish families with relatives at the cemetery are using to describe what they see as an unthinkable act of anti-Semitism. Officially, University City police say they don’t have any information yet to make them believe it was a hate crime. There was no graffiti left on the toppled grave markers. Police are examining video from the cemetery and nearby businesses. \nBut don’t tell Beverly Friedman the vandalism wasn’t a hate crime. \nThe Clayton woman’s family is all buried at the cemetery on Olive Boulevard. Her parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles and cousins. \n“Deep down, I feel like it’s anti-Semitism,” she says. \nThe toppled Jewish grave markers come at a time when anti-Semitism is at a rise in the U.S. Dozens of Jewish community centers, including those in the St. Louis area, have been evacuated in the past month because of threats. President Donald Trump, whose statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day in January specifically omitted mention of Jews, is being blamed by some local Jews for his failure to firmly denounce anti-Semitism amid the threats to community centers. The president’s harsh language toward various immigrant communities, and specifically Muslims, has given rise to an increase in hate rhetoric around the nation. \n“All of these people are being emboldened by what Trump is doing,” Friedman says. \nIt’s late Tuesday afternoon, and Arthur Schenker comes up to Karen Aroesty, regional director for the Anti-Defamation League , standing inside the gates of the cemetery. Schenker is the son of famed criminal defense attorney Morris Schenker , a colorful St. Louis character who at one time represented Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa. Morris isn’t buried here, but his brothers are. They, too, were Russian Jews who put their roots down in St. Louis. \n“What can I do to help?” Arthur asked Aroesty. The ADL has offered a $10,000 reward to find the people responsible for the vandalism. \n“How can this happen in today’s world?” Schenker asked. “It’s being perpetrated from people in high places.” The reference to Trump was obvious; but Aroesty, wary of politics while the investigation is underway, demurred. \nStill, there is no doubting the impact the event is having on the Jewish community, she said. “This one feels different,” Aroesty says, compared with the sorts of anti-Semitic incidents her organization responds to regularly. “This crosses all lines religiously. These are living souls. They are not people who don’t exist anymore.” \nWe walk by a fresh mound of dirt. There is no headstone yet but a sign marking a recent burial. \n“Marcia Sterneck,” it says. “2-9-17. Section H. Lot 15. Grave 2E.” \n“I knew her,” Aroesty says. “She just passed.” \nIn the Jewish tradition, Sterneck’s grave site, with the bare mound of dirt, will remain that way for nearly a year. The family mourns during that time, and then comes back together for another service at the cemetery to set the headstone. \nBy that time, the vandalized headstones will have been repaired. Volunteers and cemetery workers were already fixing those that could be easily reset, though dozens were still toppled, some broken, as of Tuesday afternoon. \nThe cemetery was closing for the day before Baker could determine if any of his relatives’ graves had been vandalized. \nHe wipes away a tear as he tries to explain the emotions he says he’s struggled with all day. \n“In a way I’m furious at them,” Baker says of the vandals. “But there’s a side of me that feels sorry for them. Even God has been unable to save them, and that must be a horrible life for them to live.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:24:21.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
