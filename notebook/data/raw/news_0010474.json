It sold out on the site in three days.\nWhile the Times did place “Gosnell” on their “Combined Print & E-Book Best Sellers” list at no. 13 , they did not include the book on their nonfiction “Print Hardcover Best Sellers” list, although its publisher, Regnery Publishing, said it outsold all but three nonfiction hardcover titles.\nY'all are amazing. Amazon is SOLD OUT of #Gosnell ! Back in stock soon! @BNBuzz has copies ready to go! https://t.co/zi4Nwl1Owo\n— Regnery Publishing (@Regnery) January 27, 2017\nIn a statement, McElhinney said it is “shocking that the cover-up of the Gosnell story is continuing even after the mainstream media were so criticized for failing to cover the trial.”\n“It’s clear that this is a blatant fake list in a fake news newspaper,” she said. “It’s not only an insult to the people who have bought this book, but an insult to the readers of the New York Times who buy the newspaper and think they are getting the truth about book sales across America but instead get false facts disguised as a neutral list.”\nThe book details the life and crimes of Gosnell, who was convicted in 2013 of performing abortions beyond Pennsylvania’s 24-weeks gestation limit, three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies born alive by severing their spinal cords with scissors and the involuntary manslaughter of an adult patient named Karnamaya Mongar, a refugee who had only recently arrived in the United States after fleeing war-torn Bhutan. He is currently serving a life sentence.\n“The media doesn’t want this story to see the light of day because it shines a negative light on abortion,” McElhinney added.\nThe Times has previously been accused of intentionally excluding books written by conservative authors from its bestseller list. In 2015, they omitted Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s “A Time for Truth” from their list. The book later appeared on the list.\nA spokesperson for the Times did not immediately return TheBlaze’s request for comment.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/02/12/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/?action=click&contentCollection=Books&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fbooks%2Fbest-sellers%2F2017%2F01%2F29%2Fcombined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction%2F&region=Header&module=ArrowNav&version=Right&pgtype=Reference", "http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/13/the-new-york-times-leaves-ted-cruzs-book-off-bestseller-list/", "https://t.co/zi4Nwl1Owo", "https://twitter.com/Regnery/status/824984128491778048", "https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/02/12/hardcover-nonfiction/?module=DropDownNav&action=click&region=navbar&contentCollection=Books&version=Nonfiction&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fbooks%2Fbest-sellers%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fcombined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction%2F&pgtype=Reference&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=FBADBD0987A948397813F30ED9619B18&gwt=pay&_r=0", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gosnell?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BNBuzz", "http://www.mediaite.com/print/new-york-times-finally-adds-ted-cruz-book-to-bestsellers-list/"], "published": "2017-02-04T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:29:07.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
