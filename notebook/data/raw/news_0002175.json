The Home Office said it did not have the number of illegal immigrants who were found. Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena, left, said only those who are legally in the country should be able to use NHS services; while Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone, right, said all government departments should be working together to identify illegal immigrants Watchdog paid lawyers £240k in cover-up A nursing watchdog spent £240,000 on lawyers to conceal information it held on a bereaved father. The Nursing and Midwifery Council hired a legal firm to redact documents before releasing them to James Titcombe, who played a key role in exposing baby deaths at Morecambe Bay NHS Trust. So much was removed that only half a sentence remained on some pages. Even so, they showed the NMC had detailed information on Mr Titcombe – including his Twitter feed – as he campaigned for an investigation into his son Joshua’s death. Joshua died in November 2008 at just nine days after nurses at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria, failed to spot an infection. In a cover-up, a group of midwives hid failings that led to the deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Now documents reveal that the NMC spent £240,000 on laywers to advise it on how to respond to Mr Titcombe’s attempts using the Data Protection Act to find out what happened to Joshua. One email with the subject heading ‘Twitter chat – key points’ said: ‘Keep an eye on his feed.’ The NMC said it engaged a law firm to help deal with his request, costing £239,871.85, because of the volume of information he had requested. Mr Titcombe said it had failed to fulfil its remit to protect mothers and babies, but spared no expense to protect its reputation. A memorandum of understanding was published last month outlining the full details about the exchange of information between the NHS and the Home Office over illegal immigrants, which is said to have been taking place since 2005. In an interview with the Health Service Journal, Mr Manning said he was challenged for ‘daring’ to question the legality of requests for confidential data and was met with ‘enormous reluctance’ when he launched a review into the practice. The civil servant, who stepped down from his role at NHS Digital last year, said: ‘We said to the Home Office, “We need to understand what the legal basis of this is”. ‘The Home Office response was: “How dare you even question our right to this information? This is data that belongs to the public. It is paid for by the taxpayer. We should use it for public policy”. The Home Office view was that tracing illegal immigrants was a manifesto commitment. ‘I came under immense pressure to leave matters as they were.’ Mr Manning said he was concerned that use of NHS records by immigration officials could deter people from seeking treatment, and so pose a public health risk. But Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena, a member of the home affairs committee, said: ‘I think it is important people can only use NHS services if they are genuinely in the country.’ Philip Hollobone, a Conservative backbencher, said: ‘All Government departments and agencies should be working together to identify illegal immigrants so they can be removed from the country. ‘People will see that is common sense and they will think it is nonsense that one part of Government has tried to resist it.’ The memorandum of understanding says the Home Office’s use of confidential patient data is in the public interest to protect services, including the NHS, schools and housing, from unnecessary pressures. A Government spokesman said ‘limited’ NHS data is shared with the Home Office, adding: ‘Access to this information is strictly controlled, with strong legal safeguards. ‘No clinical information is shared, and before anything at all is shared there has to be a legal basis to do so. Immigration officials only contact the NHS when other reasonable attempts to locate people have been unsuccessful.’ Share or comment on this article 23", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:18:27.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
