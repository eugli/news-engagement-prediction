Donald Trump in 2012 in Bethesda, Md. (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe dumbest criticism of any president is that he plays too much golf. Partisans on both sides make it, always disingenuously. \nWhen Barack Obama was president, Donald Trump fussed about his golfing. “He’s played more golf than most people on the PGA tour, this guy,” he said. He also expressed his anti-golf concerns on Twitter. \n“Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter” — Oct. 13, 2014 \n“We pay for Obama’s travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.” — Oct. 14, 2014 \n“President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!” — Oct. 23, 2014 \n“While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!” — May 21, 2016 \nYou get the idea. \nLast Saturday, President Trump played 18 holes of golf at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., and nine more at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The next day, Trump observed the Sabbath by hanging out at his club in West Palm Beach, where he spent five hours doing no labor. \nThe previous weekend, according to The New York Times , Trump “spent four and a half hours at one of his golf clubs, a day before hosting a Super Bowl Party at Mar-a-Lago,” which Trump calls the “winter White House.” A wolf in wolf's clothing foments conflict: Christian Schneider \nTrump is expected to return to Mar-a-Lago this weekend. If he does, it will be his third week in a row there. \nThis is great news, particularly if you hate Trump’s politics. The more time he spends playing golf, the less time he has to play president. \nRather than pleasing his critics, Trump’s golf outings irritate them. It’s ironic that the same people who don’t want Trump to do anything complain when he doesn’t do anything. \nGolf exposes a president to derision. Critics accuse him of neglect and insouciance — in short, of not caring enough. But a president can’t possibly care about everyone; nor should he. That’s not his job. \nSo painful are the criticisms that presidents sometimes quit their avocations. George W. Bush stopped playing golf in 2003 because, as he said, “playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal.” The same is true during peacetime. \nWhen Americans see their president playing golf or relaxing on the beach, they get the impression that their dear leader doesn’t care about them. Very often, the president’s critics foster this impression. After Hurricane Katrina, then-Senator Obama excoriated Bush as “a president who only saw the people from the window of an airplane instead of down here on the ground.” Impeach Trump: Ohio Republican judge \nBeing “on the ground” gives a president street cred, but street cred is overrated. More important than street cred for a president are rest and recreation. Every president needs a hobby, and golf is a good one. Golf provides more than a diversion from politics. It provides fresh air, escape from insularity and exercise, all of which are theoretically beneficial. \nBesides, in Trump’s case, he has little choice. Trump is a 70-year-old rich white man with a house in Florida. He’s practically golf’s mascot. \nContrary to popular belief, the president has a lot of free time. He makes his own schedule. Recall that on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Bush was reading a book to children. In his free time, Reagan watched a lot of movies. Ford did a lot of skiing. Clinton did a lot of adultery. \nYou can criticize Trump for a lot of things, but you shouldn’t criticize him for playing golf. If anything, you should criticize him for playing too little. If he isn’t golfing, he’s liable to do something far more consequential and devastating, such as his presidential duties. \nWindsor Mann is the editor of The Quotable Hitchens: From Alcohol to Zionism .
