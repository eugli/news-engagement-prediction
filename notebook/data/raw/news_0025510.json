The event was opened by a prayer by Yellowknives Dene Chief Edward Sangris, who said prior to the event that he was hoping to get face time with Trudeau during his short visit to Yellowknife, rather than \"sit up front and smile\" at the town hall.\nEarly on, Trudeau fielded a question from Tuktoyaktuk mayor Darrel Nasogaluak, who asked how the federal government would help create economic opportunities in the Beaufort Delta in the wake of a moratorium on licences to drill for oil and gas in Arctic waters.\nThe move has proved controversial, with premiers from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut decrying a lack of consultation with locals .\nNunavut, N.W.T. premiers slam Arctic drilling moratorium\nTrudeau justified the ban by speaking about the risks of Arctic drilling, saying that \"quite frankly, it has never been determined that it can be done safely.\n\"We make decisions based on science,\" he said. \"And that's why we're working with the North, with communities, with the premier, with scientists, to establish the framework so that we can evaluate every five years... to make sure that moratorium is still relevant. But what we've done now is we're starting from a place where the ocean and the Arctic ecosystems will be protected by default.\n\"We've closed one door of potential economic opportunity. We need to work together to ensure that we are opening many more doors of economic opportunity.\"\nQuestion: mayor of Tuk says he's disappointed in Beaufort Drilling moratorium.

But I will not compromise on what is in the best interest of Canada.\"\nThe prime minister also fielded a question from Yellowknife Centre MLA Julie Green, who questioned him on a lack of funding for elder care in the health care deal recently signed with the territories .\nTerritories agree to health funding deal with federal government\n\"We have 258 people who will need long-term care beds at the high end of that continuum in the next 10 years,\" said Green, noting that the government had pledged just over $6 million for home care services. \"So what you have given us is not adequate to our needs.\"\nTrudeau responded by touting the government's investments in home care and mental health services, before acknowledging that \" few places face more stresses than rural, remote and Northern communities, with health care impacts.\n\"It is unacceptable that young mothers in the North have to be flown south to deliver their babies. These are things that we need to address,\" he said.\n\"The solution isn't just to throw more money at the problem. We also have to look at how we're improving our systems. How we're supporting more nurse practitioners. How we're using telehealth. So that we can reduce costs overall for our systems, so that for the people who have the most needs, the money is there.\"\nTrudeau was in Iqaluit Thursday , where he met with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami leaders and Premier Peter Taptuna before attending a community event at Inuksuk High School.\nVIDEO | Trudeau signs Inuit-to-Crown partnership declaration during Iqaluit visit There are no plans for a visit to Yukon.
