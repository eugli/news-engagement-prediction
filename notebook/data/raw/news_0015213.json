The Isle of Thanet is fast becoming the Kentish Riviera – with property prices at less than half the cost of its celebrity strewn south-west rival.\nFifteen sandy bays follow the train stops from Birchington-on-Sea to Pegwell Bay via Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate, with heaps of cool cafés, galleries and vintage shops along the way. \nIncreasingly, Londoners are exchanging their fractious suburban commutes for a 75-minute journey covering 80 miles on a high-speed train for three days a week instead of five. For second-home owners, the Friday night exodus is a doable 90 minutes’ drive from London, compared with at least five tortuous hours and 280 miles to Cornwall. Thanet is coming of age.\nRamsgate harbour, Thanet, Kent Credit: Alamy T he isle’s seedier edges – and there are many – are slowly evolving as London money snaps up the fixer-uppers and pubs start serving tapas instead of meat pies. \nFor some, the fly in the ointment may be the Ukip-controlled council, yet this doesn’t seem to have deterred the game-changers, according to Stuart Barr, from local estate agent Miles and Barr.\n“There’s a massive feel-good factor with all the regeneration that’s going on, especially in Ramsgate and Margate,” he says. \n“We still have grammar schools, and the grey pound is attracted by the less stressed lifestyle, growing art scene and the sheer value for money, with London buyers getting twice as much property for half the money.” \nWhile Cornwall’s most expensive enclaves of Rock, Fowey and St Mawes recorded average prices of between £362,830 and £401,261 last year, Thanet’s hot spots of Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs have prices ranging from £195,342 to £278,931, according to Strutt and Parker and Dataloft. Annual price growth is predicted to reach four per cent in Thanet by 2020, compared with 2.8 per cent in Cornwall.\nA four-bedroom home in Broadstairs is £999,000 with Miles and Barr E dward Church, head of Strutt and Parker’s Kent region, says that all houses in the county have caught up with pre-recession prices, but seaside homes in Margate and Ramsgate have seen some of the fastest price growth in the whole of the UK. He puts this down to the combination of proximity to the sea and to London. \n“Seaside property in Kent trades at a premium of at least 50 per cent above the same house inland,” Church says. “Buy a sea view and you get a new painting every day, all of them worthy of the National Gallery.” \nBroadstairs – with its Dickens history, Punch and Judy shows and ice-cream parlours – claims the crown for the highest prices; large detached homes on the prestigious North Foreland with sea views can command prices of around £1 million. \nHowever, Margate, or “Shoreditch-on-Sea” as the agents like to call it, is snapping at its heels with price growth in the last two years pushing 25 to 30 per cent, says Barr. London’s expats can find three-storey homes from £375,000 and, like Ramsgate, its south-west aspect soaks up every last ray of sun.\nThe Point, a large apartment in this contemporary Art Deco-style building, has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. Natural light floods in through floor-to-ceiling windows, with sea views from the study. Guide price: £1 million Agent: Strutt & Parker “When HS1 is upgraded in 2019 it will only take 63 minutes to St Pancras,” Barr adds. “Will Thanet become the new stockbroker belt?” \nA lex and Juliet Herd made the leap from Surrey to Margate four years ago in search of a project. They found a vast, unloved, Grade II listed Regency property for £120,000 that started life as a family home, became The Bath House Academy School in the 1840s, then was eventually turned into the A1 hotel with 13 shabby bedsits typical of the gentrifying coastal town.\n“We were drawn by the honesty of the area – there’s still bags of potential here and you’re either in first and happy or in last saying, ‘Why didn’t I do it sooner?’ ” says Alex, 48, a serial renovator and artist who is project-managing the renovations while Juliet, 56, works at a local school. “Even in winter, the cold grey sea has its own charm, crashing onto the promenade.” \nA four-bedroom terraced house that is full of character, with a homely kitchen/dining room and a reception room currently used as an art studio. A sun room with a stable door leads to the garden, a large courtyard with plants. £359,995 with Miles & Barr U sing original materials and local craftsmen, Alex has transformed the property’s five-storey exterior. Last year, he won second place in Margate’s Town Pride Award for enhanced buildings. Now his attention is on the interior. \n“We’re finding its real identity, taking down partitions to recreate the original layout,” he says. “We have five grown-up children and elderly parents to accommodate, so it needs to be big enough for when everyone’s here together.” \nFamily was a crucial factor in retired head teacher Patricia Sargent’s decision to move to Kent, too. She drew a circle around London to compare house prices before selling her north London family home last year. \nAnywhere within the M25 was too expensive, but she found a charming five-bedroom bungalow in Westgate-on-Sea, on the north Thanet coast, for £329,000 via Miles and Barr.\nSuch is the value in Thanet that the proceeds of the London sale also paid for a five-bedroom property nearby for her daughter Katy, son-in-law and their three young children. Her son’s family often visits for the weekend from a village near Maidstone, Kent. \nPatricia Sargent with her family in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent Credit: Christopher Pledger “Cornwall is the love of my life but it’s just too far away from my family and friends,” says Patricia, 73. She is smitten. “The sunsets are to die for and the summer is glorious. Now the grandchildren have beaches, fresh air and green spaces, not traffic and pollution.” \nT he Kent coast has had a similar effect on New Zealanders Chris and Elizabeth Welch, second-home owners who bought their four-bedroom townhouse near the seafront in Ramsgate in 2007 for £280,000. They fell in love with the town’s marina, set in the UK’s only Royal Harbour, and the community-minded culture, as well as the architecture; Augustus Pugin’s home is there. \n“It’s only one hour and 15 minutes away from our home in Bromley, Kent, so it’s great for short breaks and easy to get to on the train or by car,” says Chris, 60. “We let the house for about 20 weeks a year and use it ourselves for around 30 days, so it more than pays its way.” \nChris, an accountant in London, has thrown himself into the local life. He is on the committee for Project MotorHouse, a charity that aims to regenerate Ramsgate by turning a derelict building on the West Cliff into a community asset with two cinemas, a restaurant, bar and outdoor theatre, using the rent income to fund local youth work. \nStuart Barr has noticed a huge appetite for brand new, turnkey properties, with homes in developments such as Ramsgate’s old Bread Factory conversion selling quickly and for record prices. \nMargate’s row of designer beach houses overlooking Westbrook Bay sold for £500 per sq ft, double the local average, with 80 per cent of the buyers coming from outside Thanet. \n“The pull of the sea is huge,” says Barr. “Now all we need to match Cornwall is a Michelin-starred restaurant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:13:37.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
