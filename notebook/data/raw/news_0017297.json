I was thinking how did the earthquake come because the threat came long back. There must be some reason that Mother Earth became so upset.\" \nIn December 2016, Rahul Gandhi had said, \"If they allow me to speak in parliament, you will see what an earthquake will happen.\" \nModi was speaking in the Parliament during a discussion on the motion of thanks to the President's address at a joint-session of the Parliament. \nHe spoke about the Emergency of 1975-77 when democracy was under threat and the freedom of press was curtailed. Hailing India's democracry and 'Jan Shakti', he said that it is because of the power of the people that a man born to a poor family can become the Prime Minister of India. \nCalling himself unlucky for not being able to fight in India's struggle for Independence, he said that he was making up for it by working for a better India. \nAlso on HuffPost India 'Indica: A Deep Natural History Of The Indian Subcontinent' Is More Compelling Than Sci-Fi 'Indica: A Deep Natural History Of The Indian Subcontinent' Is More Compelling Than Sci-Fi 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:09:39.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
