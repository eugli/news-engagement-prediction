Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau High-resolution cameras installed on the PSLV recorded ISRO's record-breaking feat yesterday, after the rocket that was launched into space sent back an entire video of its launch during different stages of detachment.\n\"After a flight of 16 minutes 48 seconds, the satellites achieved a polar Sun Synchronous Orbit of 506 km inclined at an angle of 97.46 degree to the equator (very close to the intended orbit) and in the succeeding 12 minutes, all the 104 satellites successfully separated from the PSLV fourth stage in a predetermined sequence beginning with Cartosat-2 series satellite, followed by INS-1 and INS-2. The total number of Indian satellites launched by PSLV now stands at 46,\" ISRO said in a statement. \n\"With today's successful launch, the total number of customer satellites from abroad launched by Indiaâ€™s workhorse launch vehicle PSLV has reached 180,\" ISRO said in a release on Wednesday. \nThe rocket launched the satellites in gaps of mere seconds and traveled at around 17,000 miles per hour. This shows the amount of precision with which the launch was carried out as a small deviation from trajectory could have resulted in a mass collision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:09:14.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
