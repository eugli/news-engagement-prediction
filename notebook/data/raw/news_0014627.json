Mark Wilson/Getty Images \nAfter fielding days of criticism and mockery, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday clarified remarks on MSNBC's \"Hardball,\" where she cited a nonexistent \"massacre\" as justification for President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban. \nConway had said that \"two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,\" further saying the attack was unknown to many because it \"didn't get covered.\" However, such an attack never happened . \nShe later tweeted a clarification that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists.\" But Conway received widespread mockery from the likes of \" SNL ,\" and even a fake vigil for the victims of the fake massacre popped up. \nIn an interview with Fox News' Howard Kurtz on Sunday, Conway struck back at her critics, some of whom she called \"haters.\" \n\"I should have said plot or I should have just called them terrorists. â€¦ I clarified immediately. I should have said terrorists and not massacre,\" Conway said. \"I'm sure it will live on for a week.\" \n\"I misspoke one word. The corrections in the newspapers that are attacking me are three paragraphs long every day,\" she added. \nWhen asked if the White House, which has often criticized media outlets as spreading \"fake news,\" should forgive the press when they inadvertently spread false information, Conway said: \" That is not what the president means when he says fake news on his Twitter. He is talking about things that are invented and just inaccurate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:36:13.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
