After working different jobs and one failed attempt at a different company, they decided to go back into business with each other. They decided to be their own bosses. \nSix years later, Boral Branders is an established marketing agency in the heart of the Houston Energy Corridor. \nBrenda Boral emigrated from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in 2005, and her sister, Patricia, moved two years later. They’ve been entrepreneurs their whole lives after taking over their mother’s English tutoring business to keep their family afloat once she lost her battle to cancer. \n“My mom had always been an entrepreneur, so we have been entrepreneurs our whole lives too,” Brenda Boral said. “We always thought of creative ways to advertise her tutorial services. That’s when we fell in love with it.” \nThe Houston Business Journal (a sister publication of Bizwomen) sat down with the sisters to talk about their love for marketing and how they went from such humble beginnings to owners of a successful, growing company. \nTell me about Boral Branders. What sets you apart from other marketing companies? \nPatricia: Everything has been through our own investment really. We didn’t get any loans from a bank, and that’s something we are very proud of. Our vision is to inspire women-owned business and business in general to think that it’s possible to live your dream and follow your passion. That’s the biggest thing that sets us apart — that we truly care about the business owner. A lot of other companies are just trying to close a deal; we become part of their team and help them every step of the way.
