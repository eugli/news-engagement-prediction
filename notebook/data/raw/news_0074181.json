CBS4’s Dillon Thomas interviews Maj Toure (credit: CBS) \n“In a lot of urban areas, we are dealing with a lot of ignorance, and misinformation,” said Maj Toure, spokesman for Black Guns Matter. \nToure told CBS4 the lack of gun education in major cities is the biggest cause for safety concerns. \n“If more people are aware that (guns) can be deterrents, and they are educated about it, we can prevent tragedies,” Toure said. “As opposed to just witnessing them. A lot of times, in urban areas, firearms are more needed as a deterrent.” (credit: CBS) \nToure said Coloradans only approved recreational marijuana because someone took time to educate them. \n“We believe we can do the same thing with firearms,” Toure said. \nToure said he didn’t believe guns killed people. Rather, he said it is the decisions made by those handling the guns that does. That belief encouraged Toure to defend the need for guns, rather than encouraging further restrictions.

I’m from Philly, that’s high cholesterol,” Toure said, comparing health related deaths to gun related deaths. \nToure said he wanted people who grew up in an environment like he did to use courses like his to better understand guns, and how they can use them to better their community. (credit: CBS) \n“This is a thing that has been historically tied into American culture,” Toure said. \nColorado Sen. Rhonda Fields made a statement about the event. \n“I support everyone’s right to bear arms. I support everyone’s right to the Second Amendment. What I appreciate is this organization’s attempt to teach people to handle guns in a responsible manner. I don’t have any issue with that,” Fields told CBS4. “I support keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people.” Vivian Wolfe and Javad Marshall-Fields (credit: CBS) \nFields’s son Javad Marshall-Fields was killed, along with his fiance, June 20, 2005. They were both shot to death. He was scheduled to testify before a jury in a murder trial. \nDillon Thomas is a reporter at CBS4 and a Colorado native.
