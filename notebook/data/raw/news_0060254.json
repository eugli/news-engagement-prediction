It’s do or die. My chest was closing up. I couldn’t breathe. We were all sinking down and we were all holding on to each other,” Jonas recalled. “The last kid I grabbed, I either went after him and grabbed him or he would not be here.” \nThe boys’ families called Jonas and Turnbull heroes for saving their sons’ lives. \n“Everybody who knows him knows that he’s just the guy,” Jonas’ younger brother, Cameron, told CBS2’s Stacey Butler at their home in San Clemente. \nJonas, an Orange County native who grew up surfing all over the world, told his little brother he was still shaken. \n“He said once he got out to the kids, he was like chest-deep, and the kids pulled him in and pulled him under the water. He’s like almost 6’3″, hefty. So he was grabbing them and throwing the little kids onto shore,” and to his friend, Cameron said. \nThe last boy was completely submerged. He regained consciousness after Jonas pulled him to safety. \nBennett is pursuing a modeling and acting career in New York. \nCameron said his big brother is too humble to let all the hero talk go to his head. He just hopes it helps launch his career. \n“I texted him and said: ‘Dude, this could be it. This could be your big break!'” Cameron added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:54:42.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
