(Photo: ITV) She was told by another ex that he cheated on her (Photo: Instagram) \nNicole spoke to Mirror Celeb ahead of Tuesday night's show about confronting Jacques and what happened when the cameras stopped rolling. \nShe said: \"It was a hard one with Jacques because I was only with him for a couple of months but he's the only boy I've been with that I've had a strong connection with. I did really love him but he did mess up a lot in the first two months.\" \nViewers will see Nicole confront Jacques about what she's been told, and him deny that anything happened. \n\"I was confident at the time that he didn't cheat on me,\" she revealed. \nWhen asked whether or not she'd since found out for sure if he'd cheated, Nicole said she couldn't say. Things are back on track for the couple (Photo: Instagram) \nBut whatever happened, Nicole and Jacques are now back together and happier than ever. \n\"I'm really happy with him now - he's changed a lot,\" she said. \n\"I've always said that a leopard never changes his spots but this one seems to have done it.\" \nThe pair have now been dating for 11 months. \nNicole has previously been linked to Ex On The Beach co-star Aaron Chalmers and TOWIE's Lewis Bloor , but quashed both relationships. \nShe said that her and Aaron had never been together and have more of a \"best mates\" relationship, and that while she went on a few dates with Lewis, she wouldn't say they were in a \"relationship\". \nNicole has been watching the show each week. \nShe said: \"There are certain things that you see on the show and you think, 'I can't remember that', but the cameras are with you 24 hours a day. \n\"You do forget about some things you say but it's the same for everybody. Taking part in the show was a great experience, a lot of fun, and it taught me a lot about myself as a person.\" Read More They're so in love (Photo: Instagram) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:01:12.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
