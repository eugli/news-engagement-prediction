Credit: ITV News \nThe inquest into the deaths of 30 British people during a terror attack at a beach resort in Tunisia will deliver its verdict on Tuesday. \nThe court has been looking into the circumstances surrounding the shooting in the popular area of Port El Kantaoui, Sousse, in June 2015. \nThe inquest, which began on January 16 at London's Royal Courts of Justice, will determine how much the UK government and travel firms knew about the risk of an attack on tourists holidaying in the area. \nIslamist gunman Seifeddine Rezgui killed 38 people with an automatic weapon on the beach and the adjoining five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel. Sousse's Police Chief said lessons have been learned from the attack.

Concerning the security agents, they are now more competent\". \nBut the threat they face has now changed as some young Tunisian men who travelled to Syria to fight are returning home. \nA senior politician, Oussama Sghaier, admits this is a worrying problem. \nHe told ITV News: \"We are completely aware of this problem and we are ready to face those people that will come from those areas.\" Gunman Rezgui was dropped off at the beach by an unknown accomplice.
