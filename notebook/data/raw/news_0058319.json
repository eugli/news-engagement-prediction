By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 8:49 pm Donald Trump gets trolled once again.

A video posted by Aron Anderson, a Swedish athlete, has gone viral for all the right reasons. The witty video dismisses Trump’s statement by taking a dig at him and also his policies. Things take an even funnier turn when the video makes a suggestion to Trump to help him build the wall along the Mexican border.
