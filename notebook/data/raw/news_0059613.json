The California math teenager was brutally murdered just two days before Christmas in 2013.

Would that work?\" \nRiverside County court documents filed last week and obtained by local news outlet Deseret News, gave a detailed transcription of the final voicemail, however Franco has maintained his innocence since her death. \nMs Grant can also be heart saying that the duo could think of something to say together. \n\"What do you want me to say? What should I say?\" she asks Franco in the recording. \nFurther court papers claim he allegedly confessed to a cellmate that he cut his girlfriend’s throat during a fight, took her to a golf course and killed her when she tried to escape not far from their home in the city of Indio. John Franco has been charged with her murder.
