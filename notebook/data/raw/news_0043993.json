I don't know about others,\" Dr Shetty said.\nGanguly, who is an eligible office bearer, will not be attending it as a source, privy to the developments, said \"IPL GC members hardly have any role to play in auctions\".\nThe erstwhile IPL GC included all office bearers along with Rajeev Shukla, Sourav Ganguly, MP Pandove, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Shetty.\nAnurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke are already ousted by Supreme Court.\nAs per Committee of Administrators (COA) diktat, vice president CK Khanna, treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhry and joint secretary Amitabh Chaudhary are not entitled to attend with their undertakings still pending in Supreme Court.\nThe tricky area was that COA has left it on other members of old GC to interpret and decide on their own whether they can attend or not.\nAccordingly Pandove has decided against it as he has demitted office in Punjab Cricket Association (PCA).\n\"I am no longer eligible as I have demitted office. I am not attending IPL auction tomorrow.\"\nFormer IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla also had to go on compulsory cooling off as he has had more than nine years in the Uttar Pradesh CA. He will, in all likelihood, skip the auctions.\nDitto for Jyotiraditya Scindia, Congress MP, who is no longer the president of Madhya Pradesh CA as he has already completed more than nine years in office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:15:41.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
