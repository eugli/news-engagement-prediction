The species is not dangerous they just come across quite scary.' Their danger, however, lies in their formidable appearance â€“ and penchant for popping out when least expected. 'Huntsman spiders tend to inhabit many places that humans do and will pop up when you least expect them. Such times are in your car when driving or in your room when watching TV.' Last year, Charlotte the huntsman went viral after being discovered on a farm in Queensland Specialists at the time told Daily Mail Australia the huntsman was a green giant species with a legspan of 20 centimetres Spine-chilling snapshots show 16cm creepy crawly dwarfing a regular-sized huntsman, The Australian Reptile Park's General Manager, Tim Faulkner, said Behemoth is closer size is closer to a bird-eating spider than his own brethren After Charlotte shot to stardom last year, specialists told Daily Mail Australia the huntsman was a green giant species with a legspan of 20 centimetres. This estimate would suggest Behemoth still has catching up to do before claiming the world title. It's believed she grew to a fearsome stature gorging on bugs - safe from predators - in an abandoned farm shed. Australian Reptile Park's Michael Tate, also known as 'Ranger Mick', told Daily Mail Australia Charlotte was a 'gobsmacker.' 'She's an exceptionally large female. I've been working at the Park for 25 years and she would have to be the biggest one I've seen. She's a gobsmacker.'
