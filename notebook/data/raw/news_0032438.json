With its API, you can pay your utility and telecom bills from your phone, computer, or a self-service kiosk without having to go through a bank. \nDan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, said: \nWorldwide, more than 2 billion people do not have affordable access to basic financial services, making it difficult and expensive for consumers to carry out basic financial tasks, including bill payment. TIO’s digital platform, and physical network of agent locations make paying bills simpler, faster, and more affordable. \nCould PayPal be making a move into the self-service world? \nThe company already has a cash-card based system that lets you add cash directly into your account. Partnering with TIO would be the next step to move your cash directly from your hand to your bill collector’s. \nThe acquisition is expected to close some time later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:27:00.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
