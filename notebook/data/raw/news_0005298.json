Prince Harry was visiting youth projects at Nottingham Academy (Photo: PA) \nLuckily the cameras were rolling at the school and the sweet moment was caught on camera. \nWomen everywhere will probably be swooning watching the video as it then becomes an adorable little game between the two. \nHaving fallen for the trick, the pupil decided to do it back to him (and, of course, like the true chivalrous gent he is, 32-year-old Harry pretended to fall for it). (Photo: PA) \nNever change, Harry. Never change. \nThe prince was visiting Nottingham Academy to see the work of two youth projects, joining in a Full Effect music and sports session with the kids, listening to rap music and watching dances. \nToday he is doing work to champion mental health projects as part of the #HeadsTogether and #TimeToTalk campaigns.
