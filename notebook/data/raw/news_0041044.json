I was a drug addict so I can’t sit here and say my reasons for doing it were founded in any way.\n“I stopped him from leaving my apartment. I did that. That is what I got done for. It was terrible what I did.\n\"I was absolutely ashamed and sorry what I did, but it has been very difficult to talk about as some parts of it are like: ‘That did not happen.’\nRead More Boy George reveals Princess Diana helped him turn his life around as he battled heroin addiction Audun Carlsen was kept prisoner by the singer (Photo: PA) “The fact is that I was not done for assault but what I done was wrong. It was wrong and I still pay the consequences for that now.\n“I have really turned my life around. Nothing anyone says to me can compare to how horrible I felt during that period.”\nThe singer declined to give evidence at the time, and explains: “I chose not to give evidence. I just chose to accept what was happening and for me I felt that was the dignified thing to do.\nBoy George and Piers Morgan on Life Stories (Photo: ITV) “When I was in court I was already a year clean so I was already sober. So that person I was in court and the person who was arrested, they were two different people.\n\"So I kind of just took the view that: ‘That person over there was in trouble.’ And I was going to get through this no matter what.\n“Plus, I did not want my mum to hear all that stuff in court. I thought: ‘She has been through enough.’\n\"I banned her from coming to the trial. I just thought: ‘You know what, I am just going to accept it. I will accept the consequences of what happened.’”\nGeorge served four months in prison in 2009, followed by a year on probation.\nSpeaking on ITV’s Piers Morgan ’s Life Stories, Boy George also told of the depths of his drug addiction which could easily have killed him, the death of George Michael and said a cup of tea was more reliable than men.\nThe 55-year-old added: “I am single but open to offers. Do I want children? No. I am not responsible. I can barely look after a hat.”\nPiers Morgan Life Stories airs this Friday on ITV at 9pm.
