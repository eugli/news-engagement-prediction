However, the crisis that the country is currently going through structurally prevents it from fulfilling this expectation. \nBrazil is melting down, to put it softly. A euphemistic image is that the country is waking up after a huge party, with a terrible hangover, and now has to face a very hard reality. \nIn fact, looking at Rio de Janeiro, the former host of the Olympic Games, the metaphor is indeed reality. \nUnsurprisingly, Rio is the epitome of the Brazilian tragedy. Until recently, both Brazil and Rio were in the spotlight of the international stage, receiving a lot of attention and investments. \nHowever, turning this promising situation into a sustainable reality was simply crushed when the real party that the country was enjoying ended. Brazil was enjoying a boom in its exports of commodities thanks to the high demand in China. As soon as the Chinese demand decreased, the impact was rapidly felt. \nWATCH: Brazil police resume duty after violent strike (2:22) \n\n'State of calamity'\nThe situation in Rio is tragic. Since the state's economy is highly dependent on oil sales, the decrease of oil prices internationally, and alleged cases of corruption, have led to a precarious financial situation. \nThis resulted in a negative outlook in several areas - ranging from the state's struggle to pay the wages and pensions of its public employees, to its crumbling health and security sectors. \nIt is not a coincidence that Rio's acting Governor Francisco Dornelles declared a state of calamity in June 2016. In the political sphere, the picture is not any better. Last November, for example, Rio observed two of its major politicians, Sergio Cabral and Anthony Garotinho, both former governors, being arrested. \nThis is definitely a microcosm of the crisis in Brazil. The country is in a dire economic situation. During the commodities boom, Brazil missed the opportunity to make structural modifications in its economy and become less dependent on commodities' price fluctuation. \nOPINION: The fight for Brazil's future \nInversely, the country experienced, for instance, the deterioration of its manufacturing sector. Now, it struggles to produce a sustainable economic growth and generate enough jobs, which consequently stresses its public deficit.\nIn this situation, following Rio de Janeiro, two other states of the federation also declared a state of financial public calamity - Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul. \nTherefore, three of the four largest state economies of Brazil are unequivocally broke. Even Espirito Santo, a state often praised as a financial example, is under a significant security crisis, owing to a strike of police officers demanding better salaries. The consequences of the strike claimed at least 144 lives . \nPolitical turmoil Notwithstanding, a pivotal dimension of the Brazilian crisis is the political sphere, which is in severe turmoil. \nIn recent months, for instance, the country witnessed the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and the arrest of the former Lower House Speaker in Congress, Eduardo Cunha. \nMoreover, Brazil's biggest-ever corruption investigation, known as Operation Carwash, is touching every major political party and profoundly shaking up the entire political establishment. \nOn the top of all this, once more Brazil is under a neoliberal restructuring in order to overcome the crisis, which is the equivalent of stepping forward when reaching the edge of a cliff. \nA country that was once able to pursue a very proactive foreign policy is now unable to deal effectively with pressing crises in its neighbourhood, such as the one in Venezuela or in Haiti.\n\nConsequently, with its core pillars collapsed, it is illusory to expect Brazil to have a major influence on the international stage. \nIn fact, for quite some time already, one can observe precisely the opposite - the retreat of Brazil's global ambitions. \nThis is clearly noticeable by simply observing the financial structure of its diplomacy-making. For instance, the country has been decreasing its budget allocated to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \nHence, Brazil is not only recruiting fewer diplomats but also discussing the closure of several embassies and consulates around the world, mainly in Africa and in the Caribbean. \nThe recent constitutional amendment, blocking federal state budget increases for two decades, undoubtedly ensures that this trend is not ephemeral. \nCumbersome presidency UpFront - Dilma Rousseff on her regrets and legacy (3:27) Most importantly, it should be noted that a fundamental drive of Brazil's diplomacy is its president. Therefore, any turbulence in the President's Office - or merely having someone that simply has no inclination to pursue proactive international policy-making such as former President Rousseff - directly affects Brazil's positioning in the world. \nTherefore, it is not difficult to understand that a president who takes office through an impeachment process - like President Michel Temer did - is far from being in a solid position to perform presidential diplomacy with a global perspective. \nOn the contrary, the constant necessity of simply managing his political position domestically - as a consequence of a very disputed and polarising impeachment process - apprehends much more of his attention and concerns than any international aspiration. \nThis situation structurally suppresses Brazil's ability to pursue a more relevant political objective in its international relations. \nOPINION: The hidden force of current international uneasiness \nConsequently, a country that was once able to pursue a very proactive foreign policy - for instance, brokering, alongside Turkey, a nuclear deal with Iran, or fostering a polycentric world with BRICS countries, engaged in the conception of an alternative international financial architecture with the creation of the New Development Bank - is now unable to deal effectively with pressing crises in its neighbourhood, such as the one in Venezuela or in Haiti.\nIt is hardly believable that Brazil is going to recreate the necessary circumstances to pursue a prominent role in the international arena before having a new president in 2019. \nOnly someone assuming the presidential office directly through the popular vote can possibly ease political tensions in Brasilia, bring some predictability to the economy and, by its turn, set the conditions to project Brazil's international influence. \nUntil then, unfortunately for the whole world, Brazil will simply remain adrift in the turbulent waters that are in the horizon of international politics. \nRamon Blanco is a researcher and professor of international relations at the Federal University of Latin-American Integration (Brazil). \nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:34:31.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
