Several parts of Accra have lately witnessed erratic power supply, which, in some instances, last for days. But the ECG says measures are being put in place to ensure that the problems accounting for the outages are solved. Speaking in an interview with Chief Jerry Forson, host of Ghana Yensom, on Accra100.5FM on Friday, 24 February, Mr Asante said: “We have some distribution and transmission challenges at the moment. The distribution has to do with the ECG and the transmission of the power to ECG is the work of GRIDCo, but there are some challenges we are fixing to ensure that outages stop.” “By the first week of March that level of outages we are experiencing at the moment will stop.” Related Articles:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:00:02.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
