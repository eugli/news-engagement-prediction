It was basically crying out for help,” Laga’aia said. \nThe pair couldn’t disguise their mirth as Malkah woke from her nap, confused at the situation. \n“What’s happening? It’s really hot … I think my bed’s broken,” she said. \n“I’ve broken beds before, but that’s when I was younger and much more energetic and there was more than one person on the bed,” the former fiance to billionaire James Packer quipped. \nThe incident was hotly discussed on social media — and while some found it funny, others suggested that Malkah, now much larger than during her 90s heyday, was set up: \nIn an opinion piece published on news.com.au last week, writer Melanie Tait called for an end to what she describes as fat-shaming of Malkah by both her fellow campmates and those watching the show. \n“Since being in the jungle, she’s been getting tasks and camera angles designed to exploit her weight, and she pulls through it all with a smile and a bravery I don’t know many of us who could muster,” writes Tait. \n“She’s obviously an incredibly strong woman who’s pulled herself out of the roughest of times. We should be celebrating her, not wanting to pull her down again. She’s resilience personified.” \nIt’s not the first time Malkah’s been the topic of whispered conversation around camp — last week, Pollard and beauty queen Tegan Martin were filmed discussing the 43-year-old’s relaxed attitude towards her body. \n“She just walks around with no clothes on sometimes! I wouldn’t walk around with no clothes on,” said Martin. \n“That doesn’t mean you’re confident … sometimes it’s a bit rude. We don’t want to see it, do we? It’s a bit of decorum, I would say,” said Pollard, who described Malkah in a to-camera interview as a “very unusual creature.” \nOne week in, tensions are rising on the set of the reality show, with American sitcom star Tom Arnold last night railing against the extreme rationing of food. \n“Give us something to f***ing eat,” Arnold yelled . “Feed us something so you can get up out of bed and stand up.” More Local News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:29:33.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
