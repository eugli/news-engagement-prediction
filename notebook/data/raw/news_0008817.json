Today's top news stories - February 1 \nLeonard Casley plans to abdicate his sovereignty of Hutt River Province on February 11, handing the crown to his youngest son Prince Graeme, whose current titles include Minister of State and Education, and Grand Master of the Order of Wisdom and Learning. \nHutt River Province is a privately-owned 75sq/km wheat property north of Geraldton, that received an official nod in a letter from Queen Elizabeth II last year on its 46th anniversary. \nThe tourist attraction has even printed its own postage stamps and currency. Prince Casley. Source: WA News \nPrince Casley seceded from Australia after a row over low wheat production quotas in 1970, but it has never been recognised by the government and is subject to state and commonwealth laws. \nPrince Casley said being the sovereign for more than half of his life had been rewarding at times and difficult at others, and his health had been going downhill for some time. \n\"I feel that it is time to hand over at a time when I am still around and thus able to offer help and support to my successor as he settles in to the position,\" he said in a statement. \nWhen asked why the reigning monarch had bucked the royal tradition of passing on power to the eldest offspring, Prince Graeme joked he believed he was his father's favourite - just don't tell the others. \n\"We have a crown council of three members, so the sovereign puts in a nomination who they believe would be a good candidate,\" he told ABC radio. \nHe said his father was suffering shortness of breath from emphysema, but was still energetic most days to welcome visitors and tend his vegetable garden. \nThe enthronement of Prince Graeme will take place in a chapel named after his mother Princess Shirley, who died in 2013 surrounded by her family, sparking a 12-day period of mourning that ended on her birthday. \nThe 84-year-old raised seven children, was grandmother to 22 and a great grandmother to more than 30. \nPrince Graeme, 60, said he was ready to rule and was excited by the prospect of improving relations with the state and commonwealth. \nWhile the wheat quotas issue prompted his father to consider secession, his mind was made up after the Court government introduced the Kewdale Lands Development Act in 1966 under which any land outside the metropolitan area could be resumed without the governor needing to be notified. \n\"That was the real catalyst and they've never actually challenged (the secession),\" Prince Graeme said. \n\"We have all these other incidental discussions. \n\"I will be trying to bring about a more harmonious relationship with our closest neighbour Australia and the West Australian government.\" \nThe federal government had sought to pursue some $1.5 million in GST, but the province didn't believe it had to pay because it does not charge the tax, he said.
