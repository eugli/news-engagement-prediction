However, observers are also worried that under the defence of counterterrorism crusade, India can increase its military pressure on Pakistan, thus risking escalating tension between the two countries,” the nationalistic tabloid Global Times, often known to publish articles critical of India, said in an editorial on Thursday.

India can work more to bring all the parties to reach a consensus over the issue instead of only blaming China for its failed attempts,” it added. \nChina, of course is aware that terrorism is a “burning” issue. \n“China has also set up anti-terror mechanisms with India in this regard. In the future, China will enhance anti-terror cooperation with India but regional peace and stability will always be a priority,” the editorial said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:03.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
