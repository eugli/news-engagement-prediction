Eugene at the base [Credit: AMC] Episode 12 — \"Say Yes\" \nThe group scavenges for supplies; back in Alexandria, someone must make a morally challenging decision. \nDespite all the goings on it looks like scavenging for supplies is still one of the main dramas of being an apocalypse survivor, especially when you're still supposed to give up 50% of your haul to a vicious overlord! The Alexandria plot will also be very intriguing, over the past seven seasons there have been many moments which have morally challenged the team — can't wait to find out what happens here. Episode 13 — \"Bury Me Here\" \nThings do not go as planned when a group of Kingdommers delivers goods to the Saviors during a routine supply drop-off. \nIt looks like Episode 13 might be somewhat of a blood bath, given that a supply drop off with the Saviors going awry usually results in violence. While it's still three episodes before the season finale, Episode 13 could well be the episode which kicks the season into high gear before what is, hopefully, a dramatic finale. \nIf you're a Walking Dead super fan, be sure to check out \"Becoming: A Zombie from The Walking Dead,\" where Chris Villain, a cosplay super star, will transform himself and become a zombie from The Walking Dead. You can catch it live on Super News By Movie Pilot at Thursday 1pm PST \nThe Walking Dead returns with Episode 9, \"Rock in the Road\" on February 12.
