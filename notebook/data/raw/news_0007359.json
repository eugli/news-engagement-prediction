The OLC memo , released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from POLITICO, follows the boilerplate format for signing off on executive orders. It does not include any discussion of legal issues that the office considered when reviewing the draft.\n“The Office of Legal Counsel’s form-and-legality paperwork includes a short description of some of the provisions of the proposed executive order and memorializes the conclusion that the proposed order is approved with respect to form and legality,\" the Justice Department said. \"As is generally the case under the Office’s longstanding practice, however, it does not identify or contain substantive analysis of issues that were evaluated in the course of the review.”\nThe White House pointed to OLC's review when defending the controversial executive order this weekend. On Monday, then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, emphasized that her decision to order government lawyers not to defend the travel ban considered factors that OLC could not, specifically statements from Trump and his associates that could reveal the executive order's purpose.\nDistrust in Trump’s White House spurs leaks, confusion By Josh Dawsey , Tara Palmeri , Eli Stokols and Shane Goldmacher\n“OLC’s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC’s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted,” Yates said. “Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order’s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.”\nDana Boente, who succeeded Yates after Trump fired her on Monday, cited OLC's analysis \"which found the Executive Order both lawful on its face and properly drafted,\" when reversing Yates and directing the department to defend Trump's order.\nThe travel ban caused chaos at airports across the country last weekend and was soon partially blocked by federal judges in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington and California. The states of Washington and Virginia have moved to join lawsuits opposing the order.\nAn executive order from 1962 requires the White House to submit draft executive orders and proclamations to the Justice Department to check their legality.", "external_links": ["https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11030.html"], "published": "2017-02-02T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:10:45.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
