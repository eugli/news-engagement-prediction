On the right, she's makeup-free, with red patches covering almost half of her face.\nCarys has eczema, a chronic condition marked by patches of dry, itchy skin. Although she's been dealing with it her entire life, she was suffering from one of her worst facial flare-ups yet when she decided to take the photo pictured above. \"I was close to tears, and I usually try and post about things I struggle with, so I decided to post about it,\" she says.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below While her flare-ups can be unpredictable ‚Äî \"the hardest part is finding out what is causing the flare up at that time and then eliminating it from my lifestyle,\" she says ‚Äî Carys noticed this one when she came out of the shower one morning after sleeping with traces of mascara on her lashes due to haphazard makeup removal.\nRegardless of whether her skin is acting out, which can make her feel self-conscious, the condition affects Carys's daily life. She has to moisturize her entire body at least twice a day, use special products prescribed by her doctor, splurge on special makeup designed for sensitive skin, and be extra careful to avoid wearing clothes that can potentially irritate her. She's on a long-term steroid treatment to keep things under control and relies on a strong topical steroid treatment to sooth flare-ups, even though it can ultimately thin and damage her skin.\nAlthough Carys knows that opening up about her eczema won't cure her condition, she was moved by the number of people who responded to her post as it's proof she's not the only one who struggles with this sort of thing. Her best advice to others going through it: \"Try to embrace your insecurities. Don't allow your skin problem to define who you are or what you are doing with your life,\" she says. It's advice everyone should take to heart, before using filters to hide their imperfections from the world.\nGet all the ~FiTsPiRaTiOn~ directly in your feed.
