Boogie told the media he’s been wanting to play with Anthony Davis for years, that the pair talked about the possibility of teaming up and what a joy it is to be in New Orleans. He also offered up this gem, which is just perfection. Reporter: Just how compeditive are you? How much does that go into everything you do? Cousins: About 17 technicals worth. If technical fouls are the measure of competitiveness (and who’s to argue with Boogie?) then he’s one of the fiercest competitors in the league. He’s led the league in techs since 2013 , and the only season he hasn’t ranked in the Top 10 was his rookie year. Congrats Pelicans. This is going to be fun.
