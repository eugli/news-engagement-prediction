We didn’t get overexcited,” said Kohli in the post-match presentation ceremony. \nKohli was the Man of the Match for his 204 in the first innings that helped India post a massive 687 for six declared. He became the first batsman to hit double centuries in four consecutive Test series. \n“It was a good wicket to bat on, good toss to win, putting massive runs on the board helps. Bangladesh batted well in the first innings, the plan was to get into good habits and we have a big series coming up as well and the bowlers got into their rhythm,” he added. \nWhile Indian spinners — Ravichandran Ashwin (4/73) and Ravindra Jadeja 4/78) — were once again the chief destroyers, Indian pacers Ishant Sharma (2/40) and Umesh Yadav, who bowled at an economy rate of 2.75 in the second innings, also impressed, troubling the Bangladesh batsmen with reverse swing and short-pitched bowling. \n“Ishant’s spell was outstanding, coming with a soft ball, reversing it at pace. If we have two world-class spinners in the side, you can tell the fast bowlers to come in and attack and the partnership between them and the spinners is great. Umesh was a revelation really,” said Kohli. \nAbout his own form, Kohli, who achieved the feat of scoring the most runs by an Indian batsman in a home season, said his plan is not to over-attack. “I just go into each game with a fresh mind, try to be aggressive, but not over-attack. I’m very comfortable with where my batting is,” said Kohli. \nIndia coach Anil Kumble also praised the efforts of the team, stating that the mentality of the team is to just go out and win matches \n“I am really pleased that the players are not looking at the surface and they just go out there and win Test matches,” Kumble told after the win. \nIndia will now take on Australia in a four-match Test series starting in Pune on February 23. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:55.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
