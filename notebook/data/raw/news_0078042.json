We tried to be absolutely ready for the first second but, obviously, we tried not enough, with the wrong tools or whatever. The first goal looked like a friendly game -- a player down, a throw in, a header and one pass.\" \nThe Liverpool manager added: \"For us, it's very important to say we cannot blame anybody else for this performance -- it's only our responsibility. \n\"The job we have to do is react again on it and react and react and react because what happened tonight has happened too often this season already. \n\"Everybody who follows us the whole year knows how good we can be, so that makes even worse to accept.\" Jurgen Klopp expresses his disappointment with Liverpool's lacklustre performance in their 3-1 loss to Leicester. \nKlopp was then asked whether some of his players were not as good as he initially thought, with Liverpool seemingly going from title contenders to a side struggling to finish in the top four within a matter of months. \nThe Reds boss dismissed that idea, but did say that everybody at the club is always fighting for their futures. \n\"We all play, myself involved, for our futures,\" he said. \"We get judged everyday, especially on matchdays. \n\"Of course performances have influence on these things -- that's how it is. I don't think they are not as good as I thought they are but I think they need my help more to show it every week. \n\"When we lose, I feel responsible because I am responsible. All what I say now, I hope I used the word 'we' and not 'they' or 'the players.' I'm involved in this. \n\"It's not the moment to make assessments like this, especially not in public. But to say the truth -- and I try to say it as often as possible -- bad performances doesn't help anybody. That's clear.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.
