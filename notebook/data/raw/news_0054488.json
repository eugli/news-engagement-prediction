If you ask me I will rather say there is hope for MMM if only MMM participants can turn up when called upon. \n“ Lots of measures are being implemented for participants to get their 2016 mavro and one of these measures is active PHing ( providing help) and inviting new members. And as for latest development, all 2017 mavro can be easily GHed ( Get help) without any limit but the 2016 mavro are saved in participants various PO and they continue to grow even though their withdrawal is under limit. \n“The faster the community will progress, the higher withdrawal limits will be expanded and the present limit will subsequently be lifted,” he said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:00:06.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
