Making my way through the maze of people, I nearly knocked over an open box of takeout that was balancing on a man’s hand. When I sat down across from him, I realized he was asleep. He appeared to be in his late 20s, wore baggy sweatpants with small cannabis plant symbols and looked comfortable and cool in his Air Jordans and baseball cap. As his head hung to the side, the foam container in his hand cracked and squeaked. It started to tilt to the left. A few people turned to look at him. Some rice began to fall from the box: first a few grains, then a few more. The people near the man looked at him, then at one another, then back at him. A lump of rice fell to the floor. The man kept sleeping. At what point were we to wake him? Just as the big, juicy pieces of meat in the box were about to shift over the edge and onto the floor, he woke up. He lifted the container’s lid and saved the rest of the meal from cascading down. Then he sat upright, looking blasé. Everyone looked away. When the train stopped at 34th Street, he got up and walked out, container in hand. The rice was there on the floor. \nRead all recent entries and our submissions guidelines .
