The zoo's grant from the City of Saint John was slashed Monday. (Connell Smith)\nIn recent years, the zoo has struggled financially, relying on city funding to operate.\nLast year, the zoo received $50,000 from the city and $60,000 the year before that, Martha McDevitt, executive director for the zoo, said on Information Morning Saint John on Monday.\nShe said money expected from council had already been calculated into its budget.\n\"It's definitely something we had needed this time of year,\" she said.\n\"It's a low season for the zoo.\"\nShe said council's decision \"makes it a lot harder.\"\n\"[But] I don't plan on going anywhere,\" she said.\nIn the past, the city has taken property taxes out of the funds granted to the zoo, she said.\nThe motion passed by a 6-3 vote with councillors Gary Sullivan, Greg Norton and Ray Strowbridge voting against. It calls for a second round of funding with $50,000 set aside.\nA spokesperson for the committee said nothing prevents an organization from reapplying during the second round.\nCherry Brook Zoo cuts brings uproar Mayor Don Darling said denying grant requests is never easy but operating funds for community groups were never a guarantee. (Joseph Tunney/CBC)\nSullivan campaigned for council members not to approve the recommendations during the opening comments of the meeting.\nHe later called into question how quickly McAlary and Coun. David Merrithew, who sat on the nomination board that decided the makeup of the community grants committee, nominated themselves after it was announced PRUDE Inc. and the zoo were added to the potential cuts.\n\"I demand an apology,\" said Merrithew.\n\"That takes the integrity of myself and the deputy mayor into question. I will not allow it in this session.\"\nDarling then brought up that a call for councillors to join the committee went out, which Sullivan hadn't responded to.\nSullivan apologized for the direct comment but said there wasn't enough time given between the call for councillors to join and the formation of the committee.\nComparisons to Moncton Sullivan also butted heads with Darling, saying Moncton is growing faster than Saint John despite providing more funding for its service organizations.\n\"Moncton funded their zoo $867,000 in 2015,\" he said. \"Boy, Moncton must be doing something wrong.\n\"The only thing we have done like this progressive, successful city is increase our own salaries.\n\"This is not my Saint John.\"\nDarling said Sullivan hadn't provided enough context as to why the cities were growing at different rates and suggested he \"put some facts on the table.\"\n\"We'll just move on,\" Darling said.\nWith files from Information Morning Saint John", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:48:19.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
