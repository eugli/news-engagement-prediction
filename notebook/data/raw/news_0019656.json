Now it looks like the Belgian striker could be set to leave at last. \nLukaku joined the Toffees from Chelsea, initially on loan, in 2013. That was after Jose Mourinho didn't think that the Belgian could break into the first team, not long after he missed a penalty in the UEFA Super Cup that cost Chelsea the match in a shoot-out. \nHe had not long spent a season on loan at West Bromwich Albion where he scored 17 goals and he soon set about proving that he was Premier League quality by bagging another 15 goals in the league. \nCheck out our video on what could have been for Chelsea: \nSince then his stock has only continued to rise and his four goals last weekend against Bournemouth made him the Premier League's top scorer this season on 16, one ahead of Diego Costa, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez! \nBut that will just increase the inevitability of a bigger club becoming interested and according to The Times that all coincides with Lukaku not signing an extension to his deal. And the new contract has been on the table since August! \nThe 23 year old's deal ends in 2019 so at the moment Ronald Koeman's team are in no rush to sell him but the striker's agent, Mino Raiola, did say in December that his client was close to signing the new deal in December and it's yet to happen. \nThe deal was first offered to the striker by the club in August but two transfer windows have gone by and half a season without Lukaku putting pen to paper and it's looking less likely that he will extend his stay in Liverpool. \nIn the past Lukaku has been linked with a return to Stamford Bridge whilst the likes of Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Barcelona have also been suggested. \nThe Belgian could attract offers of up to Â£70 million considering today's market and a lack of truly world class strikers available. \nWill he leave Everton at the end of the season?
