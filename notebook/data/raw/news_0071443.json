If they can reach a principled compromise that helps create jobs in the US and drives a new business model and if the President can politically sell this to his constituency, the two countries may have a solution to the prospective controversial issue,\" Roemer told ET in an exclusive chat here on Wednesday. \n\nRoemer is currently co-leading one of the biggest US Congressional delegations to India. He recalled that the issue of the contribution of Indian professionals towards the American economy was raised smartly by the PM when the delegation met Modi on Tuesday. \n\n\"Modi was committed to the issue of Indian professionals when he met the Congressmen. He referred to the American values where innovation plays an important role. And creating innovation means bringing talents from outside borders... The issue will certainly be raised by the Indian PM when he meets the US President,\" said Roemer. \n\nRoemer underlined the fact that India would be a priority for the Trump administration amid global uncertainty and the US Congressional delegation, comprising both the Republicans and Democrats, would expand the already deepening strategic partnership. \"There is a bipartisan support in the US Congress in favour of deeper strategic and close relations with India.\" \n\nRoemer noted: \"India is a problem-solver country. From climate change to counter-terror to peace-keeping to Afghanistan, India is a problem-solver country amid rising China, situation in parts of the Middle East and threats from countries like North Korea . President Trump will increasingly look for a country like India which helps USA. And India fits the module.\" \n\nThe former envoy listed many factors that would strengthen Indo-US ties under Trump â€” common concerns on China, threats from international terrorism, America's possible reset with Russia (as India also has wide-ranging ties with Moscow) and common characteristics between Modi and Trump. \"There could be a possibility of winwin situation in economic and business partnership.\" \n\nRoemer, who had served in the 9/11commission and played a key role in developing Indo-US counter-terror partnership after the Mumbai attacks, suggested that Washington could encourage Delhi to play a regional role in countering terror amid Trump's focus on fighting the ISIS. The two countries can further explore ways to expand maritime and cyber security cooperation. Roemer, who also met the NSA, is understood to have discussed ways to expand Indo-US security partnership. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:02:41.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
