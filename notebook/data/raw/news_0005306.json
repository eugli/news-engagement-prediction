Credit: PA Portugal's Supreme Court has said his allegations are covered under freedom of expression laws and were not abusive.\nThe ruling means a book by Mr Amaral, which mentions the claims and was previously removed from sale, can now be sold once again.\nMadelaine went missing in 2007 and despite years of extensive searches, international police help and forensic work, no trace of her has been found.\nLast updated Tue 31 Jan 2017 Leicestershire East Midlands", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:05:54.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
