The incident happened sometime this year on 6th Street in Austin, Texas. The video shows one group of women getting into a verbal spat with another group of women, and then the two factions squaring off in a physical fight. A group of scantily-clad women were recently filmed getting into a fight in the streets of Austin, Texas Punch drunk: One of the women, seen in a white t-shirt and jeans, appeared to be drunk As the two groups of women came to blows, some of their dresses started slipping down It's unclear what caused the fight to break out. The video was posted online by a witness As the two groups of women exchange hits, several of the womens' short dresses begin riding up or falling down, exposing themselves to the passing partiers on the street. Eventually, police intervene, with one officer spraying a cluster of the girls with pepper spray. One of the women was temporarily stunned by the stinging spray, but was so determined that she eventually picked up right where she left off at and started hitting her foe once again. Brawl for all: At one point, the women fall to the ground, but they keep fighting Quite a show: While the group continues to fight, a crowd around them forms The girl above's dress came completely down as she was trying to fight the other girls Eventually, police intervene, with one officer spraying a cluster of the girls with pepper spray Undeterred: The pepper spray temporarily stunned the girl in the white t-shirt, but she was quickly back to hitting her foe a moment later It was while police were trying to untangle the two women on the ground, that a male passerby crouched down and tried to take a photo with the chaos in the background. Police quickly shooed the gawker away though and went back to focusing on quelling the fight. The clip ends with police leading several of the women away in handcuffs. Big fan: At one point, a passerby got down on one knee to pose for a picture with the fighting women in the background But police officers quickly intervened and pushed the young man back to the sidelines The clip ends with the officers taking several of the women away from the scene in handcuffs The woman above appears to be reeling from the pepper spray that was unleashed on the group Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:33:25.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
