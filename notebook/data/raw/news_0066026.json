Coco Champagne Lounge debuted earlier this week with a private party. Today they readied for their first weekend open at 23 W. Hubbard St. It’s gunning for a more mature River North nightlife experience, and they’re stressing they’re not a club. There’s a full menu until 10 p.m. daily, with shareable plates like mini lobster rolls, bison tartare, and a grilled king crab salad. There’s also a decadent item called the crispy egg It’s soft boiled and fried, breaded and topped with caviar. Dion Jumapao—who has worked at Embeya in the West Loop, Nico Osteria in Gold Coast, and Virgin Hotels Chicago in the Loop—is serving as chef and manager. “It’s a contemporary American menu,” Jumapao said. “There’s a lot of Asian flavors, but with French technique.” Ashok Selvam Management describes the space as French inspired, with Eiffel Tower references throughout the decor. They’ve gone for sleek and sexy with a barrage of champagne available by the glass or bottle, as well as sparkling cocktails. After 10 p.m., the lights will dim to set the mood for DJs and dancing. It’s not the same chill vibe as Pops For Champagne has provided River North for years. The space then will almost exclusively morph to bottle service. Ashok Selvam There’s three bars, and a private whiskey/scotch room named after Louis XIII. There’s also a members-only basement lounge. Talk to the membership coordinator to gain access and entry to the upper floors after construction completes. There’s big plans for the second, third, and fourth floors, but Jumapao and Co. aren’t ready to divulge. “You need to meet certainly qualification and then be invited to be introduced,” Jumapao said of those interested in membership. Several Lamborghinis were parked in front of the bar earlier this week when friends and family got their first taste of the space. That’s the kind of scene ownership wants: Fast, furious and interested in the finer things in life. Coco Champagne Lounge , 23 W. Hubbard St., open 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Sunday through Friday; 4 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday. 23 W.
