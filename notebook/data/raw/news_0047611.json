Varun will soon be seen in David Dhawan's 'Judwaa 2'. \nMumbai: Govinda has been in the mood to indulge in some serious candour and blunt revelations. The actor, who’s been gearing up for the release of his upcoming film, ‘Aa Gaya Hero,’ had spoken quite bluntly about his feelings on the likes of David Dhawan, Karan Johar and Salman Khan. \nAnd now the veteran actor has sarcastically hit out at Varun Dhawan. \nVarun, son of director David Dhawan, who’s collaborated with Govinda a whopping 17 times, has often been hailed as a worthy successor to Govinda by industry insiders and fans. \nHowever Govinda hasn’t taken to the comparison warmly. \n\"How can he (Varun) be like me? To become Govinda, he needs to be innocent, uneducated and a poor village boy. Varun is already a son of a director. In the last six years, he hasn’t done more than two films with his father, whereas I did 17 films with his father (David Dhawan),\" DNA quoted the actor as saying. \nVarun himself has often made his love for the actor's work vocally evident. \nAnd Varun, who’ll soon be seen alongside Alia Bhatt in Sashank Khaitan’s ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania,’ took the jibe on his stride sportingly enough. \n\"There should be criticism. I learn a lot from criticism. He says there is no similarity between him and me which is right. There cannot be similarities. He is a senior actor and I respect him. I will never be able to match up to him.\" He said. \nIncidentally, Varun will be seen collaborating with father David Dhawan on ‘Judwaa 2’.
