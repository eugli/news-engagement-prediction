She told the DailyMail.com her mother was 'frightened' about the possible backlash at first, but ended up being touched by her daughter's gesture.\nKhavari, who has an Iranian passport, has spoken out against Donald Trump , including his measures affecting Muslim people. The president's travel ban closes US doors to travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran.\nScroll down for video\nStrong stance: Big Little Lies actress Kathreen Khavari used her outfit to send a powerful message against Donald Trump's travel ban at the show's premiere Tuesday night\nMother-daughter duo: The actress cited her mother (pictured with her in a previous Instagram snap) as an example of why immigrants should not be banned from the United States\nThe actress' strong stance against Trump's travel ban came while the measure remained temporarily blocked. The administration, however, has appealed to have the ban reinstated.\nNicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley also attended the premiere of HBO's Big Little Lies, which will premiere next week.\n'I decided to wear the dress because since Trump's inauguration, I've seen him implement dangerous policies and hand over power to dangerous people (see: Steve Bannon),' Khavari told the DailyMail.com.\n'He's not making our country or this world better, it's getting worse by the second.'\nStar-studded cast: Laura Dern, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Reese Witherspoon (from left to right) also attended the premiere on Tuesday night\nOne of her Instagram posts, in which Khavari shared a picture of her own outfit, read: 'Last night's red carpet look brought to you by the threat of a fascist America.'\n'[Shouthout] to @me m for teaching me that acrylic paint looks great on clothes. Thanks to all the friends and family who encouraged the message & look, and to @alanaoyam who first planted the seed in my head to put my platform to good use.'\nKhavari previously shared an archive picture of her parents in Scotland, when they were about to emigrate to the US. Her mother was pregnant with her when the photo was taken.\n'Initially my mom was frightened about me wearing [the dress] to such an event,' Khavari said. 'She was afraid of the backlash. But I had to do it. We can't allow ourselves to be scared into silence. Later when she saw the whole dress (I didn't show it to her until I was at the premiere), she was really touched.'\nEmigrating: Khavari previously shared this picture of her parents in Scotland, as they were about to move to the US. Her mother was pregnant with her at the time\nSending a message: The actress has spoken out against Donald Trump, including when it comes to the president's policies that target Muslims\nPassport photo: Khavari once posted this picture of her Iranian passport on Instagram, explaining that Golbarg wasn't her first name but had been picked for the document\nThe actress, who plays Samantha in HBO's Big Little Lies, also posted a tender snap of herself with her mother last year, wishing her a happy birthday and paying tribute to 'the lady who took my dad out of town during Senior Prom so that I could go with my boyfriend and have a house party without pops knowing.'\nHer career has seen her explore the theme of cultural identity in the past. In an online short film, Khavari played a woman who watches counter-terrorism-themed Homeland, only to dream that she has become a terrorist, sending her mind into panic.\nAll grown up: Woodley, 25, plays a single mother in HBO's new show, which is set to premiere next week and focuses on three mothers of first-graders\nReunited: Zoe Kravitz, who starred with Woodley in the Divergent movie series, plays the new wife of Witherspoon's character in Big Little Lies\nTwinning: Witherspoon's daughter Ava (right) attended Tuesday night's premiere along with her mother, who plays one of the three leading roles in the show\nThe actress said at the time that her previous agent would only send her out to audition for terrorist parts, including one that involved playing a terrorist staying undercover as a prostitute.\nShe decided that if she wanted to play more diverse roles, the only way to do so was to cast herself - and that's how she ended up playing 11 different characters in the short movie.\n'While I gave myself a chance to play, I also intended to show the world that identity is shaped by so much more than ethnic origin or the country in which one’s parents were born,' she wrote for the Huffington Post in 2014.\n'Identity is complex, fluid, and can be ever-changing. Pigeon-holing a person or a group of people is not only damaging to humanity, but it’s beyond boring. Hopefully we’ll figure that out eventually.'", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/kathreenkhavari/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathreen-khavari/homeland-satire_b_4746410.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-09T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:36:46.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
