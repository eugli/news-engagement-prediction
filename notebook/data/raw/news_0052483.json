It’s generally going to cloudy, breezy, probably showers at times and dull but getting two sunny mild spring-like days in a row this time of the year in February is quite uncommon.” \nIt’s unlikely a weather record will be set Tuesday. The high is expected to reach 12 C, 2.4 degrees lower than the record set in 1997. It’s likely a record will fall Wednesday with the temperature possibly rising to 17 C. Even if it doesn’t, all it has to do is rise above the record of 9.1 C set in 1981. \nIf it does hit 17 C, Kuhn said it would be extremely rare. \n“That is going to be very close to the warmest all-time reading ever recorded in the London-area for February. This is a day I remember well, it was Feb. 26, 2000 when temperatures in London reached 17.8 C and we do have a shot at getting that at this point.” \nKuhn said some forecasts even suggest it’s possible, but not likely, the mercury could hit 18 C on Wednesday. \nLondoners could be forgiven if they think spring has come early, it doesn’t officially arrive until March 20. \nDouble-digit highs are possible all week with a high of 12 C expected on Thursday and 11 C on Friday. \nIt will cool off dramatically for the weekend with a high of 3 C on Saturday and -2 C on Sunday. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
