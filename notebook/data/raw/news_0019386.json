(Associated Press) Maura Dolan and Jaweed Kaleem at 3 p.m. Pacific time. \nA three-judge panel will grill lawyers for the Trump administration and the states of Washington and Minnesota, which challenged Trump’s executive order. Each side has been allotted 30 minutes. \nA ruling in State of Washington & State of Minnesota v. Trump, Case #17-35105, is not expected Tuesday but probably will come later this week. \nJudge Michelle T. Friedland, an Obama appointee, will preside over the hearing. Also on the panel are are William C. Canby, Jr., a Carter appointee, and Richard R. Clifton, appointed by George W. Bush. \nU.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order Friday against Trump’s controversial Jan. 27 order that suspended entry to the U.S. for immigrants from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Libya, all primarily Muslim countries. The order also temporarily barred resettlement of refugees in the U.S. \nThe Justice Department quickly asked the 9th Circuit to lift the hold and put the ban back in place. \nThe states are challenging the constitutionality of Trump’s order, arguing it was motivated by animus to Muslims and would hurt their economies and universities. Government lawyers counter that the moratorium was not aimed at any particular religion but at nations associated with terrorism. \nThe 9th Circuit at this stage will not be deciding the key constitutional issues in the case. \nInstead, the panel will determine only whether the court order against enforcement of the ban should continue until the complex legal debate over executive power and due process is resolved. \nTo justify such an order, a judge must find that there would be irreparable harm if it were not issued. Judge Robart went a step further, and also found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge. \nBut many of the questions the 9th Circuit must resolve are more mundane. \nDid the states have standing to sue? To be able to sue in federal court, an individual or state must show evidence of direct harm. \nThe Trump administration contends the potential harm cited by the states —business loss, reduced tax revenue and disruption of higher education—are merely speculative. \nAnother technical matter is whether a temporary restraining order can even be appealed in federal court. The states argue that Trump can not challenge a temporary block on his order until later in the proceedings. \nIf the 9th Circuit upholds the restraining order, the administration can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Once the legality of the hold is resolved, the case would return to Judge Robart in Seattle. \nRobart, a Republican, was unanimously confirmed in 2004 after being nominated by former President George W. Bush. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, lauded his appointment. \nPrior to moving to the bench, Robart worked without pay to provide legal services for refugees in the U.S. \nThe judge gained notoriety—and sparked criticism—last year when he remarked in court that “black lives matter” while presiding over a consent degree matter that required Seattle police to address charges of excessive force and bias. \nWashington state Solictior General Noah G. Purcell will argue for the states. \nAugust E. Flentje, Special Counsel to the Assistant U.S. Attorney General of the Civil Division, will represent the Trump Administration.
