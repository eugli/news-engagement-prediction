Not Adam. \nAdam had a plan, though it admittedly involved a bit of Dutch courage. \nNoticing a bouncer guarding the VIP section, Adam explained, \"In my drunken state I edited the band's Wikipedia page to say I was family, and it worked! I got into the roped off VIP area because of it.\" Here's the edit. Adam Boyd's post on Wikipedia (Photo: Adam Boyd/Facebook) \nAdam tweaked The Sherlocks' Wikipedia page so it not only said he was cousin of lead singer Kiaran Crook, but that he was the influence for the band's first single Live for the Moment. \nAdam later revealed that we so close to the band he could \"see their watches\". Here's his VIP view. Adam Boyd's post from VIP (Photo: Adam Boyd/Facebook) \nHe told The Sun , \"I'm usually quite confident with others when I'm drunk, which probably helped in the situation with the bouncer. \n\"From what I can remember, he had the rope going across the door, and refused to let me in, until I explained I was one of the band members' cousins, and obviously he didn't believe that, either. \n\"I was trying to find some way to 'prove' I was family. That's when I ‘remembered’ about being credited on Wikipedia, although I had changed it minutes beforehand, and showed him he and said 'Fair enough' and let me past. \n\"I guess luck was on my side, either that or a gullible bouncer?\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:47:20.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
