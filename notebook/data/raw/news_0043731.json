While we’ve already seen a debut trailer for director Ridley Scott ’s Prometheus follow-up, there’s still quite a bit unknown about this sequel. The title suggests it’s more of an Alien movie rather than a direct sequel to Prometheus , which was the initial plan, but boy is this one hell of a talented (and diverse) cast. \nThe Alien: Covenant image also confirms that yes, James Franco is in this movie alongside Katherine Waterston , Amy Seimetz , Demian Bichir , Danny McBride , Jussie Smollett , Carmen Ejogo , Billy Crudup , and Michael Fassbender . Fassbender reprises his role as David in the film, but he’s also playing a new android presumably aboard the Covenant ship. \nBut that’s not all! Fox has announced that brand new footage from Alien: Covenant will be unveiled this Wednesday night during the third episode of FX’s new series Legion , which has a Fassbender connection in that it’s an X-Men show (albeit a very non-traditional one). \nCheck out the Alien: Covenant cast image below and look for the new TV spot tomorrow night between 10pm and 11pm ET—or better yet just watch Legion , it’s good! Alien: Covenant opens in theaters on May 19th.
