SHARE Homeless numbers show the need for a multi-agency approach, says Clover Moore. Photo: James Brickwood \n\"The number of people sleeping rough across our city highlights the need for multiple agencies across all levels of government to work together to provide safe and secure shelter for all – one of the most fundamental human needs,\" Cr Moore said. \nA collection of 19 agencies including the council, police, state government, women's services, Aboriginal services, drug and alcohol services and health services regularly patrol known hot spots for rough sleepers to check on their welfare and offer accommodation.

We arranged for her to stay at Redfern community centre and flagged her with FaCS.\" \nHigh-level involvement by departments such as Corrective Services would also cover gaps in services, with some prisons better than others in arranging support for inmates on release. \nMany people living on the street have been doing so for years and have substance abuse or mental health problems, but the overall profile is more complicated. \nAbout a third of people who accessed homeless services last year were women and children affected by domestic violence – an increase of 26 per cent on the previous year. \nJust over half of homeless people have been in prison. Just under half have been traumatised, either physically, psychologically, emotionally or sexually. \nAnd while 35 per cent of people on the street would need intensive support for the rest of their lives if they were to move into housing, City of Sydney surveys showed the remaining 65 per cent just needed housing they could afford and some short-term support. \nHomelessness NSW chief executive Katherine McKernan said increasing awareness of domestic violence had prompted many more women and children to leave unsafe situations, but the lack of affordable housing in the community had created a bottleneck in short-term refuges. \n\"The problem is the crisis system is full because there's no longer housing available, so there's a blockage,\" Ms McKernan said. \n\"Women who would normally sort things out for themselves can't afford it, and have to access services.\" \nMinister for Family and Community Services Pru Goward, who participated in the street count on Monday night, said rising house prices contributed to homelessness but poverty was rarely the only driver. \n\"I have a very strong view that nobody becomes a rough sleeper without complexities,\" Ms Goward said. \n\"You can give them housing but I've seen what happens when people don't have their underlying trauma or medications or problems addressed. Even managing housing, unless they're well supported, it becomes difficult.\" \nNSW is constructing 1500 new social housing dwellings, largely funded by the controversial sale of 293 public housing dwellings in Millers Point. \nBut Ms Goward said there were no more plans to sell social housing in high-value areas to buy more stock. \nNeither did she intend to lobby the federal government on changes that might affect housing affordability before the state had explored its own levers, including designated affordable housing in new developments and changes to state taxes.
