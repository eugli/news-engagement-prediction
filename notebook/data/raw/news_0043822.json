Webster and Dr. Wesley L. Harris, ask a compelling question: “What enables African-Americans to remain focused and motivated in a society that does not recognize the contributions of African-Americans?” \nI am driven by and find strength in this question. I remain focused and motivated despite societal challenges because from birth my parents constructed a village that taught me how to look to the past and then to the future. Naeem Turner-Bandele.

People like Alexander Miles who designed the modern elevator . Sarah Boone, who created an improved ironing board . Philip Downing, who designed a switch system for railroads to help guide trains along a track. He also basically invented what we know now as a mailbox. And Marie Van Brittan Brown and her husband, Albert, who invented the home security system . \nThese inventions remain part of our everyday lives, but the stories of these brilliant African-Americans have remained conspicuously absent from mainstream history. In many cases, their stories have been deliberately discarded, perpetuating a false narrative that suggests African Americans cannot and have not contributed anything of value to American society outside of sports and entertainment. In other cases, the absence of these stories in everyday life is simply a byproduct of being African American during a time where there were so few opportunities to claim credit for our work. \nFortunately, I have a village that believes it imperative that I know the concealed history as well as the mainstream history. I cannot overstate the value knowing the concealed history has brought me during my pursuit of a degree in a mostly homogenous discipline. Even when I sit in a class as the sole representative of my racial group, rarely do I feel alone or discouraged. Instead, I am regularly buoyed by the brilliance and perseverance of those who came before me and on whose shoulders I stand. \nThe great African-American scientists and inventors of the past are more than inspirations for me; they are my fuel. Because so many have gone ignored, I know that my success is imperative to bridge the past, present and future. I am determined to shine a light on their accomplishments through my successes. I know that as I succeed, I will be able to tell their story so that they may finally get the recognition they deserve. I owe my African-American predecessors nothing less as they’ve paved the path forward for me. \nRelated: Wesleyan students fight to re-establish focus on African American Studies \nAs a future African-American engineer, I want to do one more thing. I want to do what those who came before me sought to do: improve the human condition. Leave the planet better than it was when we arrived. As such, I do not take my responsibility – today as a student – to be a role model and mentor lightly. I also have no intention of shirking my responsibility after earning my degrees. In fact, my life mission is to create technological products and services that are accessible, affordable, efficient and that meet the needs of all human beings. \nI’m determined to do my part so that the next generation believes like I do that they too can be black and brilliant. Hopefully, by doing my part, I will be remembered if only so that those who came before me will no longer be forgotten, or only considered during Black History Month. \nNaeem Turner-Bandele is a junior at Santa Clara University majoring in electrical engineering.
