It isn’t a pipe dream.\nWhile the East Valley has earned its reputation as the center of gravity for Asian dining in Greater Phoenix, two new Vietnamese restaurants in the West Valley are doing their best to tip the scales.\nPho House and PT Noodles serve the standard template of soup, noodle and rice dishes that have surged into the Valley’s dining mainstream. But they do so at a level that would make them compelling options in Tempe or Chandler, to say nothing of Goodyear and Surprise, where traditional Vietnamese fare is considerably more difficult to locate.\nLongtime fans of the genre should be pleased to have these options on their side of town. And those curious to explore the cuisine couldn’t ask for a more friendly, approachable introduction.\nMORE FROM ARMATO: 3 restaurants attempt to shake up Valley's Chinese cuisine | Top 12 traditional Chinese eateries | Clever Koi brings hip restaurant vibe to Gilbert | Zen Culinary opens in Scottsdale in massive, remodeled space\nPho House Pho for breakfast? Why not? It’s common practice in Vietnam, and Pho House opens at 9:30 a.m. every day.\nPho House Where: 432 N. Litchfield Road, Goodyear.\nDetails: 623-312-2914, facebook.com/phohouseaz .\nHours: 9:30 a.m.-9 p.m. daily.\nName notwithstanding, however, pho isn’t the strongest offering at this tidy and friendly Goodyear restaurant, which debuted in September. Rather, it’s some of the accompanying items that stand out on a menu that will be familiar to diners who make a habit of visiting Vietnamese restaurants.\nIt’s difficult to resist the searing hot crisp of cha gio (three for $3.49, six for $6.99), and those at Pho House blister and shatter with the best of them. Filled with ground pork, glass noodles, mushroom and carrot, these delicately seasoned spring rolls are served in typical fashion, to be wrapped up in lettuce with a sprig of fresh mint and dipped in a dish of sweetened fish sauce.\nCha gio (fried spring rolls with pork, noodles, mushrooms and carrots) with lettuce, mint and fish sauce at Pho House. (Photo: Dominic Armato/The Republic)\nThose who prefer their crispy items in a larger format would do well to sample the banh xeo ($6.99), a plate-size Vietnamese rice crepe turned yellow by a dash of turmeric. Its tender center gives way to a lacy crisp edge, and while the filling could be more generous with its pork and shrimp, this is a solid rendition that does the dish justice.\nIf you can’t bear to visit a pho joint without slurping some soup, the bo kho ($7.99) — a ruddy and fragrant Vietnamese beef stew — is an atypically rich and flavorful specimen. Whether paired with egg noodles, rice noodles or a small baguette, this off-menu special (it’s usually available) is among my favorite versions in town, bold and intense but skillfully balanced.\nBo kho (Vietnamese beef stew) at Pho House. (Photo: Dominic Armato/The Republic)\nA lead-pipe cinch crowd-pleaser, however, is the com bo luc lac ($10.99). Otherwise known as “shaking beef,” this lightly sweet stir-fry of cubed beef and onions is doused with soy and fish sauce and served on a sizzling platter with a side of broken rice. It isn’t the most subtle or sophisticated dish in the repertoire — you’ll hear and smell it before it even leaves the kitchen. But it induces the kind of primal reaction that could be torturous for dining companions who’ve foregone beef.\nDetails: Pho House, 432 N.

But those in Surprise will be pleased to learn that owner Tien Nguyen added a second restaurant in their neck of the woods in November, and he has plans for a third at a to-be-determined location in Glendale later this year.\nPT Noodles Where: 13749 N.

While the seasoning on some dishes doesn’t quite have the vibrant pop that longtime fans of Vietnamese cuisine may crave, it’s fresh and well-prepared and an excellent addition to a part of town where this style of food is hard to find.\nPho dac biet (rice noodle and beef soup with steak, tendon, brisket, tripe and meatballs) at PT Noodles. (Photo: Dominic Armato/The Republic)\nThe pho dac biet ($10) packs a litany of meats into a broth that skews light but is scented with ginger and star anise. It doesn't challenge some of the city’s better bowls, but it clears the bar of being flavorful enough to enjoy without the sledgehammer smash of hoisin or Sriracha. A few torn basil leaves will do nicely.\nGoi ga bap cai ($11) is similarly delicate, almost to a fault, but this salad of tender poached chicken and shredded cabbage is refreshing and light, a worthwhile lead-in to a bolder main dish.\nBroken rice dishes are among the stronger offerings, and if indecision sticks you with the combination com dac biet ($11), you’ll have chosen well. A slice of tender cha trung — a type of steamed pork meatloaf — joins slivered pork skin and a juicy, umami-laden seared pork chop with rice, vegetables and a fried egg.\nCom dac biet (broken rice with pork cake, shredded pork skin, pork chop and fried egg) at PT Noodles. (Photo: Dominic Armato/The Republic)\nWhile its pickled vegetables could use a bit more punch, the banh mi thit nuong ($5) is made with a crisp, fresh baguette that gets the sandwich started off on the right foot even before it’s filled with barbecued pork and a smear of pate and mayonnaise.\nAs with Pho House, one of PT Noodles’ best attributes is that it’s helping bring an increasingly popular style of food to an area where Vietnamese fare is scarce. It’s getting easier for West Valley pho joint veterans to get a fix in their own backyard. And with a little luck, the shorter drive may encourage more neophytes to give Vietnamese food a try.\nBanh mi thit nuong (Vietnamese sandwich with barbecued pork) at PT Noodles.

But for West Valley residents, these are two great places to start. (h/t Stephanie Daigneault)\nDetails: PT Noodles, 13749 N. Litchfield Road, Surprise. 623-322-8399.
