Origin \nIn early August 2016, Tumblr user southern-conservatism posted several pictures of a car with an incorrectly drawn swastika symbol drawn with a key next to the word “fag” on the door (shown below, left). On August 1st, Tumblr user equestrianrepublican [5] reblogged the post along with a picture of Adolf Hitler next to the symbol with the caption “Hale Hortler” (shown below, right). Over the next six months, the post gained over 16,000 notes.

On August 27th, Redditor Gary26 submitted a post titled “Hail Hortler Flag,” featuring the incorrectly drawn swastika on a red background within a white circle (shown below). \nOn November 23rd, 2016, Redditor GrandMasterSubZero submitted a photograph of a television screen displaying a notification that a video game player had been “killed by Hailhortler” (shown below). Within two months, the post garnered upwards of 21,900 points (90% upvoted) and 300 comments on /r/gaming.

[3] Various Examples Sarah Silverman Tweet \nOn February 12th, 2017, comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted a photograph of construction markings, speculating that they were poorly-drawn swastikas (shown below). \nThat day, various Twitter users mocked Silverman’s tweet by sarcastically referring to construction workers as “Nazis” and other innocuous symbols as swastikas (shown below). \nSilverman subsequently posted tweets acknowledging the mistake, citing anti-Semitic messages directed to her and actions of the Trump administration for causing her to assume the markings were Nazi symbols (shown below).
