It's hard to find a movie that has the right balance of both humor and heart. \nI asked myself two questions while considering the movies for this list: Are the films funny enough that both women and men can enjoy them, and is a feel-good love story integral to the plot? The answer to those questions to all these films is \"Yes.\" \nHere are the movies I'd recommend to anyone looking for a few hours of love and laughs. © Universal Studios Home Entertainment 1. 'Love Actually' (2003) \nHugh Grant (no stranger to the romantic comedy genre) plays the newly elected British Prime Minister in this ensemble film with interconnected stories. The Christmas theme doesn't mean this one's just for watching during the holidays. Plus, Love Actually has so many plots that both men and women will find hilarious!

'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' (2002) \nThis little indie grew from a $5 million project into one of the highest grossing romantic comedies of all time -- all because of positive word-of-mouth. It shows what a little help from the audience can do to promote worthy projects. It doesn't hurt that the film was smartly written and featured a top-notch ensemble cast. More » Columbia Pictures 3. 'When Harry Met Sally' (1989) \nBilly Crystal and Meg Ryan are wonderful in this romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of friendships between men and women. Ryan's restaurant scene is one of the most recognizable scenes in movie history. You'll want to have what she's having. 20th Century Fox 4. 'There's Something About Mary' (1998) \nOkay, so it's a little tasteless (after all, it is a Farrelly Brothers movie). But There's Something About Mary is still a hilarious tale of love, jealousy, and persistence. Ben Stiller stars as a shy, yet lovable, loser who never gets over the love of his life, Mary ( Cameron Diaz ). And you'll never look at hair gel the same way after checking out this comedy. Universal Pictures 5. 'Meet the Parents' (2000) \nThis DVD is worth it just for the opportunity to watch Robert De Niro lose it while filming his scenes with Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller . This romantic comedy gem was so well-received, it spawned two sequels: Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers . TriStar Pictures 6. 'As Good As It Gets' (1997) \nHelen Hunt won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a hard-working single mom who is the target of unwanted, obsessive attention from a dysfunctional, anti-social, romance novelist (played by Jack Nicholson in an Oscar-winning performance). With a great supporting cast, including Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr., As Good As It Gets is as good as it gets. New Line Cinema 7. 'The Wedding Singer' (1998) \nThe Wedding Singer is an irresistible romantic comedy, teaming Adam Sandler with Drew Barrymore , and featuring a classic cameo by rocker Billy Idol. Set in the '80s, the film features some of the same music you hoped you'd never hear again, but in this film, it doesn't seem as bad as you remembered. Sandler and Barrymore would later re-team for the less memorable romantic comedies 50 First Dates and Blended . TriStar Pictures 8. 'My Best Friend's Wedding' (1997) \nBest friends Julianne Potter ( Julia Roberts ) and Michael O'Neil (Dermot Mulroney) make a pact to marry if they are still single at age 28. Guess what age Julianne's about to turn? Cameron Diaz co-stars as Michael's fiancée who has the unenviable task of competing with Julianne for Michael's love. 20th Century Fox 9. 'A Life Less Ordinary' (1997) \nEwan McGregor and Cameron Diaz star in A Life Less Ordinary, an incredibly entertaining film that mixes romance, comedy, and karaoke, with angels masquerading as hit men. You may never have heard of this one as it came and went quickly in theaters, but it's worth a look. More » PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 10. 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994) \nAn amazing cast, a tight, intelligent script, and an amusing storyline make Four Weddings and a Funeral a must-see/must-own romantic comedy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:06:05.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
