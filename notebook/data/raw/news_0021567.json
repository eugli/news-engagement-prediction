The Military Times reported: 'Most alarming is the prospect this data has been incomplete since the war on terrorism began in October 2001. 'If that is the case, it would fundamentally undermine confidence in much of what the Pentagon has disclosed about its prosecution of these wars, prompt critics to call into question whether the military sought to mislead the American public, and cast doubt on the competency with which other vital data collection is being performed and publicized.' Airstrikes from AH-64 Apache attack helicopters are unreported by US Central Command's (CENTCOM) data collection The extra airstrikes were not reported in a US Air Force open-source database that is 'relied on by Congress, American allies, military analysts, academic researchers, the media and independent watchdog groups.' An army official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the US is not trying to cover up the number of airstrikes it conducts, saying the military doesn't record bombings from certain aircraft such as from AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. He said: 'It is really weird. We don't track the number of strikes from Apaches, for example.' 'I can tell you, unequivocally, we are not trying to hide the number of strikes. That is just the way it has been tracked in the past. That's what it's always been,' the official, who has knowledge of the US Central Command's (CENTCOM) data collection and reporting practices, added. Despite the official's claims an, Air Force official told Military Times in December that its monthly airpower summary of activity in Iraq and Syria specifically represents the entire US-led coalition 'as a whole, which is all 20-nations and the U.S. branches.' The Air Force's open-source database says it includes all such missions as part of its airstrike totals. The media and others have depended on these figures for years believing they are a comprehensive tally of all American and coalition activity. However no one from the military ever has come forward to clarify that the statistics are wholly incomplete.
