Mr Downer also urged Theresa May to make it easier for Australians to get work visas in Britain as part of any deal 'That can be done with what are called Tier 2 visas but maybe that could be made a little bit easier, I suspect they would be the only sort of changes you´d be looking at.' Any negotiation over visa arrangements could be conducted separately but at the same time as a deal for the free movement of goods and services between the two nations, he suggested.
