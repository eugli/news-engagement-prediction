Jurgen Klopp's side were flying high towards the end of 2016, but the ushering in of a new year has seen the Reds' season fall apart, departing two domestic cup competitions and losing huge amounts of ground in the race for top four. \nSaturday's 2-0 loss away to Hull was yet another nail in the coffin of the Merseyside giants, who have won just once in ten games since a 1-0 victory on New Year's Eve against Manchester City, and things are now looking bleaker than ever. \nIn fact, the display against the Tigers was perhaps the worst yet, encapsulating the passive passing, lack of cutting edge and defensive negligence which has become synonymous with the club during this dreaded ten game spell.

Abel Hernandez may have been putting pressure on the Belgian, but there was still no excuse.

'We have to show a reaction. It's about finding the answer after a defeat that really hurts.' \nWell, the pressure is mounting now more than ever. Arsenal, Tottenham and Leicester represent the next three tasks for the Reds and nine points is needed more than ever. \nWho'd have thought a 2-2 draw away at Sunderland would spark such a demise? Klopp's lost his rag, but he now has to mastermind an attitude change and reinstall a winning mentality amongst his players. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
