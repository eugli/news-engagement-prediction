(Bob Levey / Getty Images) Christie D'Zurilla sang on the roof of NRG Stadium in Houston, jumped off and descended to a stage in the middle of the field for her Super Bowl halftime show.\nShe just didn’t do those things at the same time, or even on the same day, despite what some people thought they saw on TV: The rooftop segment was pre-recorded almost a week ahead of time. \nHey, blame it on the weather. \nGaga’s rooftop rendition of a \"God Bless America\"/\"This Land Is Your Land” mashup, which had the 30-year-old singer performing at the edge of the stadium’s open rooftop while red, white and blue drones danced behind her, was filmed Jan. 30, two high-ranking Intel honchos told USA Today . \n“When we talked about Super Bowl, the primary weather issue was if they closed the dome,” said Anil Nanduri, vice president of business. “If I had to simplify it, if you can do fireworks because of weather, so can our drones. … We’ve never had a situation where we can’t fly.” \nGaga, however, clearly could not fly through a roof that was closed due to rain, which was a likelihood in February in Houston. The stunt was edited for TV to appear as if she had made the complete, 260-foot leap in real time. \nAs those fortunate enough to be at the game could see, Gaga descended Sunday from a spot high in the stadium .
