Early in the morning, the 203-pound giant panda sat on her platform under a bare tree and crunched bamboo stalks. It was quiet expect for the chirping of a lone sparrow and the clicking of photographers’ cameras.\nBorn at the National Zoo three and a half years ago, Bao Bao is leaving the only place she’s ever known as home.\n[ Bye bye, Bao Bao ]\n(Claritza Jimenez,Dani Player/The Washington Post)\nThe zoo’s director Dennis Kelly called Tuesday a “really bittersweet day” for the facility.\n“While it represents a huge success, we’ve become so fond of Bao Bao,” he said. “We’re going to miss her so much.”\nThe zoo is closed Tuesday until noon as staff members get ready for the logistics of moving Bao Bao from the zoo to the cargo plane at Dulles International Airport.\nArriving along with the trucks was a crew wearing black jackets that read on the back “FedEx Panda Team.” The passenger seemed to take it all in, as she emerged in the outdoor area of her enclosure around 7:40 a.m.\nAbout 60,000 people visited the zoo over the holiday weekend, officials said. Some came as far away as Scotland just to say their goodbyes and give well wishes to Bao Bao. There were traffic jams throughout the Woodley Park neighborhood as visitors tried to get a last look at the panda.\nAllison Hadley, left, and Grace Benigno, right, visit Bao Bao, a 3-year-old female panda, at the Smithsonian's National Zoo Giant Pandas exhibit on Monday. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post) The panda got a few treats over the last few days including a farewell ice cake made with frozen apple juice, bamboo and biscuits, in the shape of a Chinese pagoda.\n[ The zoo — and Washington — prepares to say goodbye to its ‘miracle’ giant panda ]\nBao Bao’s nonstop flight to Chengdu, China, will involve a team of pilots, a veterinarian and a specialized panda keeper. Also aboard: 50 pounds of snacks and liquids. Her luggage includes bamboo, sweet potatoes, apples, water and sugar cane.\nOnce she lands, she will go into quarantine at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Dujiangyan, Sichuan province.\nMost giant pandas around the world are on loan from China and cubs that are born abroad are sent to the Chinese breeding program before they turn 4 years old. The National Zoo has had pandas since the 1970s.\nBao Bao’s older brother, Tai Shan, moved to China in 2010. The National Zoo still has three other giant pandas, including Bao Bao’s 1-year-old brother, Bei Bei; and their mother Mei Xiang, 18, and father Tian Tian, 19.\nThis spring, the zoo said it plans to breed Mei Xiang and they believe she has at least one more chance to produce a cub.\nOfficials have said Bao Bao is special because she is only the second surviving cub born at the facility. Some keepers have dubbed her the ‘miracle’ giant panda.\nThe panda, whose name means “precious” or “treasure” in Chinese, was born in August 2013. Mei Xiang gave birth to a second cub about 26 hours after her birth but that cub was stillborn.\n[ Dumplings served at National Zoo in honor of Bao Bao ]\nMany of the keepers at the zoo were reflective Tuesday as they helped get Bao Bao ready for her journey.\nBrandie Smith, the zoo’s associate director for animal care sciences, said that after Tai Shan left, no panda cubs were born for several years.\n“A lot of people had given up,” she said. “So Bao Bao to me is the new beginning of the National Zoo’s panda program. This is part of the journey we always expect her to take.”\n“A lot of people expected me to be sad right now,” she said, “but I’m so happy for her and proud of what we accomplished. I feel nothing but joy right now.”\nSome visitors, and even zookeepers, have said they expect to get emotional as Bao Bao leaves the facility where she was born.\nBut for many officials at the zoo, Bao Bao’s departure is not a loss.\n“It’s definitely emotional, and it’s tugging a little bit on me … Unfortunately we have to send her away,” said Pamela Baker-Masson, a spokeswoman for the zoo. But on a high note, she said, the zoo had reached its goal.\n“We achieved conservation success.”", "external_links": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/02-16-2017/t_1487281017302_name_20170216_BaoBaoLeaving_original.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:15:40.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
