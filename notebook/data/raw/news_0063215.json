It took four hours to be put out and one firefighter was sent to hospital for heat exhaustion, but no other casualties were reported, it added. \nMr Reidinger said the company has about 300 employees and \"20 to 30\" of them were likely in the plant when the fire broke out, but he confirmed that no one was hurt in the blaze. \nHe added the other half of the plant was \"undamaged\" and hoped that it can be up \"within the next few days to a week\". (Photo: Noor Farhan) \nThe company is currently investigating the cause of the fire, but it said there were at least \"S$5 million to S$10 million worth of fire safety features in the plant\". \n\"We have a special store for hazardous waste because we are aware it's flammable. We had a segmented storage area separated by firewalls, with sprinklers and other fire protection features like foam, and special drainage features,\" he said. (Photo: Noor Farhan) \nEco Special Waste Management's director, Ms Amy Liu, who was also at the incident site, told Channel NewsAsia that it has about 500 clients, and to minimise business disruptions, are now in talks with five other companies to help service these clients. \nThe company's plant had previously caught fire in May 2012 but the fire was contained in the incinerator and put out in 30 minutes by four fire engines, according to past reports. - CNA/kk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:04:00.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
