It was surreal.” Less than two minutes later, Mr. Holland was on stage with his “Moonlight” family. “I still couldn’t believe we were up there,” said Mr. Holland, speaking by telephone to The Times a half-hour after the ceremony. “It was a ton of people on stage, and I don’t think anyone could believe it.” Afterward, Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting actor for “Moonlight,” said backstage that he had been thrown by the turn of events. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “I just didn’t want to go up there and take anything from somebody, you know?” he said. Mr. Jenkins told Entertainment Tonight that he “could see it in Jordan’s face, that he was speaking the truth,” referring to Mr. Horowitz. “I wanted to feel compassion for him,” Mr. Jenkins said. “I’m pretty sure the first thing I do when I get up onstage is give him a hug because it couldn’t have been easy. But these things happen, you know. They happen.” Later, he posted on Twitter about what Mr. Horowitz had gone through: Jordan Horowitz. Wow. I'm slipping slowly into reflection, perspective. Much respect to that dude — Barry Jenkins (@BandryBarry) Feb. 27, 2017 Mr. Horowitz, who gave up the Oscar in his hand with almost preternatural calm, said he was “sad” in that moment but also savored the fact that “La La Land” won six Oscars during the night. “It was a surreal kind of out-of-body experience,” he said. Referring to awards season events with the “Moonlight” filmmakers and others, he added, “We’ve been on the circuit with them for six months. If that kind of thing has to happen, I’m glad to give it to them.” As Mr. Horowitz spoke, colleagues and others came up to him, hugging him sand saying how gracious he was. Then Adele Romanski, one of the “Moonlight” producers, came up to him, and they gave each other a huge hug. “I got to give a speech and then give you an award,” Mr. Horowitz said.
