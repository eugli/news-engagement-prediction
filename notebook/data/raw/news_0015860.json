Drunken, shirtless dudes were cavorting in the beer gardens. Young women roamed the fields in various stages of undress. \nHad I made a huge mistake bringing Abdullah to Coachella ? \nBorn in Iraq, Abdullah Al-Rifaie is my cousin's son and the first of my... (Lorraine Ali) \nMy pop-culture-obsessed nephew had already missed seeing his favorite metal band by two days when he left in December and, if the ban held, he’d miss them again when they play L.A. next week. “It’s like someone’s trying to keep us apart,” he said. \nEarly Saturday morning it looked as if the most recent restraining order on the travel ban was being honored at most U.S. airports. Abdullah decided to fly in on the return ticket to LAX he’d booked almost a year ago. \nHis lawyer advised him to keep in touch with her every leg of the flight. Once he landed, she instructed him to not sign anything other than the routine customs form. “And if you’re detained for questioning, be cooperative and polite,” she said, “but tell them you also have a lawyer waiting outside at the arrival gate.” \nAs my family, the lawyer and some dedicated friends stood at the international arrival gate at LAX, we overheard an immigration attorney explaining to an Iranian man near us that the woman he was waiting for, a student-visa holder, had been pulled for a secondary interview. \nWhat if Abdullah was detained by customs border agents, or denied entry altogether and sent back? \nMy sister said she felt like she was going to throw up. My other sister said she should aim the other way because she wasn’t about to repeat the same gross scenario that happened in the family station wagon when they were kids. My mom was too preoccupied scanning the arriving travelers to notice her girls were squabbling, again. \nThe lawyer warned us that Abdullah would likely be detained as well, but we just had to be patient. We’d be there a while. \nBut there were signs of hope. One traveler emerged to a greeting of cameras and well-wishers holding balloons and welcome-home signs. \nI suddenly realized, we had no signs or balloons. \nAt a nearby folding table set up as a makeshift office by volunteer immigration lawyers, I borrowed a Sharpee pen and paper to scrawl out a sign: “Abdullah. Metallica Rules! Welcome back.” \nWithin the hour, he miraculously appeared. \nAbdullah Al-Rifaie arrives at LAX during a pause in the Trump administration travel ban.

(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) \nFor the first time since I’ve known him, my young and easygoing nephew appeared worn and nervous. He was sweating and poker faced when he walked out the automatic doors and up the ramp with his luggage. It wasn’t until he saw us in the crowd that he seemed to realize the ordeal was over. \nScreams and tears and hugs, cheers from strangers, cameras flashing, reporters asking questions. He’d made it through, no questions asked. The months of vetting he’d gone through to get his American visa apparently meant something again.
