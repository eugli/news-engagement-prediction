(New York Family via YouTube)   \nParents and teachers have come to the defense of a Manhattan private school principal who said President Trump’s election is worse than 9/11. \nIn a lengthy email to parents last week, Calhoun School Principal Steve Nelson said Trump’s presidency was worse than the terrorist attack that leveled the twin towers, and more devastating to the country than Vietnam, Watergate and the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \n“I walked the complex inner-city streets of Cleveland during the racial unrest of the 60’s,” Calhoun, 70, wrote. “I was in rural Georgia when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Tennessee. I watched every moment of the Watergate hearings that led to the resignation of Richard M. Nixon. I watched soot-covered New Yorkers grimly trudging north on West End Avenue on September 11, 2001. I am more troubled now.” \nThe controversial missive roiled some parents of the elite Upper West Side school, who though Calhoun went too far. \n55% of voters approve of Trump's travel ban, poll shows \nBut some members of the school community said they had the principal’s back. \n“Proud to work at Calhoun and for someone like Steve Nelson,” school staffer Nahuel Fanjul-Arguijo in a Facebook post. \n“Getting this email yesterday made me a very proud Calhoun alumni,” posted Rachel Geisler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:04:10.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
