Afterwards, Bleacher Report tweeted video of the blooper with the words \"DIRK FOREVER.\" \nThis is all very normal for sports Twitter. Players airball shots and sports sites like us write about it because for players like Nowitzki, or LeBron James , errors like these are fairly rare and show that wow, they're human and do miss sometimes. \nHowever, Mavs owner Mark Cuban didn't like it, so he called out Bleacher Report with an angry tweet on Saturday. He wrote, \"Delete Your Account,\" and shared what appeared to be an email conversation between him and David Levy, the president of Turner. Turner owns Bleacher Report and is an official NBA partner. \nLess than 30 minutes after Cuban shared those emails, Bleacher Report deleted the Nowitzki airball tweet and Cuban deleted his angry tweet. \nHere's what the video was of: \nBleacher Report sent out the following tweet after the deletion: Earlier today we deleted a tweet about Dirk Nowitzki. Dirk is an NBA legend in our eyes and will be forever. â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 25, 2017 \nThis entire thing is extremely odd. Fans would've quickly forgotten about the Nowitzki airball tweet, but now that Cuban called out Bleacher Report , it's going to get even more attention.
