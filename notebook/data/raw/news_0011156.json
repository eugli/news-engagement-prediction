(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) \nHOUSTON (CBS) – Mark Wahlberg probably isn’t the only Patriots fan who left NRG Stadium when it looked like New England had no chance of winning. \nThe Dorchester native and Patriots superfan says he had a good reason, but it still has to hurt to miss the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time. \nTwitter took some jabs at Wahlbeg’s expense. Seriously though, we can NEVER let Mark Wahlberg live down leaving early. Never ever. \n— Andy Hannon (@AndyHannon) February 6, 2017 Mark Wahlberg leaving early in the 4th quarter is comical. Imagine a real fan spending thousands of dollars just leaving like that. Nope. \n— Boston Sports Brew (@BosSportsBrew) February 6, 2017 At least we have the satisfaction of knowing that Trump and Mark Wahlberg are bandwagon fans who stopped watching early \n— Zachery Szkolnik (@zskully) February 6, 2017 \nAfter the Patriots win, Wahlberg took to Instagram to explain his early exit. A photo posted by Mark Wahlberg (@markwahlberg) on Feb 5, 2017 at 8:43pm PST \n“I had to leave the game early because my youngest wasn’t feeling well,” Wahlberg said. “Trust me, I would have loved to be at the stadium — but family first. Doesn’t mean I don’t love my Patriots too!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:29:57.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
