The latest leak of the device comes from Evan Blass and purportedly shows the Tab S3 with a keyboard case. The tablet itself doesn’t look like a departure from Samsung’s previous designs (still rocking capacitive buttons for example) and the keyboard is similar to that of the iPad Pro (e.g. chiclet keys with generous spacing; vertical arrow keys squashed together). We’ve also seen some low-quality pics of the Tab S3 courtesy of a Taiwanese telecom registry and even a leaked manual . The latter suggests the tablet will support Samsung’s S Pen, come with a fingerprint scanner in the home button, and use USB Type-C. There’ll also reportedly be two variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi plus LTE. Earlier leaks suggest the Tab S3 will have a 9.6-inch AMOLED display with 1536 x 2048 resolution, a Snapdragon 820 chipset, and 4GB of RAM with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. The interesting thing will be to see how Samsung positions the Tab S3 in comparison to its new Chromebooks , which were made in collaboration with Google and are the first Chrome OS devices that support Android apps (albeit terrible, terrible support ). If the Chromebooks are the new portable, powerful, productivity devices, where does that leave high-end tablets like the Tab S3? We’ll find out at MWC, on February 26th.
