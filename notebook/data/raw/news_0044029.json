Donald Trump Saw It On Fox News – Update Greg Evans Tweet Share Updated 2:07 pm Sunday, with Trump response President Donald Trump has explained his Sweden comment: He saw it on Fox. “My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden,” he’s just tweeted. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 The president’s tweet came just minutes after CNN reported that White House deputy press secretary Sarah H. Sanders said Trump “was talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general and not referring to a specific incident.” Sanders also said Trump “may have seen” the Fox News report, CNN said. The barbs arrived on cue… Wait. So \"last night in Sweden\" means \"last night on Fox News about Sweden?\" \nYou find new and innovative ways to embarrass us. https://t.co/GP43Su4v4a \n— Greg Poehler (@GregPoehler) February 19, 2017 Clearly what happens in Sweden stays in Sweden… xo m \n— Marcia Cross (@ReallyMarcia) February 19, 2017 Trump says he got his info on Sweden by misunderstanding a Fox report. Doesn't he know he would have gotten intel briefing on such a thing? \n— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) February 19, 2017 My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Sweden \n— Warren Leight (@warrenleightTV) February 19, 2017 Previous, Sunday morning So what exactly happened last night in Sweden? Or more accurately Friday night, which is when President Donald Trump suggested during his rally in Florida yesterday that something terribly terroristic had occurred. “Last night, we listened to Abba,” was one response coming from a country entirely unaware that it had been attacked. Trump made the seemingly off-the-cuff remark during his Florida rally, carried live on the news channels, while discussing the impact of refugees on violence overseas. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” The comment prompted a Bowling Green Massacre of Twitter mocking, with tweeters taking up imaginary arms. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt led the charge by asking “What has he been smoking?” One of the more popular memes was a riff on IKEA’s famously simple – or at least international – how-to instructions: Naturally, Alec Baldwin couldn’t resist: I think Trump, w his ADD, asks about the latest terror event at same time that Kushner says, \"I like these meatballs. Where are they from?\" \n— ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) February 19, 2017 Nor could: The other half will go to their graves always believing Sweden had their own 9/11 last Friday night – and nothing will change their minds. https://t.co/NZlsS4gNlh \n— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 19, 2017 In honor of the fallen, the President will watch Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\". \"I didn't know they had seals in Sweden. Beautiful fish\". \n— Brent Spiner (@BrentSpiner) February 19, 2017 Our hearts and thoughts are with Sweden for the imaginary terror attack that our President pulled out of his ass. At least he's not yours. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:45:22.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
