Second, low interest rates have lowered ICBC's investment income.\n\"The third thing — which is fairly unique here — is this government policy of suppressing the basic rate increase each year,\" he explained.\n\"They've been doing that since 2010. That's really hurt the revenues, so the revenues can't balance their cost increases and they run a deficit.\"\nMcCandless said the political strategy of keeping rates low and taking out dividends from the corporation has backfired, as ICBC is quickly running out of capital reserves.\nHe says there's a massive structural deficit in the basic coverage rates, and he said it would take at least a 20 per cent rate increase to cover that structural deficit.\n\"The government has to get out of the business of price controls,\" he said. \"You've got to let the revenues go back up, but perhaps not immediately by 20 per cent as that would be rate shock.\"\nREAD MORE: ICBC says basic rates could rise 42% by 2020 in worst-case scenario Ministry, ICBC taking steps to keep rates down For now, the government has ordered ICBC to increase rates by 4.9 per cent next year.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone defended the way his government had managed the Crown corporation and pointed out an independent review of the public insurer. \n\"This is why we directed the ICBC board to commission an independent third party review to look at all facets of ICBC to make sure they are employing every initiative to drive costs down.\"\nICBC said it is also taking steps to reduce pressure on rates by stopping fraudulent claims, doubling premiums on luxury vehicles and shrinking its executive team.\n\nWith files from The Early Edition and Richard Zussman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:15:41.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
