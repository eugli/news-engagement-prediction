A view besides the ocean: Nicki Minaj's Instagram page on Friday played host to a troika of photos in which she showcased her figure in an eye-popping outfit The Bang Bang rapper had slid on a pair of thigh-high open-toed black boots with straps crisscrossing one another running down the front of each. In the first photo she posted of the outfit, she was leaning against the white railing of a balcony with sand-colored tiles and a sprawling ocean view. A black leather jacket slid off her shoulders into the crooks of her arms, huge black sunglasses sat on her face and multiple necklaces dangled into her decolletage.
