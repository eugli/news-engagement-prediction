[Puma] was stiff so it had to have been done at night time,\" she said. \nAfter posting about the grisly discoveries on Facebook, Conaghan said she was shocked to receive messages from four other people who experienced similar incidents. \n\"It's happening to other people. One person said the same thing had been done to her cat on Makino Rd, which is just round from where I am.\" \nConaghan said she was worried for the person who might be responsible for killing the cats. \n\"It's ridiculously sick, but it's scary what this person could turn into,\" she said. \"If they can do this to animals, where do they stop? \n\"The thing that scared me the most is our cats aren't friendly so they wouldn't just come up to anyone. They even ran away from us sometimes. \n\"They must have spent some time or fed them to build a bond with them.\" \nManawatu SPCA general manager Danny Auger said he had not been made aware of any suspicious cat deaths in Feilding. \n\"This is not okay,\" he said. \"You're taking someone's beloved pet and you've got to ask yourselves what's going on in this person's head. \n\"If the cats were killed humanely then there's not an animal welfare issue. There's certainly a moral issue and criminal charges can follow. \n\"People would be really affected by this - their cats are like family members.\" \nActing Senior Sergeant Jeff Veale said he was unaware of the allegations but said police would make inquiries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:20:20.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
