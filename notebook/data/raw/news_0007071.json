Schumer for ‘fake’ tears over travel ban, asks to meet his ‘acting coach’ \nFerguson said the lawsuit against Trump and high-ranking Trump administration officials would be filed later Monday in federal court in Seattle. \nHe said it would seek to have key provisions of the executive order declared unconstitutional. The lawsuit also seeks a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the executive order. \n“We’ve had folks in our office working all weekend on a legal action,” said Ferguson, who was joined at a news conference by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. \nREAD MORE: U.S. Consulate in Toronto target of protest over Trump travel ban \n“This is un-American, it is wrong, and it will not stand,” Inslee said. “The clear intent of this executive order is to discriminate against one faith amongst all God’s children.” \nFerguson said he has been in contact with other attorneys general but that at this point Washington state was acting on its own regarding the legal action. \nThe Port of Seattle said over the weekend that people who were detained at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as a result of Trump’s order have been released. \nU.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Sunday that two individuals were released. One is a citizen of Sudan and the other a citizen of Yemen, both countries named in Trump’s order. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:02:14.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
