SEE ALSO: The dramatic Oscars mishap also happened in 1964 \nDespite the ratings erosion, ABC notes that the 2017 Oscars remained the highest-rated awards show of the year, besting the Golden Globesby 12.9 million viewers(the Globes drew a total of20 million viewers in January), and the Grammys by 6.8 million viewers (the Grammys nabbed 26.1 million viewers overall) and currently ranks as TV’s top entertainment telecast in one year, since the 2016 ceremony. \nAccording to Nielsen Social, a total of 8.4 million people generated 22.1 million social media interactions across Facebook and Twitter during the Oscars, with an estimated 73 percent of all social TV interactions on Sunday mentioning the telecast. We're guessing that a pretty big chunk of that number were freaking out about the Moonlight mix-up .
