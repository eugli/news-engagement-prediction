Also, against starvation, barrenness; patron of amputees, animals, boatmen, Brazil, domestic animals, the elderly, expectant mothers, faith in the Blessed Sacrament, Ferrazzano, fishermen, harvests, horses, Lisbon, lower animals, mail, mariners, oppressed people, Padua, paupers, Portugal, sailors, sterility, swineherds, Tigua Indians, travel hostesses, travelers, and watermen. June 13 is St. Anthony's Day \nSt. Anthony is known as the matchmaker saint and on the eve of his day, June 13th, girls try various methods of finding out whom they will wed. \nOne favorite way is for a girl to fill her mouth with water and hold it until she hears a boy's name mentioned. The name she hears is sure to be that of her future husband! \nAnother way to recognize \"the gentleman\" is to make an agreement with St. Anthony by a sign or an object that only the two of you know about. \nA popular ritual advises: Fill a small bowl with water Write down the names of those you would like (or think you would like!) to be your perfect partner Roll up each piece of paper and put them in the bowl Place the bowl under your bed The next day, look at the papers. The name that has opened up the most in your perfect partner! \nSingle women have been known to buy a small statue of Saint Anthony and place (or bury) it upside down for a week, blackmailing him to only put him in his normal position after they found a good husband. \nA charming custom of the day is for a young man to present a pot of basil to the girl he hopes to wed. Within the petals is a verse or message that indicates the young man's passion. \nPots of basil are displayed on almost every balcony around the city and are often given as gifts with little verses invoking St. Anthony or of love and affection for the recipient. Celebrating St. Anthony \nWhen the entire city celebrates St. Anthony the night of June 12 to 13th, altars are built, parades are held and streets decorated the air is filled with the delicious smell of sardines being grilled at bonfires lining almost every street. Especially in the Alfma district of the city. \nThe biggest parade is the Marchas Populares, along the Avenue Liberade. I found an ideal viewing spot not far from my hotel along with a few friends and watched as countless marchers passed by. \nEvery neighborhood in Lisbon has its own contingent with colorful costumes, floats and marching bands. There is a prize for the best group but as the parade continued past midnight, my friends and I got hungry and headed over to the Alfama district for grilled sardines. \nWe had been invited to a small neighborhood bar that had a patio behind it. There we were treated to beautifully grilled sardines, served on a slice of bread on paper plates and napkins. \nWe drank sangria from plastic cups and licked our fingers as we reached for another fish. The pile of bones stacked up in the middle of our table and still the fish kept coming. I was in sardine heaven! \nOf all the beautifully prepared meals I had while in Portugal, this midnight snack remains a highlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:20:26.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
