She came here, and I just saw her, and it was really cool.” \nIt wasn’t until midweek that doctors cleared Galynn to make the trip. “We weren’t sure we’d be able to come until Wednesday,” Tom Brady Sr. told MMQB.

Very thankful, yeah, just very thankful that this played out.” \nOn Monday morning, Tom Brady was still emotional after his win.

They set such a great example for me.” \nBrady continued, with tears in his eyes, “All families go though challenging times — she has a lot of support and a lot of love. \nI was just happy last night to be able to celebrate with her. She hadn’t been to a game all year, so this was a hell of a game for her to be at.” \nIt certainly was!
