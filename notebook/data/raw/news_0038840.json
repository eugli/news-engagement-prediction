And in the other eight grocery stores across the state, the wines have either sold out entirely or almost sold out. \n“Both Midlothian and Short Pump [stores] have sold out of all five of the Trump wines we carry,” Wegmans spokesperson Joe Natale told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. “They will be replenished when they are available, possibly three to four weeks.” \nThe Prince William County’s National Organization for Women chapter called for a boycott of the popular grocery store chain because it sold a variety of Trump Winery wines in its Virginia stores. \n“Certainly if Wegmans is carrying Trump wines, I personally will not shop there,” National Organization for Women President Terry O’Neill said. \nIn response to the protests, Natale said the grocery store’s “role as a retailer is to offer choice to our customers.” \n“Individual shoppers who feel strongly about an issue can demonstrate their convictions by refusing to buy a product,” she said. “When enough people do the same, and sales of a product drop precipitously, we stop selling that product in favor of one that’s in greater demand.” \nYet, since news of the boycott broke, Natale told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that sales of the Trump Winery products at Wegmans have soared — selling out of bottles on the shelves in back-up inventory. \nPresident Donald Trump bought the Charlottesville, Virginia winery at a foreclosure auction in 2011 — long before he ran for office. As president, Trump has promised to distance himself from his many businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:05:41.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
