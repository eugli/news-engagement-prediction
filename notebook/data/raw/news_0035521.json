A combination of guys not having a true connection to the coaches on Al Golden’s staff to just flat taking young men early that weren’t good enough led to many of those defections. \nBut with the on-field product trending up at the same time as the program is catching up in college football’s arms race , Miami will be much more competitive with landing and keeping blue-chippers moving forward. That, along with the fact the new coaching staff is doing a better job of building stronger relationships, means chance are you'll see less decommitments in Coral Gables this 2018 cycle. \n“I think just the difference from the old staff and this staff,” Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) American Heritage defensive tackle Nesta Silvera said. “They actually recruit South Florida. Richt and the whole staff showed they actually wanted me to be a Cane.” \nThe jewel of the class is five-star running back Lorenzo Lingard . The Orange City (Fla.) University blue-chipper gave his pledge one week ago and recently told 247Sports national insider Ryan Bartow he was shutting down his recruitment and enrolling early . \n“ I plan to only visit Miami,” Lingard said. “I have a lot of online classes to get started on.” \nRecruits across the country say the same thing every year and end up taking visits elsewhere so perhaps take those comments with a grain of salt, but no question Richt and company are doing a better job of connecting with their top targets than the previous regime. \n“They treat me like family,” Miami (Fla.) Southridge offensive guard Delone Scaife said. “I think this staff won't let the kids down.” \nLingard agrees. \n“ [Running backs] coach [Thomas] Brown and the way he recruited me, it was a great recruitment overall with him, it was always the same story with him,” he said, adding the same regarding Richt. “I have known him for a long time. Since the eighth grade. It has always been the same story with him. He has been the same guy ever since I met him. He is always the same guy every time I go there.” \nAll nine of Miami’s commitments hail from the Sunshine State, most from South Florida. \n“From what I see, everyone will stay,” Silvera said. “We’re all from Florida so why would you leave the state and go make some other school great when you can make your hometown team great.” \nMiami is expected to sign around 25 in the 2018 cycle and they’ve had just two decommitments so far. One of those was Top247 cornerback Al Blades Jr. who is expected to rejoin the fold down the road and is recruiting others to join him. \n\"I think if we do our job the way we should, the University of Miami will have great, great classes in the future,” Richt said. \nIn addition to Blades, the Hurricanes look like they’ll be extremely tough to beat for two more touted prospects in receiver Mark Pope and safety Gurvan Hall . As Miami won its last five football games including a bowl win over West Virginia to finish 9-4, prospects got a taste of what things could look like in the future under this Richt led staff, and perhaps more important than anything, having guys like Lingard and Blades recruiting their peers will help Miami keep this thing intact moving forward while growing it. \n“With my personality, I just try and talk to as many guys as I can,” Lingard said. Tight end Will Mallory , cornerback Tyson Campbell , defensive end Gregory Rousseau , Alabama commit Xavier Williams and linebacker Rosendo Louis being some of the other top targets Miami is working on. \n“I tell them about the opportunity they can have playing at Miami,” Lingard continued. “There is a lot of support and we can go there and have a lot of fun on the field together.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:02:43.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
