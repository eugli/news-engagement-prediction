That union hall is owned by the workers. They don’t have the right to take out of office those who were democratically elected,” Dias told reporters Tuesday morning. \nREAD MORE: Temporary trustee of TTC union reinstates 10 board members, but not president Kinnear \nManny Sforza, the American parent’s international vice president who has since been designated as a temporary TTC trustee, told reporters during a press conference Tuesday morning Kinnear was “plotting in secret” to have the TTC workers’ union join Unifor. \nA letter sent by ATU international president Larry Hanley to its Canadian officers on Monday stated that Kinnear’s efforts to decertify Local 113 was part of a Unifor campaign “to take over all ATU Locals in Canada.” \nKinnear maintains the spat between the two parties is a result of its American counterpart not respecting the democracy of Canadian members and their right to vote and choose who they want to affiliate themselves with. \n“Why is the ATU so concerned and afraid of a democratic and free vote?,” Kinnear said. “If that happens and the membership so chooses, I won’t dispute it. In fact, I will respect it, encourage the members as I always have and stand shoulder to shoulder with the members.” \nREAD MORE: TTC union president, executive members ousted by American transit union \nKinnear said last week an application with the Canadian Labour Congress was filed to have them come in and investigate if the ATU is representing them properly. \nKinnear has also sought legal action to have the ATU’s decision to let loose the leadership team overturned. \nATU International had removed 17 union executives from their positions on Friday but 10 were reinstated a day later after they accepted to sign “loyalty oaths.” \nATU Local 113 represents nearly 11,000 transit employees in Toronto. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
