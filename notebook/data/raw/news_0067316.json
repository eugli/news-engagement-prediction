(Photo: Rob Schumacher/The Republic) 68 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPHOENIX — As immigration hard-liners cheered the sweeping set of federal immigration-enforcement guidelines issued Tuesday, panic and confusion intensified among undocumented immigrants in Arizona, with many calling the protocols an \"attack\" and a threat to human rights. \nThe enforcement procedures, outlined in a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos, implement President Trump's Jan. 25 immigration executive orders, putting most of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. \nThe memos, among other things, give local police the ability to help with immigration enforcement, call for the hiring of thousands more immigration agents and increase the number of immigrants who could be deported under \"expedited removal,\" a process that generally denies individuals a chance to speak with an immigration judge. \nFederal officials \"are doing everything in their power to ensure the immigrant community is under attack — not only people who are undocumented, but also people with asylum,\" said Reyna Montoya, founder of Aliento, an organization that uses art to comfort youth affected by the immigration and detention systems. \n\"I think the general feeling right now is that they want to terrorize our communities,\" Montoya said. \"People think these (guidelines) are going to make America safe again, when really it's going to push undocumented people who are victims of crimes not to report them.\" Trump set to issue streamlined immigrant travel ban \nStudent activist Randy Perez works with refugees and recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, known as \"dreamers,\" at Arizona State University. He said the guidelines sparked flashbacks to the arrival of Senate Bill 1070, Arizona's controversial 2010 immigration law. \nThe bill requires law enforcement to determine the immigration status of someone arrested or detained if officers have reason to suspect the person entered the country illegally. The law ignited protests, boycotts and a rash of legal challenges after opponents contended it encouraged racial profiling \n\"What came out today is scary but, unfortunately, not surprising to anyone in Arizona,\" Perez said. \"I don't think all of this is going to hold up in court.\" \nBrian Garcia, a legal advocate for immigrant youth, said the \"change in policy places a priority on hurting families\" who \"come to the U.S. to work, pursue an education and contribute to our economy.\" \nPhoenix immigration attorney Daniel Rodriguez called the memos an \"all-out attack on immigrants, legal or otherwise.\" Facebook Posted!
