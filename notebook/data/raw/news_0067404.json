Samsung’s upcoming mid-ranger will retail for the aforementioned figure without a contract but will also be available on contract with numerous Canadian wireless carriers like Rogers, Bell, and Telus, including all of their sub-brands. There’s still no word on when exactly the Galaxy A5 (2017) will start retailing in Canada but seeing how the device already debuted in several countries around the world, Canadian consumers that are on the lookout for a new Android smartphone probably won’t have to wait too long. \nThe Galaxy A5 (2017) is equipped with a 5.2-inch FullHD display and is powered by the octa-core Exynos 7880 system-on-chip (SoC) and 3GB of RAM. The smartphone ships with a 16-megapixel rear camera and a 16-megapixel front one, though the former is naturally more capable of shooting high-quality images. Nonetheless, both sensors feature an aperture of f/1.9. Apart from 32GB of internal storage, the Galaxy A5 (2017) also boasts a microSD card slot that supports up to 256GB of additional storage. All of that hardware is powered by a conventional 3,000mAh battery which supports fast charging. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box with Samsung’s proprietary Android launcher on top. The TouchWiz user interface isn’t the only unique software feature of this device that differentiates it from its competitors that weren’t made by Samsung as the phone also ships with S Voice, Samsung KNOX, and Samsung Pay. Finally, the Galaxy A5 (2017) features IP68 certification, meaning the device is resistant to both water and dust. \nThe South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer is expected to reveal more details on the availability of the Galaxy A5 (2017) in Canada in the coming days. In related news, Samsung is also scheduled to unveil a new product lineup on Sunday, a day before Mobile World Congress (MWC) kicks off in Barcelona. If you’re a fan of Samsung’s Android devices but aren’t interested in mid-range smartphones like the Galaxy A5 (2017), there’s not much you can do but wait for the company to unveil the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus in late March.
