What jobs does that create? How is that keeping the US safe? #Resist — billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 23, 2017 Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 This is disgusting. This is unacceptable. I #StandWithGavin and every Trans person who deserve nothing less than protection and equality. https://t.co/IK5TO8nWQ8 — Brie Larson (@brielarson) February 23, 2017 To the LGBTQ community, I'm sorry for the message that was sent today. They don't speak for all of us. We love you. — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 23, 2017 \nEvancho is not the only celebrity to speak out against the Trump's administration's decision. Many stars expressed their disappointment on Twitter.
