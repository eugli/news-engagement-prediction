It all had to go. \non Chestnut Street can command as much — we’re talking between $20,000 and $40,000 a month — as their Walnut Street counterparts. Because of it, independent retailers face an uncertain future. \n’s 2,200-square-foot space this spring. And that has left Gitter busy scouring blocks in Midtown Village -- east of Broad and Spruce Streets -- for a suitable new home. She’s even considering moving to University City. \nThere is so much more beyond the four-block radius from Broad to 18th and between Chestnut and Walnut,” Gitter said, referring to the residential developments sprouting up around town. \n’s change of address isn’t the only sign that independent retailers need to rethink their survival. Gitter, who has co-owned Knit Wit locations in Center City, Bryn Mawr, and Margate for more than 50 years with partners Bob Brandt and Donnie Davidow, is considering partnering with other established retailers. \n“” Gitter said. “We can no longer bear the brunt of the entire cost. ... I don’t need a lot, but I don’t want to work for my landlord, either.” \nand in their place, brick-and-mortar destinations of brands once carried exclusively by specialty stores — think Vince, Theory, and Rag & Bone -- are now part of the competition. \nathletic-inspired fashion brands, like Under Armour and New Balance as well as Lululemon and Athleta, are hurting boutiques, too, as athleisure styles have been a popular staple at independents. And the discount big-box retailers -- Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdale’s Outlet, and even Target -- have been, well, undercutting everybody. \nIt wasn’t like this five years ago,” Gitter said. \n’s not lying. Many days I find myself bypassing the specialty boutiques and drifting into Target and Lululemon because the prices are better for my wallet -- not to mention, those places are always having sales. But when Gitter marked down the luxury items in her store last week by more than half, I snatched up things: two sweaters, a pair of pants, and $320 Citizens for Humanity jeans for $61. \nAll of this, coupled with the general uncertainty haunting retail markets since the presidential election, is driving many local specialty store owners to get creative. \nRecently, Mona Lisa Jackson, the owner of cute lingerie boutique Coeur, began looking for a specialty retailer with which to partner. The idea, Jackson said, would be to help a clothier become a one-stop shop. After all, fashion is nothing without the proper foundation garments. \nThis week, to drum up business, Jackson marked down the majority of her pajamas and bras up to 75 percent. \nAfter moving her women's wear boutique Shop Sixty Five from Doylestown to 20th and Walnut Streets a little over a year ago,Linda LaRosa moved again in September to 17th and Sansom (the former location for Plage Tahiti, also Gitter's). \nWith the higher foot traffic came a higher rent, so to subsidize her costs, LaRosastarted offering her loft space to local designers on a short-term basis. Last week, it was Bela Shehu selling her Ninobrand collection. \nNext month, Katz will join forces with Artur Kirsh, one of the Main Line’s most seasoned salon owners, and open a gift store she's named ATF (All Things Fabulous) in Kirsh’s new Manayunk location. \n“’s a great way to feed off of each other when it comes to advertisers, client base, and customers,” said Katz.
