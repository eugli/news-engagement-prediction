Two of the men were said to be of a slim build and the third man was of a large build with a bald head and a goatee, he claimed. \nPolice launched an investigation into the reported robbery and asked for the public to keep a look-out for Egg, who was described as being a smaller breed of pug and wearing a red-coiled collar when he went missing. \nThe investigation took a bizarre turn on Tuesday night when Egg's owner went to Auburn police station where he was questioned by officers from Flemington Local Area Command. Ad Feedback \nPolice then issued the man with a future court attendance notice for false representation resulting in a police investigation. He is due to appear in Burwood Local Court on April 6. \nOn Wednesday morning, police still did not know where the dog was, and issued a new public appeal for information. \nOn Thursday afternoon, the search had been called off, the police spokeswoman said. \nPolice from the Flemington Local Area Command now say the dog \"was not stolen, but died at the owner's home and his body disposed of\", the spokeswoman said. \nShe said no further details were known about how the dog died, where the body was disposed of, or why the owner allegedly made a false report to police. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:33:42.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
