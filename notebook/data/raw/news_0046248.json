Do You Agree? posted by Alexander Shun - share \nThe NBA All-Star Game is at a crossroads. \nAfter Sunday night's 192-182 All-Star Game in which the Western Conference won a game featuring some of the league's best players giving next to no effort and playing absolutely zero defense while putting up video game type numbers, many in and around the league are calling for a change. \nSuch All-Star festivities have become nearly unwatchable for NBA fans and change is certainly in order. \nIndiana Pacers' legendary guard Reggie Miller spoke with Dan Patrick on Monday morning, just hours after the completion of the 2017 NBA All-Star Game and shared his thoughts on what he witnessed and what needs to be done to make the game better.
