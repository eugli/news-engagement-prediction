With the protomolecule-infested Eros hurtling towards Earth with seemingly no way to stop it, Miller found whatever alien-technology infused version of Julie Mao that was left on the station and convinced her to drive it into the planet of Venus instead. \nWhile that move saved billions of lives, it cost Miller his own in a dramatic finish. Now, in this exclusive video, the cast and producers pay tribute to both the fallen character and the man who played him, Thomas Jane. \n“I was floored that he would be killed,” says Chad L. Coleman, who plays OPA leader Fred Johnson. “To me, he’s a hero.” \nThe actors who comprise the crew of the Rocinante also pay their respects. “Thomas Jane brought a whole different dynamic as the person that he is and the legend that he is,” says Dominique Tipper, who plays Naomi Nagata. “I loved working with Thomas Jane. It was so nice to have him as a part of the group.” Chimes in Steven Strait (Captain James Holden): “There’s something really lyrical and poetic about Thomas Jane.” \nThe lyrical and poetic Jane himself speaks about the voyage for both him and his character. “It’s the end of the journey for Detective Miller,” he says. “I feel honored. I love making really good, smart science fiction. I think it changes the world. I feel like I’ve made a little contribution.” The last words of the video, however, add a little intrigue into the mix. “We’ll see what happens,” says Jane. Hmmm… \nCheck out the video above to watch Jane as well as his costars and producers pay tribute the life and death of Detective Miller.
