I don’t try to put a focus on discrimination or something like that, I think that was told enough with a lot of past projects people made.\nIt started off as a photography project, but editor Tristan Rodgers launched the magazine after a crowdfunding campaign in Germany\nThe magazine features photos of redheads, as well as articles of interest to those with ginger hair\n'There are a lot of things redheads have in common, for example the special way how people use the hair in art and often redheads have this special kind of connection to this topic, so there is this special vibe I try to catch and reflect with this project.'\nSince launching the magazine, he has discovered there are numerous redhead festivals and a large community interested in his work.\nHe plans to go to the Irish Redhead Convention, an annual celebration of all things ginger, later this year.\nThe magazine tackles the important questions that most matter to redheads\nTristan said he has discovered a large network of redheads around the world, and said the project is a positive thing\nThe magazine was set up to celebrate redheads, and has attracted an audience in countries across the world\nThe publication, launched in Germany, is the first in the world for redheads\nTristan, who lives in Hamburg, said: 'I discovered that a big network for, about and with redheads is coming up around the world and I am part of this movement now.\n'The people connect more at festivals or with different kind of projects around the world and they share the experience they made with a lot of other people. Its a big positive hype right now and it’s cool for almost every redhead so see most of it on the media and everywhere else.'\nBut he said not everyone is on board. 'There are still a few redheads who don’t like the hype I think,' he stated, 'maybe because they get attention they don’t want or never had before, but it’s still a really good thing.'", "external_links": ["http://mc1r-magazine.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-02T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:01:22.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
