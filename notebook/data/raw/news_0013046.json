The three other occupants of the minivan sustained minor injuries.\nAll of the injured were taken to Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife via helicopter from the scene.\nPolice say the driver of the semi was uninjured.\nAccording to Wendy Oe, a friend of the four people in the minivan, the group of travelling pastors was visiting Tulita for Christian gospel meetings, something they do on a regular basis.\nAnita Hicks of High Prairie, Alta., says her mother Jane Okemow is in hospital in Yellowknife, while her father Johnny Okemow was transferred to the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton.\nShe said her father has broken bones on the left side of his face and will require reconstructive surgery. His left leg and ankle bones were also shattered, she said. Her mother is still in hospital but won't require surgery.\nThe injured were transported to Yellowknife's Stanton Territorial Hospital by helicopter. (submitted by Mike Squirrel)\nOe says David Fehr and Albert Okemow were sent to hospital, but have since been released and are back at their homes in Alberta.\nRCMP say the crash is still under investigation but that poor visibility due to heavy blowing snow was a major factor. Alcohol/drug use and speed are not suspected to have been factors.\nThis is the second time in three weeks a vehicle has struck a semi from behind on N.W.T. highways in whiteout conditions.\nMiracle on highway 3: Yellowknife dad and 3 kids 'without a scratch' after collision with semi-trailer truck with files from Alyssa Mosher", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:43:40.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
