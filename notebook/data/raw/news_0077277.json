Viola Davis accepts the award for best actress in a supporting role for \"Fences\" at the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 26, 2017, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

People ask me all the time, 'What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?' And I say exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories,\" Davis said, thanking ' Fences ' playwright and Pulitzer Prize-winner August Wilson for exhuming and exalting ordinary people in his work. \nSomehow, Davis managed to capture what would become a recurring theme of the evening, as Black actors, writers, and filmmakers made history during the ceremony. \nIt was the first year where more than three Black Oscar winners took the stage for marquee categories - writing, acting, best picture, and documentary. \nEach winner not only celebrated their achievements, they paid homage to people who have been downtrodden, they represented the possibilities for Black people in the film industry, and they uplifted untold stories—stories rooted in Blackness—and witnessed to the world that these stories are worth telling. \nRelated: Meet the Man Behind Hollywood's Secret Screenplay Database, 'The Black List' \nIn one of the show's earlier moments, Janelle Monae, Taraji P. Henson, and Octavia Spencer spoke about their nominated film, Hidden Figures , while presenting one of the figures whose story their film exhumed. But her body wasn't entombed six feet underground. She was able to receive and smell her flowers, to experience the joy of knowing her hard labor touched millions of lives, and do it while she yet lived. Janelle Monae, Katherine Johnson, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer at the 89th Oscars, February 26, 2017, on the ABC Television Network.

With the work of the film, and in that moment on the stage, Johnson—who represents one of many Black women who worked tirelessly in the shadows of their white colleagues at NASA —was hidden no more. \nThat kind of recognition cannot be understated. Even though Hidden Figures didn't win an Oscar that night, the movie itself won in that very moment. They won by harnessing the power and pride to be found in authentic representation, in being present and counted, in saying \"I was here, I am here, and you should know my story.\" \nWhen films like \" Moonlight \" take home an Oscars haul, it sends a message to Black and LGBT people that their struggles and triumphs are worth knowing and celebrating, despite the often-crushing social forces that may make them believe they're inherently broken and flawed, and when there's nothing wrong with us being who are are. \nTerrell Alvin McCraney, who adapted the screenplay from his own stage play with director Barry Jenkins, spoke directly to a group that's usually the punchline for nasty jokes and among the most vulnerable for violent hate crimes . Jenkins said that the win should offer reassurance to marginalized groups that filmmakers and advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union will \"have your back\" during the next four years, a reference to the current presidential administration.
