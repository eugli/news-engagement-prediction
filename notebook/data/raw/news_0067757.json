He questioned whether she should take it off. But Donna didn't want to go against her doctor's advice and refused, even as pain radiated from the injection sites. At 3am she woke up in excruciating pain and tried to get out of bed, crumpling in a heap on the floor as she tried to get up. Donna called out to Paul, now 44, for help but he didn't hear her. Donna (pictured with her parents) had undergone the procedure two years prior without any problems. But this time it left her in excruciating pain just hours later She eventually pulled herself back into bed and at 7am rang her parents. They immediately called an ambulance and went straight to her house. Things got increasingly worse as Donna made her way to the hospital. 'I could hardly move from the nausea and my legs, which had swelled to double their size, were agony when touched,' she told that's life! A doctor then revealed that Donna had contracted necrotising fasciitis, a flesh-eating bug. He warned that she could lose her legs. 'The bug is eating away at your legs,' he told her. 'It will eventually get to the bone. You need surgery to remove the dead flesh to stop the bug.' Donna fell in and out of consciousness, getting transferred to another hospital. She later found out that doctors weren't even sure she'd be able to survive the journey. Donna went on to have four more surgeries in the next four days after she was first admitted into the hospital, losing most of both of her calves as she lay on the brink of death She went on to have four more surgeries in the next four days, losing most of both of her calves as she lay on the brink of death. Donna tried to prepare herself to die, but her mother pleaded with her to fight and remember her beloved border collie Doogle. Just as things looked increasingly bleak, doctors managed to find a drug that quickly turned things around. Donna's condition stabilized, but a long road to recovery lay ahead. Donna shared her story - and the lesson it taught her - in that's life! 'The sight of my legs made me feel sick,' she said. 'They were a patchwork of skin grafts and staples, red raw and mangled.' Donna cried as she tried to imagine learning how to walk again, a process that would take four months as she recovered at her parents' home. She would go on to have 13 more surgeries in the next 10 years to help rebuild the legs the flesh-eating bug had nearly taken away forever. A simple surgery had spiraled into a traumatising trial, but it was one that taught Donna an important life lesson. 'My experience has taught me to enjoy life more and not sweat the small stuff,' she said. 'I've learned not to let something as silly as a varicose vein get me down.'
