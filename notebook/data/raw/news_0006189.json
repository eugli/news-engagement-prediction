Credit: PA \nRock star Ozzy Osbourne has said he is emotional as his heavy metal band Black Sabbath prepare for their last ever shows this weekend. \nThe group, which is credited with creating heavy metal, will be drawing the final curtain on their generation-crossing career with two shows in their home city of Birmingham. \nRehearsing for the big finale, Osbourne told the BBC: \"Since I've got to this building, I've been happy, I've been tearful. Let's see what happens.\" \nOsbourne said fronting the band had been \"the most incredible adventure\" but admitted that it had \"run its course\". \nThe Prince of Darkness promised an as yet unrehearsed closing speech at the Birmingham show and said that he would continue with his solo work in the future. \nOne of the proudest things I have in my heart is the fact that Black Sabbath wasn't a band that was created by some big mogul. \nIt was four guys who said, 'Let's have a dream', and it came true beyond our wildest expectations. – Ozzy Osbourne \nOsbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi and bass player Geezer Butler will round off the band's farewell tour at the Genting Arena on Saturday night followed by a Black Sabbath special on BBC Radio 1's Rock Show on Sunday.
