Article continues below \n“No, I can’t name you one,” was Haye’s sarcastic response. “I’ve never beaten anyone of any note.” \nThe sarcasm continued. Gary Lineker posts brilliant tweet after Jamie Vardy scores vs Liverpool \n“I haven’t had a good fight in 10 years, I’m super slow, I’m old, inactive, don’t have any heart - all of this stuff,” the Hayemaker added. “Take it all on board, believe it, soak it up, enjoy it.” Monday's press conference \nFriday’s weigh-in should provide yet more drama. And we were treated to another press conference at the Hilton Hotel in Liverpool on Monday evening. \nHaye received a hostile reception in front of the crowd, the majority of whom expressed their support for his opponent. \nThe London-born boxer couldn’t resist reacting to the heckling, telling the crowd “your fighter is going to get drilled”. Haye: Bellew is going to get drilled \n“I’m really happy you’ve all come out,” Haye said. “Bet all the money you have. \n“Each and every one of you should bet on Bellew to win the fight. You know your fighter is going to get drilled. \n“When he comes back to Liverpool, be there for him, because he’s going to need you.” \nThe two then went at each other. \nBellew: I’m the younger, hungrier fighter. You are a broken man. \nHaye: The only broken man is going to be you on the canvas. Video: Haye goes nuts at fans and Bellew The face-off was a bit different \nThe traditional face-off ended up turning into a stand-off as bodyguards stood between Haye and Bellew. \nIt was quite a shame, but the fact that they boxers had to be kept apart emphasised the hate the boxers feel for each other. \nSurprisingly, the most ugly part of proceedings came when Haye directed a shot at the crowd. \n“You’re all f***ing retards,” screamed the former World heavyweight champion, via the Mirror . Video: Haye argues with fans \nHaye can expect more supporters at the O2 on Saturday. Who will win on March 4? Let us know in the comments section below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
