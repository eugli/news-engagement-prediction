Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPolice are used to problem solving, so when a little girl reached out and asked for some help with her maths homework, they were happy to help. \nTen-year-old Lena Draper sent a Facebook message to her local police department explaining she was having a bit of trouble with her homework assignment. \nInstead of pointing her in the direction of her teacher, or her parents, Lt. B.J. Gruber decided to respond to her plea for help with a simple: \"Ok with what?\" \nEager Lena quickly shared the offending question (8+29)x15 and was given this helpful tip: \"Do the numbers in the parenthesis first so in essence it would be 37 x 15.\" At first she received an automated response (Photo: Facebook / Molly Draper) Read More Confused parents ask for help with incredibly complex maths question - designed for a SIX year old \nLena, realising she was on to a good thing, took the chance to pose another problem, this time (90+27)+(29+15). \nLt. Gruber was confident. He had this. Again happy to help, he responded with what he thought was the right answer. The policeman was only too happy to help out (Photo: Facebook / Molly Draper) \nWhat a hero....except there was one tiny issue. He was wrong. \nThe answer he'd given to Lena ended up being incorrect, a fact quickly pointed out by family friends when mum Molly shared the exchange on Facebook. What's the correct answer? \nThe actual answer is to add the numbers in the second parentheses and multiply that answer - and that alone - by two, then add it to the numbers in the first parentheses. \nLena's mum, Molly, didn't seem to mind. \n\"I didn't believe her and asked for a screen shot. I thought it was pretty funny. And I love that they went ahead with it,\" she told ABC news . \nIf you're worried about the police department's mathematical abilities, stand down. The red-faced Lt. Gruber took to the Marion Police Department's Facebook page to explain. Lena eventually got the right answer (Photo: Getty) \n“Hoping it is truly the thought that counts since apparently I cannot!” he joked. “Especially since the answer was wrong, it was very nice for Molly to acknowledge our attempt to help her daughter with some math homework.” \nIt looks like Lena has forgiven him for his wrong answer - he's visiting her at school. \n“Tomorrow he’ll be joining my daughter for lunch at school, and is bringing her an autographed shirt to commemorate their going viral,” Molly told CBS . “I am surprised, I thought it was just a goofy life moment to share with some friends, but it seems to really be striking a chord with people.” \nNothing says sorry like an autographed shirt. Though maybe next time Lena's should just ask her mum's mates for help...
