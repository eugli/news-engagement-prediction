The birds gorge on bugs that have been attracted to dead and dying trees.\nFlames that killed birds and animals or forced them to flee have created conditions for different species to flourish.\nAs Darby Allen moves on, Fort McMurray names new fire chief Fort McMurray man rebuilds a home and sense of community \"The population of those kinds of woodpeckers will just sort of explode in that early post-fire habitat,\" said Steve Van Wilgenburg, a boreal ecologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service.\n\"There are suddenly all these open territories that they can move into.\"\nThere are other signs of regeneration across the fire-scarred region. Lush, green shoots from aspens, the predominant tree species in the area, have burst from the burned soil and are a metre high in some areas. The root systems of aspens can survive the flames and heat from wildfires.\nDan Thompson, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, said a warm, wet summer created ideal conditions for regrowth.\nWithin about 10 years, aspens will be tall enough to appear like a forest again and will grow to pre-fire levels in about 30 years.\nOther tree species such as spruce will take much longer to recover.\n'The ecosystem there is really adaptive to fire' Dramatic pictures last May of walls of flames consuming stands of trees might leave the impression that nothing could withstand such a destructive fire.\nBut wildfires have been part of the life cycle of the western boreal forest for thousands of years, Thompson said.\n\"The ecosystem there is really adaptive to fire,\" he said. \"Even though we had really bad human consequences, the natural consequences of this fire are just a tiny, tiny fraction of what the human consequences were.\"\n'The natural consequences of this fire are just a tiny, tiny fraction of what the human consequences were.' - Dan Thompson, research scientist, Canadian Forest Service The wildfire killed or displaced an unknown number of animals and its aftermath poses different problems for different species.\nDeer, bears, wolves and caribou would have tried to move out of the flames' path. Smaller critters such as mice and voles would have sought shelter in burrows deep in the ground.\nThe challenge for animals will be to find enough food and cover for them to survive. Van Wilgenburg said some animals might have been able to find refuge in areas within the fire zone that didn't burn.\nLawsuit seeks $10M damages for Walmart consumers after Fort McMurray wildfire Wildlife returns as forest regenerates after Fort McMurray wildfire The destruction of older trees that provide lichen for caribou or homes for martens and fishers could mean their populations won't recover until the end of the century.\nDespite the damage, within a dozen years most people will hardly notice signs of the extensive wildfire, Van Wilgenburg said.\nDead trees that look like burnt matchsticks will fall and new trees will take their place.\n\"It is remarkable how quickly you can no longer easily tell that a forest fire was through an area.\"\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:48:00.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
