The firm hasn’t worked with the CHA before, but holds several apartment complexes in the South and West Loop, as well as retail space near Millennium Park. \n“We are excited to execute a project as significant and impactful as Cabrini-Green in Chicago where the heart of our development and operational teams reside,” Hunt senior vice president Bill Little said in an email. \nIn the statement, CHA CEO Eugene Jones Jr. touted the agency’s momentum with developers in the Cabrini-Green overhaul, which has seen almost 2,400 new housing units and $350 million in investments since 2013.
