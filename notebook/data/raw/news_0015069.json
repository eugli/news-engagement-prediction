'They won the press conference. ... Today, that's all you can do.' Clark Wade/IndyStar \n*** \nCundiff made Ballard the school’s NFL liaison, putting him in frequent contact with scouts who came through the campus. A regular among them: Tampa Bay’s Jerry Angelo. As was often the case with people he encountered, Ballard made quite the impression on Angelo, and the two grew close. \nThat led to Ballard becoming the Chicago Bears’ Southwest area scout when Angelo was named Chicago’s general manager in 2001. Ballard did the job for 11 seasons, mining talent all over the region and building real credibility with the front office and coaching staff, including coach Lovie Smith. Ballard was largely responsible for the Bears drafting Pro Bowl cornerback Charles Tillman from Louisiana-Lafayette, an accomplishment of which he remains especially proud. \nAlong the way, just as he’d done at Wisconsin, Ballard was picking up methods and know-how from those around him. \nPromotions eventually came. First was the move to director of pro scouting for the Bears. Then, two years later, Ballard became the Kansas City Chiefs’ director of personnel and, ultimately, their director of football operations. \nThis past week, Colts owner Jim Irsay picked Ballard from a group of six candidates to succeed Ryan Grigson as the team’s GM. \nNow is when his experiences will really begin to pay off. But Ballard, being the relentless preparer that he is, wasn’t going to assume anything. He’s long kept a notebook in which he outlined a blueprint he’d implement if he ever became a general manager. During a campus visit to Wisconsin last fall, Ballard stopped by Alvarez’s office to get his feedback. \n“I was very impressed,” said Alvarez, now Wisconsin’s athletic director. “There were some things that he just really, really nailed. Maybe I didn’t tell him that at the time, but he really did. It let me know that he had the vision. This guy is not shooting from the hip, trust me.” \nHere, again, is another example of Ballard’s twin personalities. It shows the competitor in him, one who would never leave anything to chance, no idea unexplored. \n“But it also showed his humility,” Alvarez said. “The guys who know everything in this business get into trouble.” \nBallard readily admits there are things he does not know. But he’s learning, for example, about the number of issues he never envisioned that now find their way to his desk. \nHis success in Indianapolis will be judged the same way everyone in his business is assessed: Wins and losses. Those are the bottom lines in an industry where only the bottom line matters. The competitor in Ballard knows this and embraces it. But there’s a bigger picture, and it’s one he insists everyone around him also see. \n“This thing is hard,” he said. “Let’s enjoy it. Let’s have fun along the way. Let’s let people be people and let their personalities show, all within the team concept. That’s the satisfaction I get, watching guys develop into men. That’s where there’s satisfaction. It’s got to be more than wins and losses, man. It has to be bigger than that. \n“At the end of the day, that’s how we’re judged. And that won’t change. But when you do things the right way and you’re good at what you do, we’ll get to the result. Don’t worry about that. Don’t focus on the result. Focus on the present moment of doing things right and doing it together. \n“If we do that, we’ll get to where we need to be — I promise.” \nAnd, with that, it was back to work. That to-do list — the defense, the draft, free agency — isn’t getting any shorter. \nFollow IndyStar Colts Insider Stephen Holder on Twitter and Facebook . 9 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:35:43.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
