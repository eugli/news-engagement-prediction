The Africans were the brains,” he said. \nComm Acryl Sani said police seized seven vehicles, 17 laptop computers, 47 mobile phones and 36 ATM cards, while two bank accounts were frozen. \nHe said police have solved four cases in Singapore and 54 here with the busts. \nCAD director David Chew said they arrested seven women in Singapore who were money mules for the syndicates. \n“Most of the time, these syndicates offer the women a small sum to use their bank accounts. \n“The women fail to realise that they could face serious jail time, up to seven years,” he said. \nChew added that there were 636 cases in Singapore last year, up from 385 in 2015. \nSyndicates scammed a total of S$24mil (RM75mil) from the victims in 2016 and in the previous year, they got S$12mil (RM37.5mil).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:44:54.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
