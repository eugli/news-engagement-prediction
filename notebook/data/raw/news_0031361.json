The band’s reputation has become internet shorthand for the worst thing imaginable. Canadian police have threatened drunk drivers with having to listen to Nickelback, while authorities in Australia want the band for “ crimes against music .” Even Mark Zuckerberg dropped a random diss to the Canadian alt-rock group in his recent home video . \nFrankly, the whole thing has gotten a little tired and lazy, and Nickelback is tired of being the internet’s punching bag—especially when it’s Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing the punches. \nLast night, The New Celebrity Apprentice host took to Twitter to raise awareness about gerrymandering , and used Nickelback as a reference point for unpopularity. When Congress is less popular than herpes & Nickelback, how do 97% of them get re-elected? Gerrymandering. WATCH: https://t.co/SoX0tdlTeM — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 14, 2017 \nBut Nickelback clapped back. Hard. . @Schwarzenegger big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator. \nThe band’s referring, of course, to Schwarzenegger's role as Mr. Freeze in 1997’s Batman & Robin , a film that tanked with critics and at the box office (though it did deliver some incredibly memorable puns ). \nSensing defeat, Schwarzenegger took the high road out of town. @Nickelback That's... ice cold. I hope we can agree that we need a freeze on gerrymandering, guys. Thanks for the reply.
