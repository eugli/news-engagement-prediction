It is a toxicant and carcinogen. \nMiles O'Brien (far right) and panelists (from left) Mae Wu, Rob Bilott, Jesse Meiller, PhD and John Scully, Ph.D., Photo by Vincent Ricardel \nHere is this 2017 take away. \nAs founder of Less Cancer, it has become increasingly and exceedingly clear that the focus for Cancer Prevention must call immediate attention, an urgent 911, to our polluted and sometimes cancer-causing drinking water. \nWe as citizens need all resources shifted to this purpose--- to guarantee that (at the very least) our drinking water is safe. Having safe, clean water speaks to the most basic of human needs. It's a no-brainer. And yet, this isn't fully understood or appreciated in its urgency. \nIt is precisely such concerns that called and continue to call on our work at Less Cancer. \nThe Less Cancer work started when it was founded in 2004 under the name of Next Generation Choices Foundation. At the time the idea of cancer prevention was thought to be more of a crap shoot than the evidenced based science that more mainstream audiences now understand. Leading experts globally agree that over 50% of all cancers are preventable. Today we know that the evidenced based science indicates the best way to end cancer is to prevent it. Our goal with Less Cancer is to reduce all incidences of cancer--- particularly regarding populations with increasing rates of cancer. \nCurrent leadership suggests that any protections that would come with the legislation may soon be an effort of the past and that non- government organizations must work harder and smarter to garner support for work that assures safe drinking water for all. \nWhile individuals can help protect themselves with water testing and filters, organizations must fight for the policy and legislation that will help protect all Americans from cancers related to drinking water. This is a priority on which we all must be steadfastly focused. \nRemember when you didn't think twice about using a drinking fountain? \nIf we are to prioritize preventing any cancers, we must at the very least address the carcinogens in drinking water. This also requires we remain stealthily focused. It involves information, details, and action. \nWhile policy, legislation or regulation may not be a solution for every problem ---for the case of safe drinking water, it is the pressing priority. \nPersonal action is not enough. Leadership from a government, non-government organizations and private entities must do all they can to provide creative solutions for ensuring that there will be safe drinking water for all. \nFor agenda of there National Cancer Prevention Day Workshop, bios, speaker disclosures, instructions on claiming CE credit, and additional resources, please visit link . \nFor the live stream please see click on link \nViewers may claim CE credit by watching and completing an evaluation by March 3, 2017.
