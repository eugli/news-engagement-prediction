Shweta Basu Prasad, who, at 11, won the Best Child Ac tor National Award for her show-stopping twin turn in Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Makdee', is staging a comeback. She plays Urmila, the hero's sister-in-law in Shashank Khaitan's Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt-starrer romance-drama, 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania'. Shweta Basu Prasad is both thrilled and nervous with her comeback Shweta also said that she did an extensive amount of research to get the accent right and trained hard to perform the actions scenes perfectly. In early 2015, the actress , now 26, had received a call and instantly came on board after a look test. \"It's very different from how the audience last saw me -as a kid in Makdee and Iqbal. It's a grown up part in the otherwise glam film, as close as possible to the real me because Urmila is earthy and humble,\" asserts Shweta. Her words ring true after learning that Varun couldn't believe his bhabhi was only 25 after watching her in action during the film's Jhansi schedule. \"He laughed and remembered watching Makdee when he was in school. I had to explain to him that I was in school as well at the time,\" chuckles Shweta who cannot wait for the audience to see her in a new light. It's been a long road for the actor, since 2014, when she was detained by the Hyderabad police following a raid. A sessions court gave her a clean chit and closed the case on December 5 that year. Shweta hit back with an open letter slamming the media for tarnishing her image. \"The incident is behind me but people keep bringing it up. I have moved on, it doesn't define who I am. Apart from being an actor, I'm also a producer now and looking forward to doing some great movies,\" she says, pointing out that she co-produced Adhiraj Bose's well received 2016 short film 'Int. Cafe, in which she acted alongside thespians Naseeruddin Shah and Shernaz Patel, and online royalty Naveen Kasturia. Come Friday, her documentary 'Roots' premieres at a city festival. The 61-minute film, which traces the gradual decline of classical art forms in India, features a 10-minute animation sequence chronicling the country's 5000-year musical journey. Stalwarts like A R Rahman, Gulzar, Birju Maharaj, Shubha Mudgal, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and Dr L Subramaniam feature in it. \"I've grown up in a family that appreciates art and theater. I learnt the sitar and kathak. But many of my friends weren't interested, they thought fine arts wasn't 'cool'. It was due to lack of exposure,\" she says. \"As I interviewed musicians for the documentary, I sensed that this wasn't only my concern, but theirs too.\" While studying mass media and journalism, she came up with the idea of making the documentary. \"It took me over four years to research, make a team, and finish this project,\" she says. She is currently filming Chandra Nandini in Naigaon. The TV drama-series opened with whopping TRPs last October. The Ekta Kapoor-period drama features her as Nandini, love interest of Chandragupta Maurya. As a subscriber of the 'never say never' school of thought, the bold and lively Shweta is exploring every possible medium of filmmaking and says that her ultimate dream is to produce great content. \"I will be co-producing something small soon.There's a plan,\" she signs off with a mysterious smile.
