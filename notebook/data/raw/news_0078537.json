From Bloomberg/Getty Images. It was easy enough for Republicans to rail against the Affordable Care Act when President Barack Obama was in office. There was no political cost to voting, approximately 60 times, to repeal the controversial health-care law, because there was no chance they would succeed, and no chance they would need to craft a replacement plan of their own. Now, however, the political calculus has changed. Republicans control both houses of Congress, and the White House. After vowing for seven years to dismantle Obamacare, they must deliver. It’s a familiar quandary for Democrats, who labored for years to devise legislation to increase health insurance coverage, and who spent years afterward suffering the consequences. Ironically, with Democrats out of power, Obamacare is more popular than ever. And Republicans, who leveraged voters’ anxieties over losing their health care plans to seize control of the House in 2010, now risk being undone for the same reason. It is worth considering how we got here. Emboldened by Donald Trump’s shock electoral win in November, the Republican Party swiftly set in motion the process of repealing Obamacare through a process known as “budget reconciliation,” which would allow the party to gut the law with a single party-line vote. But fissures quickly emerged within the party as public opinion shifted against the G.O.P.’s original plan to repeal the A.C.A. without a ready replacement. One Nation, a political advocacy group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been circulating a poll on Capitol Hill that shows only 17 percent of people surveyed in potential battleground Senate states believe the law should be repealed immediately, while 34 percent think the party should wait to rally around a replacement. At the same time, approval ratings for the current health system—including, notably, the Medicaid expansion—have reached an all-time high. According to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 84 percent of Americans—and 69 percent of Republican voters—are in favor of the Medicaid expansion, through which an estimated 12 million Americans have gained coverage. A number of Republican governors and senators have recently come to the program’s defense, spurred on by massive, grassroots support among Democrats and Republicans alike. Recognizing the importance of having an alternative in place, McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan are currently pushing for a repeal bill that would include a number of replacement provisions—a stopgap that would keep the $3 trillion health care system in serviceable condition until further reforms could be made. The problem is that no one can agree on what the G.O.P. replacement should look like. The party is split between Trump, who has suggested that nobody will lose their coverage under his plan; moderate Republicans, who hope to keep much of the A.C.A. infrastructure in place, but replace elements with more conservative incentives; and more ideological conservatives who don’t believe in government redistribution and say not everyone deserves to receive health care. Even within the moderate camp, there is vast disagreement. The most popular components of Obamacare are also expensive, particularly the provision barring insurance companies from refusing coverage for people with preexisting conditions, and the G.O.P. can’t decide how to pay for them. “Republicans never ever agree on health care,” former Speaker of the House John Boehner explained during a health-care conference last week, arguing that lawmakers were more likely to simply “fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it.” Obamacare “repeal and replace,” Boehner concluded, is “not going to happen.” Either way, Republicans need Trump, and are looking to him for leadership. “The president’s going to be very pivotal in this,” Representative Dennis Ross of Florida, senior deputy majority whip, told The Wall Street Journal. “He’s got to go into these districts and give air cover to these members who are weak-kneed on some of these issues.” On Monday, Ryan and McConnell are reportedly expected to urge the president to publicly throw his support behind a House G.O.P. plan currently circulating on Capitol Hill and making the rounds in the media. “This is a critical moment for him to get behind this,” one senior congressional aide told CNN . It’s not clear, however, that backing the bill is in Trump’s best interest. The draft House Republican bill would scrap both the Obamacare subsidies and much of the Medicaid expansion. The rich, who would be freed of the A.C.A.’s taxes, would see a windfall. Just about everyone else would likely pay more, causing millions of people to lose or drop their coverage . That’s a nonstarter for plenty of Republicans, not to mention the president, who vowed after the election that “We’re going to have insurance for everybody. … Everybody’s going to be taken care of.” \n“Are you going to be the Republican senator who prevents an Obamacare repeal from being sent to a Republican president who is willing to sign it?” Twitter Despite a handful of confident statements to the contrary, Trump appears worried. “It’s an unbelievably complex subject,” the president told reporters Monday, seemingly conceding some ground to critics. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” His personal views on the matter also appear fluid. According to a report from The Washington Post, Trump’s position on health care was shifting as recently as last weekend, following meetings with Governors John Kasich of Ohio, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida. The president seemed to have made little personal progress on understanding the subject while meeting with major U.S. health insurers on Monday. “The new plan will be a great plan for the patients, for the people, and hopefully for the companies. Going to be a very competitive plan. And costs will come down, and I think the health care will go up very, very substantially,” Trump said , keeping his remarks brief and unspecific. “We’ve taken the best of everything we could take.” Divisions are emerging within the West Wing, too. While Vice President Mike Pence declared last week that “America’s Obamacare nightmare is about to end,” other Trump allies seem happy to “fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it,” as Boehner suggested they might do. Trump’s senior adviser Jared Kushner, senior strategist Stephen Bannon, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, and Gary Cohn , a Democrat who serves as the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, have all warned of the potential political pitfalls of moving too aggressively, the Post reports . That’s not surprising, considering that Trump and Kushner both used to move in Democratic circles, while Bannon has said he’s perfectly happy to drive conservatives “crazy” if it means advancing his nationalist populist agenda of jobs, jobs, jobs. None are ideologues when it comes to health care policy. But there remain plenty of conservative lawmakers within the Republican Party who aren’t willing to let their colleagues get cold feet and are pushing for a swift repeal of Obamacare, with or without a replacement. “You’re a Republican, you’ve been running to repeal Obamacare, they put a repeal bill in front of you . . . Are you going to be the Republican senator who prevents an Obamacare repeal from being sent to a Republican president who is willing to sign it?” Doug Badger, a longtime Republican leadership health policy adviser, told the Journal. The party’s right wing hopes that by repealing Obamacare through the reconciliation process, Congress will have no choice but to come together afterward to pass a conservative alternative. But the move is risky. With a slim majority in the Senate of 52 to 48, the gamble could cost Republicans their shot at repeal—and ultimately hurt them at the ballot box if (or, more likely, when) upending the insurance markets causes chaos. “They won’t be able to do that,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the Journal. “How can they do it? They do not have the votes.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:00:35.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
