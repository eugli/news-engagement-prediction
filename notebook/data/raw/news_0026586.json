Eventually Latin America, I think, we should develop one Union. Also, sometimes I feel Mexico should be a part of United States.” The Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader said the Latin American continent, Africa, India and China should also follow the EU model and come together. \n“We should create a Union of the World and demilitarise the world,’’ the Tibetian spiritual leader said. He was delivering a talk on ‘Ethics, Values and Wellbeing’ at Hyderabad on Sunday. \nThe function was attended by KT Rama Roa, minister of IT and the Deputy Chief Minister Mohammad Mahmood Ali. “In order to achieve a demilitarised world, we must make effort to create the spirit of dialogue, it is a practical way. \n“The best method is dialogue, whenever some different interest or different view arises, through dialogue and talks we can resolve it,” he said. \nO ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:19:42.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
