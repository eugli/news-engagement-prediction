It's an architect-designed playhouse for the lucky pre-schoolers at a kindergarten in Saga, Japan. \nThe architects at Hibinosekkei , who worked on the project with Youji no Shiro and Kids Design Labo, say they were asked to build an area in the school where children can develop their creativity through role playing. HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nThis new playhouse is a small-scale replica of a house that sits within a kindergarten building in Saga, Japan. \n\"We wanted to break away from the existing toys and playground kindergarten typology, and design the space in sync with our belief that when children role play, they try imitating adults. With this in mind, we decided to design one mini house within the existing building, where children can imitate their parents and their real world activities.\" \nREAD MORE: HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nThe architects say the Ouchi, as it is called, is designed to let children play creatively. \nOuchi somes equipped with a kitchen, dining table, sink, cupboards, laundry and wood stove. Tucked away in the doors and drawers in the kitchen are frying pans, forks, knives, spoons, cups, a toaster, rice cooker, chopping board and pots. There's even a refrigerator. \n\"Children may enact their mothers, by making a meal from various ingredients, decorating the table with flowers, and also arranging dishes while dining,\" the architects say. \n\"After the meal, children may also clean and wash dishes in the sink. They may turn on the heater during cold, and eat at the terrace when sunny. They can put clothes into the washing machine and then dry them.\" HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nPlywood walls and timber furniture feature throughout the interior. \nThe team says the children were brought to the site during construction to give them a first-thand touch-and-feel experience of a carpenter's job. \n\"By this, we are challenging the conventional methods and creating opportunities to increase the possibility of exploration and curiosity amongst children, by keeping them in close contact with the adult jobs.\" \nThe architects also have a few words to say about conventional toys and playground equipment. HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nAt one end, stairs lead up to a small mezzanine sitting area. \n\"These are produced to cope with the law of Product Liability, and hence fashioned cautiously towards customer security and spoon-fed guidance. This inhibits the creativity and curiosity amongst children, by making things straight and clear and hence eradicating the possibility of exploration. \n\"To handle the situation well, our design is based on this essential concept, where children could continuously create challenge and grow. \n\"To complete this concept, it's essential to allow children to explore in here with full freedom and less direct interference from the teachers. The owner understands this well and hence keeps an eye on children from a distance. HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nChildren can pretend to make meals and clean up afterwards. \n\"As a result, we have the scenes where children continuously create and challenge with wonderful smiles on their face. We are looking forward to the future they will make for themselves.\" HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nUtensils include pots and frying pans, as well as crockery and cutlery. HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nChildren hang clothes out to dry on racks within the laundry. HIBINOSEKKEI/YOUJI NO SHIRO \nThe interior includes a table and chairs, wood stove, fully equipped kitchen and laundry. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:26:29.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
