In a recent briefing, though, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the bathroom question an issue for states. \nThe order the Trump administration plans to issue has not yet been released, but an early draft says people are confused by the meaning of the current protections. \nSen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who spearheaded the fight against DeVos' confirmation, issued a statement about DeVos' reported resistance. \n\"I am glad to see reports that Sec. DeVos agrees with me and so many people across the country that rolling back this guidance on protecting transgender students would be absolutely wrong and should not be done,\" Murray said. \nThe Supreme Court is slated to take up the question of transgender students' rights next month.
