You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” the president said at a rally in Melbourne, Florida , on Saturday night. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” 'Sweden, who would believe this?': Trump cites non-existent terror attack Read more \nSwedes reacted with surprise and confusion to the president’s claim about an unspecified incident that he said took place on Friday night. On Sunday, the Swedish embassy in Washington asked the US state department for an explanation. \n“We have asked the question today to the state department. We are trying to get clarity,” said the Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson. \nOn Sunday afternoon, the president tweeted his own clarification: “My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. February 19, 2017 \nSarah Sanders, the principal deputy press secretary for the White House, told reporters a few minutes before his tweet that Trump had been “referring to a report he had seen the previous night”. \n“He was talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general, and not referring to a specific incident,” Sanders said. \nOn Friday night, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson presented a segment with the film-maker Ami Horowitz, who claims that the migrants Sweden has accepted are linked to crime. \n“Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already,” Horowitz claimed, without specifying what attack he was alluding to. “They oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes.” \nSweden suffered a suicide bombing by an Iraqi-born Swedish citizen in Stockholm in 2010, a year before civil wars began in Syria and Libya and unrest across the Middle East pushed millions of people to flee their homes, many into Europe. Crime rates in Sweden have changed little over the last 10 years, according to the 2016 Swedish Crime Survey. \nContacted by email by the Guardian on Sunday, Horowitz said he would answer a list of questions, including about the alleged terror attack. He had not responded to the questions as of Sunday evening. \nThe Swedish foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, tweeted a link observing that “post-truth” was named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2016. \nShe also tweeted an excerpt of a speech she gave in parliament last week. “Both functioning democracy and constructive cooperation between states require us to speak with, and not about, each other, to honour agreements and to allow ideas to compete,” Wallstrom said. “They also require us to respect science, facts and the media, and to acknowledge each other’s wisdom.” \nEarlier this month, a senior White House aide, Kellyanne Conway, was criticized for citing a “ Bowling Green massacre ” that had not occurred. \nCarl Bildt, the country’s former prime minister, more succinctly tweeted a link asking “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.“ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:34:29.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
