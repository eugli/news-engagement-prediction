In his statement, Yiannopoulos said that the decision to resign was his alone. “When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them,” he wrote. “For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.” However, previous reports suggested that there was significant internal pressure for him to step down; sources told The Washingtonian that at least six employees had threatened to leave if he was not fired.

Grynbaum (@grynbaum) February 21, 2017 Yiannopoulos’ current success, largely rooted in the Gamergate controversy of 2014, is based on inflammatory proclamations about women, immigrants, and transgender people — who he characterized as sexual predators during a recent appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher. But he seemingly crossed a line in a 2016 podcast, where he defended adult men and women having sex with 13-year-old boys. Yiannopoulos has expressed “regret” over the comments, which he denied indicated support for pedophilia. But the partial apology hasn’t stopped many one-time supporters from denouncing them, including Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow, who called the statements “absolutely indefensible,” “appalling,” and “disappointing.” Next Up In Culture ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:26:12.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
