Last year, the United States carried out at least 456 air strikes in Afghanistan that were not documented in a U.S. Air Force database, the website reported. The air strikes were conducted by U.S. Army helicopters and drones.\nThe incomplete data could go back to October 2001, according to the Military Times, which describes itself as an independent news organization.\nThe Pentagon and Army did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Idrees Ali; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:54:23.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
