This is the place where you gain the most confidence when you win.\"\nMichael Grabner had a goal and an assist, Rick Nash also scored and J.T. Miller had two assists to help the Rangers win for the fifth time in seven games overall and improve to 5-0-1 in their last six against Calgary.\n\"I don't think we had our `A' stuff, but we did a good job defending and not getting hurt by it,\" Rangers center Derek Stepan said.\nFlames veteran Kris Versteeg got ejected after losing his jersey during a fight in the third period, and waved to jeering fans as he skated off.\nVersteeg, a two-time Stanley Cup champion with Chicago and not known as a brawler, tangled with Pavel Buchnevich and got his jersey pulled over his head during the scrap. The 30-year-old forward was tossed because, by rule, his jersey hadn't been properly tied down.\n'We just didn't get the points' The Flames, who practiced on an outdoor rink in Central Park on Saturday, had won three in a row.\nMatthew Tkachuk had a goal and an assist, and Dougie Hamilton and Troy Brouwer also scored for the Flames. Brian Elliott finished with 28 saves and Mikael Backlund had two assists.\n\"I thought we deserved to get some points out of this building,\" Calgary coach Glen Gulutzan said. \"These are the types of games that make you better and we were good tonight, we just didn't get the points.\"\nThe Rangers outlasted Calgary in a furious third period that began with the score tied at 1.\nKreider put the Rangers ahead 3-2 as he brought the puck up the left side and sent a shot from outside the left circle that deflected in off the skate of defenseman Dennis Wideman for his career high-tying 21st goal at 8:20.\nFast made it 4-2 with about 8 1/2 minutes left off a pass from Miller.\nThe Flames took advantage of a Rangers giveaway less than a minute later as Backlund fired a shot that deflected off Tkachuk past Lundqvist.\nGrabner gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead at 1:54 of the third, taking a pass from Brady Skjei in the right circle and putting it into the top right corner for his 23rd.\nBrouwer tied it at 4:40 as he got the deflection of Johnny Gaudreau's shot and put it past Lundqvist for his ninth.\n'It was an awful period' Nash appeared to give the Rangers the lead in the final second of the second period, but it was waved off after a review showed the puck went in after the clock had expired.\nAfter the Rangers outshot the Flames 15-13 in the opening period, the chances slowed down in the second.\n\"It was an awful period from both sides,\" Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. \"In the third, I thought we executed better ... and we were able to get two points.\"\nHamilton gave the Flames a 1-0 lead on the power play when his shot from the point deflected off Rangers defenseman Nick Holden and past Lundqvist's glove side for his eighth at 6:59 of the first.\nThe Rangers tied it on their own power play less than two minutes later. Nash got a pass in front from Stepan in front and his second attempt went in for his 15th at 8:55. Ryan McDonagh also had an assist on the goal for his 200th career point.\nNew York scored on the man advantage for the second straight game after going 0 for 15 over their previous five.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:04:16.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
