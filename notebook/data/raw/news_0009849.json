My family was the most important thing to me. \n\"They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age.\" The Duke and Duchess (left) of Cambridge attend the Place2Be Big Assembly with Heads Together for Children's Mental Health Week at the Mitchell Brook Primary School, north London Credit: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror \nT he engagement is part of a series of events the Duke and Duchess are undertaking - many with Prince Harry - to promote the royal trio's Heads Together mental health campaign . \nHeads Together is a umbrella organisation - with Place2Be a member - that aims to change the national conversation around psychological issues to a positive one. \nThe couple watched the assembly from a kindness bench. Normally sited in the school playground, it is used by children who feel lonely or need a chat and other pupils know to come forward and support them. \nOn Sunday they were in very different surroundings with William, Kate and Harry taking to a track at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to support runners taking part in the London Marathon for Heads Together. \nDuring the assembly a Kindness Cup was awarded to Nadia Dhicis, aged 10, who was recognised as the most supportive pupil in the school.
