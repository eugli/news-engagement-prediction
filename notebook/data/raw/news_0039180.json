LOUIS • Mayoral candidate Lyda Krewson is calling on the St. Louis Police Officers’ Association to fire Jeff Roorda, the police union’s business agent, citing “vile and disgusting” comments he has made toward city Treasurer and fellow mayoral hopeful Tishaura Jones. \nRoorda blasted Jones on Facebook on Thursday, calling her lazy, a “cop-hater” and a “race-baiter.” \n“Tishaura and I are both candidates for mayor and are competing hard against each other but I absolutely reject his despicable characterization of her,” Krewson said in a statement. “She is a respected government official and does not deserve this abuse.” \n“When I am mayor, he will not be welcome in my office,” Krewson added. \nThe police union, which represents most of the officers in the city, endorsed Krewson last month. Krewson’s campaign accepted the endorsement but has tried ever since to distance itself from Roorda, who was fired from his position as business manager by the St. Louis County’s police union last summer. \nRoorda also attracted national attention in July when he blamed President Barack Obama for the deaths of five police officers shot by a sniper in Dallas. The now-deleted post showed hands dripping with blood. The caption read: “THIS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, MR. PRESIDENT.” \nIn his Facebook post Thursday, Roorda says one of Jones’ supporters has called him the “worst person to occupy skin.” +3 \nJeff Roorda Facebook post \nIn the post, he also criticizes Jones’ attendance record when she was in the state Legislature, the roughly 50 publicly funded trips she’s taken as treasurer since 2013 and her father’s time in prison over unpaid taxes. Specifically, Roorda refers to Jones as the “daughter-of-a-felon,” the “laziest legislator-of-all-time,” and a “globetrotting-traveler-on-the-taxpayer-dime, cop-hater and race-baiter.” \nHe then goes on to ask his Facebook friends to weigh in on who is a worse person between the two of them. \nFor her part, Jones has used Roorda’s reputation for controversial statements as part of her campaign. At a forum last month, Jones received a loud ovation when she told the audience that she neither met with the police union nor asked for its endorsement. \n“I did not seek the endorsement of the POA because anybody who stands with Roorda, I can’t support,” she said. \nIn calling on Roorda to be fired, Krewson, the city’s 28th Ward alderman, showed a glimpse of camaraderie with Jones in a race where the two candidates have largely ignored each other. “This is not the first time I have felt the need to repudiate Mr. Roorda for his statements,” Krewson said. “He justified today’s repulsive remarks by claiming he had been attacked first by Ms. Jones. That excuse is not acceptable to me. I have seen police officers treated far worse by citizens on the street and still completely maintain their composure and civility.” \nAlderman Antonio French, another mayoral candidate, jumped into the fray on Twitter Thursday night, using a #FireRoorda hashtag and saying Krewson’s comments were overdue. “The silence of Krewson and others has enabled Roorda’s dangerous rhetoric for years,” French said. “We needed them to speak up long ago.” \nIn all, there are seven candidates running in the March 7 Democratic primary.
