Speaking at a press conference, Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, clarified the current policy on translators and interpreters who receive what’s known as a special immigrant visa.\nStory Continued Below\n“Lawful permanent residents and special immigrant visa holders are allowed to board their flights ... and will be processed for a waiver upon arrival,” he said. \nThe announcement was the latest step in the chaotic rollout of Trump’s immigration policy. On Friday, the president signed an executive order that would freeze the U.S. refugee program for four months and ban for three months visitors from seven majority-Muslim nations.\nThe vague language of the order and its hasty implementation created considerable distress and confusion at U.S. and international airports. Lawful permanent residents and other valid visa holders were detained by customs agents, and lawyers said they were denied access to the detainees. \n\nSpicer takes issue with 'ban' label used by Trump By Louis Nelson \nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a clarification to the new policy Sunday, stating that lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders) from the seven banned nations could request a waiver to enter the U.S.\nThe fate of Iraqi translators and interpreters with special immigrant visas was uncertain. The detention of two Iraqis detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City led a federal judge to block deportations of valid visa holders, even if they came from the banned countries.\nOn Monday, federal authorities at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reportedly detained a wheelchair-bound special immigrant visa holder for 15 hours, according to a legal aid group. An FAQ posted Tuesday on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website said no special immigrant visa holders had since Friday been denied entry to the U.S.\nMcAleenan said customs and border officials at airports have granted waivers to 1,060 lawful permanent residents and 75 individuals holding immigrant and non-immigrant visas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:49:49.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
