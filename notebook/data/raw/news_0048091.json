Olympus, built in 1929 by New York Yacht, Launch and Engine Co. in… more The classic motor yacht M.V. Olympus which has been the Pacific Northwest since 1942 has just been sold for an undisclosed price and will head out of Lake Union through the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks in Ballard for the last time on Feb. 26. Owner and Seattle Yacht Club member Diane Lander has invited the public to gather at the locks at 1:30 that afternoon to wave goodbye, and she also hopes that a flotilla of classic and other boats will follow the Olympus from its final exodus from Morrison’s North Star Marine Fuel Dock in Lake Union to the Ballard Locks. 34 photos The 97-foot M.V. Olympus, built in 1929 by New York Yacht, Launch and Engine Co. in… more Built in 1929 by the New York Yacht, Launch & Engine Co., the 97-foot yacht was originally named Junaluska and was built for George Heck , the president of the New York Stock Exchange. Lander, who with her husband John VanDerbeek , acquired this boat in 1994 for $500,000 from Newport, Oregon, owner Norman Halliday , says they spent a fortune restoring it from stem to stern. “We put in several millions of dollars,” she says, “and we loved it. We used it for our own personal use a lot and we also chartered it out and we donated it for dinners and cruises to charities as well.” Lander knows every inch of this yacht and is emotional about seeing it leave. “For 24 years I’ve put my heart and soul into this boat, and it is very hard letting her go,” she says. Maintenance costs make it impossible for Lander to keep it, however, and it was sold earlier this month, by Brian Holland at Fraser Yachts in Seattle, to a young businessman who does not want his name disclosed. “He is a New Yorker,” says Lander, “who has an international public relations business. He is 42 years old, married with 3-year-old twin boys; he loves history and has restored a 1700s house on the Hudson River. He has never owned a boat before.” For sale for the last three years, listed at $950,000, the Olympus’ route will take it first to Victoria, British Columbia, where it will be put on a transport ship which will deliver it through the Panama Canal and up to North Carolina for survey work. Then it will enter New York Harbor in May. Lander has been invited to be on board and she plans on it. The boat was built on the Hudson River and now almost 90 years later is returning to its roots. The yacht was owned by several East Coast residents before it was bought by George Converse , commodore of the Newport Beach Yacht Club and husband to silent movie star Anita Stewart . He took the boat through the Panama Canal and brought it to Newport Beach in 1938. “In the mid 1940s,” says Lander, “in World War II it was conscripted by the U.S. government to patrol the waters between Prince Rupert, B.C., and Ketchikan, Alaska. There were eight guys on board and one had a rifle. They would send an SOS if they found an enemy submarine.” The whole yacht was painted Navy gray for this term of duty. It was after the war that President Harry Truman told his longtime friend Washington Gov. Monrad Wallgren that the government was going to auction off the yacht. Wallgren acquired it for $18,000 with money from the state’s Department of Fisheries. Rather than using it for the Fisheries' patrol vessel, the governor used it as a pleasure boat and refurbished it for more than $100,000, expenditures which had been earmarked for saving saltwater fisheries. He rechristened the yacht, changing the name from Junaluska to Olympus in a ceremony at Rosario mansion on Orcas Island and had Truman and other dignitaries on board many times. An investigative report of his misspending of the money uncovered by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer sank that chapter, and new governor Arthur Langlie promptly sold the boat. Since then it was owned by some well known names – Roy Maryatt , Howard S. Wright Sr. with George Schuchart ; Crowley Maritime used it as its corporate yacht; and the late Jerry Schei of Western Yacht Sales, who had entered into a boat charter business purchasing, with four others, the Olympus and the 107-foot M.V. Malibu, which is now owned by Windermere. The Olympus, with its mahogany and teak interior, can cruise 3,000 miles on 1,600 gallons of fuel at speed of 10 knots, says Lander. The yacht can accommodate eight guests in four cabins: a master suite, VIP suite, a double and a twin, all with bathroom facilities, and all located in the aft portion of the yacht. Crew quarters for four and the maintenance facilities are located forward; a wine cellar is hidden in the floor of one of the crew bunk rooms. A large formal dining room, salon, wet bar area and commercial galley are all in mint condition, as well as the fantail lounge with its dinette/settee and wrap-around stern seating. The entire fantail area is enclosed in clear isinglass, making it usable in any weather. Among the many well known names who have been aboard this yacht for fully crewed luxury charters are: Candice Bergen , Bill Ford III, media executive Barry Diller , former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan , Disney’s Michael Eisner , Intel’s Andy Grove, Julie Andrews and her husband Blake Edwards , and more. “The yacht served as home for Robin Williams during the filming of the movie ‘Insomnia,’ ” writes Lander in a flyer, “and he treated his co-stars Al Pacino and Hilary Swank to dinner and drinks ... ” She says the yacht was used to transport governors to Bill Gates ’ Medina manse during the 2006 National Governors Conference.
