Express photo \nTHE tiger that has struck terror in the Sindewahi and Shivni ranges of Chandrapur district may be shot dead if the situation goes out of control. \nPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Shri Bhagwan has issued shoot orders “as a last resort”. Talking to The Indian Express, Bhagwan said, “I am going out of town for a few days. I have asked my officers to take the call, if needed, in my absence… But that is only as a last resort…” \nWatch What Else Is Making News \nMeanwhile, the tiger, whose gender is not known, has apparently moved again in the Shivni and Karwa areas of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve buffer.

But on Tuesday, the sighting of new pug marks in that area, has added to the confusion. \n“It is of a different tiger. So we need to be extra careful when we act against the so-called problem tiger.
