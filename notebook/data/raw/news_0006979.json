Selvaraja preparing the lantern-themed kavadi at River Road, Penang. \nGEORGE TOWN: Kavadi maker Y. Rajasingham was inspired to design a festive themed kavadi after seeing Chinese New Year lanterns strung over several roads here. \nHe spent two days making the kavadi, which featured seven lanterns painted in red, orange and yellow. \nThe kavadi also has pictures of Lord Ganesha and Lord Muruga on each side. \nRajasingham, 27, said it would be given to a Chinese friend of his who carries the kavadi during Thaipusam every year. \n“Chap Goh Meh and Thaipusam will be celebrated close to each other this year. \n“With many roads all nicely lit with red lanterns during the festive season, I decided to incorporate the two cultures together,” he said. \nThe three-day Thaipusam celebration will begin on Feb 8 while the Chap Goh Meh, which falls on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year, is on Feb 11. \n“The lantern-themed kavadi is a first for me. \n“I would make more kavadis with multi-racial flavours from now on. \n“We are now making a kavadi that features roosters as the base. This is the Year of the Rooster,” he said at the Sri Raja Muniswarar Temple in River Road yesterday. \nRajasingham, who runs an event management company here, has been making kavadi for 10 years. \n“I work with a team of four to make kavadi each year. We usually make about 10 kavadi a year but this year, we managed to make 14,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:24:04.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
