Ashton Kutcher’s emotional speech on fighting child abuse is so important \nShe explained: ‘I love Adam, but I wasn’t ready to settle down and commit to just one man.’ \nWhen she tried to break up with Adam, he was devastated. He suggested they stay together, agreeing she could have sex with other men so long as she was completely honest about it. Beatrice says the arrangement keeps them happy (Picture: Twitter) \n‘It’s the perfect situation, I have a boyfriend I love but also get to have fun with other men when I want to,’ she told The Sun . \nBeatrice says she sometimes feels a little guilty about seeing other people, but after a chat and a cuddle with Adam things quickly get back to normal. \nExplaining why he sacrificed his preference for monogamy, Adam said he’d rather this than lose her completely. \nAdding: ‘We decided this is the best way to take the relationship forward so I have become used to it.’ \nHe insists he’s not interested in chasing other women and while he feels jealous when she talks about bedding other guys, he keeps his emotions inside, claiming he’s learnt to deal with his feelings.
