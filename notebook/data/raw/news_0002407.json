casual and non-casual. \nBoth of them declined to be named. \nThey said when a cabin crew member takes an MC because of a flu or minor ailments such as stomach ache and fever, it is considered a casual MC. \nOne of them, who has been with the company for several years, said when they take a casual MC, it can affect their promotion prospects and renewal of contract. \nFEAR \nShe claimed she has not taken a casual MC for the past eight years for fear it would affect her record. \nShe said: \"It prevents people from abusing MCs, but if you're sick it is a whole different thing. \n\"It is easy to spread the flu especially when you are in an enclosed area and the air doesn't circulate.\" \nThey said more serious conditions, such as conjunctivitis or torn muscles, are considered non-casual MCs and they will not be penalised for taking them. \nThe SIA spokesman added: \"Crew members who are given medical leave are encouraged to rest and recuperate at home. \n\"Operating with an MC is a disciplinary lapse. \n\"Crew members are granted up to 28 days of paid medical leave and six months of paid hospitalisation (non-casual) leave due to chronic or prolonged illness. \n\"Crew members diagnosed with tuberculosis or cancer are given additional paid leave.\" \nMr Lim had also claimed points are deducted from crew members' annual service performance for every MC they take. \nIn response to this, the spokesman said: \"As with all other businesses, employee productivity and attendance at work is important for a successful airline operation. \n\"Although crew attendance is a component in the performance management process, we would like to emphasise that crew performance is nonetheless still measured across many other factors.\" \nThe second air stewardess said the MC practice should be reviewed. \nShe said: \"We face issues such as jet lag, adjusting to different temperatures and meal times that could potentially affect our health. \n\"A flu can lead to severe consequences. So can that be considered casual?\" \nThis article was first published on Feb 4, 2017. Get The New Paper for more stories. Sign up for our e-newsletter now!
