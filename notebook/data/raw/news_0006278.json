The US has deployed a vessel to monitor the area for any visible signs of oil on the shoreline and vowed to initiate immediate clean-up procedures if any is detected. The USS Antietam was able to safely return to Yokosuka Naval base with the help of tug boats following the incident and continuing inspections show that oil is no longer leaking from the ship, the Navy said. Read More An investigation is underway to assess the full extent of the damage to the ship, according to the Navy. The 567-foot USS Antietam was commissioned in 1987 and is part of the US Navy's permanent rotation of forces deployed in the Pacific. While it is primarily equipped for anti-submarine warfare, the Antietam is also capable of defeating threats from the air, land and sea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:45:27.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
