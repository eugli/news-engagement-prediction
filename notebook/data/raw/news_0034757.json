While you could argue ICE is just proud of the job it's done—which according to its website includes enforcing immigration laws \"in a fair and effective manner\" and detaining \"individuals when necessary\"—others are questioning the timing of the tweet. Today is the national \"Day Without Immigrants\" strike, in which immigrants—many of whom are legally in this country or are on legal paths to citizenship—have walked out of work in protest of Donald Trump's \"crackdown\" on undocumented immigrants. This includes the more than 680 arrests of immigrants made by ICE agents last weekend. \nMany are pointing out the insensitivity of the message on Twitter. Screenshot via ICE/Twitter Twitter eggs following the ICE, on the other hand, encouraged the agency to keep up the good work. ICE/Twitter Maybe next Thursday we can throwback to a simpler time, like 2001, when government entities didn't do so much of their communication via social media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:03:34.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
