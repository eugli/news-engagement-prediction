Chrapkiewicz, made a new name for himself: Kid Perfect. \nBetween them, the father and son duo from Oak Lawn have bowled for 50 years. What are the chances that they would roll their first 300 games within a week of each other? \nA smart gambler doesn't play those odds. \n\"Just unreal,\" Mike said. \"I got to gloat for one week about family honors. It didn't last long.\" \nThe Chrapkiewicz family is bursting with bowling tradition. Mike started as a young lad at the old Miami Bowl on 50th and Archer in Chicago. Michael L. threw his first ball there as well, and later became a league bowler at El-Mar Bowl in Bridgeview. \nMichael L. has a younger brother, Rick, who also bowls on their team in the Friday Early Bowlers League. Their mom, Lynn, was a 2017 Beat the Champs qualifier. \nPrior to his big night, Mike's previous high game was a 290, shot when he was in his early 40s. Michael L. had a 299 game five years ago. \n\"On the 12th ball I thought off my hand I had it,\" Michael L. said. \"It came up light and left a 10 pin. I was devastated.\" \nFor both, another shot at glory would come. \nMike's chance came in the third game, on a night in which he was already bowling well. In the first game he fired a 222 — well over his 196 average. In Game 2, he shot 189. \nThen, the left-hander and his Lane Masters Xtreme Damage ball locked in. \nNo Brooklyns. No slop. No messengers. \nThe only time he sweated was before the ninth frame. \n\"I've thrown three in a row in the 10th thousands of times,\" Mike said. \"But the ninth frame is the one that gets you there. I was nervous on that ball.\" \nNo problem. Neither were the three strikes he shot in the 10th, although the last one came from a board wider than he would have liked. \n\"It had a little more (rev) on it, though,\" Mike said. \"It went right to the pocket.\" \nMichael L. is also a lefty. He serves as the team sub, and in 10 previous weeks maintained a 208 average. \nOn Feb. 17, he was needed to fill in, and left his Storm Virtual Gravity in the car while he was at work. \n\"I really didn't think anything about it, but it was warm that day,\" Michael L. said. \"When I pulled my ball out of the bag it was bleeding oil. I couldn't get it to stop the whole first game.\" \nHe didn't throw his first strike until the ninth frame. It was a clean game, though, good enough for a 200. \nThen the strikes started piling up. \n\"I was definitely thinking about it when I got the sixth one,\" Michael L. said. \"It started creeping into my head, 'Hey, it might be cool if we did this back to back.' But it didn't seem real until the ninth frame. That's when I started getting nervous.\" \nLike his dad, Michael L. had no problem in the ninth. On his first ball in the 10th, he held his breath. \n\"I tugged it inside,\" he said. \"But I got a lucky break and it went down.\" \nAs Michael L. finished his perfecto, his younger brother recorded it all on his cell phone. \n\"At the end I could hear my dad cheering in the background,\" Michael L. said. \"When he shot his 300, I was the first one to greet him with a hug. When I shot mine, he was the first one to hug me.\" \nAs for Rick… \n\"He'll have some pressure on him this week,\" dad said with a laugh. \nTwitter @tbaranek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:06:01.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
