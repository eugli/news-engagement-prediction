The heartwarming clips have also been shared by hundreds of thousands and gained the fathers plenty of new fans. 'This is the cutest thing I've seen on FB. Ever,' wrote one user.

'Saying thank you doesn't seem to cover how we feel. We are so overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from around the world,' the statement read. 'Thank you for recognizing the beauty, love, and joy that dance can bring into the world. It just proves that art, love and family are the international language.'
