She was taken to hospital for treatment (file picture) \n\"Our thoughts are with the child and their family at this extremely difficult time. \n\"The area was evacuated following the partial collapse of the ceiling. \n\"At the time of the collapse, there were about 40 people in the sports hall. \n\"It is possible that the collapse of the ceiling was caused by the adverse weather conditions that the country has been experiencing overnight and into today. \n\"However, we will be conducting a joint-investigation with Buckinghamshire Fire & Rescue Service to determine the cause. \n\"Representatives from Milton Keynes Council also attended the scene.\" \nPolice said a cordon is in place at the scene but no other buildings have been affected. \nA school spokesman said: \"We are co-operating fully with the relevant authorities in this investigation. \n\"Our thoughts are of course with this child and her family at this very difficult time.\" \nIt comes after horrified witnesses described the moment a woman was \"near-decapitated\" by falling debris outside a Starbucks during 90mph Storm Doris winds. \nEmergency services were called to Wolverhampton at 11.43am following reports of a serious incident outside the coffee shop in the town centre's Dudley Street. \nWest Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed a piece of debris fell onto the street leading to 15 999 calls. \nEyewitnesses say the victim appeared to be a young woman in her 20s and she was drinking outside the coffee shop at the time of the incident. \nStorm Doris: Live updates as one woman killed and more injured as 100mph winds cause traffic chaos (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nKitty Jenkins, 38, a Holland and Barrett shop worker, said: \"I was out on my lunch hour when it happened. \n\"A piece of debris from the roof just came down and hit her. She went down straight away. \n\"There was blood everywhere..\" (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nWitnesses said the area was busy with shoppers at the time and some commuters were seen in tears following the tragedy. \nIt comes after a series of incidents across the UK this afternoon following strong winds caused by Storm Doris. \nA 19-year-old student, who did not want to be named, added: \"My friend saw what happened and had to go home this afternoon, she was in pieces. \n\"She said the poor girl was near-decapitated. It's absolutely horrendous.\" \nRebecca Davis, a 40-year-old teacher from Wolverhampton, walked past Starbucks shortly after the incident and saw a woman receiving CPR. \nShe said the woman appeared to have been hit by something resembling a piece of roof which had fallen off a building nearby. (Photo: Caters News Agency) \n\"I think the wind broke it and caused it to fall. I don't know if it was hit by something else or just the wind did it,\" she said. \nShe said that while the woman had been hit \"right outside Starbucks\", it was unclear if the debris had fallen from the coffee shop or from a nearby building. \n\"I don't think anyone else was hurt. It was a big piece about the size of a coffee table but I think it just hit her,\" Mrs Davis said. \nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: “On arrival, crews found a woman who had suffered very serious head injuries. \n\"Sadly, it quickly became apparent that there was nothing that could be done to save her and she was confirmed dead at the scene.” \nWhat to do if your flight or train is cancelled because of Storm Doris - Your rights and how to check if your journey is affected (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nThe woman's identity or her age are not yet known with police in the process of contacting her next of kin. Local resident Alexander Bushell, 44, said the falling debris looked \"pretty heavy\". \n\"She wouldn't have stood a chance,\" he said. \nA spokesman for Starbucks said: \"We are shocked and saddened by this terrible incident. We are supporting the police with their investigation and our store will remain closed until further notice.\" \nIn Whitechapel, east London, a woman was injured after an advertising hoarding fell injuring her head.
