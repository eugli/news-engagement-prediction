The Minister remained non-committal on privatising the airline, but said taxpayers’ money cannot be committed forever, and it needs to be run in a professional manner. Edited excerpts: Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian in the Economic Survey 2017 stopped short of suggesting that the government should privatise Air India. What do you think of his views? \nThe performance of Air India in recent times has gone up. It is a good airline but its finances are bad. Last year, it didn’t make an operating loss, but a profit which is probably worth not talking about. This year, it will make an operational profit again. But it’s in a kind of debt trap. The government had committed money and around ₹23,000 crore has already been released. After that money comes in, what about its finances? It is still in a debt trap. So something has to be done. It’s a nice airline, and I have been saying that right from day one in office. Even in Parliament, I said that I will not do Air India bashing. We can’t commit the taxpayers’ money for eternity. If you leave it like this, there will be a downhill slide and one fine day it will close shop. If some strategies come in then it can survive and compete. Is privatisation one of the strategies? \nIt has a big debt. You put the airline on the market and no one will buy it. What do you do? People who are well-versed with finances will have to start thinking on those lines. There was a proposal to ask banks to convert part of the airline’s debt into equity. \nThat could be a way. If a consortium of banks decides that they will pick up part equity so that it’s not in a debt trap, then Air India — if it works the way it is working — still has a chance of coming out. Otherwise, with all the money put in and some legacy issues, it’s a problem. \nWe can’t commit the taxpayers’ money for eternity. How far have the banks been convinced? \nI haven’t even started talking to them. Ideas are floating and probably Air India would have themselves approached the banks to see whether they are willing or not. The die-hard people will say it should remain [in the] public sector or crash — they will go that way. I would like it to survive. As a public sector entity? \nSurvive — whether public or private sector. Serve the Indian skies because its reach is the best in India. Among Indian players, Air India is one of the best in ferrying Indians abroad and bringing them back. There was a news report which said that there is a plan to list Air India on stock markets. Is that true? \nYou should ask an Air India employee whether he would like to buy stock in Air India then you would know (laughs). The thing is that stock options are generally nice, provided people are willing to take it up. Financially, the airline’s books are bad. That’s the main issue. Do you think Air India would require more equity from the government beyond 2021-22 as envisaged in the turnaround plan? \nFirst of all it requires a professional management. It has to run like an airline and then things would work. \nFinancially, the airline’s books are bad. That’s the main issue. During the previous government’s tenure, a group of officers suggested to Cabinet Ministers that once the airline reaches a certain growth rate, it can be privatised. Is the government contemplating this option? \nFirst of all, has it come anywhere near profitability? It’s nowhere near that. The turnaround and the financial restructuring plan have all come in. What is the result? Has it come out of its debt-trap? There are a lot of legacy issues. Air India’s debt is the problem. If you can solve that problem, the puzzle of Air India will get solved. It’s unfair to the taxpayer if you have to keep pouring their money there. Beyond a point, it just can’t happen. Provided the debt issue is resolved, will the government look at privatising Air India? \nI would like Air India to survive. I have told some friends this is something like the old story of King Solomon where two women come to him claiming the same baby to be theirs. So one mother says you cut the baby in half, the other one says if this is going to be justice of cutting the baby in half, I would rather have my baby living with the other mother than dead. There are hardly any choices here. I would like Air India to survive and fly Indian skies proudly. That’s my wish whether in the public or the private sector. But if you see it dying, you don’t want to let it die. That’s it. But I can’t commit the taxpayers’ money for eternity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:50:50.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
