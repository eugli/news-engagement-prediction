Bernie Sanders speaks at the Theatre at the Ace Hotel on Sunday in downtown Los Angeles. (Michael Owen Baker / For The Times) Javier Panzar got a rock star’s welcome when he spoke in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday in what was theoretically a book tour stop but amounted to more of a political rally, urging progressives to play by new rules as they resist President Trump ’s administration.\n“We are looking at a totally new political world,” he said. “If we play by the old rules, we will lose and they will win. Our job is not to play by the old rules.” \nSanders, 75, used the stage at the Theatre at the Ace Hotel as part of Los Angeles Times Ideas Exchange to buttress his pitch to reshape and redefine the Democratic Party after its 2016 drubbing. \nSince Trump’s electoral college victory, Sanders has secured a spot on the Senate Democrats’ leadership team and begun to reassert the populist political vision that won him millions of votes against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. \nSanders applauded the activism that has sprung up since Trump’s inauguration and said Democrats and progressives needed to continue to build a resistance to Trump as well as a vision for the future. \n“We can defeat Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology,” he said. “We have to understand, despair and throwing up your hands — that ain’t an option.” \nSanders believes a majority of voters agree with progressive values, but he sought to explain Trump’s electoral college win, arguing the party did not do enough to appeal to economically downtrodden industrial workers. \nSanders said Trump — whom he called a “phony billionaire” — seized on anxiety and fear among working-class voters on his way to victory. Trump, he argued, did not win the election “so much as the Democratic Party lost the election” by not answering the call of those workers. \nHe asked voters to put themselves in the “hearts and the souls” of workers who have lost jobs and who feel left behind by the global economy. \n“What that means in my view is that Donald Trump has a mandate for nothing … [and] positions advocated by Trump are in a minority, and in a distinct minority,” he said. \nSanders repeated many of the populist platforms he ran on, including rallying against the influence of money in politics and a financial system he says rewards Wall Street bankers while the American middle class shrinks. \nThe key to a progressive resurgence, he said, could be turning Trump’s message on its head by persuading workers who have lost jobs that foreign workers who come to the U.S. in search of a better life are not their enemies. Instead, he said, corporate greed is the main cause of their economic woes. \nSanders began on Sunday by thanking California voters who cast ballots for him, and shouts of “Bernie 2020” rang out multiple times in the sold-out theater. \nClinton won Los Angeles County and California by large margins, but Sanders found support in pockets of Santa Monica and Silver Lake, as well as northeast and downtown Los Angeles. \nSanders’ campaign found a fount of support in Los Angeles during the primary, holding rallies with hip rock bands and liberal celebrities and drawing cheers from picnickers while walking around Echo Park Lake. \nUpdates on California politics » Caption President Trump lashes out over Australia refugee deal \nTrump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. \nTrump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center.
