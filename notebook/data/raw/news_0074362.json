Article continues below Watch: Man United fans absolutely love Wayne Rooney's reaction to Ibrahimovic's winner \nSpeaking to the media at his son’s 40th birthday in California, Mayweather Sr said: \n“I’m going to tell you something. At the end of the day, if Floyd decides to take that fight, I’m going to be with him. The fight ain’t going to be about 2 rounds anyway. I’m just telling you the honest truth. \n\"McGregor can talk. Personally man I’ll tell you the truth, when I was talking to that young dude (another reporter) lately, about two weeks ago, I told him already anyway. If Conor McGregor want to fight come see Floyd Mayweather Senior.” \nOne reporter followed that statement with a question of what Mayweather Sr would do to the Notorious if they faced off. \n“Stop him,” he replied, “Stop him cold. He’s 29, 28? I’m over twice his age. I’ll whoop him real bad.” \nMayweather Sr couldn’t be any clearer, then. He doesn’t rate McGregor’s as a boxer. An understandable stance, since the Irishman has yet to compete in a professional bout, having spent his career in UFC’s octagon. \nIt’s an opinion shared by many, but most fans would love to see it happen. If it does – and we really hope it does – then don’t expect Mayweather Sr to sit and watch the build-up quietly. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
