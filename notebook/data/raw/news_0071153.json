We're not confident enough,\" Calipari said. \"We should be. I don't get it.\" \nHe seemed to single out some of UK's veteran players. \n\"I don't understand guys, especially seniors, not being excited to show what they're about.\" \nAfter losing three of four in late January and early February, the Wildcats have now reeled off five wins in a row, but are far from playing its best basketball of the season. \nThey'll need to be at their best Saturday when they host No. 12 Florida (23-5, 13-2 SEC) in a game that will likely decide the SEC regular season championship.
