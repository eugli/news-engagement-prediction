The public can compete in a slice-eating contest (watch for sign-up to begin in a few weeks), and industry members will face off in dough-tossing and pizza-box-folding competitions. \nLast yearâ€™s Pizza Summit featured a surprise guest, musician and self-styled \"King of Partying\" Andrew W.K. This year? Spina remained mum on what surprises are in store. Over the next couple of weeks, expect organizers to tease more events and names of participating restaurants across Old Style's social media channels (@oldstylebeer). \nThe one-day event, held at Chop Shop in Wicker Park (2033 W. North Ave.), is organized in partnership with Empty Bottle Presents. Tickets ($35) include all-you-can-eat pizza, five beer tickets good for Old Style or Old Style Light beer, and an Old Style pizza-shaped plate. The first session will run from 2 to 5 p.m.; the second session from 6 to 9 p.m. \nTickets go on sale at www.emptybottle.com on Thursday, Feb. 9 beginning at noon. Last year, they sold out in less than an hour. \njbhernandez@chicagotribune.com Twitter @joeybear85 \nFirst, we found the best hot chocolate in Chicago .
