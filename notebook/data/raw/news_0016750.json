A leading contender in wall! Disaster for @KATSUMASA_CHIYO #B12hr pic.twitter.com/zR1jZqcmHm — Bathurst 12 Hour (@Bathurst12hour) February 3, 2017 \nThe driver was okay — punching the wheel in frustration — but the car was not. \n“I was too close to the inside wall,” Chiyo explained. \n“I thought it might just be a scratch but the tyre angle caused the damage. The tyre gripped on the wall. That pushed everything, the suspension on the left front.” — Bathurst 12 Hour (@Bathurst12hour) February 3, 2017 \nThe broken car was brought back down to the paddock on a flat-bed truck, spending several minutes in the Parc Ferme area as the Nissan crew worked to get cradles under the car to push it back to the garage. \nThe crash came just 20 minutes after Nissan completed an overnight rebuild on their No. 24 car after Florian Strauss crashed during Practice 3 on Friday. \nAlthough there is less damage to the No. 23 car, the team is still up against it to get the car ready for qualifying later on Saturday. #23 making its way back to the garage.

Immediately I try to stop the car and bring the car back, because we have limited time to qually. \n“I hope we can fix the car before qually. We try our best.” \nThe first of the two qualifying sessions gets underway at 10:40am AEDT — about 85 minutes after the damaged Nissan arrived in the team’s garage. \nHowever, the No. 23 car doesn’t need to be ready until as late as 11:50am, when the second qualifying session exclusively for Class A cars gets underway. \nChiyo’s crash, which, ended the session prematurely, was the second major crash of the one-hour session. \nThe No. 62 R-Motorsport Aston Martin crashed heavily on the run up Mountain Straight. \nJan Struve was at the wheel when the car veered right just after crossing the hump in the straight, slamming heavily into the wall before sliding to rest on the left side of the circuit. \nThe car was badly damaged along the left side and is in doubt for qualifying, if not the race as well. — Bathurst 12 Hour (@Bathurst12hour) February 3, 2017 \nThe truncated session was topped by the No. 75 Audi of Garth Tander/Christopher Mies/Christopher Haase, ahead of the No. 11 McLaren and No. 60 BMW. \nThe No. 23 Nissan was fourth fastest despite Chiyo’s crash, while the No. 74 Audi rounded out the top three. \nRESULTS — Practice 5, Bathurst 12 Hour (60 min) 1.
