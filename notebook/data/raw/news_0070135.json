System would continue the work of the Project Noah Team which conclude its engagement with the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).” \nProject Noah was an initiative that started in UP which was eventually adopted by the DOST. It is a state-run flood and rain forecasting system created due to Typhoon “Sendong” in 2011 as a part of DOST’s Disaster Risk Reduction R&D Program.

Board of Regents ensures that the multidisciplinary applied and operational researches of Project NOAH, which has been critical to saving lives and property, continue,” Farolan wrote. \n“The move also allows government agencies and funding institutions to continue supporting component projects of Project NOAH and for communities and DRRM-involved offices to benefit from the program,” he further explained. \nOn January 30, DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña said that state weather bureau, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), would take over the operations of its Project Noah.

The results are useful and should be institutionalized in regular government agencies whose mandates cover these areas,” he added.
