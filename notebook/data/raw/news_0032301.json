A man pretending to be the pop star's manager promised The Giving Back Fund a performance in exchange for four VIP tickets. \nEd Sheeran 's celebrity was used in a Super Bowl scam that promised a U.S. charity a performance in exchange for VIP tickets to the event. \nTMZ reports a scammer contacted the The Giving Back Fund pretending to be Sheeran's manager, proposing Sheeran would two perform at the nonprofit's pre-Super Bowl event in Houston on Feb. 4 for four VIP tickets to the big fame the following day. He even took the liberty of presenting a fraudulent performing contract with Sheeran's forged signature. \nThe alleged manager met with the charity beforehand to accept the tickets, which are reportedly worth $50,000. They never saw him again, nor Sheeran -- who was on tour in Australia at the time. \nOnce The Giving Back Fund sorted out they were being scammed, they contacted police, who informed them the tickets had been re-sold. \nIf the perpetrator is caught, he could face felony charges, TMZ reports. \nBillboard reached out to Sheeran's rep for comment but did not receive an immediate response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:04:37.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
