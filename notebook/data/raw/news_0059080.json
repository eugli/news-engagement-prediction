No student’s outcomes should be subject to this lottery system - when students are given inferior resources, they’re much more likely to fall behind & stay behind for their entire academic career. \nFront Row provides students with the means to not only stay on track, but to actively develop the skills they need to be motivated, self-starting learners for their entire lives. We arm teachers with the data they need to support every student individually, and we provide students with the skills they need to take control of their education. \nIf you’re passionate about the same things we are, we want to hear from you! \nMore about us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:08:24.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
