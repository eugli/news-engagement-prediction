Source: Supplied\nSafeWork SA said the case was dropped “following legal advice” and after SRG entered into a legally binding agreement to improve its procedures, processes and training programs to improve safety.\nIt would also pay for an annual award in Mr Castillo-Riffo’s name to be presented at the SA Training Awards and expresssed “deep regret” over the death.\nMs Gurner-Hall – who said she would continue to campaign for a Coroner’s inquest into the death – said SRG had shown her a “great deal of respect”, in contrast to HYLC.\n“HYLC have been obstructionist, they’ve not been clear or transparent and they’ve not shown any accountability,” she said.\nPam Gurner-Hall at her partner’s memorial. Source: News Corp Australia\nCFMEU assistant secretary Jim O’Connor said it was a “disgrace” that SafeWork SA had dropped all charges.\n“Someone has gone to work and paid the ultimate price and 27 months down the track what are we getting?” he said.\nSRG said it had been “deeply impacted” by Mr Castillo-Riffo’s death and “sincerely regrets” the incident occurred.\nSafeWork SA’s decision to drop charges over Mr Castillo-Riffo’s death comes almost a year after father of two, Stephen Wyatt, 63, died in a similar accident on the new RAH site.\nThe Advertiser has sought comment from HYLC.\nTimelapse shows 12 months of work on new RAH 3:59 A timelapse condenses 12 months of construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital into just a few minutes.
