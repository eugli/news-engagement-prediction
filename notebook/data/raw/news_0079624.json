Could he develop an offensive game? \nWould he be able to thrive on a roster and in an organization that included some of the NBA’s most iconic players over the past couple of decades? \nNow in his sixth season in the league, Leonard has answered those questions and has done so emphatically. \nAveraging just 7.9 points over 24.0 minutes per game as a rookie, Leonard has progressively improved on both ends of the court every season and is having an MVP-level season this year, putting up 25.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. \nThe two-time Defensive Player of the Year also leads the team with a career-high 17.6 field goal attempts per game, a clear indication that he’s taken on the primary role on the offensive end of the floor as well. \nAs a result of his elite status, teammate Pau Gasol, who has played with a number of talented stars over the course of his decorated career, has voiced high praise for Leonard. \nNoting that Kobe Bryant is on his own level, it seems as though Gasol would be willing to place Leonard in the group right below him. \nEarlier this season, he also shared his admiration for Leonard, via Sam Amick of USA TODAY Sports . \n“He’s (Kawhi Leonard) a special player, without a question. I’ve been around, and I’ve played against incredible players, but this guy is just unique. He’s definitely very confident and determined. He may not talk too much, and might keep it quiet most of the time, but his demeanor and his swagger is pretty high even though he doesn’t show much. He doesn’t express it. The way he plays, it’s pretty obvious.” \nWhile he’s quiet, his elite play does a whole lot of talking.
