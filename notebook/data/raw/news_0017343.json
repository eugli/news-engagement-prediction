Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said he advised President Trump on his immigration order. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times Rudolph Giuliani , having correctly predicted the crippling October surprise of the presidential campaign, appears to have talked himself into the middle of a historic confrontation between the president and the judiciary. Mr. Giuliani is emerging as a tribune of truth, perhaps inadvertently, about the intent behind President Trump’s executive order suspending or barring the entry of refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. On Thursday, a federal appeals court ruled that the possibility of unlawful religious discrimination in the order was a central legal issue that must be decided. Until that and allegations of violations of due process are resolved, the court ruled, Mr. Trump’s order should not go into effect. The administration’s arguments that the courts could not review the president’s order “run contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” a three-judge panel ruled. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called for “ a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” \nAdvertisement   No specific religion is mentioned in the executive order, which was issued on Jan. 27, but the appeals court said it must examine evidence that the order was meant to carry out a Muslim ban. That would include an interview Mr. Giuliani gave the day after it was issued. Speaking to Fox News, he cast himself as the architect. Asked if the new order had anything to do with religion, Mr. Giuliani held forth on how it had been devised and what he said had been his role in carrying out Mr. Trump’s wishes. “I’ll tell you the whole history of it,” Mr. Giuliani said on Fox. “So when he first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up and said, ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.’” By focusing the order not on religion but on areas of the world that created danger for the United States, Mr. Giuliani said, the ban is “perfectly sensible, perfectly legal.” Now federal courts are considering if the order is, in fact, “perfectly legal.” Congress and the Constitution give a president broad control over the country’s borders . One explicit limit is that a president may not refuse immigrants visas because of their race, sex, nationality, place of birth or residence. August Flentje, a lawyer from the Department of Justice, argued this week before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that judges cannot try to find out if a president disguised some of the reasons for an executive order. The “best evidence” of the president’s intent is the language of the order, he said, adding: “That is the end of the inquiry.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
