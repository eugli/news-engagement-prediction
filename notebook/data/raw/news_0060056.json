Once hailed as one of the brightest young things in English football, the 21-year-old’s career has taken a big hit after injury and an apparent failure to win over Jose Mourinho. \nNotably left out of United’s squad to take on Saint-Etienne in the Europa League this week, it’s hard to see what games Mourinho would trust Shaw in between now and the end of the season after he admitted the former Southampton man is now his fourth choice at left-back . Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nFew would have seen this coming when the Red Devils paid the Saints £30million for him in 2014, and it seems like overly harsh treatment for a player still recovering from a horrific leg break that left him out of action for almost a year. \nShaw won’t have lost his talent just like that, so if speculation is to be believed there could be clubs queuing up for him this summer as he reportedly considers his future at Old Trafford. \nHere’s a look at four teams who could match Shaw’s own ambitions and might realistically be in for him as an upgrade on their current left-back options… Chelsea Shaw is a Chelsea fan and nearly joined them from Southampton (Picture: Getty) \nThere’s been speculation that Chelsea are interested in Shaw again , having first tried to sign him during his days at Southampton. Rumour Mill: our round-up of football gossip, rumours and speculation \nThe 21-year-old could be ideally suited to playing wing-back for Antonio Conte’s 3-4-3 system, and despite the fine form of Marcos Alonso, the Blues do appear to be searching for an upgrade. \nConte’s side have been linked with a number of other left-backs, but if Shaw is made available could they do well to revisit this transfer? If given regular games and used in a more attacking role, Shaw could finally showcase his full range of talents. \nPlus, he’s a boyhood Chelsea fan – perhaps he’d take his game to a new level after pulling a blue shirt on? Tottenham Shaw played under Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton (Picture: Getty) \nTottenham aren’t exactly desperate for a left-back at the moment, but Danny Rose’s fine form has sparked some rumours that top clubs could be after him in the summer. \nIf he were to leave, Shaw could be an ideal replacement at White Hart Lane, and having played under Mauricio Pochettino at St Mary’s, he may be one of the first names on the Argentine’s list. \nSpurs have been mentioned as one of the clubs interested in Shaw recently, and it could do the youngster the world of good to play under his old boss again to revive his career. \nLike Chelsea, Tottenham have experimented with wing-backs this season, so could again provide the perfect template for Shaw to showcase his best form.
