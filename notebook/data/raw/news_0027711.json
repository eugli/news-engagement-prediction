This requires dozens of trucks and associated military personnel. Such a large-scale deployment is much harder to conceal from a vigilant foe. \n“Liquid-fuelled missiles are more vulnerable to tracking and preemptive strikes. Solid-fuelled ballistic missiles are not fuelled on site and therefore pose more of a threat because solid-fuelled ballistic missiles require less support and can be deployed more quickly,” Kelsey Davenport , the director of nonproliferation policy and a North Korea expert at the Arms Control Association , told Business Insider. \nUsing a missile like the one tested on Sunday, North Korea could simply park a truck and let a missile fly. \nThat’s exactly what the video of their latest launch shows: \n“Another striking feature of the test was the transport erector launcher that was used to launch the missile. Images indicate that it ran on treads rather than wheels,” said Davenport. “This gives allows North Korea to move its missiles through more difficult terrains.” \nTo counter such a sneaky launcher, an adversary would have to spend extensively on surveillance and recon technology. \nSo while North Korea remains without an ICBM to directly threaten the US homeland, their successful launch of a solid-fuelled missile means they have developed a very destabilizing technology that can strike US military bases, South Korea, or Japan in a moment’s notice. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
