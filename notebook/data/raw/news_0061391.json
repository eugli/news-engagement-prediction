The model revealed last night that she's interested in appearing on the big screen at some point in her career. When asked by WWD if she'd consider pursuing other projects aside from modeling, the 20-year-old answered: \"I'm going to stick with this for a while and kind of ride it out. And then eventually, I'll hopefully start dabbling in acting. But I want to be able to give my full attention to one or the other.\"\n If she does end up becoming an actress, Hadid already has her mind set on what kind of roles she wants to play. \"I think I want to be like a superhero,\" she said. (Hey, Marvel and DC, we have a prospective star ready for you.)\nIt may be a while before the model heads to any auditions, since she's currently busy starring in campaigns and and being a fashion week runway staple. Plus, she's a spokesperson for Nike and Dior makeup, and she has a design collaboration with Chrome Hearts on the way. But whenever she does decide to go into film, we already know she's a pro in front of the camera.", "external_links": ["http://wwd.com/eye/parties/bella-hadid-acting-ambitions-10818498/"], "published": "2017-02-25T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:08:29.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
