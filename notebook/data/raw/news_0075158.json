From Rex/Shutterstock. While it was said that the president would not be watching the Academy Awards, the specter of Donald Trump was inescapable as Hollywood gathered to toast itself on Sunday night. Jimmy Kimmel set the Oscars’ Trump-inspired political tone early as he wondered if some acceptance speech would prompt the president to “tweet in all caps during his 5 a.m. bowel movement.” That was, of course, a possibility, since Trump’s self-declared favorite morning show, Fox & Friends , wouldn’t come on until 6 a.m. The only thing far-fetched about the premise was the notion that Trump would wait that long before interjecting as celebrity after celebrity rose to offer repudiations of the president. The generally understated, if still telling takes on Trump were predictable. Ditto the fodder they would provide Trump and supporters. One couldn’t miss how the diversity of presenters, some winners, and oft-mentioned films like Moonlight , was at odds with the lack of the same in Trump’s White House and among his core constituents. Nor could one miss the empathy urged in absentia by award-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi , who slammed Trump’s “inhumane” travel ban, or by Mexican-born actor-presenter Gael García Bernal , who rebuked the building of Trump’s wall on the southern border. This was not Trump’s America. That’s one that views elite Hollywood as the enemy, right up there along with the “fake news” media. It’s a caricature that Trump and social conservatives have long used to fuel resentment among their base and deepen the cultural fault lines running through the country. It was thus an interesting parenthetical to see one ad quoting from George Orwell’s 1984 and another from The New York Times on the relevance of sifting through conflicting claims to discern truth. The deeply-felt animus toward the president, which suffused much of the proceedings, only served to underscore the depth of the divide. It’s actually too bad that the Hollywood crowd didn’t realize how they truly could have driven Trump nuts, as New York playwright-director Pippin Parker tweeted before the show, if they had not mentioned him at all. But as conspicuously modest as the references to him and his actions were, that was wishful thinking, especially with the worldwide audience that was watching the rather languorous event. Trump was, as ever, omnipresent. Still, many remarks about the president were decidedly unostentatious, as if the former Apprentice host was not worthy of the oxygen he so regularly sucks up. “It’s almost as though the Hollywood elite decided that President Trump was a C-level celebrity not deserving of mention in the few seconds of stage time given them,” Harvey Young , a dramatist and a theater and African American studies scholar at Northwestern University, told me. The most powerful stand, he found, “was made by Gael García Bernal who went off-script and rejected Trump’s border wall. It was a brilliant moment by a man who understood the significance of the moment and saw the opportunity to speak in defense of a nation and its people before a global audience.” And, amid the rhetorical shots at Trump, another, perhaps overarching reality went unmentioned. Watching it last night was David Israel , a longtime Los Angeles writer-producer whose inside look at legendary horse trainer Bob Baffert, The Barn , will be published next year. “Donald Trump is a creature of Hollywood, for fuck sakes. He is president because he got famous playing a successful business executive for years on television.” “His voters did not really know him from his tabloid bad boy years—that’s a NY media thing—they know him from The Apprentice , which was acting,” said Israel, who in an earlier career was one of the top sports columnist in the nation. “Hollywood isn’t a geographic place when you refer to it. It is a business. And Trump is very much of that business. He’s not in the real estate business. He licenses his name to real estate developers. Just the way stars endorse other products. He’s in the self-promoting celebrity business.” It is, in fact, a business that has made Trump’s inner circle rich, too. There’s Steve Bannon , who produced nearly two dozen movies and had a financial stake in Seinfeld , and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin , who also made a fortune producing films including Mad Max: Fury Road , Sully , and Suicide Squad , which took home an Oscar on Sunday night for Best Makeup and Hair Design. Not doing anything this week with the kids? Take them to The Lego Batman Movie . You’ll find Mnuchin's name in the credits.
