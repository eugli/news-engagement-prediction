With Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio there, it should help. They are outspoken and we are listening to them, and they are listening to us.”The Alliance describes itself as “a bi-partisan ad-hoc committee comprised of prominent civic, business and communal leaders representing intersectional views” that is dedicated to the US-Israel relationship. It has already led several similar missions.In June 2016 they lobbied Congress to appropriate $600 million for Israel’s missile defense systems, and in September 2017 they went to Washington to show support for Congressmen who are in the forefront of writing legislation to counter the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction movement.
