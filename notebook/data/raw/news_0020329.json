(Getty Images) \n(CBS) While he shares a name with the street that his workplace sits on, Cubs shortstop Addison Russell came to his name in a much more winding fashion. \nRussell was originally named “Geoffreye O’Neal Addison Robert Watts Jr III” on his birth certificate, his mother,Milany Ocampo-Russell, told USA Today . How so? \nWell, the “Addison” part came from her obsession with Bruce Willis, who played a character named David Addison on the TV series Moonlighting in the late 1980s. The rest of the name? It’s kind of a mystery. \n“When I gave birth, I was kind of out of it with the drugs,’’ Milany Russell told USA Today. “So when I came out of it, there was already the name on the birth certificate: ‘Geoffreye O’Neal Addison Robert Watts Jr III.'” \nApparently, the name stuck. At age 13, Russell’s mother gave him a one-time option to change his name when he was adopted by Wayne, his stepfather and the man he considers his father, USA Today reported . He chose Addison Wayne Russell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:41:09.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
