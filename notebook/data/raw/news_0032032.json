Missed deadlines \nCampbell, who is suing for Magic Leap for sex discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment, connects the lack of women in Magic Leap’s leadership and engineering department with claims of missed internal deadlines. \nFrom the complaint: \n“The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure, hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines (including launch, which has shifted back at least 4 times in Campbell’s 1.5 years at the company) and, literally, prevented Campbell from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the “pink/blue problem” or making Magic Leap less of a “boys club.”” \n“Sadly, because Magic Leap seldom hires and does not actively recruit female candidates, the company loses competitive advantage to products like Microsoft’s Hololens. Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders.” \nOne of the things Campbell connects to her eventual firing was that she challenged Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, comparing herself to the child in the “Emperor’s New Clothes” who pointed out that the emperor was naked and not in fact wearing extremely cool invisible clothes. \nFrom the complaint: \nCampbell also raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do — admonitions ignored in favour of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap’s website and on YouTube were “aspirational,” and not Magic Leap’s version of “alternate facts.” Here’s the full complaint: \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
