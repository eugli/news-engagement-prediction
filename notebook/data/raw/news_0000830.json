LeGarrette Blount (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:28 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:28 p.m. ET \nHOUSTON — If LeGarrette Blount scores Sunday against Atlanta, it may take him a moment to determine how to celebrate. \nThat’s because the Musket Men won’t be at Super Bowl 51. \nThe roughly 20 or so Revolutionary War re-enactors that are regular staples of every New England home game won’t be on the field or in attendance en masse at NRG Stadium. This means Blount can’t strike his trademark pose with them should he get into the end zone. \nEven so, it doesn’t diminish the camaraderie Blount has built with a group that takes pride in loving the Patriots and the U.S. history from which the team's nickname was derived. \nMORE: Super Bowl 51 picks, predictions \nThe Musket Men came into existence in 1996, whenthey were hired to add some entertainment spice to the New England Revolution soccer team that had just launched. Adorned in replica clothes from the late 1700s and steeped in knowledge about the era — at least three years of experience in re-enactments is mandatory for membership — the MM would fire their weapons after a Revolution goal was scored. \nUnfortunately for the El Salvador national team, nobody filled the players in about this new tradition before a 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup match against the U.S. \n\"Six muskets went off and half the El Salvadorian team dove for cover,\" MM captain Geoff Campbell told Sporting News during a Tuesday telephone interview. “It scared the daylights out of them.\" \nWith the Revolution also owned by Robert Kraft, the Patriots began having the Musket Men appear for their games in 1998. The MM’s ranks grew, as well. \nThere was some misfiring over the years like when then-Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri missed an extra point because of the smoke that enshrouded Gillette Stadium after muskets were triggered by MM stationed in both end zones (only one end zone now shoots after a score). Incidentally, there was a complaint to the NFL about the Musket Men made by the Falcons following a 2009 matchup. \n\"The ball on the (kickoff) tee and was coming out when we shot our muskets,” Campbell recalled. “The Falcons' returner jumped out of his skin.\" \nMORE: Best of Pats at Super Bowl Opening Night \nThe bond between the Musket Men and Blount began after he scored during the 2014 season. \n\"I saw them and looked at them and they looked at me,\" a smiling Blount told co-host Gil Brandt and me on SiriusXM NFL Radio. “They kind of gave me the come-over-here gesture. \n\"I ran over there and stood with them and all these people start taking pictures I’m like, 'This is me from now on.'\" \nBlount and the Musket Men shared plenty of time together this past season with the running back scoring an NFL-high 18 touchdowns and one more in the playoffs. \n\"It has just clicked and evolved,\" Campbell said. \"It’s a way he can celebrate individually without having to worry about getting a flag.\" \nThe Musket Men have ties with other Patriots players, particularly through member \"Nana\" Janie Ritchie. Campbell said Ritchie still keeps in close contact with ex-Patriots tight end Ben Watson and has developed a postgame tradition of slapping hands with New England's tight ends and defensive backs. \nMORE: 5 matchups to decide Super Bowl 51 \nBlount gets even more love from the MM. \n\"They’ve given me one of their hats and pictures they've taken with me to sign,\" Blount said. \"Snacks, cookies and all kinds of things, man. \n\"They show a lot of love. I appreciate every part of it.\" \nConsidering that, it would seemingly make sense for Blount to serve as an honorary Musket Man once his playing career is over. \nBlount, though, said the Spirit of '76 wouldn’t be moving him in that direction. \n\"I wouldn't be able to be down there and watch (the Patriots) play because I'd want to play,\" Blount said. \"No matter how old I was, I couldn't do it.\" \nAlex Marvez can be heard from 7 p.m. ET to 10 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday from Super Bowl 51 on SiriusXM NFL Radio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:45:46.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
