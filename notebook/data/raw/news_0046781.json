The intrinsic reactivity of mid-to-late M–L multiply bonded complexes renders these structures challenging to isolate and structurally characterize. Although synthetic tuning of the ancillary ligand field can stabilize M–L multiply bonded complexes and result in isolable complexes, these efforts inevitably attenuate the reactivity of the M–L multiple bond. Here, we report the first direct characterization of a reactive Ru 2 nitride intermediate by photocrystallography. Photogeneration of reactive M–L multiple bonds within crystalline matrices supports direct characterization of these critical intermediates without synthetic derivatization.
