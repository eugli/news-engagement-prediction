Kornblue Kicking The Iowa Hawkeyes have found their punter. After scouting several different options all over the country, the Iowa coaching staff landed on Ryan Gersonde and offered him a scholarship last week. Today, the 6-foot-4, 190-pound Gersonde accepted and gave his verbal commitment to the Hawkeyes after making his official visit this past weekend.\n\"I loved the people,\" Gersonde told HawkeyeReport.com . \"It just felt like the perfect fit.\"\nI am proud to announce my commitment to the University of Iowa to continue my academic and athletic career #Swarm17 pic.twitter.com/hS6LjD5Ug7\n— Ryan Gersonde (@ryan_gersonde) January 31, 2017 Overall, Gersonde is commitment No. 20 for the Hawkeyes in the Class of 2017.\nA first team all-state selection for Marquette University High School, Gersonde averaged 39.8 yards per punt this past season. When he worked out for the Iowa coaching staff, he not only impressed them with his consistency, but also his versatility as a punter who grew up in Australia learning different kicking styles.\n“I think just kind of being able to put the ball where he asked me to,” Gersonde told us. “With my pooch punts, usually you want to have them land around the ten-yard line, and I don’t think I missed one.”\n“Then I was able to rugby pretty easily just because that’s what I’m used to growing up in Australia,” he continued. “Then with just my routine, he was very impressed how when I came out there and had a set routine and had my own warm up. I didn’t just come out there and do whatever. I stuck to my routine, which is a key to coaches.\"\nSee highlights from Gersonde's senior year at Marquette in the video below.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://t.co/hS6LjD5Ug7", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/h2fno36mpysxrah9aooy", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/h2fno36mpysxrah9aooy)", "https://twitter.com/ryan_gersonde/status/826572679708827650", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Swarm17?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-01T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:28:56.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
