Kungsbacka, the Swedish furniture retailer's latest line of kitchen cabinets, is made from reclaimed industrial wood and recycled plastic bottles. \nIKEA collaborated with Swedish design studio Form Us With Love to create a sleek collection of anthracite cabinets with a matte finish (you know we love a black kitchen !). Each 15.75-by-31.5-inch cabinet uses 25 plastic bottles . \n\"Since our products [are] consumed by a lot of people, we believe we can make a huge difference by actually changing the way we use resources and use recycled materials,\" product developer at IKEA Anna Granath says in a video about the company's sustainability initiatives: \nDespite being made out of trash, the inspiration for these elegant cabinets — which boast a 45-degree chamfer (a symmetrical sloping edge) at the top and bottom of each to enhance the horizontal lines in the kitchen — came from something far from a landfill. \n\"The function of the chamfer is emotive. It's an ingeniously generous shape making use of an industrial process sparingly to add something extra, breaking the rigid formality and flatness of kitchen fronts. We wanted it to feel like a black t-shirt, tune to fit right, practical and still precious,\" Form With Us Love's creative director John Löfgren said in a press release. \nKungsbacka joins IKEA's Sektion system , which the furniture retailer launched in 2015. Prices range from $15 for a drawer front to $105 for a 90\" cover panel. . \n\"Sustainability should be for the many people. It should not only be for the ones that can afford it and that was something really important for us when we started the development of Kungsbacka,\" Granath added. \nKungsbacka comes with IKEA's 25-year warranty. \n\"Our aim is to increase the share of recycled materials in our products. We are looking into new ways how to reuse materials, such as wood fiber, foam, paper, plastics, so that we can give the materials new life in a new product,\" Granath said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:49:45.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
