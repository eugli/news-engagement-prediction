A fully functional NRA is a prerequisite for WHO prequalification of vaccines. One of the requirements to become eligible and retain prequalification status is to have the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) assessed as functional against WHO-published NRA indicators. \nThe WHO Prequalification Programme facilitates access to vaccines that meet unified standards of quality, safety and efficacy, as well as programme needs. Vaccine manufacturers can only apply for WHO vaccine prequalification if the NRA meets the standards of the WHO-published NRA indicators, i.e., the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool on the functional regulatory system for vaccines. \nBesides, as was done during the last such inspection as well, the exercise that happened from February 13-17 updated the Institutional Development Plan of the CDSCO and other involved affiliated institutions to address existing and/or potential gaps, and to build upon the strengths of the existing vaccine regulatory system. The WHO had carried out pharmacovigilance field visits to West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh in December last year. \nWhat is the size of India’s vaccine exports? \nThe total value of vaccines manufactured by Indian companies is estimated to be in the range of $ 900 million. About 65%-70% is exported — India is a major player in the vaccine supply chain to agencies such as UNICEF, the WHO and the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). An article on the Indian vaccine industry in the online forum Biotech Articles a few years ago said: \n“India is the major supplier of vaccines to UNICEF which in turn supplies 40% of the total vaccine demand for childhood vaccination in more than 100 countries. The share of the private sector in the total volume of vaccines exported is roughly around 40%. The once neglected vaccine market is now considered a source of steady income. The evidence for this being the takeover of Shantha Biotech by Sanofi Aventis and the possible takeover of Biological Evans by GSK. The reasons which make Indian companies very attractive for takeover are opportunity and assured income from exports, and facilities on par with global standards…” \nWhat impact can the WHO’s rating have on India’s pharma sector and beyond? \nIt will make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to enter international markets, especially after the setbacks of the last year when vaccines made by several Indian firms lost the WHO prequalification status. As the WHO itself pointed out in a congratulatory letter earlier this week to Health Minister J P Nadda, this will “give an impetus to the “Make in India” mantra of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India”.
