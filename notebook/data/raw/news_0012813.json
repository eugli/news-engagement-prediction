Image copyright CABI Image caption The caterpillar can march like an army across the landscape \nDr Jayne Crozier, of Cabi, said the armyworm's presence had now been confirmed in west Africa and was thought to be present in the south and east of the continent, many parts of which relay on maize for their staple diet. \n\"It's possibly been there for some time and it's causing a lot of damage now,\" she told BBC News. \n\"The recent discovery of fall armyworm in Africa will be a huge threat to food security and also to trade in the region.\" \nThe FAO is to hold an emergency meeting in Harare between 14 and 16 February to decide emergency responses to the armyworm threat. \nZambia has used army planes to spray affected areas with pesticides. \nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:53:02.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
