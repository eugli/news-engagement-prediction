Delhi and Islamabad was yet again in the same room close on the heels of SAARC official-level meet in Kathmandu. India confirmed its participation at the meet when National Security Advisor Ajit K Doval was in Moscow last month. \n\nIndia expressed the hope that the initiative for these consultations, which mark a new beginning, would help promote regional cooperation for stabilising the situation in Afghanistan, protecting its unity and integrity and pursuing peace and reconciliation, according to MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup . \n\nThe Indian delegation at the meet without a direct to Pakistanalso stressed that it is essential “to end all forms of terrorism and extremism that beset Afghanistan and our region, and to ensure denial of territory or any other support, safe havens or sanctuaries to any terrorist group or individual in countries of our region.” \n\nIndia also underlined that it is up to the Afghan government to decide whom to engage in direct talks. These efforts can only be facilitated by friends and well-wishers of Afghanistan, the delegation noted underling Delhi’s role and goodwill there. Delhi also emphasized on arrangements of regional countries for discussing stability of Afghanistan. \n\nIt is understood that India-USA-Afghanistan will also hold their trilateral meet on the Afghan situation in what would be first such meeting under the Trump Presidency. US President Donald Trump , however, is yet to announce his policy on Afghanistan.
