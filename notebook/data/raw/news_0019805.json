is about one in 250.\n“Over their lifetime more than one in two uncircumcised males will suffer an adverse medical condition caused by their foreskin,” said Dr Morris.\nThe researchers’ risk-benefit estimates were based on an analysis of research data compiled from 140 “high-quality” research studies relevant to Australia.\nThe studies had determined the level of protection male circumcision affords against conditions such as urinary infections, inflammatory conditions, sexually transmitted infections and genital cancers as well as the level of risk posed by the circumcision procedure in infancy.\nCosmetic circumcision is banned at Australian public hospitals, although the surgery can be carried out privately.\nDr Morris said permitting male circumcision only for medical reasons was “penny wise, pound foolish”. “The enormous benefit but low risk makes early infant circumcision akin to childhood vaccination,” he said.\nThe authors of the study are members of the Circumcision Academy of Australia . \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians disagrees but accepts there are differing medical and non-medical opinions on the often highly emotive and cultural issue of infant male circumcision .\n“The RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision for healthy male infants in Australia and New Zealand,” according to the RACP’s position statement on the issue.\nElective infant male circumcision has been criticised on ethical and human rights grounds because the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the child is unable to consent, the RACP says in the statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:30:13.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
