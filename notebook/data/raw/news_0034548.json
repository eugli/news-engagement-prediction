Police were then alerted. External Link: The German couple are thought to have died on their first day at Trephina Gorge \n\"They had medication in their room which would indicate that they probably weren't the best people to be wandering around in that sort of heat, in that sort of terrain,\" Duty Superintendent Burgoyne said. \n\"They probably have taken too many chances, but the woman at least was closer to the car park, so she may have been heading on her way back.\" \nA photograph, not yet released by police, of Ms Thor was found in her camera showing her in good spirits at the Gorge with a 600 millilitre bottle of water, but not wearing a hat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:03.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
