Britain has 3,000 ways to say 'drunk' (here's 100 of them) \nBut once they signed in to her Apple account and the iCloud, 12 images appeared on the iPhone 5S. \nSix of them were blank but the remaining half dozen were the same obscene picture of a man’s nether regions which left Lynn thoroughly disgusted. (Picture: SWNS) \nLynn, who also has a nine-year-old son, said: ‘I couldn’t understand what had happened, neither of us could. \n‘It is a brand new phone, not a refurbished one or anything, so they couldn’t have been left there from a previous owner. School plans to open later because pupils can't get out of bed in time \n‘I took the phone straight back to the shop to complain and the manager took a copy of the images, but couldn’t give me any explanation as to why the pictures were on the phone. \n‘They said they would get back in touch with me to let me know what happened but I haven’t heard anything three weeks on. (Picture: SWNS) \n‘I am quite angry about this. I could have bought this phone for one of my kids who could have seen this. It’s disgusting.’ \nApple was contacted for a response to the complaint, but the company say they do not comment on individual customer cases. Couple fined for maliciously ordering takeaways for a neighbour \nLynn, from Carronshore, Falkirk, purchased the phone at a branch of network Three on Falkirk High Street. \nA Three spokesperson said: ‘In order to assess how this has happened we need to test the device thoroughly. \n‘We have offered the customer a replacement handset and discount on their line rental as an intermediate gesture while we investigate this serious matter further.’ More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:59:10.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
