The left-arm spinner had also troubled England skipper Alastair Cook in the five-Test series last year. Ravindra Jadeja will get the opposition captain out 2 Today was the 18th such instance for Jadeja in Test matches 3 His frequency of dismissing opposition captains is the second best among all Indian bowlers \n- Pune's Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium became the 25th Indian ground to host a Test match and fourth to make its debut this season after Indore, Rajkot and Visakhapatnam. \n- Virat Kohli was leading India for the 24th time in a Test. Interestingly, he is yet to play the same eleven in two consecutive Tests. Kohli is closing in on Indian record held by Sourav Ganguly, who played the same eleven for the first time in his 29th Test as captain. ( Pune Test, Day 1, Highlights: Key highlights ) \n- The Pune Test is the seventh consecutive Test between India and Australia on Indian soil in which Australia have batted first. \n- Interestingly, Australia went on to lose in all of the last six occasions. Australia have batted first in the first Test of eight consecutive Test series between India and Australia. ( What a catch! Wriddhiman Saha flies to pull off a stunner ) \n- Matt Renshaw - at 20 years 332 days - became the youngest Australian to score a fifty on Indian soil, beating Rick Darling's record. He is followed by Rick Darling at 22 years, 156 days and then Peter Sleep at 22 years, 167 days. Mitchell Starc stands fifth in the table to become the youngest Australian to score a half-century at 23 years and 45 days. \n- Steve Smith's scores against India in India read as : 92, 5, 46, 18 and 27. His scores against India in Australia are: 162*, 52*, 133, 28, 192, 14, 117 and 71. Smith averages a whopping 128.16 against India in Australia and just 37.60 in India - a difference of 90.56. ( Pune Test, Day 1: Mitchell Starc defies India after Umesh Yadav grabs 4/32 ) \n- More often than not Ravindra Jadeja will get the opposition captain out. Today was the 18th such instance for Jadeja in Test matches. In fact 15.13% of Jadeja's wickets have been of opposition captains only. \n- Jadeja's frequency of dismissing opposition captains is the second best among all Indian bowlers (with 10 or more dismissals of the opposition captains). He is second to Narendra Hirwani with a difference of only 0.02% and is followed by Karsan Ghavri at 14.68 %. ( Bizarre scenes as Matt Renshaw leaves batting crease with upset stomach ) \n- Mitchell Starc - on 51 - completed 1000 runs in Test cricket. With 143 wickets already against his name, Starc completed the coveted all-round double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets. He became the 14th Australian to accomplish this feat. Only five Aussies have done so in fewer Tests than Starc's 35 - Monty Noble (27), George Giffen (30), Richie Benaud (32), Keith Miller (33) and Alan Davidson (34). Incidentally Starc is the fastest to reach this milestone for Australia in last 50 years. \n- Starc averages 53.80 with the bat against India (269 runs in 7 innings with three fifties) - his highest against any country. The second best is 29.33 against New Zealand. \n- Umesh Yadav (4/32) has now taken five four-wicket hauls in a Test innings - three of them have come against Australia. \n- Starc and Hazlewood have added 51 runs for the tenth wicket without being separated. This is only the third fifty stand for Australia in India for tenth wicket. The record is 66 between Moises Henriques and Nathan Lyon at Chennai in 2012-13.
