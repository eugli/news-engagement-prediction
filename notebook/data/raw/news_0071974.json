If anyone tells you there were watching the game live in the United States, they were either living near the Canadian border or they're fibbing. \nThe game wasn't on live TV in the United States. It was played in the late afternoon and shown that night. \nNow, take a break from whatever else you're doing and watch the final minute. First, though, turn up your speakers. All the way. \nLynx star Seimone Augustus stands up for better pay in WNBA StribSports Upload is where you’ll see what other people are saying about Minnesota sports.
