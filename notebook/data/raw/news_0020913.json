The actress has been traveling the globe to promote the film in an arresting lineup of red carpet looks. After taking the plunge in a deep-V Valentino dress in Los Angeles, Johnson turned out in Hamburg, Germany, wearing a Saint Laurent sheath with a sultry thigh slit that could make even Angelina Jolie blush. But last night in London, Johnson took the film’s gothic undertones to new heights in a darkly romantic Alexander McQueen dress. With a fantastical motif made up of sea creatures, shipwrecks, and coral reefs, the Sarah Burton design was fit for a modern-day mermaid—the kind that prefers sinuous gowns over a shell bikini. The puffed sleeve lent Johnson an Old World look, while the dramatic square neckline gave off fairy-tale-princess vibes, echoed by her slightly disheveled top knot. Major accessories would have been overkill, and Johnson did well to eschew them, keeping the focus on the dress. We predict the rest of Johnson’s Fifty Shades appearances to be nothing less than stylish smooth sailing.
