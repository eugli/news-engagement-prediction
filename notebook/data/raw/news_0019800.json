While we greatly value their teaching and their efforts while they have been here, we appreciate that the situation was not ideal. Samantha Dunster will assume the role of Interim School Principal while we conduct a search.\" \nTheir predecessor, Ochoa, a beloved longtime principal dancer with the ballet, had become the school's director after she retired from dancing in 2012. \nBut after 19 dancers were fired or left on their own last year, Ochoa also left, to become the director of faculty and curriculum at the Miami City Ballet School. \nThe School of Pennsylvania Ballet reopened in 2012 after a 20-year hiatus. In 1992, when the Pennsylvania Ballet faced financial difficulties, the school had gone independent and become the Rock School for Dance Education. Now the Rock School and School of Pennsylvania Ballet both teach talented ballet students in Philadelphia. \nBabayeva and Gronostayskiy's names have been removed from the company's web site.
