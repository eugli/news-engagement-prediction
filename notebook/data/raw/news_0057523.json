The teacher told a local paper: ‘Teaching is becoming more about social work now,’ adding if students are dealing, they might not realise the dangers of collecting drug money. The teacher continued: ‘If their bag has been searched and nothing is found then it is really difficult. ‘I know a lot of staff would like for police dogs to be brought in without the students knowing. ‘If there is a zero tolerance approach, maybe it would kick it out. I want to see the police come into the school rather than hanging around outside because then it will show there will be consequences to this sort of behaviour.’ Associate head Bob Linnegar said the problem is down to drugs becoming ‘more prevalent and mainstream’. He added: ‘Drugs are an issue for all schools and that is why we spend so much work looking at the effects of drugs and trying to educate them on making healthy choices.’ Wiltshire Police said it had received complaints that children from the school were smoking drugs in back alleys. The force said undercover officers have stopped children who were actually smoking roll-ups rather than drugs. A police spokesman said: ‘Any use of a drugs dog in schools should be done with consent and full knowledge of the school, governors and parents.’ The spokesman said the school had rightly consulted local community police for help dealing with the problem. They added: ‘We also do school visits with drugs dogs as an educational tool.’ Share or comment on this article 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:39:29.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
