You’d be wrong. \nAmnesty has learned about a calculated programme of extermination taking place in one of President Bashar al-Assad’s military prisons – Saydnaya, in Damascus . Here, thousands of civilians considered opponents of the regime are systematically starved, deliberately dehumanised, mercilessly tortured and finally hanged in the utmost secrecy in the dead of night, 20 to 50 at a time. 'The worst place on earth': inside Assad's brutal Saydnaya prison Read more \nIt’s like something from a grindingly bleak horror film – a grotesque series of depraved acts that almost defies description. I wish it weren’t true. But I’ve sat and talked to one of the survivors of Saydnaya, and I know it’s all horribly real. Amnesty has gathered testimony from 31 former Saydnaya detainees as well as former guards, and we calculate that as many as 13,000 people have been hanged at Saydnaya since the uprising against Assad began , possibly many more. \nOn top of that there are the deaths through sadistic beatings, starvation and disease. Food and water are regularly cut off for prisoners at Saydnaya. When food is delivered, it’s often dumped in the blood, puss and dirt of the cell floors. The prison also has its own set of “special rules”. Prisoners are not allowed to make any sounds, speak or even whisper, even when being brutally beaten. They’re forced to assume certain positions when the guards come into the cells and merely looking at the guards is punishable by death. \nHere’s how one former detainee described the terrifying beatings that those about to be hanged are made to endure: “We would hear a huge sound. From 10pm until 12, or from 11pm until 1am, we would hear screaming and yelling come from below us … This is a very important point. If you keep silent, you will get less beating at Saydnaya. But these people were screaming like they had lost their minds … It wasn’t a normal sound – it was not ordinary. It sounded like they were skinning them alive.” Before and after: a Saydnaya detainee. Photograph: Amnesty \nAs for the hangings themselves, these are carried out in the basement of a place called the White Building. After hours of beatings, groups of up to 50 blindfolded men at a time are taken to the execution site by white delivery trucks (called “meat fridges” by other prisoners) and made to stand on a metre-high platform. Here a noose is placed over their heads and they’re bundled to their deaths. \nNot all the hangings result in quick deaths. Some of the lighter men are still alive several minutes into the hangings, and two prison officials have the job of pulling on the bodies of those still alive to break their necks. One former detainee, Hamid (not his real name), told me how he could hear the sounds of the hangings as he and other prisoners slept on the floor of the rooms above: “There was a sound of something being pulled out – like a piece of wood, I’m not sure – and then you would hear the sound of them being strangled … If you put your ears on the floor, you could hear the sound of the gurgling. This would last around 10 minutes … We were sleeping on top of the sound of people choking to death. This was normal for me then.” \nThose being killed in this unbelievably cruel way are only told they’ve been sentenced to death a few minutes beforehand. First they’re taken out of Saydnaya to a “military field court” at a military police headquarters in the al-Qaboun district of Damascus. Here they’re rushed through a mockery of a trial lasting no more than three minutes. No lawyer. No evidence. Blindfolded for the whole process. A predetermined guilty verdict and a death sentence. Then a return to Saydnaya – more torture and a grisly, hole-in-the-wall death. ‘After hours of beatings, groups of up to 50 blindfolded men are taken to the execution site.’ Photograph: Amnesty \nThese deeply inhumane acts constitute a policy of extermination as defined by the Rome statute of the international criminal court : the “intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population”. \nAmnesty has learned that Saydnaya’s mass hangings are authorised by officials at the highest levels of the Syrian government. The executions are approved by Syria’s grand mufti and by either the defence minister or the army chief of staff, both of whom are authorised to act on behalf of the president. Together with the names of an “execution panel”, Amnesty has forwarded information about alleged perpetrators to the relevant international investigation bodies. \nOne former prisoner told me how Saydnaya, like some Dante-esque modern hell, has layers of systematic brutality. “At each stage you reach,” he said, “you discover that the previous stage was actually better, and you start worrying about the next stage”. \nWhat else are we going to discover about the hell of Assad’s Syria?
