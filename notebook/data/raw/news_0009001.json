Jenone Orgona, 59, of The Gatehaus, Bradford, was sentenced to eight years and five months for human trafficking and forced labour, namely prostitution. Laszlo Petrovics, 38, of Ashton Road, Oldham, was sentenced to three years and six months for controlling prostitution for gain. Lakatos and Orgona have also been given Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Orders. Following the completion of their sentences they will be deported.\nAn application will also be made to subject a fourth person to a Slavery and Trafficking Risk Order.\nLakatos and Orgona trafficked young women aged 19-24 from Hungary with the promise of a better life through legitimate jobs only to find themselves forced to work as prostitutes on the street.\nThe defendants forced them to work seven days a week, having sex with as many as ten men each day.\nOne of the victims was later befriended with an offer of sanctuary away from Lakatos and Orgona only to find herself under the control of Petrovics.\nThe women saw none of the money themselves while Lakatos and Petrovics splurged cash on alcohol, gambling and drugs.\nIn January 2016 Lakatos and Orgona were arrested after one of the victims was observed by plain clothes officers repeatedly visiting them in two cars parked in a dark alleyway off Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.\nThe woman had been taking her earnings to Lakatos who was found with almost £2,000 in cash on him and over the following weeks more victims were traced.\nThe court heard how one of the women was left “feeling like they wanted to die” by the harrowing ordeal as she witnessed Lakatos attacking another girl and forced them to have sex with men, sometimes with no contraception, for extra money.\nPetrovics was subsequently arrested being found in a bookmakers in Oldham.\nInternational checks revealed that in 2009 Petrovics was convicted of 14 counts of human trafficking and violent exploitation of sex workers in the Netherlands and also had a previous conviction of running a brothel in Hungary jointly with his parents.\nLakatos also has international convictions in Hungary for extortion of sex workers and pimping of underage girls.\nDetective Constable Adam Cronshaw from the City of Manchester Challenger team, said:\nThese ruthless and manipulative offenders have targeted and groomed vulnerable young women from poor regions of Hungary.\nThe victims are enticed with the hope of legitimate well-paid work. However, once in the UK they are quickly faced with the grim reality of being forced into prostitution.\nThere is a common misconception that the vast majority of the women working on our streets in Manchester do so willingly. They each have their own personal back story and the majority do not want to be there.\nIt's likely that a proportion of sex workers on the streets of Manchester will be controlled by a pimp and all their hard earned money will be going to him. Quite often these pimps and traffickers threaten to hurt their families if they go to the police.\nA common question is why these women don’t run away or seek help. Their ‘counter-intuitive’ behaviour in staying with the defendants, and not taking opportunities to escape, are explained by the theories of traumatic bonding, learned helplessness, Stockholm Syndrome and attachment to the aggressor.\nThe victims’ acquiescence didn’t amount to consent, and repeating this behaviour is typical of victims of domestic violence and exploitation.\nIt’s important we raise awareness of these issues amongst our community, recognise the signs and provide support to victims.\nReducing trafficking is a key priority for us and our partners and we will work tirelessly to save people from modern slavery and a lifetime of misery. We want to gain their trust so they feel they believe there is hope.\nI know we will never be able to end prostitution but we can make it safer for all concerned by targeting serious and organised criminals exploiting young women.\nThese young women were dehumanised by these narcissistic and controlling offenders who were only interested in greed.\nHowever, now they are behind bars these brave women can enjoy their lives again.\n– Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:40:34.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
