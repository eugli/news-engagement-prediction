No need for secret betting,” online commentator Nguyen Thanh Phuc wrote beneath an article on the state-run VnExpress that hailed the move as a “historic decision”. \nYet some expressed concern that gambling, long branded a “social evil” by the government, would now run wild in a country where punters are already known for staking their savings -- and even their homes -- on big tournaments. \n”Gamblers now have another thing to play. Many families will be miserable again,” wrote Tran Phuc. \nThe moves to ease Vietnam’s strict betting and casino bans come after years of debating whether to legalise gambling and open the government up to millions in potential tax revenue. -AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:29:34.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
