The actor has chosen to reveal her identity and claims she is not ashamed to talk about the muck that exists in the Tamil film industry. \n\"I know you are trying to save my privacy, but that would imply that the woman is to be shamed and not the man. I think it's about time that women take a stand that it is not we, the victims, who need to be shamed, it's the man who needs to be shamed,\" Varalaxmi Sarathkumar told India Today. \nIt was last Saturday when the actor, who made her debut in the Tamil film Poda Podi in 2012, met a noted TV producer. It was a half-hour meeting which ended on a horrendous note. \n\"We had a half-hour meeting about work and we finished talking about it. Then out of the blue, he said, 'When can we meet outside?' I was a bit confused and asked, 'I'm sorry, something else about work?' He said, 'No, for other things'. Then I asked him to leave. But he didn't seem to think what he did was wrong! That's when it struck me that people don't even think that it's wrong, and feel it's alright to talk to women that way,'' the actor told India Today. \nVaralaxmi's father is noted Tamil actor-turned-politician Sarath Kumar. She has worked across Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam films. This is the first time she has chosen to speak out against the worst-kept secret, the casting couch, in the hope that it brings about a change. \n\"There is a group of people - we don't know whether they are educated or not educated - who feel it's okay to talk to women like this. Women are treated as objects in any industry, not only the film industry. This has to be fixed. It's animal behaviour, not human behaviour. Unless you have capital punishment for sex offenders, they will treat women like this,\" Varalaxmi said. \nThis is not the first time that someone from the film industry has opened up about the dirty secret called casting couch. Kangana Ranaut revealed she was asked for sexual favours at an audition. Mamata Kulkarni too accused a director of casting couch in Bollywood. Surveen Chawla, who has acted in Hindi, Tamil and Kannada films, also claimed to have faced the casting couch. \n\"Every time, you keep saying it's sexist. It has to change at some point. Something like Sati was legal for a long time, but we got rid of it. Now we've got to start cleaning somewhere. If we don't start now, then our future generations will never get rid of rape, molestation or child abuse,\" Varalaxmi Sarathkumar said. \nAs of now, she hasn't lodged a legal complaint or written to the channel where the TV producer is currently working. \n\"He is the TV programming head, I am guessing that when he opens the newspaper, he will know it's him. We need to attack the entire society, not one person. As for me, I don't want to attack the channel because it's not their fault. It's one man's fault\", Varalaxmi signed off.
