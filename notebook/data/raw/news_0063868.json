That's the sad part.”\nThe family left in two blue minivans with out-of-state licenses, making the investigation more difficult.\nNone of the suspects has been identified, Roswell police said, but they are hoping the video leads to a break in the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:06:05.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
