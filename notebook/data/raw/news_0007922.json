Image copyright AFP Image caption Tents have been set up to feed and warm residents in war-torn Avdiivka \nThe text did not raise objections from Russia, a permanent member of the council, which has in the past routinely blocked statements put forward by Ukraine. \nMore than 9,700 people have died in the conflict which erupted in 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Pro-Russian rebels later launched an insurgency in the east. \nThe US and EU imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied backing the rebels. \nUkrainian forces say the latest outbreak began when rebels launched an attack on the government-held town of Avdiivka, which borders land controlled by the separatists. \nThe rebels say government forces attacked them first. \nSeven soldiers and a number of rebels have been killed in recent days, and there have been civilian casualties although precise numbers are unclear. \nUkraine say that if the evacuation goes ahead, up to 8,000 people could be moved each day from the town. \n\"Everything is going bad,\" a resident in Avdiivka, who identified herself only as Nadiya, told the BBC. \n\"People are scared and try to go out. It's very cold. There are bread queues. Only a few shops are open.\" \nThe population of the town is believed to range between 16,000 and 22,000. \nOfficials say the evacuation will go ahead if the fighting escalates further. About 10 tonnes of food will soon arrive in the city, they add.
