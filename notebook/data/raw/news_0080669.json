There was no sign of forced entry.” \nThey viewed CCTV which showed Whitehead in the bar area. \n“He took one bottle of Disaronno, one bottle of apple sours and two bottles of WKD,” said Ms Dodsworth. \n“He is seen helping himself to a drink behind the pumps before removing cash and taking the charity boxes. \n“He takes two trips back and forth to the woods where he hides the charity boxes. \n“Six of these boxes were recovered, three were not.” CCTV footage was shared on Facebook of a thief pouring himself a pint and stealing charity boxes from a social club (Photo: Gazette Live) \nHe also took £30 from behind the bar and a till containing about £160. \nAfter the CCTV footage was circulated on social media, Whitehead's mum contacted the club via its Facebook page. \n“She contacted the witness and at a later stage he spoke to her on the phone,” said Ms Dodsworth. \n“She repeatedly apologised and said her son was a drug user but she hadn’t realised he was in as bad a way as he was.” \nWhitehead also contacted the club and offered to return three of the boxes. \nThe court heard the dad-of-one, who is a qualified rigger but is currently unemployed, had been drinking whisky and taking cocaine that day. \nCraig Bartram, defending, said Whitehead “has no intention of re-using” cocaine following the burglary.
