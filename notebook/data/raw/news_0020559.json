This is a full-frame picture. I guess you’d say I was trying to make a point.”\nPeople absolutely love it and what it says about equality.\nCommenter Quote: : “This is great! It says so much. Thank you!” while Quote: : “Trolling done in style”. Michellerichmondsf added: “Now there was a president who knew women had something to add to the conversation.”\nSadly, the picture is in stark contrast to the type of scenes we get to see in the White House nowadays with the Trump administration.\nAs long as you live you'll never see a photograph of 7 women signing legislation about what men can do with their reproductive organs pic.twitter.com/dXjfVjnRiX\n— Martin Belam (@MartinBelam) January 23, 2017\nDon’t mind us while we simultaneously clap and weep in the corner.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/dXjfVjnRiX", "https://twitter.com/MartinBelam/status/823637000783798272"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:34:59.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
