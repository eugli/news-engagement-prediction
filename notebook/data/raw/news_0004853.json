Those teams are filling their spaces, too.” \nStewart said that Carter also drew interest from Japanese clubs last off-season before joining the Brewers on a one-year, $2.5 million free-agent contract. \nThe Brewers, rather than risk paying Carter a projected $8 million in arbitration, declined to extend a contract offer to Carter in November, marking the second straight year he was non-tendered. \nInstead, the Brewers signed free agent Eric Thames, who agreed to a three-year, $16 million deal after spending the past three seasons putting up monster offensive numbers in the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO). \nCarter batted only .222 and led the National League with 206 strikeouts last season, but drew enough walks and hit for enough power to manage an .821 OPS. \nThe Rays appear to be Carter’s best major-league possibility, according to Stewart and major-league sources. \n“We’ve had enough conversations — I know what they’re thinking,” Stewart said. “We just haven’t advanced in that direction yet.” \nThe Rangers, another team in need of a first baseman/DH, appear to a more logical destination for Mike Napoli, who — like Carter — is a right-handed hitter. \nStewart said the Rangers also have told him that they still could rotate younger players at first base, and also might want to address pitching needs. \n“I get it,” said Stewart, who resumed control of his agency this off-season after getting dismissed as Diamondbacks GM. \nCarter, Napoli, Mark Reynolds and Billy Butler are the leading first-base/DH types available from the right side. \nThe remaining left-handed hitters at those spots include Pedro Alvarez, Adam Lind, Justin Morneau, Ryan Howard and Logan Morrison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:21:57.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
