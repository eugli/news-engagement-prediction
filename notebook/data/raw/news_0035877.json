Laroyce Tankson is charged with first degree murder. Chicago Police \nEarlier this month, Robertson was taking a Megabus from Memphis, Tennessee, to Minneapolis when an altercation between him and the officers occurred during a one-hour layover in Chicago, the suit alleges. \nTankson and another officer were \"aggressive\" and harassed Robertson and two other individuals, followed them to a nearby restaurant and demanded to search them, according to the suit. \nRobertson \"feared for his life and began to run,\" which prompted Tankson to \"calmly drop to one knee\" and fire a shot striking him in the back. \n\"The officer gave no commands but calmly stated, 'It's a gun out. It's a gun out,'\" the suit alleges. \nThe gunshot left Robertson, a father of two, quadriplegic until his death almost a week later. \nChicago police confirmed Robertson was unarmed. \n\"When he found out about his condition from the doctors, he was heartbroken,\" his sister, Nina Robertson, said of Robertson at a news conference. \"He just said, 'The police ruined my life.'\" \nWhile Chicago police allege Robertson had cash and drugs on him, his attorney told NBC Chicago that it was \"an insignificant\" amount of marijuana and he has no criminal record. \n\"Amtrak is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Chad Robertson,\" Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari told NBC Chicago . \"Amtrak is cooperating fully with the Chicago Police Department and State's Attorney's office as they conduct an independent investigation.\" \nBond for Tankson was set Friday at $250,000.
