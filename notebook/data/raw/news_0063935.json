However, there are some obvious problems,\" said Unite workers' union national director Mike Treen. \n\"The scale of the problem is underestimated. There are 150,000 people working on temporary work visas in New Zealand that industries rely on and those workers are in an overwhelmingly vulnerable position ... because they don't even have the right to change employers from an abusive employer. \n\"Until people are fully able to change employers and are able to fully exercise their legal rights, we have a problem. \n\"At worst you're stood down for two years ... it's a bit of a growling in my view.\" \nUnion network of migrants (UNEMIG) co-ordinator Dennis Maga said the measures were good, but questioned how they'd be applied. \n\"What's the mechanism in order to encourage migrant workers to come forward, because that's always a grey area,\" he said. \n\"What we want to see is employers banned from being able to employ foreign workers at all. Two years is nothing for these guys. \n\"These measures are big on paper but soft in application.\" \nIn October last year Masala restaurant owner Rupinder Singh Chahil was sentenced to six months' home detention and ordered to pay $2500 reparation after paying $3 an hour to a woman hired as an assistant manager $3, and making her clean her house. \nAn extensive investigation by Immigration New Zealand found that four Indian nationals were significantly underpaid between 2012 and 2014, were forced to under-record the hours they worked and return some of their pay to their employer. They were also not paid any holiday pay.â€‹ \nIn another case, eight Indian students faced deportation after they came to New Zealand on fraudulent student visas. They claimed they didn't know their supporting visa documents were forged by agents in India. \nThe students announced they would voluntarily leave the country by Monday . But their lawyer said the group would present a case to the Ombudsman to review whether or not they had an opportunity to prove they did not know their visa applications to New Zealand were fraudulent. \nAnd a Filipino national and her company were sentenced after exploiting five migrant workers at their Auckland sushi restaurants. The workers were paid less than they were promised and were made to work more than 60 hours per week. \nBetween them, they were underpaid more than $55,000. \nOwner of Imai Japanese Food Services Rosanna Imai was fined $10,000 and ordered to make an emotional harm payment of $5000 to her victims, and the company was fined a further $5000. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:22:38.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
