When Peter is looking after Simon, he drops him off at a party in town but he is then left in a panic when he loses touch with his son. \nEarlier in the week, Simon is caught in the feud between Leanne and her sisters and he advises both Toyah and Eva to give her space and stop harassing her with texts. But when the messages stop coming through, Leanne is secretly disappointed. (Picture: ITV) \nThis potential thawing is undone though when Leanne gets wind that Simon has been dropped off in town and is not answering his phone. \nAs a search gets underway for Simon, Leanne rails at Peter and Toyah for being so careless and she harshly lashes out by telling Toyah that she could never understand as she’s not a mum. (Picture: ITV) \nWill Simon be found safe – and will the tension around his disappearance cause Leanne and Toyah’s relationship to crumble even further? \nOne to watch: Friday 17th February on ITV at 8:30pm.
