That why, when she was college, Tami accepted a challenge to pick out a tie and hang it in her room until her God-sent husband entered her life.\nEvery day she would pray for her future husband, the future they would share and the kids they would hopefully raise - after years, the cloth became \"drenched\" in her prayers. Little did she know, that tie would have an even bigger meaning on her big day!\nFacebook/Tami Acree\nSeven years after the day she picked out her future husband's tie, Tami was set to marry her soulmate, Caleb. God's plan was in motion for the beautiful young lady.\nTami shared what happened with the tie in a Facebook post that's gone absolutely viral!\n\"That is a very special tie.\nWhen I was a sophomore in college, I was challenged to purchase a tie and hang it in my room to remind me to pray for my future husband.\nFor 7 years, it hung on my bed or my dresser mirror and more times than I can count it led me to pray God would encourage, grow, and spiritually develop my someday husband into the man of God I desired. I always meant to give it to my husband as a memento on our wedding day.\"\nThe tie went virtually unnoticed for seven years, until the night before Tami's wedding.\nFacebook/Tami Acree\nTami realized it was hanging in her room, when it should be wrapped in a box for her husband to open!\n\"The night before our wedding, I was with my girls and went to wrap it and we realized it was navy blue, grey, and pink. Our 3 wedding colors! (And it wasn't on purpose, I was originally thinking mint or yellow as the accent color.)\nI had such a special moment with the Lord; He knew even before I bought that tie 7 years ago that Caleb was the man I was praying for and He orchestrated it in His perfect timing!\nI didn't tell Caleb to wear it, I just gave it to him like I always meant to.\nAnd as I'm walking down the aisle towards him, one of the things I will always remember is seeing Caleb and seeing he is wearing my prayer-soaked tie.\"\nTami believes that, without knowing, Caleb was guided by God and wore the tie on their wedding day because of it. He really does work in mysterious ways.\nFacebook/Tami Acree\nSponsored\nDo you have a similar story about God's hand in your marriage?
