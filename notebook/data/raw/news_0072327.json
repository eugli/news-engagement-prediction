Defense attorney Valentin Rodriguez said Gregory surrendered himself to authorities.\n“He has accepted responsibility and he’s been working diligently with the government for several months,” Rodriguez said.\nGregory is the fourth defendant to plead guilty in the case, which so far has led to charges against him and seven other defendants.\nThe arrests are part of a federal investigation that targeted sober homes and drug-treatment centers founded by Kenneth Chatman, 46, of Boynton Beach, Michael Bonds, 45, of Delray Beach, and Fransesia Davis , 44, of Lake Worth.\nThe businesses offered illegal kickbacks to patients and sober home owners, coerced residents into prostitution, threatened violence against patients, and submitted urine and saliva for screening even when no medical need existed, federal investigators allege.\nChatman hired Gregory, a licensed mental health counselor, to serve as the clinical director for Reflections Treatment Center in Margate and Journey to Recovery LLC in Lake Worth, according to the plea agreement. \nAs the clinical director, Gregory was responsible for supervising treatment services and reviewing the work of his employees.\nAlthough Gregory knew many of his patients continued to use drugs, he and his staff often allowed the behavior to continue, according to documents from the plea agreement.\nOther times, Chatman would overturn Gregory’s recommendations for patients to leave treatment so they could continue to bill patients’ insurance plans, according to the agreement.\nThe plea agreement said Gregory also knew:\nChatman paid illegal kickbacks and bribes to sober home owners for patient referrals. Cigarettes, free rent and other items were paid to patients in return for attending treatment. Chatman decided which patients were allowed to be admitted and discharged, although that was officially Gregory’s job. Chatman was charging insurance companies for unnecessary drug testing.  Employees forged documents designed to make it appear as though patients attended treatment, even when they weren’t.  Chatman is currently in jail awaiting trial.\nFederal prosecutors filed court records last week updating the judge on the status of the case and listing some of the evidence that has been turned over to the defense. Prosecutors notified the judge that they are still in discussions with lawyers for the remaining defendants to figure out which defendants may enter into plea agreements or go to trial.\nStaff writer Paula McMahon contributed to this story.  \nRvanvelzer@sun-sentinel.com , 561-243-6544, or on Twitter @RyanVanVelzer \n  Healthcare Providers Wellington", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:35:30.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
