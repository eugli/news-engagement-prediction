By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 21, 2017 2:41 PM In a bitter jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his ‘kabristan’ remark during a campaign rally for the fourth phase of polling for Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2017, BSP supremo Mayawati on Tuesday asked him to build ‘crematoriums’ in states ruled by BJP. \nIn a bitter jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his ‘kabristan’ remark during a campaign rally for the fourth phase of polling for Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2017, BSP supremo Mayawati on Tuesday asked him to build ‘crematoriums’ in states ruled by BJP . “First you should set up crematoriums in BJP-ruled states, then you talk about these issues in Uttar Pradesh.” Hitting out at PM Modi over his statements, the former UP Chief Minister said, “In the past 3-4 days, the PM has given wrong statements, bringing in caste and religious angle because they seem to be fairing badly in the politically crucial state.” Renewing her attack at the ruling party at the Centre, Mayawati said, “BJP must have realized by now that they are not going to form government in UP.” Underlining her party’s secular credential, Mayawati said, “BSP respected every religion during its tenure, whether it was providing electricity during festivals, or any law and order issue.” PM Modi had torn into the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav ’s government for failing to maintain law and order in the state. \nThe PM in his speech had said, “Sabka saath, sabka vikas is our mantra”. But more than that, PM Modi accused CM Yadav of playing vote bank politics and taking it to extremes by saying “When electricity is available on Ramzan, then so should its supply be ensured during Diwali.” (“Ramzan me bijli aati hai tho Diwali me bhi aani chahiye; Bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye). PM Modi added, “there shouldn’t be any discrimination.” For those who may have missed the phrase, PM Modi underlined his message by saying “If there is a Kabaristaan, there should be Shamshaan too”. \nWatch this video \nEarlier, PM Modi had mocked at Mayawati’s opposition to note ban, saying BSP is no longer Bahujan Samaj Party but ‘Behenji Sampatti Party’.At an election rally in Orai region of Jalaun in Bundelkhand region, the Prime Minister said those who deposit wealth for themselves can never solve the problems of people. “Where has Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) reached today…when I announced note ban on November 8 last year, arch-rivals SP and BSP, who never see eye-to-eye, came together…I was amazed when I launched war against corruption and asked for the details of blackmoney. They came together and all including the Congress started speaking the same language,” Modi said. The main concern of the parties in Uttar Pradesh was not note ban but that they did not get enough time to stash away the ill-gotten money. \n“Behenji (Mayawati) alleges that government was ill-prepared… was it the government or it was you who was not prepared…she said one week should have been given (before implementing note ban)…Mulayam also said the same,” he said. “Money started being deposited in banks all of a sudden (after note ban) and (Mayawati) started shouting as why is it only at election time that the account of her brother has been made public…why is it being discussed that Rs 100 crore have been deposited,” he said. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:08:38.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
