He recently completed his first hand bike half marathon. \nA workplace accident that left Jesse Apiti paralysed has set him on a new path with new goals. \nJust over three months after the accident, he's ticked one off: completing his first half marathon. \nThe 20-year-old Hamilton man was injured on October 26 in a building accident. He was standing up building frames and two toppled back down on to him, paralysing him from the waist down. MONIQUE FORD/Fairfax NZ \nJesse Apiti, left, and Baehau Candy competed in Wellington Round the Bays on Sunday. \nHe completed his rehabilitation in Auckland on January 5. \nREAD MORE: Bumper entries for 40th Round The Bays in Wellington \nOn Sunday, he finished his first half marathon - Round the Bays in Wellington - on a hand bike. He completed the 21km in 1 hour 20 minutes. \n\"I just want to give everything I can a go. I have been on the bike three times - the first two times were little piddly go-arounds and then the third one I did 14km, then straight into the 21km. \n\"I felt pretty good. The arms were pretty tired, but I felt all right. My hands felt like they were cramping up.\" \nApiti has his eye on possibly improving his time in a race in Hamilton next month if he can get in a bit more training. \nApiti was never a runner when he was able-bodied, but did enjoy his sports, like touch rugby. Ad Feedback \nHis accident has forced him to look at things differently. He now dreams of being a Paralympian. \n\"Obviously it was hard at the start, but it was good for me to get over it really quickly and just decide to try and live life as much as I can and just love everything that I do. \n\"I would like to make the Paralympics one day - in what sport I'm not too sure yet. I am just trying a whole lot of different things right now. \n\"I have thought about staying in the construction side of things and do something like quantity surveying or going into social work to help other people with disabilities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:06:31.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
