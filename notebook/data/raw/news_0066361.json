Last year the prisons house around 22,000 people at an annual cost of $600m.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Under Obama, the justice department committed to ending the use of private prison facilities.

Essential government education and training programs for prisoners “have proved difficult to replicate and outsource” in the private sector, she said.\n\nThe move prompted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which controls a much larger network of privatised detention facilities, to conduct a similar review in August. But a report authored by the DHS’s advisory council concluded in December that due to the agency’s heavy dependence on for-profit facilities, it should not follow the lead of the justice department.\nThere were 13 criminal alien requirement prisons operated by the prisons bureau at the time of Yates’s memo. One of these facilities in Cibola County, New Mexico, was subsequently closed and reopened as an immigration detention facility at the end of last year. \nUS prisons Trump administration US politics news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:45:21.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
