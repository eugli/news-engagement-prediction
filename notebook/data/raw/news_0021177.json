Bridle said in a statement released Tuesday. \nIt is not unprecedented for the U.S. government to lease space in order to provide support services for the president when he travels home; the Pentagon rented space in President Obama's Chicago home. Trump Tower, however, happens to be an unusually expensive address where a floor with 13,000 to 15,000 square feet of space rents for about $1.5 million. \nThe Secret Service and New York Police Department are already installed in the building to provide security for Trump's wife, Melania, and son, Barron, who have not yet moved to the White House, and for the president when he visits. \nAccording to public records filed Jan. 26, Trump transferred ownership of Trump Tower to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust as part of a promise to turn over the business to his sons. Critics say he still benefits from the trust. \nTrust documents obtained by the non-profit news outlet ProPublica state that the \"purpose of the Trust is to hold assets for the exclusive benefit of Donald J. Trump.\" Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:41:21.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
