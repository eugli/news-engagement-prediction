'Failure' of police, community prevents disclosure \nResearchers heard of a hesitance by the women to disclose the violence they experienced, because in some instances there \"was a reluctance and/or failure by service providers, police and community and family members to appropriately assist\".

The worst is having it taken away,\" Louise said. \n\"I didn't want to ring the police or DCP would be involved. So I just took the hidings,\" Claudine said.
