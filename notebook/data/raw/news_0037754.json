PUBLISHED: 23:11, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 | UPDATED: 23:23, Wed, Feb 15, 2017 GETTY Marine Le Pen has promised to 'rebuild... damaged relations' with the UK if elected \nHer remarks are a far cry from the negative remarks of incumbent president Francois Hollande, who previously said Britain must \"pay the price\" for leaving the crumbling Brussels bloc. \nThe Front National leader said: \"What is the point in punishing a country? It is senseless, unless you think the EU is a prison, and you are condemned if you escape. Related articles Marine Le Pen is 'the ONLY force' who can pull France out of EU \n\"I want to rebuild our damaged relations with the United Kingdom.\" \n\"A people decides its own destiny. You cannot force a country to do something that is against its own interests, or against the democratic process.\" \nShe also moved to reassure French nationals living in Britain that none of her policies would be \"anti-English\" and that \"all existing contracts\" with Britain would be upheld. \nThe 48-year-old also hailed Brexit as the beginning of a domino effect which led to the election of Trump, and a move which will help dismantle the EU. \nShe told the Telegraph: \"Brexit has been a powerful weapon for us. In the past our adversaries have always been able to say that there is 'no alternative' but now we have had Brexit, and then Trump, and Austria. \n\"A whole psychological framework is breaking down. I think 2017 is going to be the year of the grand return of the nation state, the control of borders and currencies.\" \nLe Pen has consolidated her position as the frontrunner in the first round of voting in the French presidential elections. \nA recent poll put the anti-establishment candidate on 26 per cent of the vote compared to her nearest rival Emmanuel Macron, who snagged 19.5 per cent of the vote. \nFormer frontrunner Francois Fillon's chances of becoming president have been damaged after allegations the conservative candidate wrongfully paid his wife thousands of euros for work she did not do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:35:23.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
