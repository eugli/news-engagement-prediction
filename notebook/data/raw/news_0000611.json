Well known for his leadership abilities and precision, Fromm challenged for the state passing yardage record in his senior year. Originally an Alabama commit, he was the first quarterback offered by Jim Chaney upon his arrival to Athens, and he flipped soon thereafter. His early enroll status should allow him to learn the playbook early and challenge Eason for playing time in the fall.\" - Jake Reuse\n\"Miami, Auburn, Tennessee, and LSU were players for the services of Jeremiah Holloman at one time, but it's safe to say he was Georgia's all along. A lengthy wideout and multiple time state champion in triple jump, Holloman brings excellent athleticism and a knack for making tough catches, which he put on display as an Army All-American. He'll be joined in Athens by his brother, former Newton wideout LJ Holloman.\" - Jake Reuse\n\"By the time he committed to the Bulldogs during the Under Armour All-American Game, Deangelo Gibbs was almost as well known as any recruit in the country. A one-time five-star, the versatile Gibbs began receiving attention before high school, and teams never stopped pursuing. In the end, it came down to Georgia and Alabama, as Nick Saban made a strong late push. Initially projecting as a cornerback in Athens, Gibbs has the ability to play spots throughout the defensive backfield and has the playmaking ability to see time on offense, if needed.\" - Jake Reuse\n\" Monty Rice surprised many when he initially announced a commitment to the LSU Tigers, but he surprised even further when he opted to change his commitment to Georgia at the last moment. Ranked by Rivals.com as the nation's no. 34 inside linebacker, the Dawgs prioritized his services and offered chase for some time. With a skill set that smacks of Roquan Smith, Rice should be an excellent fit into Georgia's linebacking corps.\" - Jake Reuse\n\"A man who needs no introduction to Georgia fans, Richard LeCounte was Kirby Smart's first commit upon arrival to Athens. The Army All-American safety chose the Bulldogs over Ohio State and Alabama, among many other offers, and quickly shifted his focus to helping the Bulldogs recruit. Given the work he did reeling in other prospects to join him in Athens, he quickly became a fan favorite. On the field, however, he's an exceptional defender, known for trash talk, hard hits, and his ample speed.\" - Jake Reuse\n\"Louisville and Mississippi State were two of the main contenders for former Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College tackle D'Marcus Hayes , but the Georgia Bulldogs won his services after relentless pursuit. Georgia's need on the offensive line paired with available playing time and Hayes' experience made for a situation he could not pass up in the end. His status as an early enrollee should only aid his efforts in competing for starting reps on the Bulldogs' line.\" - Jake Reuse\n“The accolades piled up for Rivals100 running back D’Andre Swift throughout his four year career at St. Joseph’s Prep (Philadelphia). The No. 35 nationally ranked prospect was recently named Most Valuable Player after rushing for 109 yards on 12 carries as the United States Team beat Team Canada, 33-11, at the North American Championships last Saturday in Orlando. The No. 2 ranked prospect in the state of Pennsylvania won three state championships in four years, while being named Pennsylvania Player of the Year in 2016 after rushing for 1,564 yards and 25 touchdowns while also receiving for 405 yards his senior campaign. The Army All-American is the No. 3 ranked running back nationally and he joins the talented backfield with Nick Chubb and Sony Michel for the Bulldogs in 2017 Swift chose the Bulldogs over the likes of Alabama, Clemson and Penn State.” - Trent Smallwood\n\"Rivals250 wide receiver Mark Webb was a first-team All-City selection in 2016. The No. 101 nationally ranked prospect helped lead his Archbishop Wood to a fourth State Championship in last six seasons. Webb led his team with 33 receptions for 703 yards and six touchdowns in his senior campaign. The No. 14 nationally ranked receiver is the Bulldogs top ranked signee at the position, but also had an excellent senior season on the defensive side of the ball leading his team with four interceptions. Webb, the No. 5 ranked prospect in Pennsylvania, joins his cousin D'Andre Swift in Athens and gives the Bulldogs two of the top five prospects in the state of Pennsylvania. The home state school Penn State attempted to make a late run for Webb, but in the end it was the Georgia Bulldogs that earned the signature.\" - Trent Smallwood\n\"William Poole III- An Under Armour All-American, Poole committed to Bulldogs back in April, but it was a lot closer than some might have thought. At the time, the four-star defensive back was flirting with the Florida Gators, and at one time seemed like he might actually end up in Gainesville. Those rumors were quickly put to bed and Poole’s been one of the lead recruiters for the Class of 2017. The Hapeville Charter product helped lead his team to the semi-finals in the Class AA division.\" - Paul Maharry\n\"Army All-American offensive tackle Andrew Thomas joins a loaded offensive line class for the Bulldogs. The Rivals100 tackle was one of the Big Movers in the finals rankings after an impressive week in San Antonio, moving up 72 spots from No. 160 to No. 88 overall nationally. The No. 10 nationally ranked offensive tackle gives the Bulldogs two offensive tackles ranked in the Rivals100, and two of the top ten offensive tackles in the country. Thomas is also the No. 10 ranked prospect in the state of Georgia, giving Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs six of the top ten and eight of the top 15 in the Peach State. Thomas committed to the Bulldogs back in July of 2016 over top tier schools like Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame, and others.\" - Trent Smallwood\n\"One of two PACE Academy players that will be joining the Bulldogs, Trey Blount’s been a Dawg ever since he committed. Blount is a four-star prospect on Rivals.com and was a starter the majority of his time at PACE Academy. The talented wide receiver could even see some reps at defensive back, as he is well versed in both positions. Much like Landers, Blount committed to UGA early in his recruitment and decided to stick with his commitment.\" - Paul Maharry\n\"Eric Stokes is the fastest man in the state. He is the defending Georgia track champion in the 100, 200 and 400 meters. A raw prospect who will benefit from good coaching, Stokes will play defensive back. And while he may not be an instant impact guy, you can't teach speed like that.\" - Radi Nabulsi\n\"Tray Bishop, an Army All-American, gives Georgia one of the better athletes in the 2017 class. The former Auburn commit starred all over the field during his high school career, but will likely be playing in the defensive backfield during his time in Athens. The three-star prospect waited until late in the process to flip over from the Tigers to the Dawgs, but Georgia fans will be glad he did.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"Ameer Speed gave Georgia some good news to get National Signing Day started. The three-star defensive back out of Sandalwood High School in Jacksonville chose the Dawgs over Michigan State, North Carolina, Oregon and Virginia Tech. His commitment adds size and versatility to Mel Tucker's secondary that he and Kirby Smart had been looking for in the 2017 class.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"While Under Armour All-American Robert Beal spent his senior season at IMG Academy in Florida, he spent majority of his career in the state of Georgia. The No. 177 nationally ranked prospect spent a big part of his senior campaign battling nagging injuries, and decided to move back home in November enrolling at Peachtree Ridge High School to graduate in the home state. The No. 9 ranked nationally weakside defensive end spent most of his playing career at Norcross High School, and drew comparisons to Bulldogs outside linebacker and Norcross graduate Lorenzo Carter. The one time Notre Dame commit had schools like Florida State and South Carolina pushing hard for his signature down the stretch, but Georgia was able to hold onto and sign the talented edge rusher.\" - Trent Smallwood\n\"Three-star defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt is not as highly ranked as some in this class, but the upside is out the roof for the Towers High School standout. Wyatt was recently named to the Touchdown Club of Atlanta Metro All-Stars team where he was one of nine future Bulldogs honored. The No. 30 ranked defensive tackle nationally was a do it all player for his Towers team, whether it was making sacks and tackles for loss on the defensive side of the ball, or running the football on offense. Following a talented interior defensive class in 2016 for Georgia, Wyatt enters Athens as the top rated defensive tackle for the class of 2017. While only ranked No. 43 in the state of Georgia, Wyatt has the tools and athleticism to contribute early in the trenches for the Bulldogs. The one time South Carolina commit flipped to Georgia back in August, and the Bulldogs had to fend off a late run by the Gamecocks to gain his signature.\" - Trent Smallwood\n\"Georgia's biggest addition in more ways than one was Isaiah Wilson, a five-star offensive tackle out of New York. The Bulldogs had to fight off some of the nation's best recruiters in Nick Saban and Jim Harbaugh, but were able to end up earning a commitment from their highest ranked offensive lineman in a long time in Wilson, the No. 4 offensive tackle in the 2017 class.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"Malik Herring waited until later in the process to make his intentions of playing for Georgia official, but it was widely speculated all along that he would end up picking Georgia. As the No. 6 strongside defensive end in the 2017 class, Herring gives Georgia more depth on the defensive line and another athletic edge pass rusher to get after opposing quarterbacks.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"Nate McBride's signature helps Georgia solidify the linebacking core for the next few years. A four-star prospect, McBride finished up ranked as the No. 5 linebacker in the 2017 class nationally. Also ranked as the No. 60 prospect in the 2017 Rivals250, expect him to be an early contributor in Athens.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"An Army All-American, Johnson was at one point committed to play football for Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Johnson is the fourth best guard in the nation, according to Rivals.com, and is also a Rivals100 player. Johnson’s known for his choice of hair color, normally some variation of pink or red, but it is his play on the field that could get him recognized even more by Georgia fans. The four-star has the ability to see the field early for Kirby Smart and the Georgia Bulldogs.\" - Paul Maharry\n\"The 6-foot-5 wide receiver does not get talked about often, but it is not because he can’t play. Wide receivers coach James Coley found Landers early on in the recruiting process and made him a target. Landers committed to Georgia back in June and never wavered. While being the least talked about recruit, Landers has the opportunity to come in and learn the playbook without the unnecessary stress of having to come in and impress automatically.\" - Dan McDonald\n\"Walter Grant didn't become a part of Georgia's 2017 class until the middle of his senior season, but Bulldog fans will be glad he did. He'll pair up with McBride to strengthen Georgia's inside linebacker position going forward. Kirby Smart found a way to beat his old boss Nick Saban again to land Grant, the No. 17 inside linebacker in the 2017 class nationally.\" - Dan McDonald\n“Justin Shaffer was committed to Louisville fell in love with Sam Pittman and once the Bulldogs offered immediately jumped at the offer. Although his more heralded teammate at Cedar Grove, four-star Netori Johnson, received more personal accolades, Pittman loves his frame and athleticism for a big man. Shaffer certainly has a future on the Bulldogs’ offensive line.” - Anthony Dasher\n\"An Army All-American, Demery shut down his recruitment back in June and never looked back. Demery, who lost his mother July 27 due to Lupus, has had to grow up in a very short amount of time. The three-star offensive tackle looks to be offensive line coach Sam Pittman’s first project since taking over at the University of Georgia. Demery might not see the field this fall, but he should be a valuable part of the offensive line rotation for years to come.\" - Paul Maharry\n“Jaden Hunter was one of Georgia’s first commitments to the Bulldogs and it’s easy to see why. The son of the late Brice Hunter, former wider receiver with the Bulldogs, Jaden Hunter is a four-star performer who boated 19 offers from FBS schools, including Alabama and LSU, along with non-conference powerhouses Clemson and Michigan. Although he’ll have to add some weight and some muscle, Hunter has that quick twitch that you just can’t coach and coaches love his nose for the football and ability to make plays.” - Anthony Dasher\n\"Mater Academy (Hialeah Gardens, Fla.) defensive back Latavious Brini , who initially committed to the Bulldogs over the summer and decommitted soon thereafter, now jumps back in the fold. The addition of Brini gives the Bulldogs a third cornerback commitment on signing day. The 6-foot-2 corner accumulated 32 total offers throughout his recruiting process, and chose Georgia over Charlie Strong coached USF today. Brini brings size and versatility that Kirby Smart and Mel Tucker are looking for in the secondary in Athens. The three-star defensive back is the 26th overall commitment and seventh defensive back commit for the class of 2017.\" - Trent Smallwood\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/p7ppxqqwqhtfb8gobzid", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/p7ppxqqwqhtfb8gobzid)"], "published": "2017-02-01T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T21:10:20.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
