Today it is a keystone of the city's sporting calendar. (Prince George Newspaper Archives/Prince George Citizen/Prince George Public Library)\nTheir initial version had competitors cross-country skiing up Tabor Mountain, switching to downhill skis to get down before biking 20 kilometres into town to skate, run and swim.\nNot many people signed up.\n\"I think there were eight people willing to give this a go,\" Hallmark said.\nThe race was cancelled when temperatures dropped to below -30 C, giving organizers a chance to revise their plans and come up with a more achievable race.\nSince then, the competition has grown from having 50 people in 1988 to more than 600 in recent events, with athletes ranging in age from elementary school students to seniors. \nOver 100 volunteers are needed to block traffic, keep time and prepare venues for the annual Prince George Iceman. (Prince George Iceman)\nHallmark thinks part of the event's popularity stems from the fact that variable weather makes it difficult to compare times and speeds from year to year, decreasing pressure to compete.\nOne year conditions were so warm that skaters had to form into a 'funnel' in order to pass through a one-metre wide patch of ice.\nOther years have been quite a bit colder, with the official cutoff for cancelation being -20 C, which has only happened twice.\nHallmark explained the cutoff is less for the athletes and more for the hundreds of volunteers who have to stand outside for hours to make the event happen.\nShe said she only expects the popularity to grow as endurance events such as Tough Mudder take off.\nFor the 30th Prince George Iceman organizers printed a retro t-shirt using the logo from 1988. It is already sold out. (Prince George Iceman)\n\"If you think about it, this is the original and this is in the winter which makes it even crazier and tougher,\" she said.\n\"I think because we're in Northern British Columbia where community and winter, all of these elements, make us who we are. Something like the Iceman makes us who we are.\"\nThe 30th Prince George Iceman takes place Sunday, Feb. 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:29:42.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
