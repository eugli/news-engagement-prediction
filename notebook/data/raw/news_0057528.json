But we have different views, we think that some deliberate insult should not be tolerated, which undermines law and order.\"\nSeveral police associations plan to lobby the city's government to ban insulting acts against public officers on duty, reported the Post.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/800F/production/_94638723_76691c55-3386-4604-8016-0e1de336d3b9.jpg", "http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2073069/mass-meeting-police-support-hong-kong-officers-jailed-beating-occupy", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-36410804", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8520/production/_94808043_d30502ae-1cf5-443d-96d1-0303bd0da1ba.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-39000618", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29635426", "http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1315176-20170222.htm"], "published": "2017-02-23T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:18:52.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
