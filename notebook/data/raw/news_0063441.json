It needed a tidy-up, for sure. It was pretty messy last year. \n“But now it’s so much riskier to make a pass. The racing might be not as good because of some things. The penalties are just too harsh now. So I think they might change that back a little bit. \n“It’s all a kneejerk to the Bathurst thing. That’s what it’s all about, everyone was trying to tidy up stuff like that. It’s too much the other way in my opinion.” \nIt was Van Gisbergen who brought the ‘redress’ move to the fore at the season-opener two years ago. SVG bumped Courtney wide and took the lead, but soon ‘redressed’. Pic: Mark Brake Source: News Corp Australia \nAfter bumping race leader James Courtney wide, Van Gisbergen slowed to allow Courtney to repass him. The HRT driver raced on to victory, while second-placed SVG was widely hailed for his act of sportsmanship. \nNow, drivers will instead be told to race on after any contact and cop either a drive-through penalty or a post-race sanction. \n“A drive-through penalty for something like that is just too harsh,” Van Gisbergen said. \n“When it’s a one-on-one and a car bumps wide (and) you know you’ve mucked up, you should be able to let the guy back through and carry on.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
