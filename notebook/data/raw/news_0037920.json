Mum Michelle Galea was in labour for just 15 minutes before Arlo was born. \nIt started out as a pretty standard Sunday for the Razorback family, with Mrs Galea attending mass at St Paul’s Catholic Church in Camden with Arlo’s big brother Jett, 8, and twins Ruby and Ava, 5, before going for a morning shop and coffee with the children. media_camera Little Arlo Galea with mum Michelle, brother Jett, 8, and five-year-old twins Ruby (left) and Ava. Picture: Robert Pozo \n“I was at home and I started to feel a bit unwell,” Mrs Galea said. \n“I rang my doctor, Peter Hammill from Sydney Southwest Private Hospital, and he told me to come in just to be safe. \n“I was getting some stuff together as you do and then it started, all of a sudden, and I realised, I’m having this baby now.” \nMrs Galea, her children and husband Robert quickly jumped in their car and hit the road to Camden Hospital on the advice of their doctor. media_camera Mrs Galea with the brand new car Arlo was born in outside Camden Hospital. Picture: Robert Pozo \n“I rang the doctor to tell him what was happening and he told us to head to Camden Hospital (the closest), and started instructing me on what to do if the baby was born while I was in the car,” she said. \n“It was incredibly frustrating driving out of Razorback, it’s a one-lane road and my husband was flashing the lights hoping to get people who were driving slowly out of our way. \n“On the way I was preparing myself and getting into a mindset, I knew this baby was coming.’’ \nArlo was born in the front seat of the car after Mr Galea raced into the hospital to seek help. \n“At first he wasn’t making any noise and I started to feel around his neck, to check if the umbilical chord was around it,” Mrs Galea said. \n“It didn’t take long though for him to start crying and I thought, thank God he’s here and he’s okay. media_camera Arlo with his family at Camden Hospital immediately after his birth. \n“I think I was able to really focus once I realised what was going on. I work as a police officer and I think having the experience of being in stressful situations helped.” \nMrs Galea’s contractions had begun at 1.45pm and by a few minutes past 2pm little Arlo was sitting on his mother’s stomach. \n“When the hospital staff and Robert came back out they were just gobsmacked,” she said. \n“Everyone was just in shock. I took them a little while to grab the wheelchair and get us up to the hospital.” \nThe surprises weren’t over yet for the Galea family. Robert and Michelle had decided not to find out the baby’s sex before birth. \n“We hadn’t really thought about it even after Arlo was born, with everything that was happening we were so focused on getting him into the hospital,” she said. media_camera Arlo meets his father Robert. \n“I had been clutching him to my chest to make sure there was no chance I would drop him and because of that no one could see if he was a boy or a girl. \n“It wasn’t until about 10 minutes after when we were in the hospital that one of the nurses asked us and we checked.” \nMrs Galea praised the hospital staff who helped her before she was transported to Sydney Southwest Private Hospital. \n“They were really fantastic, they went above and beyond in a situation they could never have expected,” she said. media_camera Mrs Galea shows her love for her newborn baby. Picture: Robert Pozo \n“They made me very comfortable while we waited for the ambulance to arrive. \n“Dr Hammill was amazing as well, he lives locally and arrived at hospital just a couple of minutes after the birth to help.” \nShe is now looking forward to telling Arlo all about his birth when he gets older. \n“Looking back, the actual experience was beautiful, having everyone there,” she said. \n“I am looking forward to telling him all about it. \n“It’ll be a nice story to tell him about how we bought the new car on the Friday and he christened it on the Sunday.” \nSouth Western Sydney Local Health Network clinical maternity manager Karen Sorenson said a birth such as Mrs Galea’s wasn’t a regular occurrence but was not considered uncommon. \n“It does happen, probably less than one per cent of the births across our hospitals but it happens,” she said. \n“Some women just give birth quickly, particularly if they’ve had a few births beforehand, their body can become programmed to it. \n“It can be enormously stressful on the mother and the partner, some people may think a quick birth would be great but you can imagine what it would be like to have a baby in those circumstances if a doctor or nurse isn’t around.” media_camera Michelle and Robert Galea an impatient Arlo at Camden Hospital. \nMrs Galea said Arlo is settling in well with the family and is by his sisters and brother. \nArlo weighed in at a healthy 3.5kg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:54:27.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
