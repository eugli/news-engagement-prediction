Rinehart's China connections open up 'channels' \nBeef industry consultant Timothy Kelf said the businesswoman's mining connections in China bode well for her beef line.

(ABC News: Dominique Schwartz) \n\"Even if she's in the mining industry, by virtue of having connections in aspects of China it channels you towards the right people to deal in the meat business,\" he said. \n\"She'll be able to get into channels of delivery with that product into some of the best hotels and restaurants I am sure because the connections she has in the other parts of her business.\" \nThe wagyu brand is separate from S Kidman and Co which Hancock Prospecting bought last year with one-third joint venture partner Shanghai CRED. \nMrs Rinehart has stressed in the past that she is deeply committed to honouring and preserving the Kidman heritage and brand, and has previously highlighted her family's historical ties with Sir Sidney Kidman. \nShanghai CRED, Mrs Rinehart's Kidman co-owner, has also been busy establishing supply lines into China — not for packaged beef, but for the emerging live cattle market. China's rise as a live trade market \nOver the weekend, Australia's first live shipment to China left Portland in south-western Victoria under a new health protocol agreement between the two countries. \nIt will deliver 1,200 head of black Angus to Shanghai CRED to distribute. \n\"I don't see China as being a big live trade market in the next year-and-a-half to two years,\" corporate agribusiness analyst David Williams said. \n\"But it will certainly be a market once we start to get our animal herd up here and our cattle prices fall from near-record highs. \n\"These early shipments will be testing the market and testing the logistics … and clearances. \n\"I think it bodes well for probably two years down the track when our stock starts to get back to what it was previously.\" \nMr Kelf, an expert in China's beef market, said he'd be \"very surprised\" if some Kidman stock was not live exported to China, particularly because of the part ownership with Shanghai CRED. \nHe said some of the properties are situated in parts of the country where there are not export restrictions. \n\"From the Kidman point of view, she's [Mrs Rinehart] in a very good position to be able to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the mass market in China.\" \nWhile Mrs Rinehart's beef business is tiny compared with her mining interests, she has proven she is serious about expanding her agricultural investments, and is in it for the long haul. \n\"Food, like mining is not for the faint-hearted, especially when you're in the Top End: it's driven by weather, disease and international markets and it's still a risky game so it needs people with big kahunas,\" Mr Williams said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:46:18.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
