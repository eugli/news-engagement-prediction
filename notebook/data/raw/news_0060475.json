(Matthew le Cordeur, Fin24) #Budget2017: Little good news for South Africans \nCape Town – The hearty reception Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan got in Parliament when he delivered his Budget Speech on Wednesday is a reflection on President Jacob Zuma's failures, says political analyst Theo Venter. \nVenter said Gordhan seemed \"more presidential and dignified than Zuma and [US President] Donald Trump together\", Netwerk24 reported . \nGordhan received a standing ovation from the opposition. There was less enthusiasm among some ANC ministers however. \nMineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, who was fingered along with Van Rooyen in a report on alleged \"state capture\", walked out during the speech. \nVenter said the innuendos were significant. \nGordhan's approach to the plan for radical economic transformation, to which Zuma referred in his State of the Nation Address (SONA), is more achievable and politically significant, he said. \n\"Gordhan's approach and explanation is more pragmatic and based on economic efficiency, rather than the president's ideological one.\" \n'Clear message to successor' \nProfessor Dirk Kotzé, a political analyst at Unisa, said Gordhan didn't come across as someone under siege and whose political future was in the balance. \n\"His Budget Speech was almost like a SONA, with a clear-cut vision of what the future holds.\" \nHe said Gordhan's breakdown of economic transformation made more sense than the message Zuma tried to convey during his SONA. \n\"He also sent out a clear message to his successor that they would be facing an extremely complicated agenda.\" \nAccording to independent analyst Daniel Silke, Gordhan's approach to economic transformation seems more holistic and sober. \n\"He made it clear that it is not only about redistribution, but that the country also needs economic growth.\" \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
