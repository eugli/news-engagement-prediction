He's her confidant, hype man and apologist — sometimes all within the span of a single sentence. He’s droll with a dry wit and seen-it-all attitude, a throwback to a more civilized, elegant time. \nThe casting brings Omundson back to ABC following his two-season role as King Richard in Dan Fogelman musical comedy Galavant . The actor next guest stars on ABC's American Housewife and Fox's Lucifer . His credits include Psych, Judging Amy and Deadwood . He's repped by Innovative Artists and Jackoway Tyerman. \nSaltzman will pen the script and exec produce alongside Poehler, Brooke Posch, Burnett, 3 Arts' Dave Becky and Michael Pelmont. Matt Oberg co-stars. \nKeep track of the latest news and castings at THR.com/PilotSeason and bookmark THR 's handy guide .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:45:13.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
