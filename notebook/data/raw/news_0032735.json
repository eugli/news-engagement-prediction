Spanning across 15,000sq ft, the retail store will offer customers the full range of products that we have,” he shares. \nNgei and his team are currently scouting for suitable locations in these six areas and aim to open all the new outlets by the end of 2017. \nTo-date, there are eight Feruni retail stores and 11 premium resellers across Malaysia. \nBuilding a strong foothold in Johor would also enable Feruni to create brand awareness and introduce its products to Singapore, given that the country is only a causeway away. \nNgei reveals that he is also planning to take Feruni across the region into countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and China. \n“The tile consumption rates are three times, two and a half times, and up to 20 times more for Indonesia, Thailand and China respectively, compared to Malaysia. \n“We believe that our business will flourish because these markets are huge and we just need to tap into the right one. \n“No doubt, there is a lot of research and preparation to be done but we are really excited and determined to create our brand presence in other countries,” expresses Ngei. \nAside from just expanding the business, Ngei also hopes to introduce Feruni’s culture to the tiling industry in these countries. He hopes the company’s core values and goals will help transform and inspire the industry to impact the communities they are in. \n“We don’t just want to go there and sell tiles. Our plan is to also bring the entire concept to that country. How we run the business the right way, how we run community projects and how we treat our staff. \n“This is something we are really passionate about,” he stresses. \n“We are also in the midst of looking for the right partners to work together — the ones that are championing the same cause as us. It is crucial that we get like-minded people to work with,” Ngei adds. \nAccording to Feruni director Roger Ong, there are not many tile brands in the world that have set up their own retail store. \n“Typically, manufacturers would just distribute their tiles without proper brand representation and way of marketing. \n“For us, we want to have a strong brand presence in the country itself. Additionally, we want to make our tiles as affordable as possible,” says Ong. \nFeruni’s expansion plans will be rolled out in the second quarter onwards. \nOng also notes that Feruni is working towards minimising wastage of unused and unwanted tiles this year. \n“From our survey, we found out that about 30% to 40% of people usually hack off their tiles because they are not happy with the current offerings by the developer. \n“Tiles are very messy to hack off and it’s more costly for the homebuyers, on top of getting new tiles. \n“We want to offer tiles that house owners like so that they don’t need to hack them off. Feruni has a wide range of designs for them to choose from,” he explains. \nFeruni will be working with property developers to address this issue. \n“We have a combination of marble designs, wood and more. There are also various sizes customers can choose from. \n“Our specialty is the modular design that combines different sizes of tiles to form a unique pattern when installed. \n“There is also the i-Shape collection that takes inspiration from natural geometrical elements of nature, while the ActiveSurface tile is created as a low VOC (volatile organic compound) product and is anti-microbial,” he adds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:06:34.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
