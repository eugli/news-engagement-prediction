The final straw was a 30-point loss to Wake Forest on Saturday. Mark Gottfried (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:39  39 p.m. ET \nNorth Carolina State is in the process of searching for a replacement for head men's basketball coach Mark Gottfried, who is near the completion of his sixth season in charge of the Wolfpack. \nA source close to the process told Sporting News the university has begun to reach out to gauge the interest of potential candidates, including at least one such contact initiated Tuesday. \nMORE: Ryan Fagan's latest Field of 68 projections \nMark Armstrong of Raleigh TV station WTVD reported Monday that N.C. State has made the decision to remove Gottfried at the end of the season. University officials were considering an immediate dismissal following an embarrassing loss Saturday at Wake Forest, but determined that would not be the best course to follow. \n“My thing right now is I’ve got North Carolina I’m preparing for (Wednesday) night,” Gottfried told SN on Tuesday evening. “I believe in our team. I know we’ve had some struggles but we’ve showed at times we can be very good. My hope is we can get on a run. My goal is to get us into our fifth NCAA Tournament in the last six years. I don’t know anything else.\" \nGottfried is 122-81 in his time at State. The Wolfpack have lost five consecutive games entering their rivalry game Wednesday against the Tar Heels. The Pack are 14-12 overall, 3-10 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, one game out of last place in the 15-team league. The team's defense stands 216th in the nation in efficiency, according to KenPom.com. \nMORE: Smith high in NBA Draft prospect rankings \nThe season began with considerable promise with top point guard recruit Dennis Smith Jr. arriving to join a team with two double-figure scorers returning. The official ACC preseason poll projected the Pack for a sixth-place finish. \nAgainst opponents from top-six leagues, however, State is 3-12. One of those victories was a comeback win over Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium, but consecutive losses last week to Florida State and Wake by a combined 54 points appears to have led the university to this decision.
