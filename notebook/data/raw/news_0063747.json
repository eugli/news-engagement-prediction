The pair were together on and off for 10 years Mark called off the engagement five months after proposing \n\"I love TOWIE! It's one of those shows you don't want to watch, but just can't help turning on,\" she wrote. \n\"I don't know how Lauren can take Mark back so easily, though - it's so cringe!\" \nShe also said she'd never be able to take someone back after they'd gone behind her back. The pair started dating when they were just 15 \n\"I wouldn't' be able to get back with someone who'd slept with lots of girls I knew, but that's just me,\" she continued. \nMark and Lauren got engaged in March 2011 after dating for 10 years on and off, but the radio DJ called off the engagement just five months later.

But later he realises she's perfect.\" \nAnd Mark fired back on Twitter: \"If your reading this, please PLEASE respect my wife and STOP. I wish you well but leave me, my life and my wife out of it. Im sure there is other ways to make money.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:57:35.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
