TETSURO MITOMO/FAIRFAX NZ \nFarmer Geoff Wallace has been shocked by reactions to his frank advert seeking staff. \nWallace echoed this sentiment. He did not want a \"sloppy worker\". \nHe is building six sheds to house more than 500 bulls during part of the winter as his Makikihi property abuts the Wainono Lagoon, an internationally significant wetland. \nThe sheds would protect his bulls from the cold weather and soggy winter soil, while preventing effluent from entering the lagoon. \nBut a shed full of wheat straw and bulls would be no match for a cigarette so he ruled out smokers. Ad Feedback \n\"I don't want roast beef before their time,\" Wallace said. \nHe had received a dozen job applications in the last couple of days for the positions, but wished some people had read the advert more carefully. \n\"I'll give anyone a chance, but I won't put people in a situation where they could kill themselves,\" Wallace said. \nChanges to health and safety regulations meant the onus was on the employer, not the employee, to take care, which was \"disappointing\", he said. \nWallace had more workers in their 60s and 70s because they might move slower, but they had the experience to manage their times and the knowledge to work faster, he said. \n\"I just want someone who is focused on the job, not their phone.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:24:21.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
