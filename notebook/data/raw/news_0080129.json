The 16-year-old (yes, you read that correctly) star of Disney’s Moana was on stage at the Academy Awards to sing “How Far I’ll Go,” which was nominated for Best Original Song, and her poise in the spotlight was one of the evening’s most charming moments. Now, Deadline is reporting that Cravalho will go from animation to live action, having landed the lead role in the pilot for NBC’s Drama High . The potential series is based on a book of the same name about a high school teacher named Lou Volpe, who ran an influential drama program in a working class community. Cravalho will play Lilette, one of Volpe’s students, in her TV debut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:48:58.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
