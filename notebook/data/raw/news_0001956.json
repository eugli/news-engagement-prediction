He fled to Cairo before moving to Canada, but his brother Ali remained across the ocean. \nIn January, he told Global News that since arriving, the most difficult part was knowing he left his brother in Egypt. But last month, he got the call his brother would be joining him in only a few weeks. \nThat day has finally arrived. \nAli is set to arrive in Fredericton on Thursday night and said during a Facetime call, through his brother as an interpreter, that he’s excited. \n“He cannot describe how much he’s happy after a long year of huge stress… he’s in Canada and is going to be with his family again,” Bakhash translated. \nIt’s not just his brother arriving either. His sister-in-law and six nieces and nephews are all flying in. \nWaiting for this day alongside the Bakhash family is Brenda McAdam, who has become good friends with the family since they moved to the city. \nShe said she’s seen the excitement grow in the family, especially in Bakhash’s mother. \n“She’s just trembling here, she’s so excited,” McAdam said. \nAs they await for Ali’s arrival, Bakhash said having his brother back will be a special moment for everyone, especially his mother. \n“For years she was a bird with two wings… one of them was broken but today it’s mended and today she’s recovering and I can tell you today she can fly again,” he said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
