It transports you to a place and time of simpler means, introducing you to a cast of characters so quirky and unique in their appearances and behaviors, they'll stick with you long after the credits have stopped rolling. With a story so charming, a collection of music so nostalgic, and a fully realized setting so immaculately constructed, it's rare to find a movie as captivating and as beautifully poignant as this. And yet, Wes Anderson (a director known for his idiosyncratic visual style and astonishing attention to detail) has risen above and beyond expectations to create what may just be his best work since \"The Royal Tenenbaums\". Suffice it to say, I adore this film.Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, \"Moonrise Kingdom\" follows the story of two 12-year-olds named Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away into the wilderness together. As various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is brewing off-shore - and the peaceful island community is turned upside down in more ways than anyone can handle.Above anything else, the acting in this movie is what truly stands out. Newcomers Gilman and Hayward bring a sense of complete authenticity and remarkable depth to their roles that's rarely ever seen these days. Their dialogue feels refreshingly unscripted, and the extended pauses of silence they share make their chemistry even more genuine and poignant. They're the heart and soul of the film, and you easily want to root for them every step of the way. The adult actors in the cast deliver wonderful performances as well. Bruce Willis and Edward Norton play against-type as the local sheriff and a Khaki Scout troop leader, respectively. It's simply hysterical to see these two well-known action stars acting as unashamedly awkward as they possibly can. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand also turn in enjoyably memorable performances as Suzy's overprotective parents, as do Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, and Bob Balaban as the movie's quirky narrator. At the end of the day, the acting is absolutely brilliant. There's just no other way to put it.Calling \"Moonrise Kingdom\" a work of art would be an understatement. This, my friends, is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. From the quaint New England set pieces to the carefully framed camera shots to the deadpan humor spoken by every character, Wes Anderson has created a dazzling gem of a film, a picture that captivates its viewers with each scene and takes them on a whirlwind journey through a whimsical land that feels utterly nostalgic. I know I may sound overenthusiastic about this movie, but I honestly can't find any other words to express my true admiration for it. As a lover of cinema, this is by far one of the most enthralling films I've ever experienced, and I truly can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen this extraordinarily original comedy-drama yet, give it a chance. I promise you won't regret it! Loved everything about this movie by aaffleck My son was one of 300 (or so) Rhode Island boy scouts who appeared as extras in this movie when they filmed at the Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Rhode Island. While it certainly was fun to be on the set and to watch certain films being shot (and seeing my son, lips blue, shivering with cold, staggering off the set where they boys had had fire hoses raining water on them for hours, asking me if he could go home now -- of course he has no regrets now that he's seen the finished product). So, I might be a bit biased about this movie. But I have to be completely honest, I truly loved this film. I went to go see if I could see my son but I kept forgetting to look (thank goodness for the HD version, now I can!) because I got so caught up in the story, the cinematography, the music, the artistry of the whole picture. I just loved it. This movie is touching, funny (so, so very funny), and charming, witty, andâ€¦ oh just watch it. You won't be sorry. Moonrise by banehardy this is a beautiful master piece with quirky humor and the sweet tale of young love. This is a wonderful independent movie and certainly worth a buy.
