Their applause was loud in support of George, who remained with the team after Pacers president Larry Bird didn’t make a blockbuster deal before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline. George heard the fans and appreciated their response. \n“It was an emotional moment to be honest,” George said. “Even running out of the tunnel, I couldn’t help but have a little smirk from them just being happy and cheering, them being really happy for me continuing my career here. I felt that. I felt a little queasy going out, but that’s the reason why I love being here. That’s love that I love here.” \nCollectively, the Pacers responded Friday by defeating the Memphis Grizzlies 102-92 in one of their better performances of the season. The win was much needed for the Pacers, who snapped their season-long six-game losing streak. \nThe fans rejoiced when George swished his first shot, a 3-pointer early in the first quarter. Yet George played the role of decoy for much of Friday’s game, and his unselfishness allowed his teammates to excel. Six Pacers scored 10 or more points in a balanced offensive attack. George was not one of those players to crack double figures. He finished with just nine points on an inefficient 3-of-12 shooting. He did collect nine rebounds and added four assists.

The cramp became too bearable late in the fourth quarter and he grabbed his final rebound. George landed awkwardly after his foot slipped. After two steps, George grimaced. He needed help from a trainer to walk off the court. He then hobbled back to the locker room before the final buzzer. \n“(The cramps) started about the five minute mark,” said George, who expects to play in Saturday’s game against the Miami Heat. “It just got worse and worse as the game went on. I asked the (trainer) to massage me, but he took off. We had to go back on the other end (after a timeout) and I had to just deal with it. I should be fine. I’ll drink a lot of water and drink a lot of Gatorade.” \nThe Pacers, in their cardinal red-and-gold Hickory uniforms, played with the grittiness and intensity George said was needed before the game. George said the Pacers needed to be better at boxing out when trying to collect rebounds. The Pacers outrebounded the Grizzles 50-39. The Pacers (30-28) held Memphis to 41.7 percent shooting. They also did a better job of defending the 3-point line, which plagued them for much of their losing streak. \n“We played some defense,” George said in explaining the biggest reason why the Pacers were victorious.
