All seven could potentially have liquid water, which is the key to our survival on other planets under the right atmospheric conditions. \nâThis discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life,â Thomas Zurbuchen , associate administrator of the agencyâs Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement. âAnswering the question âare we aloneâ is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal.â Watch a video below to find out more info… \nClick inside to read tweets from celebs about the discovery… I'd be happy with any news @NASA makes about a discovery beyond our solar system except if they announce finding thisđđťđđł #findoutin50minutes pic.twitter.com/DEXJKdxDN3 \n— William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) February 22, 2017 #asknasa Have youbern able to determine how many planets actually orbit TRAPPIST-1?
