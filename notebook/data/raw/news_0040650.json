Simon Rice for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 15 Feb 2017 11:40 am Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is a Chelsea legend (Getty) \nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has declared which side in the Premier League has the best XI, and remarkably he didn’t pick Chelsea . \nConsidering the former striker’s ties with Stamford Bridge and the fact Antonio Conte’s men are 10 points clear at the top of the league , they would have been the obvious choice. ‘How can Gibbs be captain?!’ Man Utd legend Roy Keane TEARS into Arsenal flops \nHowever Hasselbaink instead picked Tottenham. \n‘Their squad is not the biggest but I do say this again, the first XI for me is the most talented out of the [top] six,’ he told Sky Sports. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored 88 goals over four seasons at Chelsea (Getty) \nMauricio Pochettino’s side resume their Europa League campaign this week and the lack of squad depth will prove a problem ‘big time’ according to Hasselbaink as they look to keep the pressure on Chelsea in the league. \n‘But they have to take the competition [Europa League] seriously because if you win it you’re in the Champions League,’ said Hasselbaink, who added: ‘They just need to go back on track in the Premier League as they’ve been doing, playing their football, they’ve been playing beautiful football. Need to improve a little bit when they are playing against the top six. If they can get more points they will be in the top four.’ Tottenham are currently third in the table (Getty) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:45:27.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
