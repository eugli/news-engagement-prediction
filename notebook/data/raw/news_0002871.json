Water is our natural resource; therefore, we should use it to attract big investments. \nWhy did the video clip go viral? \nTan should ask why the video clip showing a lion apparently refusing to perform in front of Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak and Rosmah Mansor went viral? \nWhy were people gleeful and took the trouble to even share the video clip, when they saw that the lion seemingly refused to dance? \nIf what Tan claimed was true that the ‘lion’ was peeling citrus fruits, it no longer matters. Why did Najib and Rosmah not be patient to wait a bit longer? You do not expect to enjoy a two-minute Maggi noodle in just 15 seconds. \nIt is not only this video clip that has gone viral. I have seen many others including one captured by Astro Awani where Najib said that Petronas was contributing RM26 billion in one particular year; the following year the contribution would be reduced to RM9 billion. In the speech, Najib asked, “What am I going to do with the shortfall of RM15 billion?” \nA young boy in Year One would be able to tell that RM26 billion minus RM9 billion is not RM15 billion, but RM17 billion. Therefore, what happened to the RM2 billion? Such miscalculation coming from a finance minister is what shocked a lot of Malaysians who shared the video clip . \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
