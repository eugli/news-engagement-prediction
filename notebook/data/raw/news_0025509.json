Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd Aileen Cullinane – branded a real-life Vicky Pollard – attacked her mum after downing eight cans of lager while pregnant BBC 6 Neighbours likened Cullinane to Little Britain character Vicky Pollard because of her dress sense and foul-mouthed Facebook rants \nThe incident occurred last November after jobless Cullinane, from Eccles, near Salford, Greater Manchester – who claims £340 a month in state handouts – had knocked back eight cans of lager on the anniversary of her father’s death. \nAt the time she was three months’ pregnant with her second child and magistrates in Manchester were told she had split up with her boyfriend following a ”discussion” over the identity of the unborn child’s father. \nYesterday Cullinane arrived late for her court hearing sporting pink hair and purple lipstick and admitted two charges of assault by beating. Vicky Pollard caught smoking \nProsecutor Miss Ann Deakin told JPs: \"Emotions were running high and on the day in question the defendant had gone to the Gradwells' home with her 10-year-old daughter. ''Whilst there the defendant left her daughter with her mum and stepfather while she went to visit a friend. \n\"While she was out she accepts that she had some alcohol, some eight cans of lager. \n''As a result when she returned to the address an argument happened with her stepfather about the defendant's upbringing. \n\"As a result of that there was an altercation between the defendant and her mother and stepfather. Cavendish Press Aileen Cullinane appeared at court with pink hair and purple lipstick after admitting assaulting her mum Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd The mum - whom neighbours likened to Little Britain's Vicky Pollard - admitted two counts of assault by beating \n\"The defendant accepts that in relation to Lynne Gradwell she pulled her mother's hair twice. \n\"Mark was trying to call the police when she tried to stop him by grabbing the phone out of his hand and struck him - because she didn't want him to call the police at the time.'' \nIn a statement Mrs Gradwell said she still loves her daughter and wants her to get the help that she needs. \nCullinane who has previous convictions for being drunk and disorderly, assault, criminal damage and possession of a weapon in a public place, was conditionally discharged for 18 months. \nShe was ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £75 costs out of her benefits and has to pay a further £1,134 in outstanding fines. \nShortly before she was sentenced, she was confronted by her ex-partner in the corridor of the courthouse who allegedly shouted: \"Where is that n f . I'm going to stab her and kick that baby out of her.\" \nHe then chased her into a side room and banged on the glass. \nWhen court staff tried to intervene, the man - who has green mohican hair and wore a grey hoodie - allegedly tried to headbutt them before running off. Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd 6 The court heard Cullinane's drunken antics happened on the anniversary of her dad's death \nIn court Cullinane's lawyer Steve Munton said in mitigation: \"This was a very regrettable circumstance, this incident has taken place on the anniversary of her biological father's death, which was not natural and this was emotive for her. \n\"The day in question has a background, and the defendant admits to having that drink when she attended at her friend's. \n\"Following that there was a verbal discussion about the upbringing of the defendant and as a result Miss Cullinane admits to pulling the hair of her mother and her step father tried to intervene. \n\"She admits that while she was trying to get the phone from her stepfather she did come into physical contact with him, in a reckless act. \n\"It is aggravated by the drink and the fact that a child was in the address.\" Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd 6 Cullinane became aggressive after a discussion with her mum about upbringing \nMr Munton added: \"Her personal circumstances is that she has recently been forced to move from the Salford area. \n\"She fell pregnant and there were discussions made with her partner of who the father was, which led to the break down of that relationship and she has had to move out of her address and declare herself homeless to get another address. \n\"Her ex-partner attended court this morning and threatened to stab her and kick her unborn child out of her. This was very distressing for her.\" \nCullinane who did not comment after the hearing calls herself Bambi on her social media pages but was likened by former neighbours to Vicky Pollard, the character played by Matt Lucas in the BBC show Little Britain. \nOn Facebook she posed for series of selfies showing blonde pigtails and and a shell suit and her timeline is littered with foul mouthed rants worthy of the comic character. \nOne about a former friend read: \"Saying I will have my new born bby took away - over my dead body that's why my daughters nearly 11 n never once been took or had to be away from me never. F bitch im gunna smack her mams saggy wind pipe.\" \nAnother said: \"Wait til I see this filthy dirt mate, busting my gear n still running her mouth in my channel tracksuit.
