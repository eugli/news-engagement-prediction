Key points New Hope Group already invested in beef and dairy industries with deals worth $200 million China looking offshore to meet domestic demand for beer, mutton and seafood Investment in Kilcoy Pastoral Company has created 130 new jobs in Queensland \nIn 2013 New Hope Group, China's biggest private agribusiness, paid nearly $100 million for a controlling stake in Queensland export beef abattoir Kilcoy Pastoral Company, and in 2015 it announced a $100 million deal with two of the country's biggest dairy farming families — the Moxeys and Perichs in New South Wales. \nNew Hope Group's Australian chief executive officer Nick Dowling said he suspected the company had flown under the radar because it did not buy land and assets outright, preferring to invest in local companies. \n\"We invest into businesses, we don't acquire businesses,\" he said. \n\"We look to work with great partners that have great businesses where we can bring our resources and market access to give life to opportunities that business wouldn't otherwise have. \n\"It's all about giving oxygen for those businesses to grow.\" \nNew Hope Group chairman Liu Yonghao — one of China's richest men — plans to invest $1 billion in Australian agriculture by 2020. \nMr Dowling said the group had not closed its chequebook yet and was looking for further investments in premium food operations from lamb to aquaculture. \n\"He's quite happy to invest another billion or more into Australia in the next two or three years,\" Mr Dowling said. \n\"I don't think there's necessarily any limit to what the chairman wants to invest in, it's really about opportunity.\" \nA sign of New Hope's long-term commitment to Australia came late last year with the opening of the company's new Australian head office in Sydney. Chairman's rags to riches life \nMr Liu 65, is revered in China because of his extraordinary rags to riches life story. \nIn 1982 he and his three brothers sold a watch and a bicycle to raise the equivalent of $AU150 to grow quail.

(ABC News) \n\"My parents were not officials, my relatives were not rich, so everything depends on myself, I just wanted to change myself, change my life,\" he said. \nNew Hope Group is now a global animal protein powerhouse with 90,000 employees working in 600 businesses around the world. \nIn China last year it processed 30 billion chickens, 800 million pigs, sold 20 million tonnes of stock feed and produced 400 million tonnes of milk. \nAccording to the Forbes China Rich List, Mr Liu and his family were worth $4.5 billion in 2016. \nMr Liu started looking at Australia four years ago. \n\"The air and water in Australia are very good, the processing plants are more standardised, and the supervision of Australian Government is also stringent,\" Mr Liu said. \nMr Liu said China could not meet domestic demand for beef, mutton, and seafood and needed to look offshore. \n\"So we thought where could we find these resources and finally we found Australia is a nice place, then we sent a working group to investigate in Australia,\" he said.

(ABC News: Pip Courtney) Job growth from beef exporter deal \nThe first investment in the Kilcoy Pastoral Company (KPC), an hour north of Brisbane, has created 130 jobs. \n\"[The deal] has allowed us to replace older assets with newer more contemporary assets and started to pave the way for future growth,\" KPC chief executive officer Dean Goode said. \n\"For the local community it's been huge, and as the investment comes together we'll see more jobs created.\" \nMr Goode said having a well known Chinese partner had been invaluable, saying \"doors opened\" to opportunities. \n\"The New Hope name's enabled us to gain access not just in China but globally to financiers, business partners or future customers or suppliers,\" he said. \n\"They have shown a willingness to work with the companies, not work on the companies, and actually enable those businesses to grow. \n\"It's almost unbelievable to go from where Mr Liu was in 1994 to where he is today with over 80,000 employees, $14 billion in annual turnover, all from raising quails. \n\"It's quite extraordinary, and if that does not inspire people nothing will.\" 'We can take this business wherever we want'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:10:13.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
