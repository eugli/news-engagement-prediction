She says, \"We have a one and a half year old baby and I had put on a lot of weight after the pregnancy. I really wanted to join the gym, but that's impossible due to my hectic schedule at work, where I spend all day working on laptops. So, I came up with the idea of working out together in the morning. Before getting married, I was inclined yoga and aerobics, and he used to go the gym. Now, instead of that we do a lot of cardio and yoga together, and he indulges in some weight lifting. We anyway get very little time together, and this not only ensures that we get some time together every morning, but also motivate each other to stay fit!\" However, Gurdeep says that dieting is something that she finds impossible, thanks to the fact that she barely gets any time to cook. \nPointing out how working out together can be beneficial in more ways than one would think, Dr Dharam P Pandey, Director and HOD, department of Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, says, \"Not only is it cost-effective and saves money, but people feel more connected to each other, supported and confident, and you also get a lot of additional time together.

I usually recommend 20-minute cardio and functional training or body weight exercises to people who come to me. Many also want to do ab exercises and of course, there's the lot which has back issues due to their desk jobs. And it works out pretty well for people because you are working out with someone you're comfortable with.\" Manmeet, who trains about 10 couples a day, says that most couples have the same body type, and hence, have the same regime. \"But sometimes, their body types are different or have injuries of problems, so we have to tweak a few exercises here and there to make it more convenient.\" She recommends doing crunches with a ball, planks and trunk rotation with a band. Abhishek Sinha, Manager and Head Trainer Equilibrium, Faridabad, recommends abdominal workouts, leg workouts, chest workouts by body weight together, acroyoga workouts, circuit training together, running, cycling, body combat workouts and acrobatics in the swimming pool. \n41-year old Harsh and his wife Aditi (38) have figures out exactly how to tackle their health. He's an interior designer who does a lot of field work and she's a lecturer at Delhi University, and they both make it a point to work out for an hour at least five times a week. Says Harsh, \"We are also very conscious about our diet, read up a lot about staying fit and pick up a lot of exercises for couples off the internet. We've divided up the work - she works on the mental part, which is all the studies on the internet on the exercises and the kind of nutrition needed, while I work on physical aspect like which weights to pick up, etc. It helps us train better and keeps us motivated. Though body weight exercises are a little tough, it's easier to work with weights. We do a lot of push ups, pull ups, squats and bench tricep. Our cardio is a little different - we sprint for 30 seconds and then walk for three minutes - the body burns up all the fat directly in those three minutes and 30 seconds.\" And as far as their diet goes, they eat a lot of natural foods and avoid processed foods. They also eat a lot of bananas, sports supplements like protein shakes, Chicken, eggs and meats in healthy preparations. But Saturday is their cheat day. Adds Harsh, \"We don't party every day or hit the gym. We just party on Saturdays, the only cheat day.\" Sweating out with each other brings intimacy.
