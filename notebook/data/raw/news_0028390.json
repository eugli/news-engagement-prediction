Then on Tuesday, they come out to celebrate with a promo and get jumped by The Revival to set up a guaranteed “get the crowd into it” WM opening match.

By: tgbusteed 02.13.2017 @ 7:42 PM \nMaybe not, but people will get excited over a new challenger appearing. Especially when the rest of the division looks like trash. By: SHough610 02.13.2017 @ 4:09 PM \nThe Elimination Chamber itself was pretty fun, but hurt tremendously by it being WrestleMania Season and everything being by-the-numbers obvious \nI can’t hate on predictability when it works as well as the Chamber did last night. I don’t trust the WWE to do swerves well. By: dl316bh 02.13.2017 @ 4:12 PM \nI’m with you, man. It drives me nuts when they swerve just to swerve, even if it makes no sense in context of the stories they’ve been telling. I mean, Sheamus winning the Rumble over Jericho is brought up regarding this all the time. Predictable isn’t bad. That’s just the downside of being wise to the business and the nature of stories in general. There’s value in finishing the stories you’re telling, even if everybody figured out where it’s going because they can connect A to B. By: TheFakeMSol 02.13.2017 @ 5:01 PM \nI’m thirding this. The result made sense for the story they’re telling, which is way better than WWE overthinking the booking and having a surprise winner for the sake of having a surprise winner without applying any logic to that surprise winner. I’d rather have the expected winner win if it makes sense for the story. By: The Real Birdman 02.13.2017 @ 6:01 PM \nThe best thing about that match was I’m not sure it’d be a swerve no matter who won. Maybe Corbin, but he’s looked great lately & everyone else has been main event level since the split By: dl316bh 02.13.2017 @ 6:33 PM \n@The Real Birdman They’ve done a remarkable job with Corbin lately. If this keeps up, they may have good hand for the main event and eventual world champion on their hands. As it is, it looks like he’s headed for Intercontinental gold at Wrestlemania, or at the very least a program. By: Jester King 02.13.2017 @ 6:35 PM \nThere’s a lot of shades between a super obvious outcome and a swerve for the sake of a swerve. The EC match was well executed, but the winner has never been up for questioning. Would I have preferred a surprise out of nowhere, maybe neutralised two days later on SD? Hell no. But I would have enjoyed a bit more of uncertainty By: dl316bh 02.13.2017 @ 6:46 PM \n@Jester King The reason it was never up for questioning is because Meltzer got wind of what was coming and talked about it. The programming itself leading up to Elimination Chamber, taken in itself, didn’t really favor Wyatt more than anyone else, and in fact a lot of his stuff has concerned the split with Harper, Orton and Orton beefing with Harper. So we knew what to expect from an outside source and got that. If they desperately tried to course correct or convince us it wasn’t going that way, it would have been super obvious what they were pulling and we’d have noticed. Probably complained, too. \nI’m honestly just glad that for once, plans got leaked and they didn’t just change course at the last minute for a gotcha, like they’ve done several times in the past. For a while now they’ve needed to realize the dirt sheets are just an ubiquitous thing these days and they can’t spend all their time chasing their tail over it. Uncertainty is nice, but,I mean, it’s technically on us if we know ahead of time and don’t have that uncertainty. We read the sites.

Crews even wore his trunks that match Kalisto’s yellow gear and then Kalisto came out with green gear for one of the few times Crews wasn’t wearing green. It was basically Gift of the Magi. By: dl316bh 02.13.2017 @ 4:25 PM \nI don’t get crowds jumping behind Ziggler in general – I’m so over the guy by this point it’s disgusting, especially since his character, even as a hell, is as much of a loser as he was as a face – but sometimes it feels like WWE wants them too, despite insisting he’s a heel. The hell do you put a heel in a handicap match for? Who forgot the concept of the underdog, getting heat that way and how to utilize it? Smackdown is usually better than this. This is Raw level booking. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:57:27.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
