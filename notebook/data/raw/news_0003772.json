While Clinton didn’t say exactly what irked her, it’s not too difficult to discern. After opening the speech with the usual generic platitudes, Trump started complaining about the Inauguration Day tweet by Time Magazine’s Zeke Miller where Miller mistakenly thought a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the oval office: \nLast month we celebrated the life of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. whose Incredible example Is unique In American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. And It turned out that that was fake news. The statue Is cherished. It’s one of the favorite things – and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln, and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King. And we have other. But they said the statue, the bust, of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And It was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is. It’s very unfortunate. \nMiller quickly apologized when it turned out that the bust had been behind either a door that opened into the office or a Secret Service agent the whole time. While White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer immediately accepted the apology on Twitter, he and Trump have since used it as an example of “fake news” put out by the “opposition party” media. \nHere’s a full transcript of the speech, which you can also watch via the video (via MSNBC ) embedded at the top of this article: \nWell, the election, it came out really well. Next time we’ll triple the number or quadruple it. We want to get It over 51, right. At least 51. \nWell, this Is Black History Month, so this Is our little breakfast, our little get-together. And just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country. Throughout the world, if you really think about It, right. And their story Is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. I’ve gotten a real glimpse during the campaign; I’d go around with Ben to a lot of places that I wasn’t so familiar with. They’re incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, who’s going to be heading up HUD, and it’s a big job, and it’s a job that’s not only housing. It’s mind and spirit, right? And you understand that. Nobody’s going to be better than Ben. \nLast month we celebrated the life of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. whose Incredible example Is unique In American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. And It turned out that that was fake news. The statue Is cherished. It’s one of the favorite things – and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln, and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King. And we have other. But they said the statue, the bust, of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And It was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is. It’s very unfortunate. \nI am very proud now that we have a museum, National Mall, where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things, Frederick Doug – Douglass Is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more, I notice. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made Americans what It Is today. Big Impact. I’m proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more. \nFolks at the table, in almost all cases, have been great friends and supporters. And Darrell, I met Darrel when he was defending me on television. And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn’t have a chance, right. And Paris has done an amazing job In a very hostile CNN community; he’s all by himself. Seven people and Paris. I’ll take Paris over the seven. But I don’t watch CNN, so I don’t get to see you as much. I don’t like watching fake news. But Fox has treated me very nice, wherever Fox is, thank you. We’re going to need better schools, and we need ’em soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages, a lot better wages. We’re going to work very hard on the inner city. Ben’s going to be doing that, big league, that’s one of his big things that we’re going to be looking at. We need safer communities and we’re going to do that with law enforcement. We’re going to make it safe. We’re going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now it’s terrible. \nI saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really – you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show. I’m ready to do my part, and I will say this, we’re going to work together. This is a great group, this is a group that’s been so special to me, you really helped me a lot. If you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African- American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting, Iwon’t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now we’re going to take that to new levels. I want to thank my television star over here – Omarosa’s actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that. I don’t want to destroy her reputation. She is a very good person and she’s been helpful right from the beginning with the campaign and I appreciate it, I really do. Very special. So I want to thank everybody for being here. \nHave a tip we should know?
