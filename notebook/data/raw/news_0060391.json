I only had â‚¬28 with me and the police accused me of trying to immigrate because things were going badly in my country.\"\n'Discrimination' \"They discriminated against me because of my dress, my face or appearance,\" said Mr Solano, who was deported a few days later.\nHis trainer said that the police laughed at him. \"They said skiing didn't exist in Venezuela,\" coach Cesar Baena said.\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez tweeted on Thursday that \"following instructions by @PresidentMaduro we will deliver a strong protest to the French government for the affront against the Venezuelan athlete\".\nThe tweet links to a report claiming French police mocked the Venezuelan athlete In a second tweet, Ms Rodriguez said that \"the insult against Venezuelans is absolutely unacceptable\" and blamed opposition groups for bringing Venezuelans into disrepute.\nThe country is deeply divided into those who support President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him and his socialist policies for the economic crisis the country is experiencing.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/49FD/production/_94814981_0cd61085-4e24-4e4e-a73c-343013e72b35.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0655/production/_94812610_delcy.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39063855/the-worlds-worst-skier-adrian-solano-had-only-ever-trained-on-wheels", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10965/production/_94814976_44bfca51-78f2-41bf-b014-d3b40e4b2946.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:26:21.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
