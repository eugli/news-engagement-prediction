Photo: Alan Putra \nMr Taylor admitted to \"searching his body\" but said Mr Sudarsa then pushed him to the ground and punched him. \nMs Connor said she wandered off looking for her missing bag after attempting to separate the two men and did not see Mr Taylor land any blows. \n\"I never knew the policeman was seriously hurt. I left â€¦ I never went back to the scene,\" she said last month. Ms Connor, who was originally from Italy, testified that Mr Taylor had told her Mr Sudarsa had \"passed out\" and she didn't realise the extent of his injuries. \"English is not my first language. That for me could mean just tired,\" she said. \nThe couple told the court they had tried to go to police station but an ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver refused to take them. Instead, they bought cigarettes and returned to their homestay in Kuta, Kubu Kauh Inn. \nThe couple showered and then Ms Connor cut up Mr Sudarsa's identity cards, which were in the wallet Mr Taylor had taken from the victim. \nMs Connor insisted this was to protect the Balinese police officer from identity theft. But prosecutors told the court this was irrational and she had done it to hide something. \nThe couple checked out of Kubu Kauh Inn at 7am on August 17 and travelled to Jimbaran. \nThey claimed they only learned the victim had died when Ms Connor was contacted by a friend on August 19, who said her name was all over the news after her identity cards had been found at the crime scene. \n\"After I received the phone call, we were both crying,\" Ms Connor said earlier this month. \"That's when I asked David: 'Did you hit him with something?' He told me yes. We were desperate.\" \nShe said Mr Taylor had suggested they burn the clothes they had been wearing that night. While Ms Connor initially just wanted to \"chuck them away\", she ultimately didn't complain because she was so sad a life had been lost. \nThe couple then went to the Australian consulate in Bali and were later apprehended by police. \nAsked outside court why the sentencing request for Ms Connor been the same as Mr Taylor's, a prosecutor told Fairfax Media it was because Ms Connor had denied any guilt, intended to destroy evidence by cutting up the cards and went to the Australian consulate instead of reporting directly to police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:44:47.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
