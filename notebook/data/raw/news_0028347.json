So, are we in for a repeat performance in 2017? Here are the main talking points ahead of the game...\nFORM\nBarcelona will go into the tie as favourites but both sides should be high on confidence. PSG have won 10 of their last 11 games, drawing the other, and warmed up for Barca with a 3-0 victory at Bordeaux. They are not running away with Ligue 1, as in previous years, but are just three points behind leaders Monaco and could win a fifth successive title. Barca trail Real Madrid in LaLiga but are unbeaten in 11 games and thrashed Alaves 6-0 at the weekend.\nLionel Messi celebrates after scoring against Alaves (Photo: AFP/Getty) FIXTURE HISTORY\nPGS's Qatar-funded rise in recent seasons has seen the two clubs become regular Champions League opponents. This is the third knockout-stage clash between them in five seasons after Barca prevailed in the quarter-finals of 2013 and 2015. They also met in the 2014-15 group stage, winning a game apiece. As PSG continue to push for a place among the European elite, it is a match-up growing in glamour and significance.\nRead More Lionel Messi leads his Barcelona team-mates off plane as they arrive in Paris Gerard Pique competes for the ball with Gregory Van der Wiel (Photo: Miguel Ruiz/Getty Images) YARDSTICK FOR PSG\nThe French champions have fallen at the quarter-final hurdle in each of the past four seasons. Barcelona present a formidable obstacle as they bid to reach the last eight again, but there is no doubt this is the sort of clash PSG want to establish firmly on their fixture list. After dominating their domestic league in recent years, it provides another measure of their progress.\nRead More 5 things to look out for as the Champions League returns Zlatan Ibrahimovic in action with Barcelona's Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba last season (Photo: Reuters) PRIORITY FOR BARCA\nLuis Enrique's men are still in contention in LaLiga but, with a one-point advantage and two games in hand, Real are in control of the title race. If the gap cannot be closed, Barca are increasingly likely to turn their attentions to the Champions League. They will hope to have all their big guns - Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar - firing for this tricky tie.\nNeymar scores against PSG last season (Photo: David Ramos) TEAM NEWS\nPSG have bolstered their side with the recent signing of Julian Draxler and his arrival seems to have forced Angel di Maria to up his game after a subdued start to the campaign. With striker Edinson Cavani also in fine form, taking his tally for the campaign to 33 at Bordeaux, Barca will have their work cut out at the Parc des Princes. Former Barca midfielder Thiago Motta is suspended, however. The visitors will be forced to make a change with in-form right-back Aleix Vidal facing a long lay-off, while Javier Mascherano is also out.\nAngel Di Maria looks set to start (Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos) FC Barcelona Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our FC Barcelona Paris Saint-Germain Champions League FC Barcelona", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3476/4221396001_5316891958001_5316885900001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2797/4221396001_5321414423001_5321407529001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/837/4221396001_5319875456001_5319852050001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1477/4221396001_5320545059001_5320539534001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3830/4221396001_5322588797001_5322558492001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2702/4221396001_5322541440001_5322525849001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2253/4221396001_5321341945001_5321330293001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/158/4221396001_5322552172001_5322530495001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2874/4221396001_5321537022001_5321519582001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-14T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:31:10.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
