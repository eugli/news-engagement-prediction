No matter how much he tries to let go off the feeling of being a captain, even at home he has taken the commanding position. \nA post shared by @mahi7781 on Feb 16, 2017 at 9:48pm PST \nIn this Instagram video, he can be seen making his dogs obey to him first before he bounces the ball and tries to trick his dogs. MSD fans will see him back in action in Indian Premier League on April 6 when he will lead Rising Pune Supergiants against Mumbai Indians. \nHowever, the fans will have to wait till June to see Dhoni back in Indian colours when India will take on their arch-rivals Pakistan in ICC Champions Trophy.
