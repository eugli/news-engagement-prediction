It also temporarily halts the U.S. refugee program. The future of the order was put into doubt late Friday with word a U.S. judge had temporarily blocked it until the states of Washington and Minnesota could mount a challenge.\nSurgeons in the U.S. approached colleagues at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and told them they had to cancel surgeries for children coming from those countries, Hoskins said.\nSick Kids then reached out to the Ontario government, which Hoskins said is working to facilitate any surgeries that can be performed here. He has also spoken to the federal government, which has indicated it is ready to help to potentially expedite visas for the children and their families, Hoskins said.\nThe Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario is also able to provide specialized pediatric care, he added.\n\"Given that this is a critical time for these ill children, our ministry and Ontario's specialized children's hospitals, which provide best-in-the-world care feel the responsibility to act quickly,\" Hoskins said.\nIt's not known yet how many children the support would cover, Hoskins said, but at this early stage Sick Kids has received \"several\" requests.\nOntario already has programs in place to provide health care on a humanitarian basis, Hoskins said.\n\"We do it from time to time in different ways, so we're confident we have the ability to provide Sick Kids with whatever support they would need,\" he said.\nRelated Stories U.S. State Dept. says fewer than 60,000 visas cancelled Tehran bans travel of U.S. wrestlers in response to Trump order Angelina Jolie takes on travel ban in New York Times op-ed Photos Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins speaks during a news conference after the first day of a meeting of provincial and territorial health ministers in Vancouver, B.C., on Jan. 20, 2016.
