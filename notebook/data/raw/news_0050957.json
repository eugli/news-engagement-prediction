That's pretty much a universal truth of '80s pop culture. SolaLook is following last year's killer Flashdanc e-inspired eyeshadow palette with more (and perhaps even better) '80s film-influenced makeup. The brand could veritably be one-upping itself. \nThe SolaLook Dirty Dancing eyeshadow palette looks like it will be everything, thanks to the teases the indie brand has been dropping on its Instagram. \nThe palette is launching soon — the exact date will be revealed shortly— in conjunction with the definitive movie's 30th anniversary. It will have you yearning for the '80s and wanting to do a movie and makeup night with your besties. I mean, what could be more fun than quoting Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey aka Johnny and Baby while playing with eyeshadows?! \nThe brand teased the packaging, along with a swatched shade. It's a hot pink called \"I Carried A Watermelon,\" which the fans will instantly recognize as a film reference, because duh! \nBustle reached out to SolaLook for more details. \nThat said, this is one palette I cannot wait for. I love that bubbling under brand has teamed up with a blockbuster, beloved film and has translated key elements into a palette. \nLet's peep the teases, shall we? It'll have you reaching for a can of hairspray. OK, not really. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:10:10.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
