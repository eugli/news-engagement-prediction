Under the nuclear deal with Iran, the United States and the other signatories – Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany – cannot reimpose nuclear-related sanctions, except if there is evidence Iran has resumed its nuclear program in violation of the accord. There has been no such evidence. But missile sanctions, and sanctions for sponsorship of terrorism, do not violate the agreement, which was limited to nuclear activities. Iran argues that a United Nations Security Council resolution, whose wording was negotiated in Vienna in 2015 at the same time the nuclear accord was reached, stops short of prohibiting missile tests. It simply urges Iran to refrain from such tests, if the missiles are designed to carry nuclear weapons . Iranian officials have argued that since the country has no nuclear weapons, it has no missiles designed to carry them. Outside experts note that whether a missile can carry a nuclear weapon depends on the design of a re-entry vehicle, which can be modified with relatively little work. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More A missile launch in recent days, at first no reported by the Iranians but later the source of boasts from its military, traveled about 600 miles, before the final stage exploded on re-entry. It is not yet clear what kind of ballistic missile was fired, or what kind of re-entry vehicle was atop it. But experts in the region have suggested the design may have been a version of North Korea’s medium-range Musadan missile, modified for Iranian needs. The two countries have long shared missile design technology, though usually for shorter-range missiles. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Many experts had questioned whether new sanctions would have significant practical effect, because the companies that supply missile parts rarely have direct business with the United States, and allies have usually been reluctant to reimpose sanctions after many were lifted as part of the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord. But Mr. Trump, who tweeted early Thursday morning that Iran was “ON NOTICE” and incorrectly said it had received $150 billion in the nuclear deal, has been eager to change the tone on dealing with Tehran. While the Obama administration often looked for reasons to avoid confrontation with Iran in its last year in office, Mr. Trump seems equally eager to challenge what he has said is an Iranian expansion across the region, especially in Iraq. The Iranians reacted sharply to a White House announcement Wednesday that also used the “on notice” language, but left little indication about what the administration was planning. In recent days, according to officials, there has been discussion of everything ranging from new economic pressure, which Mr. Trump’s aides understand has little impact, to more aggressive patrols in the Persian Gulf, including the possible interception of arms or parts. But no decisions have been made about more aggressive steps, officials say. \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:12:16.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
