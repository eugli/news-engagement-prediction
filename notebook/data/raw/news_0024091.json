Grabbed veil \nJudge Stephen Earl heard the victim was standing outside the Bridges shopping centre in July when Scotter grabbed her veil, almost throwing her to the ground. \nLaura Lax, prosecuting, said the attack had left the victim feeling as if she could not go out. \nTony Hawks, defending, said Scotter had recently been diagnosed with a cancerous tumour under his tongue and was due to undergo surgery. 'Stupid' Muslim \nDuring the abuse, Scotter was heard to swear at the woman and call her a \"stupid\" Muslim. \nHe continued to make derogatory comments when he was being interviewed after his arrest, Miss Lax said. \nScotter's previous convictions include actual bodily harm and racially aggravated criminal damage.
