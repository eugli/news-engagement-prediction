Just consider what Patriots owner Robert Kraft told Andrea Kremer in a “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” clip from an interview that will air Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET on HBO. \nWhen asked about Deflategate, Kraft had a message for the haters. \n“Envy and jealousy are incurable diseases,” Kraft told Kremer, via WEEI.com . “The haters still hate. And I understand it, and we’ll do our best to keep them in that position.” \nHe added: “I really don’t hold grudges. I mean, I remember everything, but I move on.” \nThe Patriots are just shaking it all off. \nThumbnail photo via Stew Milne/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:32:12.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
