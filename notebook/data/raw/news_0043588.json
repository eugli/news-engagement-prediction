It's low in calories but not low on flavor. I can honestly eat an entire pint and not feel bad about it, so when Halo Top shared this recipe for a birthday pie using the Birthday Cake flavor, I suddenly wished it was my birthday so I'd have an excuse to make it. I didn't let something like a silly calendar keep me from whipping this supereasy recipe together, though, and you shouldn't either. It only requires a few ingredients, and you can eat a slice without wanting to fall asleep, a feeling that a huge honkin' piece of chocolate cake might bring.
