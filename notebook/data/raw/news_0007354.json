A task made exponentially harder given the fact that he must deal with grandstanding Obama holdovers while trying desperately to ferret out the vipers in his own nest. \nYet on Thursday, the president has had to deal with a security breach caused by the leaking of private phone calls between himself and Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \nHow did we get here? \nFirst there was the pushing of the “Russian dossier” by some in the intelligence community. A document Washington Post investigative journalist Bob Woodward labeled “Garbage.” Next, there was acting Attorney General Sally Yates declaring that the Justice Department would not enforce President Trump’s executive order calling for the temporary \"suspension of issuance of visas and other immigration benefits to nationals of countries of particular concern,\" and the enhanced implementation of \"uniform screening standards for all immigration programs.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:20:30.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
