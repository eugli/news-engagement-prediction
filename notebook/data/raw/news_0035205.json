And, no, we’re not talking about the rumored return of the legendary Nokia 3310, which still defies all reason. We’re referring to the rumored Nokia 5 and Nokia 3, following the reportedly successful Nokia 6. Both smartphones, however, have rather low specs with very little differentiation between them. Which does seem on par with Nokia’s infamous naming strategy, or the lack thereof. \nThe Nokia 6 isn’t exactly high-end either. It is, actually a weird Frankenstein of specs. For example, it ran on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430, the chip maker’s lower mid-range class, but had 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. The 5.5-inch screen does only have a 1080p resolution, but the 16 megapixel main camera is rather formidable. \nIn contrast, the Nokia 5 and 3 fit more closely the image of budget-friendly phones. The Nokia 5, pictured above, has that same Snapdragon 430 processor as the Nokia 6 but with only 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage this time. The smaller 5.2-inch screen also has a lower 720p resolution. The back camera has a 13 megapixel sensor while the front gets 8 megapixels. \nNokia 5 • Display: 5.2in 720 x 1280 (720p) • Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 430", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:20:16.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
