Editor Advertisement \nThe authorities here cannot see any old, rustic places, they must have a hand in how to develop the area, right? They will point to Singapore being land scarce, thus any free available space is a space to be developed. \nThe next on their list of targets is the Sembawang Hot Spring. The land that the hot spring is on is actually located within a military camp, but the Defence Ministry has returned the land back to the authorities. Thus, the plans to develop the area into a park, which will also incorporate the hot springs. \nWhy can't they just leave the hot springs alone? Need to build a park around the area so that families can do what? Walk in the park? Have a picnic near the hot springs? Always want to intervene, and do something, even if not required to. If the area is really developed into another park, there is a high chance that the rustic feel of the place will be gone. When will the authorities realise that rustic feel is more than just retaining its physical appearance. It is a whole package, where the tranquility of the place must not be compromised. \nLau H L \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
