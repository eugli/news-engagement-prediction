[there are] more reports on paedophilia and homosexuality,\" Cruz said. \"It is a heinous crime, you know. And a priest at that? Violating a minor? Come on!\" \nREAD MORE: 'Shocking' scale of Catholic Church sex crimes revealed in Australia \nFor centuries, the Catholic church has wielded considerable influence in the Philippines, with more than 80 percent of a 100 million-strong population following the faith. \n\"If clerical abuse victims take on the most powerful institution in the Philippines, it is a David and Goliath battle,\" 101 East's Drew Ambrose, reporting from the capital Manila, said. \nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, \"Imelda\" said she was sexually assaulted by a priest three years ago, when she was 15.\nAfter she filed a police report, two members from her village church paid her US$150 to drop the case, she alleged.\n\"At first, I didn’t really want to accept the money because I already knew it was from a priest, but they were so insistent that I take the money,\" she said. \nJaime Achacoso, a lawyer and expert on the Catholic Church's Canon law, said priests found guilty of sexual misconduct had not been removed from ministry.\nAbout 80 percent of the 100 million Filipinos are Catholics [Reuters File Photo] \"Oh yes, they weren’t.

They are afraid they will be cursed or 'God' will curse them if they go against these people.\"\nObservers say that is just one reason why the full scale of abuse by Filipino priests may never be known.\nThe Vatican and the Archbishops of Manila and Cebu refused to comment on the investigation.\nAmong the most high profile accusations of abuse was one from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has repeatedly said the church hierarchy are \"hypocrites\" .\nDuterte said that, during his teenage years, he and other male classmates were molested by an American priest while attending a Jesuit school in his hometown of Davao.\n\"This religion is not so sacred,\" he was quoted as saying.\nHe also said he was too young and frightened to file a complaint against the priest, who was later linked to similar abuse after he returned to the United States.\nYou can watch the full 101 East film, Philippines: Sins of the Father, on Al Jazeera English at 22:30GMT on February 16th.
