I was so excited for this movie, and it did not disappoint. I was crying the whole time from something sad happening, to something good happening, to something funny. It really tugs at all of your emotions. The story is so amazing and while it's similar to past Disney stories in the sense that she goes on a journey to discover who she is, that's where the similarities end. The characters are so complex that really anyone can relate. It's refreshing. I was not expecting the ending AT ALL. It was absolutely beautiful. Plus the songs are super catchy - Lin Manuel Miranda is a true gift to this earth. Moana by Amazing and touching!!! This Disney movie is probably my new favorite! I loved everything about it from the characters to the plot! Such an beautiful story line and as soon as the movie was over I wanted to watch all over again! Definitely recommended this for all ages! A+ Movie!! by PrettyLittleSydney This movie is amazing!! I am a huge Disney fan! This movie is a must watch!
