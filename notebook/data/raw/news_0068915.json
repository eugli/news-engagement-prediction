Speaking last week following the discovery, Pat said: 'We have been told that a skeleton has been found - we don't know what to make of it. Workmen found a skeleton at the bottom of the well last Thursday and police were called The remains were removed from the site and taken to a nearby hospital for tests. Pictured is the outhouse where the well is located 'It was a shock to receive the call after all this time, it's upset all the family.' The remains were taken to the forensic department of Heraklion University Hospital where a DNA test was carried out. After the discovery, islanders said they believed it may have been Steven because there are very few unsolved missing persons in Crete. One local said: 'The owner of the well brought in a company to clean the well and empty whatever was at the bottom of it. 'They found a complete human skeleton, a small camera and a leather belt. The police and coroner were both called to the scene.' Steven was last seen in a bar asking for directions to his hotel, but walked off in the wrong direction. He had been on his first trip abroad In 2015, the family launched a fresh plea for information to mark the tenth anniversary of his disappearance. Cheshire Police issued an image of how Steven might look aged 30 STEVEN COOK: HOW THE BRITON WENT MISSING IN MALIA IN 2005 Steven Cook went missing in Malia, Crete in 2005 during a night out with friends. The then 20-year-old was on his first holiday away from parents. Several sightings of a man of Steven's description by holidaymakers on Crete and nearby island Rhodes in the months after his disappearance convinced his family that he was still alive. It was thought a blow to the head may have made it difficult for Steven to communicate his whereabouts. Despite appeals on UK and Greek TV Steven has never been found. In 2015 the family launched a fresh plea for information to mark the tenth anniversary of his disappearance. At the time Cheshire police issued an image of how Steven might look in 2015 - aged 30. Workmen discovered a skeleton down a well earlier this month Detective Inspector Gary McIntyre, from Cheshire Police, said: 'On Thursday February 16, Cheshire Constabulary was made aware of the discovery of human remains in a well in Malia, Crete. 'Since then, officers have been in close liaison with the Greek authorities and have been awaiting further information. 'Tests have been carried out and we have now received confirmation from the Greek authorities that the remains belong to Steven Cook, who went missing on September 1 2005 during a holiday to the island.' He continued: 'Steven's family have been kept fully updated on the developments and are currently being supported by Cheshire officers. 'This is understandably an extremely upsetting and distressing time for the Cook family. 'Steven's relatives are very appreciative of all the support the media and the public have given them over the years in their quest to find him but they have asked for their privacy to be respected at this time as they are trying to come to terms with the news.'
