We're going to start making good deals,\" he said. \n\"WE'RE VERY ANGRY\" \nThe United States is in the midst of a US$1 trillion, 30-year modernization of its ageing ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, a price tag that most experts say the country cannot afford. \nTrump also complained that the Russian deployment of a ground-based cruise missile is in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans land-based American and Russian intermediate-range missiles. \n\"To me it's a big deal,\" Trump said. \nAsked if he would raise the issue with Putin, Trump said he would do so \"if and when we meet.\" He said he had no meetings scheduled as of yet with Putin. \nSpeaking from behind his desk in the Oval Office, Trump expressed concern about North Korea's ballistic missile tests and said accelerating a missile defence system for U.S. allies Japan and South Korea was among many options available. \n\"There's talks of a lot more than that,\" Trump said, when asked about the missile defence system. \"We'll see what happens. But it's a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion.\" \nChina has made clear that it opposes North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and has repeatedly called for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and a return to negotiations between Pyongyang and world powers. \nBut efforts to change Pyongyang's behaviour through sanctions have historically failed, largely because of China's fear that severe measures could trigger a collapse of the North Korean state and send refugees streaming across their border. \nTrump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month in Florida was interrupted by a ballistic missile launch by North Korea. \nTrump did not completely rule out possibly meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late. \n\"It's very late. We're very angry at what he's done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration,\" he said. \nAccording to Japanese news reports, the Japanese government plans to start debate over the deployment of a U.S. missile defence system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, and the land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence system to improve its capability to counter North Korean ballistic missiles. \nThe strength of Trump’s remarks in favour of the EU took some Brussels officials by surprise after his support for Britain's vote last summer to exit from the EU. \n\"I'm totally in favour of it,\" Trump said. \"I think it's wonderful. If they're happy, I'm in favour of it.\" \nStatements by him and others in his administration have suggested to Europeans that he sees little value in the Union as such, which Trump last month called a “vehicle for Germany.\" \n(Corrects number of Russian, U.S. warheads in paragraph 8, adds full name of Korean leader in paragraph 26.) \n(Additional reporting by Jeff Mason, Roberta Rampton, Emily Stephenson, John Walcott, Matt Spetalnick, Arshad Mohammed and David Brunnstrom in Washington and Alastair Macdonald in Brussels; editing by Ross Colvin) - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:43:08.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
