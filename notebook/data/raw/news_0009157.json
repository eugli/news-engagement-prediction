Yep, as a good wife it’s only proper to seek permission for such rendezvous... \nALSO READ: I’m close to getting my dream man and I want my uncles to keep off \nI arrived at Steph’s house on that Friday evening by around eight. Steph and I frequently have such nights out to catch up and bond as former campus friends. So the sumptuous dinner was served at 8.15pm, the two children were tucked in bed by 9pm. We bonded downstairs until late in the night then I was shown the guest room upstairs in the vast house. \nIn the middle of the night I woke up for a bathroom break and on my way back, I accidentally entered a wrong room. Guess who was in that room? Saitain! Steph’s mzee! I ducked out like a mad woman and ran to the sitting room down stairs. That is where I slept. So in the morning, I asked Steph what the hell is going on with her marriage that they are sleeping in separate rooms. “Are they fighting?” \n“Not really, Jack is a horrible snorer.

Or that one who sleeps like they are fighting with demons. Nocturnal reading habits: I am as guilty as charge. While my hubby is asleep, I am always reading stuff online way past midnight and it’s always a nagging distraction. \nResearch from Ryerson University in Canada has proven that sleeping in separate rooms can invigorate a couple’s sex life because it breaks the monotony of having sex in one room and brings in the mystery and spontaneity of doing it anywhere. \nALSO READ: Husbands absconding marital beds:How to deal with 'vagina's size' after child birth \nSo next time you bust your couple friends sleeping in separate rooms, do not assume they are having marital trouble.
