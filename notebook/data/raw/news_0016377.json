When his legal team asked to see the profiles he claims the Crown Prosecution Service said they \"never existed\". \nThe reporter, who is a former policeman himself, also says there is a list of 100 potential suspects that was never properly \"followed up\" because Barry George was on trial for the murder. \nSpeaking to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on Tuesday, Williams-Thomas said the Met Police had thanked him for his report and said it would \"take on board the new information and act on it\". ITV Mr George was convicted and jailed in 2001 but acquitted eight years later ITV 14 The forensic evidence used to prosecute him was later discredited \nA spokesman told The Sun Online: \"The MPS would welcome any new information or evidence that relates to the murder of Jill Dando, which remains unsolved. \"This may provide an opportunity to find answers for Ms Dando's family and friends and the MPS remains committed to solving this case. \"Since Ms Dando's murder a number of theories have been aired publicly.
