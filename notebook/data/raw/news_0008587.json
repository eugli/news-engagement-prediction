DM me as I have a car load and am willing to offer 'reasonable' prices. #lettucecrisis \n— Parveen Agnihotri (@Parveen_Comms) February 3, 2017 A nother woman took to Twitter claiming she had a car boot full of lettuces and was willing to offer \"reasonable prices\".\nAnd it appears lettuces are - quite literally - the tip of the iceberg as other affected vegetables are also selling for ludicrous prices.\nBroccoli is seen for sale at a vegetable market in London for £5 per kg Credit: PETER NICHOLLS B rocolli, which is experiencing a shortage was found being sold for £5 per kg at a London Market. \nCourgettes, popular among health-conscious consumers who have caught onto the UK's \"spiralizing\" craze, were also found selling for an extortionate £6 per kg.\nCourgettes are seen for sale at a vegetable market in London for £6 per kg Credit: PETER NICHOLLS A ccording to the British Leafy Salad Association most market traders are now selling iceberg lettuces for three times their usual price. This is because they are buying wholesale trays for £15 instead of £5.\nPrime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was keeping a watch on what was happening.\nHe said: \"Clearly, there is a situation with bad weather on the continent affecting some vegetable crops. \"Clearly, supermarkets are working hard to rectify any supply chain problems.\n\"They are confident that will be resolved swiftly, but the relevant department, Defra, is monitoring the situation,\" he told a regular Westminster briefing.\nAsked how Brexit would impact on such situations, he said: \"The rural industry of the United Kingdom will be an area that will come back under our control once we have left the European Union.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:37:44.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
