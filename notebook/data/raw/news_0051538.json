Daily Edition Richard Schickel, Time Magazine Film Critic, Dies at 84 6:39 PM PST 2/19/2017 by Abid Rahman Kevin Winter/Getty Schickel also wrote 37 books and was involved with 30 documentaries related to the film industry. \nRichard Schickel, Time magazine's long-time film critic and a noted chronicler of the movie business, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 84. \nSchickel's family told the Los Angeles Times that he died after complications from a series of strokes. “He was one of the fathers of American film criticism,” said Schickel's daughter Erika. “He had a singular voice. When he wrote or spoke, he had an old-fashioned way of turning a phrase. He was blunt and succinct both on the page and in life.” \nBorn in Milwaukee in 1933, Schickel began his career in film criticism in the 1960s, first working for Life magazine and then moving over to sister publication Time in 1965. Schickel wrote at a time when film criticism began to take on an intellectual and philosophical dimension that pushed back against established critics and their excessive moralizing and identifying with the prevailing social changes in America found in the New Hollywood movement. His film ciritc contemporaries included The New Yorker 's Pauline Kael and The Village Voice 's Andrew Sarris. \nSchickel retired from Time in 2010, but continued to write film reviews for the online film blog Truthdig . A prolific author, Schickel wrote 37 books related to film, film theory and film history. Among his noted books were biographies on Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, D.W. Griffith and Elia Kazan. \nAway from writing, Schickel was an equally prolific documentary maker having been involved in 30 productions either as a writer or director. Schickel's documentaries, most of which were made-for-TV, ranged from popular fare such as The Making of Star Wars (1977) and From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga (1983) to several Emmy-nominated docs including The Men Who Made the Movies (1973), Life Goes to the Movies (1976), Minelli on Minelli (1987), Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey (1994) and Shooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000). Most recently Schickel worked on You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story (2008), a three-part series for PBS. \nSchickel is survived by his daughter Erika and Jessica, step-daughter Ali Rubinstein and his grandchildren.
