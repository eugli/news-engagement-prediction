The two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, reunited to record music together this weekend, and Starr shared photographic evidence on Twitter. \nStarr is currently creating the follow-up to 2015's \"Postcards From Paradise,\" Rolling Stone reports . The magazine notes that Starr and McCartney last collaborated on Starr's 2010 LP \"Y Not.\" \nThe remaining Beatles are enough musical star power for almost anyone, but Starr turned it up to 11 by also tweeting out a photo of Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh joining the pair. (Walsh and Starr are brothers-in-law, married to sisters Marjorie and Barbara Bach.) He gets by, with a little help from his friends. \nTo no one's surprise, fans loved the mini magical mystery tour.
