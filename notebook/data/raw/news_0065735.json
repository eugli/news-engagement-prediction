When Helen Bailey’s husband of 22 years drowned on holiday in Barbados in 2011, her world crumbled. Then Ian Stewart, 58, a “gorgeous, grey-haired widower” on an online bereavement group. \nHe had lost his wife and quickly they bonded over what they had both been through. Within a year, Stewart had proposed. The couple moved to Royston, Hertfordshire, and set up home in a seven-bedroom mansion. Bailey even changed her will so her fiance would inherit almost all of her £4m fortune if she died before they married. She was worried he’d be left vulnerable if their paperwork wasn’t in order. \nBut their cosy domesticity was short-lived. In July last year, the 51-year-old was discovered in a Victorian cesspit underneath the house, alongside the remains of her faithful daschund, Boris. Her body was so badly decomposed, she had be identified by her dental records. A lot of middle-aged women find themselves incredibly lonely and this emotional vulnerability can cause them to make bad choices Emma Kenny \nO n Wednesday, Stewart was sentenced to 34 years in jail for Bailey’s murder . The jury heard how he had been secretly drugging his partner with zopiclone, a sleeping medication, for weeks before suffocating her. Later that day, he watched his eldest son, Jamie, play bowls, taking him back home for a post-match Chinese takeaway. Afterwards, he changed a standing order from Bailey’s bank account to the couple’s joint account, switching the amount from £600 to £4,000. \nIn the months that followed (Stewart told concerned relatives Bailey had left a note saying she “needed some space”) he renewed Arsenal season tickets and even flew to Spain for a holiday he had booked with his wife-to-be. \nThe grim final chapter in the life of a woman described by family as “immensely witty and talented” has once again exposed the seedy underbelly of the digital world. This time, however, it’s not the online exploitation of children that’s raising alarm bells – research suggests older women are, in fact, the internet’s most vulnerable.

A lot of middle-aged women find themselves incredibly lonely and this emotional vulnerability can cause them to make bad choices. Quite often, a woman will go for someone who validates her, and she might reveal a lot of personal information early on, which enables predators.” \nThe number of people defrauded by online dating schemes has reached a record high, according to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau – last year, almost 4,000 victims of “romance fraud” handed over a staggering £39m. Forget the well-worn trope of the wealthy widow, conned overseas by an unscrupulous lothario you could see coming a mile off – the danger now has moved closer to home, and can be much harder to spot. You can’t assume that because someone has been through the same thing as you, they’re somehow 'safe' \nN ancy*, a 37-year-old single mother was duped out of £300,000 by Marcello, a man she met on match.com . Within days, the attractive Italian, who claimed to be Manchester-based but working in Turkey, persuaded Nancy to move their conversations to an instant messaging service. After six weeks, he asked for a loan for his son, who needed surgery. \n“It escalated unbelievably quickly, so straight away it was the medical fees, then money for food, rent and taxes to get them out of Turkey,” she told the BBC. She’s now facing bankruptcy. “I wasn’t comfortable, and then I got in so far I couldn’t get myself out. You keep going in the hope this person is genuine.” \nIt’s not just the betrayal of trust women like Nancy have to endure – a number of female victims of so-called “love scams” claim to have been excoriated for their perceived naivety. Like Bailey, the casualties are often smart, successful women who under other circumstances would know better.

Those who have suffered an emotional trauma, such as divorce or bereavement, are particularly susceptible to grooming, says Kenny. “My friend is widowed, so I checked out a couple of support forums for her. You could tell that not everyone on there had lost a spouse. It’s awful to say, but trust no one.” \n“It’s truly astonishing how much time and effort fraudsters will invest in building a relationship with someone,” says Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online . It’s awful to say, but trust no one \n“Starting a new relationship at a difficult time in your life can prevent you from noticing the signs of something more sinister. It is this vulnerability that they prey on, which makes it ever important to talk to your friends and family about your experiences online. They might spot something suspicious you don’t. Even if you feel you have become close to someone on the internet, you must remember that they are still a stranger.” \nI t is also sensible to look check your privacy settings on all of your social media accounts to ensure that people can’t easily fish for details about your private life which they can exploit in ways further down the line. \nOf course, for the majority, support forums provide a tremendous source of comfort during the worst of times. It was through a Widowed and Young (WAY) Facebook group that Annie*, 42, met her partner, Andrew*. They’ve been together for three and half years. \n“You can’t assume that because someone has been through the same thing as you, they’re somehow 'safe’, but I did feel like I got the measure Andrew pretty quickly. People have made a lot out of the fact that [Bailey and Stewart] met on a widow’s group but I think that’s irrelevant. Sadly, you can meet bad people anywhere. I don’t think there was anyway she could have known.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:12:39.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
