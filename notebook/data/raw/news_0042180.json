Known for his proximity to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, he was initially detested by the 43-year-old Chief Minister but their relationship seems to have turned a new leaf of late. \nHe was sacked by the Akhilesh Yadav last year from his cabinet only to reinstate him within days. The BJP has also demanded that the rape victim be provided adequate security by the police.
