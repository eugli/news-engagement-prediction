Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHorrific pictures have emerged showing a Russian poacher's \"trophy\" kills after he slaughtered a half a dozen endangered Siberian tiger s and 46 bears. \nOne photo shows Evgeniy Romanov, 52, proudly holding one of the slain big cats, of which currently there are less than 600 living in the wild. \nThe 'influential businessman' was hit with a record fine of Â£123,000 after he was found guilty of killing six rare tigers, but avoided jail. \nA case was brought against him after investigators found animal skins, body parts, dead sea eagles and other remains at one of his properties.

Romanov was found by a court to have slaughtered the tigers (Photo: Will Stewart) \nDuring a five year legal battle, the wealthy businessman escaped a criminal conviction after the time expired for the police investigation, but he was hit by the 9.3 million rouble fine. \nSince his poaching exploits, Russian laws have been tightened and the populations of Siberian tigers and even more endangered Amur leopards - of which there are only 80 or so in the wild - are now rising. \n\"There are genuine hopes both species will survive in their native habitat, after coming perilously close to extinction in the wild caused substantially by illegal hunting,\" reported The Siberian Times . Authorities found body parts from several animals (Photo: Will Stewart) Read More Hippo dies after being hit by ambulance while it was crossing a road \nOlga Zherebkina, senior legal expert at WWF Russia, said this was \"the largest fine\" levied on poachers in the endangererd tigers' natural habitat. \nShe said: \"In this sense, the decision makes history for environment legislation. But the scale of the crime is massive. \n\"Nature lost six tigers and many other wild animals.\" \nSergey Aramiliyev, director of the Far Eastern branch of the Amur Tiger centre, called for further tightening of Russian laws to counter poaching.
