What’s going to happen to Coachella? \nPeople. Beyoncé is about to bring TWO new Beyoncés into your life, and all you can think about is your Coachella tickets? Giphy \nEarlier this month, Coachella announced its 2017 lineup . Beyoncé was listed as a headliner. \nI have never once bought Coachella tickets, but let me tell you, when I heard Bey was going to be there, I damn well considered it. \nSo I feel for these people. I really do. The other headliners are Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar. (They’re both cool but… c’mon. No one buys Coachella passes for JUST Radiohead.) \nShe hasn’t officially canceled or anything, but it does seem like a possibility. \nCoachella isn’t for another three months, she already looks at least four months pregnant now and it’s with TWINS. On top of that, TMZ reports top organizers at the music festival were just as surprised by the news as the rest of us. So yes, some people are worried. Twitter Others are keeping the faith that she’ll be there.

Twitter Of course, there is still ONE way fans could get their money’s worth. Twitter Some think Beyoncé timed the pregnancy this way on purpose, for one good reason… Twitter …or another. Twitter And in the end, she’s still Beyoncé. She’s not about to bend her life around your Coachella plans. Twitter \nSorry boos! If she does cancel, you’ll just have to enjoy your $200 ticket to a Radiohead concert. \nMeanwhile, the Queen Bey will slay on, bringing two babies into the world at once, like a boss. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
