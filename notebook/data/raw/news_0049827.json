They’re meticulous. The decisions they make in the mines are life and death decisions. So they take that sort of thought process into their code, and they’re so good.” \nLaucher says learning to write computer code is a guaranteed ticket to a job. \nDelano: “Do most of your graduates find a job?” \nLaucher: “Every single one of them, yes.” \nDelano: “Every single one of your graduates?” \nLaucher: “They all find a job.” \nTo most of us the code on the screen looks like gibberish. \nDelano: “Did you know any of this stuff before this class?” \nMcNett: “None of it. Absolutely zero.” \nBut knowing computer code can mean big bucks. \nLaucher: “With the skills we give them in our class — $200, $250 an hour out in California or Chicago.” \nDelano: “Wait a minute, $200, $250 an hour?” \nLaucher: “Exactly.” \nA far cry from the coal mines. \nIt’s a 16-week intensive training course and open to everyone, not just coal miners. \nAnd Mined Minds branching out of Waynesburg with classes in East Liberty. \nIn most cases, the cost is picked up by government retraining grants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:10:17.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
