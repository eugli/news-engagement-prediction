Can echo what @WindhorstESPN just said on @SportsCenter : More than a few rival teams out there think Boston has a shot at Paul George today. \n— Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 23, 2017 \nBoston is believed to be in talks with Indiana involving the All-Star forward and reportedly has discussed trading the rights to its 2017 Brooklyn Nets first-round pick. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports’“The Vertical” reported Thursday afternoon that no deal is imminent, but talks very much are alive. Sources: Less than two hours until the NBA Trade Deadline, but no significant traction for Boston on Jimmy Butler or Paul George deals. Yet. \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 \nMeanwhile, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst reports the Pacers are involved in other trade talks, possibility to make room for players who could come their way in a blockbuster involving George. Pacers involved in talks with teams potentially to clear roster spots, sources say. Teams suspect might be related to Celtics talks \n— Brian Windhorst (@WindhorstESPN) February 23, 2017 \nThese developments are quite the departure from 24 hours ago, when reports surfaced that Indiana didn’t want to trade George at all. We’ll find out at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday which side they’re really on. \nThumbnail photo via Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
