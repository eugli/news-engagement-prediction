PAUL MCCREDIE \nThe Monahans’ Upton Oaks Garden holds the coveted New Zealand Gardens Trust Garden of National Significance rating. \nGuests can peacefully enjoy the beautiful setting after everyone else has gone home. \nWhat is the history behind the cottage? When I designed our garden in 2008, I always envisaged something in the empty space in the corner. The cottage was situated in an industrial area and it was likely it would be demolished when it was sold, so we approached the developer and bought it for removal. \nHow did the relocation go? It came all the way from town on the back of a truck and was craned over the hedge. It creaked for the whole trip and there were a few moments when we were worried it wouldn't hold together. Sometimes relocated homes can look out of place, but we think it fits into the garden perfectly. PAUL MCCREDIE \nSue and Dave Monahan. \nHow did you make it feel homely? We renovated it to the same standard as our own home and I had fun pulling together all the extra bits to bring the look together and make it cosy and homely – for example, the collection of old green glassware and lots of comfy cushions and throws. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:26:24.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
