We suggest Chinese investors establish an industrial zone here, for which we will provide land and other facilities. This will also help other investors,\" Paudyal said. \n\nIn addition, Nepal has an insufficient supply of power, but this is also a potential area for investment by Chinese companies, he said. \n\nChinese investors may need professional interpreters to overcome language barriers, but the problem may be alleviated in the coming years, as the country has sent many students to China to learn Chinese, including 200 in Beijing, Paudyal said. \n\nThe ambassador also suggested foreign investors find a reliable local business partner in Nepal to help them understand the laws and culture of the country.
