Useful on site taxi for getting around. Andrew, New Zealand Nice big room... we were in the superior double but the standard double looked pretty spacey too. The room was nicely furnished, clean, and so much storage space! The bathroom was big and clean. Staff were friendly and the wifi worked really well. Location is a little away from the touristy part but if you want to go there it's easily reachable on foot. It is close to the night market and a 7/11 though.
