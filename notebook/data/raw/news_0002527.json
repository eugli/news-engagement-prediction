Kyle Long (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:42 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:42 p.m. ET \nBy the sounds of it, Kyle Long had a pretty rough time with ankle surgery in December, but his second procedure of the offseason should go much smoother, according to dad Howie Long. \nThe Bears guard \"vomited 30 times\" on the night of his ankle surgery in Charlotte, N.C., according to his father. \nMORE: Tom Brady's parents attending Super Bowl after 'challenging year' \n\"Right now, he's really good,\" Howie Long told the Chicago Tribune . \"First two, three weeks was rough. I think he threw up 30 times that first night down in Charlotte at the hospital. Poor kid couldn't even hold a pill down. Like with any player, you kind of have to have this feel of invincibility and when that invincibility is cracked for the first time, it's kind of a shock. How you respond means everything.\" \nKyle Long underwent a particularly brutal surgery on his ankle, made necessary after he tore multiple ligaments during the Bears' loss to the Buccaneers on Nov. 13. \n\"My recent conversations with him, Facetime is the big thing now, which is nice,\" Howie Long said. \"I not only hear him but as you know with Kyle, you can kind of read his emotions by his facial expressions. He's really good right now. I think the shoulder thing will be far less significant.\" \nKyle Long will also need to have surgery on his left shoulder for a torn labrum, which he has been battling the entire season. \nHopefully, his reaction to the medicine for this surgery will be far better.
