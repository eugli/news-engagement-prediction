After falling flat in 2015 and finishing bottom of the Western Conference, the club nearly pulled off a worst-to-first turnaround, coming up just short of topping the conference in 2016. \nThe turnaround was something of a stunner, but it all started with a defense that gave up less than a goal per game. An attack that came up with timely scoring saw the team finish with 58 points in the regular season and the second seed heading into the playoffs. \nRapids looking for balance in 2017 \nA run to the conference final followed, with the Rapids bouncing the LA Galaxy before falling to the Seattle Sounders one step shy of the MLS Cup final. \nMost of the Colorado core is returning for 2016, with the notable exception of Manchester City product Bismark Adjei-Boateng coming in to help replace veteran Jermaine Jones in central midfield. How did the Colorado Rapids perform in 2016? \n2016 finish: Second in Western Conference (15-6-13), lost in the conference final \nThe Rapids made one of the best season-on-season turnarounds in league history, climbing from the bottom of the Western Conference in 2015 to second in 2016. Colorado Rapids' key losses during the offseason \nThe big loss was midfielder Jermaine Jones . Though the U.S. World Cup veteran missed most of last season, he was a driving force when in the mix. \nThe club also lost Sebastien Le Toux , who signed with D.C. United as a free agent after being traded to the Rapids in the summer, and declined the option for midfielder Marco Pappa . Colorado Rapids' key additions during the offseason \nBismark Adjei-Boateng may be the most exciting signing for the club in the offseason. The 22-year-old was signed from Manchester City but spent the last four seasons on loan at Stromsgodset IF. \nVeteran striker Alan Gordon was also brought in to bolster the options up front. How will the Rapids starting lineup look in 2017? \nThere are plenty of options in this Colorado team, so this is something of a moving target. Goalkeeper Tim Howard is still questionable to return by opening day, which would mean a start for Zac MacMath. \nShkelzen Gashi figures to again man the left flank, presenting the best way to get him, Gordon and Kevin Doyle on the field together, though Dominique Badji may lay claim to that starting spot up top. \nAt the back, Jared Watts and Bobby Burling have claims to the starting spot alongside Axel Sjoberg in central defense. For now, we pick the combo of Watts and Sjoberg to start the season.
