(John Peterson/AP) \nIt's become an American tradition to parse billionaire Warren Buffett's annual letters to his shareholders for nuggets of plain-spoken insight, wit and sometimes a dash of politics. \nIn this year's letter, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman brought up a familiar subject under Donald Trump's presidency: immigrants. \n“Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers,” Buffett wrote — ostensibly as reason to be optimistic about the company's future earnings. \n[ Warren Buffett, cheerleader for the American economy ] \nThe billionaire's praise of immigrants contrasts actions by the new presidency. Trump's travel ban and large-scale raids of undocumented immigrants have left some chief executives ' deeply concerned ,' while the technology industry has joined in opposition . \nBuffett vocally supported Hillary Clinton during the general election, offered to release his tax returns if Trump did the same and compared Trump's business skills to that of a monkey's. \nAfter the election, he told CNN that Trump “deserves everybody's respect .” \n\nBuffett also glanced off a couple other Trump talking points in his letter — offering a much more optimistic take than the president. \nWhere Trump has railed about foreigners subsuming American debt and assets — “they suck the blood right out of out country” he once said of China — Buffett was sanguine. \n“Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Those holdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet,” he wrote. \nAnd those worried about the course of the next four years might glean some hidden hope in this passage: \n“Yes, the build-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not, however, be stopped.” \n“Babies born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,” Buffett wrote. \nThen he turned the remainder of his 27-page letter to stockholder profits, share repurchases and GEICO: in Buffett's view, part of the same glowing American tapestry as immigrants and newborns. business", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:24:09.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
