Photo: Andres Kudacki/New York Magazine Photographer Andres Kudacki captured Hillary Clinton behind the scenes yesterday at Grand Central Terminal, where she and Chelsea Clinton joined Anderson Cooper, Ralph Lauren , Diane von Furstenberg , and more admirers to pay tribute to Oscar de la Renta .

Later, he went uptown to the Park Avenue Armory for Marc Jacobs’s show — a colorful end to New York Fashion Week .
