And yet, out of all of those films that could have so easily been pushed onto the eager masses, none of those films were showcased for a moment of last night's collective ad space. This is extremely strange, considering how brazen DC and Warner Bros were with selling their DC Cinematic Universe around this same point last year. \nIt's hard to think that Warner Bros and DC aren't at the very least marginally worried, and at the most in full blown panic mode, as history has shown us that the studio wasn't always shy about showing us what they had cooking in the past. By this point in 2016, we had a full prime time special that pimped not only Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice , but also a new trailer for the then-forthcoming Suicide Squad , and the rest of the developing DC canon being groomed for film. What a difference a year makes. \nIt's not that we don't want to like Warner Bros' DC Universe films, or that we want them to fail. Quite the contrary: we're among the fans that want Marvel and DC to compete with increasingly better films, giving us all of the fan-worthy moments we loved on the page in full color life on the screen. But the way that the studio is handling their properties, from the production right down to last night's Super Bowl snub, has us upset about the prospects for even the greatest sounding prospects in the studio's comic canon. \nA lack of new footage this late in the game, considering all of the stuff DC saw fit to give us last year, is not only a missed opportunity, it's a vote of no confidence in their own work. Let's hope we're wrong, and that Warner Bros. has some DC Comics magic up their sleeves. We'll find out when Wonder Woman hits theaters on June 2nd, or when Justice League arrives on November 10th. At the very least, we have The LEGO Batman to look forward to, which debuts this Thursday in early screenings.
