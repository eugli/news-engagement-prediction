There are a few reasons to suspect that what we’re looking at here is one of the two models of the upcoming Xiaomi Mi 6 flagship, despite the fact it shares little similarities with a recent render that was allegedly showing one variant of the upcoming device. For starters, the source of these latest images outright states that this could be the Xiaomi Mi 6. There is also mention of an ultra high-res screen which could refer to the QHD resolution that’s popular with modern flagship devices or could even indicate a jump to 4K. The device’s size and profile also fit the typical range between 5 and 5.2 inches that most flagship Xiaomi phones stick to for their screen sizes. It remains to be seen whether these newly leaked pictures turn out to be legitimate. \nThe device in question appears to be running the latest version of Xiaomi’s custom software, MIUI 8. This is somewhat corroborated by one image in which the device is displaying what appears to be a downloaded zip file containing a ROM or a system image of MIUI 8, with the label “miui8_kingdom_row_161204” attached to it. The stark and sharp rectangular frame is not entirely unique in Xiaomi’s lineup, but the only device it shares such a trope with is the Mi MIX which has almost no bezels. All of Xiaomi’s other devices that could be called similar either sport much thicker bezels, more rounded corners, or curved side edges, which this device appears to be lacking. \nA closer look at the images shows why the source believes this could be the Xiaomi Mi 6. The fact that the design is similar to the ceramic-bodied Mi Mix might not be a coincidence since one version of the Mi 6 is supposedly made of ceramic and will be sporting a QHD display. To recap, the Mi 6’s rumored specs thus far include a Full HD display on one version and an Ultra HD screen on another, while both will sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM.
