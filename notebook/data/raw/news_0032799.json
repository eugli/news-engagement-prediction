There was the Chris Lofton game in 2006 and Brandon Wharton's shot in 1999. Reggie Johnson made his mark in 1979, the same way Bernard King and Ernie Grunfled did in 1977. \nThat history, though, doesn't scare Rick Barnes or his young group of Vols (14-11, 6-6 SEC) that venture to Lexington, Ky., on Tuesday (TV: ESPN, 7 p.m.) to face No. 13 Kentucky (20-5, 10-2). \"I think that, as a group, they are confident wherever they play,\" Barnes said on Monday, \"that if we compete and do what we need to do, we’ll have a chance. \"I don’t think there’s any question, whether it would be Kentucky or South Carolina or Florida, anyone. I think that they do believe that. They believe in themselves.\" Here's what went right for Tennessee over the years when the Vols did walk out of Rupp as winners: \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?   Feb. 7, 2006: No. 14 Tennessee 75, Kentucky 67 \nMaysville, Ky., native Chris Lofton exploded against his home state school with 31 points, including 7 of 10 shooting from the 3-point line, as Tennessee went into Rupp under former coach Bruce Pearl and won for the first time since 1999, snapping an eight-game overall losing streak against rival Kentucky in a 75-67 win. \nMajor Wingate had 12 points and C.J. Watson added 10 points and four assists as the Vols improved to 17-3 for the season and 8-1 in SEC play. Randolph Morris had a team-high 20 points for Kentucky and point guard Rajon Rondo had 11 points, six assists and five rebounds. \n\"I think we are fortunate to have Kentucky as our rival,\" Pearl said after the game. \"It is what is going to help me build this program into something.\" Jan. 13, 1999: Tennessee 47, No. 6 Kentucky 46 \nTennessee shot a season-worst 30.4 percent from the field, but it didn't matter as the Vols pulled off the upset of sixth-ranked Kentucky 47-46 at Rupp Arena in 1999 -- just nine days removed from the Tennessee football's team BCS National Championship win over Florida State. \nAaron Green hit a 3-pointer to break a 35-all tie and Tony Harris put Tennessee back in the lead with a long three with 4:40 to go. Trailing 46-44 in the closing minute, Brandon Wharton missed a three, but Vincent Yarbrough rebounded and Harris got the ball back to Wharton, who didn't miss a second time, putting the Vols up for good at 47-46. Kentucky missed potential game-winning shots. \nA streak of 20 years without a win at Rupp Arena was broken which, as noted by the Cincinnati Enquirer at the time , started before most of Tennessee's players were born. \n“I was shooting basketballs in my mama's stomach,” Harris, then a sophomore guard, said after the win. Jan. 20, 1979: Tennessee 66, Kentucky 55 \nReggie Johnson scored a game-high 20 points for Tennessee, Terry Crosby scored 14 and Gary Carter added 13 as the Vols dropped Kentucky 66-55 for their second win in three trips to Rupp. Kevin Nash scored 10 points off the bench for Tennessee and Bert Bertelkamp had eight assists in 40 minutes. Lavon Williams (19) and Kyle Macy (18) combined for 37 of Kentucky's 55 points. \nThe Vols beat Kentucky on March 3, 1979 in Birmingham, Ala., to win the SEC Tournament and complete a three-game sweep of the Wildcats in the 1978-79 season. Jan. 12, 1977: Tennessee 71, No. 2 Kentucky 67 \nErnie Grunfeld and Bernard King combined for 38 points to lead Tennessee to an overtime upset, 71-67, of No. 2 Kentucky in 1977, in the Vols' Rupp Arena debut. King finished with 16 points and 19 rebounds and Grunfeld had 22 points on 9 of 21 shooting. \nReggie Johnson had another double-double for Tennessee with 18 points and 13 boards and Terry Crosby scored 10 points. Kentucky was led by 23 points from Jack Givens, 11 points from James Lee and 10 from Jay Shidler. \nThe Vols (22-6) finished the season as SEC champions after going 16-2 in league play. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
