The statement said that Plank’s comments to CNBC were about Trump’s business policies, not his social viewpoints.\n“We engage in policy, not politics,” the statement read. “We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore,” the company’s headquarters.\nThe company’s response seemed to satisfy Curry, who endorsed the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Nevertheless, Curry, who is under contract with Under Armour through 2024, signaled his willingness to leave a company that did not align with his values by saying, “There is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off, if it wasn’t in line with who I am.”\nThe Trump presidency continues to roil the sports world, and Curry’s interview ran on the same day that the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont’a Hightower became the third player from the New England Patriots to reject the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:26:32.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
