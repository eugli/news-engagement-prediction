(Source: Reuters) \nThe United State President Donald Trump continues with his striking at the leading US daily New York times. This time the US president has said that despite being asked to apologise for its wrong coverage, the daily is ‘still lost’. In his latest tweet, Trump wrote: “After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!” After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nFurther, posting a series of tweets, the Republican leader said, “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned.” Commenting about his immigration ban that has been widely criticised by the media house, Trump said that it is interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it’s death and destruction. Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it’s death & destruction! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nTrump continued justifying his immigration ban order in his further tweets. He wrote: “When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot, come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security – big trouble!” When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security – big trouble! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nIn the past, Trump had accused both New York Times and The Washington Post for dishonest coverage. “The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!” Trump wrote on Twitter on January 28. \nIn a similar kind of post, Trump wrote: “Thr (sic) coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas (sic) been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its dwindling subscribers and readers,” They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST, he added further. \nYou might also want to see this: \nHowever, Trump had never indicated clearly about what sparked his tweet storms, but the reason is obvious as both the above mentioned media house regularly post scathing editorials criticising Trump and his administration’s policy proposals.
