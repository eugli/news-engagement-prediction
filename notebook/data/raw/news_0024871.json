By Jenny Hadfield Wednesday, February 8, 2017, 1:20 pm Going for a quick run when you’re pressed for time beats skipping your run entirely. Casey Crafford \nGiselle asks: I find that when time isn’t on my side, I blow off my runs and then I get off track. I feel like I’m always starting over again. What can I do on those busy days to stay on course with my training? \nSometimes life can get in the way of your runs. If you can’t get in that planned 45 to 60 minutes, you probably can get in “better than nothing runs” (BTNs for short). You’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish in a shorter period of time, you’ll feel better for having done it, and most importantly, it will keep running momentum flowing. The next time you’re in a jam, try one of these 30-minute BTNs to stay on track.

If you’re training for a hilly race (and have access to a treadmill), try this: \nWarm up by walking briskly for two minutes. \nRun for five minutes at an easy, yellow-zone effort. \nRepeat for 21 minutes: Run at three- to four-percent incline at a red-zone effort (hard) for one minute, then run easy for two minutes with no incline or a slight decline to recover. (If you don’t have access to a treadmill, try climbing stairs for the same amount of time.) \nWalk for two minutes to cool down. If you’re training to improve speed, try this: \nWarm up by walking briskly for two minutes. \nRun for five minutes at an easy, yellow-zone effort. \nRepeat for 20 to 21 minutes: Run at a hard, red-zone effort for one minute, then recover fully with easy-effort running or walking for two minutes. If you've been running speed workouts and this feels too easy, reduce the recovery time to one minute. \nWalk for two minutes to cool down. If you’re within the final six weeks of race prep (and have been doing speedwork), try this: \nWarm up by walking briskly for two minutes. \nRun for five minutes at an easy, yellow-zone effort. \nRun for 20 minutes at a moderate, orange-zone effort just outside your comfort zone. \nWalk for three minutes to cool down. If you’re busy and bored, try this: \nWarm up by walking briskly for two minutes. \nRun for five minutes at an easy, yellow-zone effort. \nFor 21 minutes, play with your speed by performing short and random 30- to 60-second pickups at a hard, red-zone effort. A few fun ways to employ this are to run the first 30 to 60 seconds of every song on your playlist hard and the rest of the song easy, pick it up at random visual markers on your running route, or plug them in randomly based on how you’re feeling. \nWalk for two minutes to cool down. If you don’t have 30 minutes, try this: \nPack your comfy running shoes and fit in activity during the day. Try to get in 30 minutes total of activity during the day by climbing stairs, taking a brisk 10-minute walk over lunch, or even performing squats, wall sits, and planks. \nIt’s all about rewiring our brains to value the power of a shorter workout. Quick bursts of activity keep you on course, maintain your fitness, and may even spice up your routine. \n* * * \nAsk Coach Jenny a running question on the AskCoachJenny Facebook page or on Twitter , get her latest posts via email , and listen to her podcast .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:25:31.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
