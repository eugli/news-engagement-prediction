(Dillon Anthony)\nThe pursuit of capturing the great outdoors on camera isn't the only form of art Anthony has been working on.\nThe New Brunswick native, also a lifelong musician, is known for his ability to play several instruments. He also performs vocals with rock/blues band, Kill Chicago, based out of Fredericton.\nHe says his passions both on stage and in the great outdoors, are a bit of a balancing act.\n\"I mean, I love both, and it's pretty busy,\" said Anthony.\nThe local musician will be playing a show at the Capital Complex on March 10 and will fly out to the Arctic circle shortly after.\nWhen he returns, Anthony will perform a stretch of shows, which include the East Coast Music Awards and a variety of other festivals.\n\"I fit it in, just between everything,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:35:16.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
