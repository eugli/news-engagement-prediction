I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done,” he said. \n“I don’t think you’re going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place,” he added. \nThe deal, reached in July 2015 , lifted sanctions in exchange for limits on nuclear activity in Iran. \nThe U.S. brought new sanctions against Iran on Friday, targeting 13 individuals and 12 entities in the aftermath of a missile test conducted by Iran on Sunday. \n“I think the key is to rigorously enforce this deal. But also, remember, they’re testing ballistic missiles,” Ryan told NBC. \nWatch a clip of Ryan on “Meet the Press,” which airs Sunday on NBC, above.
