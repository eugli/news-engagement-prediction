The device was reportedly used to launch large amounts of marijuana into the country from Mexico. Authorities said they made the discovery Feb. 10, when they approached a small group of people near the contraption. Though the individuals immediately fled the scene, agents later found 47 pounds of packaged marijuana in the area.\n#USBP agents spring into action dismantling catapult used to launch #Marijuana #Honorfirst\nDetails: https://t.co/NfhWwej7G7 pic.twitter.com/wJ3HPMLTuN\n— CBP Arizona (@CBPArizona) February 14, 2017 Related Feds Discovered Half a Ton of Weed Hidden Inside Coconuts at Mexico Border Border Officials Find Nearly 2 Tons of Weed Inside Fake Ass Limes Half a Million Dollars' Worth of Smuggled Weed Found Inside Fake Carrots, Giving Everyone a Great New Dinner Idea Agents then contacted Mexican authorities, who seized the catapult after U.S. agents dismantled it. The device appeared to be constructed of rope, square tubing, and a heavy spring.\nThough this method may have been effective, it was far from the most creative way of moving weight between countries. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers intercepted a shipment of weed hidden in small pods disguised as limes . In 2016, agents discovered 2,486 packages of marijuana stuffed inside coconuts that were to be delivered in the U.S. And, months prior, authorities also came across nearly half a million dollars worth of weed packed into fake carrots .\nTags: News , Drugs , Marijuana , Mexico , Smuggling", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aCgSwmm5Ho", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marijuana?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/USBP?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honorfirst?src=hash", "https://t.co/wJ3HPMLTuN", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjKqy5_ttFk", "https://twitter.com/CBPArizona/status/831644128978931712", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/us/marijuana-catapult-trnd/", "https://t.co/NfhWwej7G7", "https://twitter.com/JoshuaLEspinoza"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:17:59.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
