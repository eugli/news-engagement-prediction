The race to 5G \nVerizon is not alone in its testing endeavors, as the telecoms giant has partnered up with the likes of Ericsson, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, and more to provide technological assistance in testing its new network's effectiveness. \n“We are pleased about the progress made with partners like Samsung on advancing 5G technology commercially,” said Verizon executive vice president and chief information and technology architect, Roger Gurnani. “Delivering 5G to these pilot customers is an important step in assessing the business model and customer experience for delivering wireless broadband via 5G.” \nThough the road to building a new 5G standard is being paved - Qualcomm having just announced its fastest-yet gigabit modem for mobile devices earlier this week - it's still estimated that that 5G connectivity still has about another year or two before it becomes the new normal for smartphones.
