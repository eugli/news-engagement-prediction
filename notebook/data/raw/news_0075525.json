His taste for muddy, driving techno, is reliably exceptional, crafting tracks that flutter and morph to a destructive effect. Surprisingly, it’s been nearly five years since he put out his last solo 12”, as nine of his past 10 releases were co-produced with Boddika (aka Al Green). This month alone, Orbison released not one, but two records under his own name, showing his fans he is far from running out of ideas. \nOn “Rid,” the opening track on Toss Portal , Orbison offers a sludgy sonic whirlwind. Behind a out-of-focus beat, as synths tear erratically through the mix, like a horn searching wildly for its tone. Even the concentrated groove—a complement of sputtering drums and ascending arpeggios—threatens to unspool from the track.. In the final third, the pressure dissipates, and all those careening sounds filter into a surface of woozy textures. This stark contrast between airy space and dense rhythms gives “Rid” an aura of both comfort and menace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:56:05.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
