Moreover, these negative consequences can persist for an average of three days after they occurred,” said Sandy Hershcovis, lead researcher from the Haskayne School of Business. “It’s also important to note that incivility is more embarrassing when it comes from someone who is powerful, and that the powerful exacerbate the already negative effects of incivility.”\nAccording to the research, people can also feel physical symptoms like stomach issues, sleeplessness and headaches from persistent incivility.\nTwo studies were conducted in North America with full-time employees who experienced rudeness in the workplace and the data is the first to show the link between incivility and feelings of isolation and embarrassment among workers.\nResearchers say companies need to address the behaviors to ensure people feel valued at work.\n\"It’s important for management to regularly reinforce people’s value, so that when employees inevitably experience incivility they won’t be as threatened by it,” said Hershcovis. “Our findings also show that employees are embarrassed when they are treated uncivilly, which implies that they care what witnesses think. This suggests an important role for witnesses, who can help targets by providing social support that help employees feel less isolated.”\nThe research has been published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:20:44.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
