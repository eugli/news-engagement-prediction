AP FILE - In this Aug. 22, 2015, file photo, New York Giants offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo confers with quarterbacks Eli Manning, left, and Ryan Nassib, right, during the first half of a preseason NFL football game in East Rutherford, N.J. A person familiar with the decision tells The Associated Press the Giants are hiring offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo as their next head coach. McAdoo, 38, is being given the job a little more than a week after Tom Coughlin stepped down after 12 seasons, the person spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the team has not officially announced the hiring. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nThe New York Giants got busted, and they'll feel the NFL's wrath in this year's draft. \nThe Giants' fourth-round pick in the 2017 draft will be pushed back 10 spots as punishment for the team's illegal use of walkie-talkies in its Week 14 win over the Cowboys. \nAn NFL release detailing the compensatory draft picks handed out to teams this year (the Cowboys received none), noted that the Giants' punishment had been doled out. \n\"As the result of League discipline, the New York Giants' original selection in Round 4 (4-23-130) has been relegated to selection 4-34-140. Because that pick is a regular selection, it does not appear on the above list of compensatory draft selections,\" the release said. \nThe club was fined $150,000 while McAdoo owed the league an additional $50,000. The draft pick could have been moved up to 12 selections later than its original spot. \nThe Giants used walkie-talkies for five plays vs. Dallas in a 10-7 victory on Dec. 11, violating the NFL policy prohibiting two-way radio usage between coaches and players during games. \nThe NFL's issue with the radios? \"They will not be cut off when the Cutoff Switch Operator engages the cutoff,\" league policy says. The quarterbacks cannot communicate with coaches on the sideline once the play clock ticks down to 15 seconds. This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
