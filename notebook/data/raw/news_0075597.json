Late-night TV on Trump's golfing: 'He loves making fun of people’s handicaps' Read more \nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert reviewed further news to come from Trump’s visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture where he reportedly referred to slavery as “not good”. \n“I haven’t heard that kind of eloquent denunciation since the civil war novel The Red Badge of Dang, That’s Messed Up,” Colbert said. \nHe then covered the controversial InfoWars pundit Alex Jones, who has reportedly joined Trump’s staff. On the name of his site, Colbert joked: “The name is easy to remember. Just imagine the word info and then imagine someone at war with it.” \nHe spoke about some of his more unhinged theories, including the belief that juiceboxes are turning men into women. “A couple of sips and suddenly your Capri-Sun is your Capri-Daughter,” he said. \nJones is apparently keen to gain press credentials for the daily Sean Spicer briefings. Colbert warned: “To those of you working in the White House press pool, you’re going to want to get earplugs and a poncho.” \nOn Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host took a closer look at Trump’s wall plan and immigration policies. He played footage of Trump claiming that he didn’t know the number of Mexican immigrants in the country illegally and it could be 5 or 30 million. \n“We do know what the number is,” Meyers said. “Just because you don’t know, doesn’t mean no one knows.” \nHe also joked about Trump’s attempts to get others to help build and pay for the wall with a leaked email that showed a very informal request, ending with “call me”. Meyers responded: “Where else is he drumming up support? In bathroom stalls?” \nHe also played footage of Trump’s wall promises, claiming it would include sensors above and below ground, while making a theatrical hand movement. “He may be a terrible president but he’d be great at a game of Douchebag Charades,” he said.

Even most Republicans think so. Those Republicans and Democrats should stand up to Trump.” \nOn the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon talked about a report that claimed Trump’s speech to Congress would be lighter than his inauguration speech. “Seriously, Manchester by the Sea was more upbeat than his inauguration speech,” he joked. \nHe went on to ridicule the president’s many expensive trips to his luxury Miami resort. “Trump’s frequent visits to his Mar-A-Lago resort have many wondering if he’ll stick with the presidential tradition of visiting Camp David while others would be happy if he just stuck with the tradition of visiting the White House,” he said. \nEarlier this week Trump claimed that the media are an enemy of the American people yet Fallon said “that would still be kale”. \nIt was George Washington’s birthday this week which led to Fallon joking: “George Washington is of course the father of our country while Trump is more like the stepfather that got your mom on the rebound.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:11:53.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
