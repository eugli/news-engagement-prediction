In doing so, the Atlanta Zoo settled a Super Bowl bet with Roger Williams Park Zoo (Providence, R.I.), in which the losing side must name a baby animal after the winning team’s quarterback. A post shared by Zoo Atlanta (@zooatl) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:14am PST \nHow can we tell Atlantans still feel the sting of the Patriots’ improbable overtime win? By looking at the super-salty action of the Atlanta Zoo. \nIt’s all good, though. That family of cockroaches probably is already winning titles by now. \nThumbnail photo via James Lang/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Marcus Kwesi O'Mard?
