Police say another caretaker recorded Fultz and later showed a supervisor, who reported the incident to police this month. \nFultz pleaded not guilty Tuesday. Her attorney says Fultz should be exonerated because it was a prank intended to make the man feel good. The attorney alleges that even though the resident has dementia, he had the capacity to say no but didn't. \nThe second caretaker wasn't charged. \nAuthorities say the caretakers no longer work at the facility.
