He then fired a shot, sending the children running away. \nAt one point Christian can be heard saying â€˜Iâ€™m only 13â€™, as the others keep telling the officer to â€˜let him goâ€™.

Two of them were arrested.

The teens also say the officer called a girl who was walking on the garden a â€˜c*ntâ€™. \nThe shocking incident took place in Anaheim at around 2.40pm on Tuesday. \nProtesters then took to the streets on Wednesday, chanting â€˜Whose streets? Our streetsâ€™, â€˜Donâ€™t shoot our kidsâ€™, â€˜Shame on youâ€™, and â€˜No justice, no peace, fuck the policeâ€™. \nâ€” FW BURRITO ðŸŒ¯ (@FWBleu) February 23, 2017 \nLate on Wednesday night the boyâ€™s father, Johnny Dorscht, said he was â€˜pretty pissed off about what happenedâ€™.
