(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) \nThe viral and unintentional gaffe at last night’s Academy Awards rings a bell to many pageant fans and, especially, the Miss Universe body. \nMiss Universe (Organization) and Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach poked fun at the “Steve Harvey moment” of the Oscars 2017 awarding, where “Moonlight” was recognized as the winner for the Best Picture category but “La La Land” was announced as the winner instead. \nFilmmaker Warren Beatty called up the crew of “La La Land” for winning the said category but corrected his live mishap when he noticed he opened the wrong envelope. On stage, “La La Land” executive producer Jordan Horowitz handled the issue with grace and bestowed the trophy to the real Best Picture winner, “Moonlight.” ADVERTISEMENT \nWhile the internet audience was still hanging their jaws with the faux pas, Miss Universe’s Twitter account offered the Oscars people a pat on the back. “Have your people call our people – we know what to do,” the organization tweeted on Monday. Have your people call our people – we know what to do. #Oscars #MissUniverse \n— Miss Universe (@MissUniverse) February 27, 2017 \nIn a tweet on the same day, Wurtzbach shared a snippet of her previous hair commercial where she said, “If it can happen to me, It can happen to anybody.” \n— Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach (@PiaWurtzbach) February 27, 2017 \nHarvey himself even reached out to Beatty following the gaffe. “Call me Warren Beatty, I can get you through this!” he tweeted . Good morning everybody! Went to sleep early last night. So… what I miss? #Oscars \n— Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) February 27, 2017 Call me Warren Beatty. I can help you get through this! #Oscars \n— Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) February 27, 2017 \nDuring the 64th Miss Universe edition, Steve Harvey wrongfully announced Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez as the victor of the beauty competition, but returned on stage to crown the Filipina-German beauty queen as the Miss Universe heir.
