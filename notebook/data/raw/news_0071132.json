Rios has been in the country for 10 years with a green card and applied for full citizenship six months ago. \n\"All of my family is here, we all immigrated from Colombia,\" the 52-year-old said. \nThe ceremony was one of 162 held by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) across the country that welcomed 25,000 new citizens this month. The celebrations are in stark contrast to the fear of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants by the new president, Donald Trump. \nThe ceremony -- which took place the country's most diverse city -- was attended by several local officials, including City Council President Rolando Lavarro Jr. and Councilman-at-large Danny Rivera. \nU.S. Rep. Albio Sires, D-West New York, himself an immigrant from Cuba -- was the keynote speaker of the ceremony, telling the new citizens his family's story fleeing Cuba and becoming a citizen. \n\"I walk in the halls of congress and discuss laws all for this great country, and that's because I was given the privilege to become a citizen of the United States and take part in the democratic process,\" Sires said. \" I want to congratulate all of you today for this privilege.\" \nMayor Fulop has declared Jersey City a \"sanctuary city,\" despite threats by the president to withhold federal funding from such cities. As a sanctuary city, Jersey City will not devote any city resources to the capture or detention of undocumented immigrants. \n\"At the height of immigration in the 19th century, as people of all nationalities arrived at Ellis Island, their first view of America was not just the Statue of Liberty, but of Jersey City,\" said Vivian Brady-Phillips, deputy mayor of Jersey City. \"Jersey City continues to be America's golden door.\" Most Read", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:52:49.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
