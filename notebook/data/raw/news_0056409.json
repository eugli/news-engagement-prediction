Reuters \nSAN DIEGO, Calif. — Two top Navy fleet commanders said Tuesday that the next potential conflict hotspot would likely be in Korea. \n\"If there’s a fight tonight, it’s probably going to happen on the Korean peninsula,\" said Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of 7th Fleet, in a panel discussion at the AFCEA West 2017 conference. \nVice Adm. Nora Tyson, commander of 3rd Fleet, agreed with that assessment, saying that hostilities with the North Korean regime would be the \"number one probability.\" \nThe fleet commanders made their comments on a panel discussion titled, \"Are we ready to fight — today and in the future?\" \n\"Are we ready to fight? You bet we are,\" said Vice Adm. Jamie Foggo, a former 6th Fleet commander who now serves as director of the Navy's joint staff. \nFoggo pointed to recent provocations out of Pyongyang as worrisome. Earlier this month , North Korea launched a land-based nuclear-capable ballistic missile that traveled 300 miles before splashing into the Sea of Japan. \n\"Frankly, it was pretty impressive,\" Foggo said. \"It was like a submarine missile launched from a tank. Solid fuel. Pretty impressive.\" \nStill, Aucoin pointed to the US' strong relationship with South Korea and Japan as helping to counter aggression out of Pyongyang, along with a number of moves of sophisticated weaponry and early-warning assets to the region, including E2D Hawkeye aircraft, F/A-18 Super Hornets, and F-35B fighters being placed in Okinawa. \nThe US also has Patriot missile batteries and is moving forward with placing the more-advanced THAAD interceptor on the ground in South Korea. There are more than 28,000 US soldiers stationed there. \nAucoin said those assets provide a \"pretty good umbrella.\" \nOn Sunday, the Washington Post reported that preparations were underway to bring North Korean officials to the United States for diplomatic talks between former US officials. \n7th Fleet, Aucoin said, is well-resourced and well-manned. \"We're ready to deliver decisive combat power on, above, and below the surface if necessary,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:43:40.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
