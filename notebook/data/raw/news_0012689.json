NDF consultants Wilma and Benito Tiamzon (middle) participate in peace talks in Oslo. Rappler file photo \nMANILA, Philippines – The Duterte administration has terminated the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG), paving the way for the arrest of National Democratic Front (NDF) consultants who were temporarily released from government detention to participate in the peace negotiations. \nChief Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza relayed the JASIG termination in a letter dated February 7, addressed to Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison and NDF chief negotiator Fidel Agcaoili. \n\"Following the President's announcement of the cancellation of the peace talks with the CPP/NPA/NDF and per his instructions, the government is hereby serving this notice of the termination of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees,\" Dureza said in his letter to the CPP leaders. \nThe Duterte government had earlier filed petitions before local courts for the temporary release of around 20 consultants, including NPA leaders Benito and Wilma Tiamzon , for the negotiations. \nJASIG, signed in 1995 during peace talks between the government and NDF panels under the administration of President Fidel Ramos, grants NDF members involved in the peace talks immunity from arrest. \nBefore President Rodrigo Duterte cancelled his administration's talks with the communists, the two panels had been working towards reconstituting the JASIG. \nPeace talks were stalled during the administration of President Benigno Aquino III after it was discovered that the list of NDF consultants covered by the JASIG were contained in a floppy disk that had become corrupted, and therefore, impossible to encrypt. The government did not agree to the proposal of the NDF for a new list to be drawn up. \nThe NDF said 87 rebel leaders were covered by the agreement. \nOn Saturday, February 4, Duterte changed his tune and announced he was scrapping the talks. A few days earlier, he had lifted the government's ceasefire with the New People's Army (NPA), the CPP's armed wing. \nDuterte called the CPP \"spoiled brats\" and \" terrorists \" and accused the NPA of attacking soldiers even before the termination of its ceasefire with the govenrment on February 10, one of them leading to the death of 3 soldiers in Bukidnon on February 1. \nThe NDF, meanwhile, demanded Duterte release 400 more political prisoners before it signs a bilateral ceasefire agreement with the government. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
