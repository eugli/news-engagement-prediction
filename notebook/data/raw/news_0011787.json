Due to security concerns and public safety consideration,I hereby announce the cancellation of the planned March.” \n“The protest is under serious threat of hijack by interests not aligned with our ideals,” he said. \nThe Lagos State Police Command had backed down on its threat to stop the nationwide protest. \nPolice Commissioner, Fatai Owoseni, disclosed that both sides met and resolved to modify their hard line positions. \nHe said: “We had a meeting with the protesters and we explained to them why we advised against the protest. \n“A pro-government group wants to protest that same day and we don’t want a situation where there would be friction. \n“We also don’t want hooligans to hijack the process and injure the protesters. After explaining to them, they said they will go back and discuss with others. \n“They said if they decide to go ahead, they won’t demonstrate but would assemble at a point and read their demands. \n“That notwithstanding, we have resolved to provide security for them. It is our responsibility and we won’t shy away from it. We will ensure trouble makers do not hijack the process.” \nThe Presidency had also declared that it wasn’t against the protest, admiting that citizens are free to express themselves peacefully.
