Credit WWLP-22News, via YouTube For a brief period that began in December, students in Northampton, Mass., arriving at elementary schools were greeted once a week by police officers lining the sidewalks to deliver high-fives and encouragement. It was part of a trust-building program called High Five Fridays, intended to show children that police officers were not the scary men and women they might have heard about or seen on television. Parents overwhelmingly supported the program. But in January, Jody Kasper, the city’s police chief, started hearing from a small number of parents who said that their children — especially minorities and those who have had difficult experiences with the police — were uncomfortable with the officers’ presence. Concerned that the education of those students might be harmed, Chief Kasper and the school district’s superintendent, John Provost, decided last week to scrap the program. “Certainly we do not want to have our officers at a school and have kids, even if it’s a handful of kids, be traumatized and have a negative experience with our officers,” Chief Kasper said in an interview on Tuesday. “That’s the opposite of the goal we’re trying to accomplish.” She noted that most of the response to the effort had been positive, but said the police needed to listen to those who felt otherwise. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We are everyone’s police,” she said. “Not just the majority, and not just the minority.” In response to the program’s cancellation, a groundswell of parents said the police leaders and school officials had it right the first time. They criticized the decision to discontinue a program that they thought had promoted healthy interactions with police officers. The Police Department’s Facebook page filled with angry comments, many from parents unsympathetic to complaints. A petition is circulating to reinstate the program. “I just think my kid will benefit, and the community as a whole will benefit, from positive opportunities for the police and the children to get together,” Tim Chilson, 58, said in an interview on Tuesday. His son, Maverick Carey, 10, was among those who high-fived and fist-bumped officers outside Leeds Elementary School. He said he usually liked going to school, but he was excited on days that he got to talk to the officers — or, as he put it, “the really nice people.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
