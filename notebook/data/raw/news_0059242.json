That happened to Martellus Bennett on Tuesday. \nAfter the Los Angeles Lakers promoted Magic Johnson to the position of president of basketball operations , Bennett on Twitter described a memorable interaction he once had with the Basketball Hall of Famer. But based on the wording of his tweet, it sounded memorable for all the wrong reasons. I had a conversation with Magic Johnson when I was 21 and a rookie. Damn I wish I had that 5 minutes back. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nDozens of Twitter users jumped on this slip-up, and the New England Patriots tight end later clarified what he was trying to say. I wasted that 5 minutes. That same 5 minutes today would possibly be life changing. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 Am I that much of an asshole that even when I say something nice it sounds asshole-ish? Lmfao. Y'all crazy. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nApparently inspired by his meeting with Magic, Bennett then rattled off a slew of interactions he’s had with other celebrities, including Tom Hanks, Will Smith and Sinbad. I also was once on an elevator with Tom Hanks, Olivia Wilde, Ben Stiller and a few others. I absolutely crushed that interaction. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 I once had a small conversation with Jackie Chan and Will Smith. Well that was really mostly with Will. I couldn't understand Jackie. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 But I had the feeling that Will Smith didn't understand him either so I didn't feel that bad. Just laughed when Jackie laughed and agreed \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 I gave Sinbad a what's up bro nod one time at a restaurant I couldn't afford to be at, at that time. Crustaceans in LA. He nodded back \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 One solo night a few years ago maybe 8. Maybe 9. I ended up at the playboy mansion after getting a Range Rover with 3 hot strange girls. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nStay weird, Marty. \nThumbnail photo via Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:42:47.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
