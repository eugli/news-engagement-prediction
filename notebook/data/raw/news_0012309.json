During his commentary stint at Stamford Bridge, Neville had also blasted an Arsenal fan who was holding up a 'Enough is enough, time to go' banner, calling him an 'idiot.' As a result, Neville has been invited onto Arsenal Fan TV to expand on his view, and said he would be 'very happy' to make a guest appearance. Robbie Lyle from the fan channel, on a YouTube post, said: 'Neville's been having a go at Arsenal Fan TV on Sky Sports saying that fans shouldn't be slating off the manager of the football club. Saturday's defeat left Arsenal fourth in the Premier League table, 12 points behind Chelsea One furious Arsenal fan held up a 'time to go' banner, leading Neville to call him an 'idiot' 'Fans pay their money and go to watch their club week in, week out, up and down the country everywhere. So because they're not as articulate as you and haven't got on a suit and in a Sky Sports studio, they're not allowed to say anything and just be quiet?

Neville was asked on Twitter whether he would consider making an appearance on Arsenal Fan TV and he replied 'be very happy to...' The YouTube channel then replied: 'The balls in Gary's court.

Speaking on Sky Sports, the former Manchester United defender said: 'Arsene Wenger's biggest challenge is that he's been there such a long time and there's always that sort of grass is greener. 'If Arsene Wenger was Jurgen Klopp and he was currently above Manchester City, above Liverpool, above Manchester United that have spent nearly £150-200million between them we'd be saying he's doing a great job. 'At the start of the season, forget Arsene Wenger's the manager, and Arsenal are there, you could argue the profile of the players would change if a new manager comes in, they could end up in eighth or seventh could Arsenal. With their budget, they potentially could. 'If Arsene Wenger was Jurgen Klopp now, we'd be saying he's doing a good job, because he's 18 months in. Actually, is Arsene Wenger not just doing a great job full stop? And I have to question that.'
