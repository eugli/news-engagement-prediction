The 15-track collection comprises some of the best hip-hop songs in history (though he humbly didn't include any of his own hits). Pioneers like Grandmaster Flash, N.W.A., and Public Enemy made the cut, as well as some of Jay’s most celebrated peers, like Biggie, Tupac, Eminem, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. His pal Kanye West also earned a slot, for his 2004 hit “Jesus Walks.” \nBasically, this playlist is a must-listen for any hip-hop lover, and a wake-up call for anyone who’s doubted the place of songwriting in rap. Let’s hope the artists hand-picked by Jay join him in the Hall of Fame in the coming years, now that he’s paved the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:54:04.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
