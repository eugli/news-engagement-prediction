Any other figures mentioned are not in the contract,” the sources said. \nAsked how the government could have come to the €60 million figure, the sources said the “estimated commercial consideration” mentioned by Dr Muscat was not the price of the land to be paid, as was the norm in the market. \n“Strangely, the €60 million figure includes the €15 million consideration for the land, €3 million stamp duty and the presumed payments to be made by future purchasers of apartments, offices and garages. \n“The latter will not be paid by the company being given the land but by future clients in the eventuality that they decide to redeem the ground land of the properties they purchase,” the sources pointed out. The controversial issue of selling the ITS property on the cheap has been raging from day one, when the government announced negotiations with Mr Debono. According to the draft Paceville master plan released last November, the price of seafront land in St George’s Bay was estimated to be €8,500 per square metre. \nAlthough, according to this estimate, the land that was conceded to the DB Group could fetch €212 million on the market, experts said that the whole site was not considered to consist of seafront land. In a presentation given by the Minister Within the Office of the Prime Minister, Konrad Mizzi – who was the Prime Minister’s representative regarding this deal – the valuation of the land was based “on an innovative model” to be adopted in other developments in the future. \nAccording to Dr Mizzi, this model was designed by audit firm Deloitte. \nIn Parliament yesterday, Dr Mizzi said the contract entered into with the DB Group was “very robust”, unlike that entered into by the previous administration for Smart City, where the amount paid was 40c per square metre and the developer had the freedom to sell the property, sub-lease and give land to a contractor. \nDr Mizzi added that the valuation of €56 million was attributable as: premium payable of €15 million, conversion from temporary to perpetual emphyteusis of €5.9 million, car park conversion of €0.5 million, redeption of ground rent of €23 million, hospitaly ground rent of €2.49 million and retail ground rent of €8.7 million. Dr Mizzi also said government would ensure that the money would be recouped and not as happened in the case of Manoel Island, where MIDI paid €12 million over six years and the rest is still being negotiated because of lack of enforcement in the early years. « Konrad Mizzi defends land transfer price as Marlene Farrugia says it was a rip-off Malta newspapers review » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=47368887439&n=5a297d2a' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=47368887439&n=5a297d2a' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
