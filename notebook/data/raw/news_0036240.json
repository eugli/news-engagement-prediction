REUTERS \nUS President Donald Trump's adminstration discussed an 11-page document calling for the unprecedented militarisation of immigration enforcement. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Saturday morning (NZT) the document was \"not a White House document\". \nREAD MORE: \n\"There is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,\" he said. REUTERS \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said the document was not White House's. \nSpicer called the AP report \"100 per cent not true, adding that there was \"no effort at all to utilise the National Guard to round up unauthorised immigrants\". \nA DHS official described the document as a very early draft that was not seriously considered and never brought to the secretary for approval. \nGovernors in the 11 states would have had a choice whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, which bears the name of US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general. This is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false https://t.co/MFIJci7XaU Ad Feedback \nWhile National Guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the US-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north. \nThe memo was addressed to the then-acting heads of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection. It would have served as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that President Donald Trump signed January 25. \nSuch memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders. - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:01:22.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
