Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nThe trajectory of the ball was straight at a young child in the stands who was being held in a woman’s arms. \nA fan behind them showed reactions that would have impressed Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to reach his hands over the head of the infant to palm the ball to safety. Regardless of how it ends, this Burnley fan wins today. pic.twitter.com/StiO6UxXs0 \n— Mike Keegan (@MikeKeegan_DM) February 12, 2017 \nSave of the season right there.
