Just a thought.’ Like all Lineker’s forays into public affairs, the remarks were met with great approval in the realm of social media, where he has accumulated more than 5.5 million followers on Twitter and another 400,000 on Instagram. Here, in the smug echo chamber of woolly liberalism, his Left-wing take on global politics has helped the former England footballer burnish his credentials as a trusted and popular TV icon. Perhaps that explains the high esteem in which Lineker, 56, is now held by the likes Jeremy Corbyn, who believes he’s ‘showing Britain at its best: compassionate, welcoming, and standing up to fear and division’, and his predecessor as Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who admires Lineker’s ‘compassion and solidarity’.

The interview was flagged on the front page. It claimed that keyboard activism has ‘turned Mr Lineker, a one-time working-class boy from Leicester, into an unlikely spokesman for the much-maligned “liberal elite” ’, who in commenting on current affairs is unafraid to go ‘where not even the opposition Labour Party goes these days for fear of being branded out of touch’. Accompanied by a picture of its ‘silver-haired and boyish-looking’ subject in the state-of-the-art kitchen of his £4 million home in Barnes, South-West London, it cast the BBC presenter as a fearless voice of sanity in an increasingly troublesome world. ‘Listening to Mr Lineker, soccer becomes almost a parable for what has gone right and what has gone wrong in Britain over the past 30 years,’ it declared. At the weekend, he went into bat against an old foe — popular newspapers, which had exhibited the temerity to reveal that David Beckham’s efforts to manipulate the honours system had been stymied by his equally vigorous attempts to avoid paying tax Dig behind the façade of national hero Gary Lineker, and you will very quickly discover that this budding member of the liberal commentariat has for many years taken a — shall we say — robust approach to his personal finances Naturally, the New York Times article — which said that the former England footballer ‘is now worth an estimated $15 million’ (£12.5 million) — pleased its subject a great deal. He duly flagged it on Twitter. Yet one important area of Lineker’s life was curiously absent from this hagiographic piece of journalism (written, it should be noted, by an Establishment newspaper which has a dog in Lineker’s fights, having been humbled by the Trump phenomenon). It also, coincidentally, has almost never been properly addressed in his public statements, or endless commentary on social media. Namely: His colourful tax affairs. Gary Lineker and Danielle Bux attend the unveiling of Walkers biggest ever campaign, releasing 15 new flavours of crisps held at Orchid on March 29, 2010 in London For dig behind the façade of national hero Gary Lineker, and you will very quickly discover that this budding member of the liberal commentariat has for many years taken a — shall we say — robust approach to his personal finances. Indeed, a critical reader might wonder if this self-styled Leftie’s relationship with Her Majesty’s Exchequer represents, to borrow the New York Times’s phrase, ‘a parable for what has gone right and what has gone wrong in Britain over the past 30 years’. To understand why, you don’t even have to look very hard. Simply examine records kept by Companies House, the Government register of publicly available information about commercial organisations. Here, you will find that Mr Gary Winston Lineker has in recent years been listed as an ‘officer’ at seven different companies. One of them, Goalhanger Films — a nod to his playing days — is a TV and film production firm that he runs with former ITV sport director Tony Pastor. It makes documentaries for a number of broadcasters, including the BBC. Another is an old TV firm called All Jazz Limited which he put into liquidation in 2014, around the time of his separation from second wife Danielle, the company secretary. The remaining five? Well here’s where things get interesting. Records show that Lineker is, or has been, a member of a series of so-called ‘limited liability partnerships’ (LLPs) which were set up between 2003 and 2007 by a somewhat notorious firm called Ingenious Media. Gary Lineker, the former England striker with a copy of Unbelievable, which shows the funny, bizarre, and crazy World of football in 2012 Their names are Inside Track 1, Inside Track 2, Ingenious Film Partners, Ingenious Film Partners 2 and Ingenious Film Partners 3. These organisations are highly controversial. For each was deliberately designed to allow wealthy individuals — such as Lineker, this great champion of equality — to avoid paying the same rates of tax on their income as the man or woman in the street. The LLPs created complex ways for very rich people to exploit tax breaks intended to encourage investment in UK films. Ironically, these are the same schemes that former England captain David Beckham signed up to, and which saw his proposed knighthood ‘red flagged’, or rejected, by the Honours Committee. Perhaps that may partly explain why Lineker chose to speak out in support of his fellow tax-avoider this week. He has a reputed £2 million salary from broadcasting, plus roughly a million more each year for endorsing Walkers crisps But we digress. A major attraction for would-be members of Ingenious schemes was the belief they would be able to keep thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds from the taxman’s grasp. In some cases, they expected to initially pay just a few per cent of tax on income, or defer income tax for many years. Sadly, as we shall see, things didn’t quite turn out that way. For the authorities have in recent years taken an increasingly dim view of what they regard as highly aggressive vehicles that help stop the rich and famous paying their dues. A few years back, the then head of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Dave Hartnett, famously referred to Ingenious products as ‘scams for scumbags’. Given that Mr Lineker is involved in five of such ‘scams’, it follows that Britain’s top tax official regarded him as a ‘scumbag’. His status as such is long-standing, too. Public records show this ‘compassionate’ hero of Messers Corbyn and Miliband has a relationship with Ingenious which stretches back to October 23, 2003. Back then, Lineker joined the partnerships Inside Track 1 and Inside Track 2. At the same time, his ex-wife Michelle, mother of his four children, also signed up to the partnerships. They remain members of these schemes to this day. In the gilded circles in which they move, the couple were hardly alone. Indeed, the 500-odd other members of the Inside Track LLPs included a host of famous footballers, such as another former England captain Steven Gerrard, several members of the England cricket team, pop stars Craig David and Peter Gabriel, leading British film directors Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, not to mention fellow Left-wing member of the Twitterati, comedian David Baddiel. In 2007, following his separation from Michelle, Lineker chose to sign up to Ingenious Film Partners 3, alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and around 150 other high-net-worth individuals Fast forward to 2005, and the Linekers squirrelled even more cash away, each joining two other schemes: Ingenious Film Partners and Ingenious Film Partners 2. This time, they were joined by the likes of Beckham, fellow footballers Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs, TV hosts Ant and Dec, Ali G star Sacha Baron Cohen, and PR man Matthew Freud. Then in 2007, following his separation from Michelle, Lineker chose to sign up to Ingenious Film Partners 3, alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and around 150 other high-net-worth individuals. By this point, film partnerships were becoming increasingly controversial, thanks to a number of newspaper reports revealing how they had become vehicles for aggressive tax avoidance. They worked, very broadly, as follows: under rules created by Gordon Brown, at the height of the ‘Cool Britannia’ movement, investors could claim tax relief on cash intended to finance UK films. The New York Times chose to honour the Match Of The Day host with an adulatory profile article last month, describing him to readers as a ‘soccer hero’ who has lately decided to ‘dip a toe in post-Brexit British politics’ If they earned, say, £3 million a year from their own activities, they would ordinarily have paid the then going rate of 40 per cent tax on almost all of it. But by investing £2 million in a film partnership, they would be liable for tax only on the remaining £1 million. So far, so straightforward. However creative investment firms such as Ingenious soon began to find ways to make this already tempting proposition more tempting still. Under schemes it began to market, investors didn’t need to put up the full £2 million themselves. Instead they could put up, say, a quarter of that, £500,000, and borrow the remaining £1.5 million from another source, yet still claim tax relief on the full £2 million. Since almost all films lose money in their first year, they could claim the interest due on the borrowed £1.5 million, plus costs paid to Ingenious, as losses set against their taxable income, cutting their total tax bill even further. In the early 2000s, billions of pounds were ploughed into the firm’s schemes, invested in a range of movies, some of which were successful. When any profits began rolling in, the investor would in theory become liable for tax on his or her share of profits. However, those profits could be ploughed into another film venture, which might also make a loss during its first year. So the whole process started again. That was the theory, at least. However, as public hostility to tax avoidance grew, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Ingenious was dragged into a legal dispute with HMRC. The taxman believes its LLPs (whose members invested between £100,000 and several million of their annual earnings) broke not just the spirit but also the letter of the law. Ingenious, of course, disagrees. Gary Lineker (centre) with David Walliams (left) and Marco Pierre White during the Walkers 'Do Us A Flavour' campaign in 2014 In August, HMRC won a landmark victory in this dispute, when a tax tribunal found that members of the firm’s schemes (who of course include Lineker) were entitled to only a third of the tax relief they had previously claimed. The Revenue says it has already ‘protected’ £400 million in tax revenue thanks to the ruling. ‘Avoidance schemes almost always fall flat and don’t deliver what they say they will, and users risk ending up worse off than if they had never used the scheme in the first place,’ a spokesman said this week. Ingenious intends to appeal the August ruling. But in a sense, the outcome of this case is beside the point. For what remains beyond dispute is the fact that Lineker was a major client of the firm. He still is, actually, having retained his membership of both Inside Track schemes (though in common with most other members he left the other three LLPs between 2007 and 2011). All of which strikes some of the hapless politicians who have drawn the ex-footballer’s ire in recent months as a little rum. ‘Hard-working people who pay their taxes and buy their BBC-TV licence will be appalled that Mr Lineker has tried to avoid paying for public services through aggressive tax avoidance schemes,’ argues the Tory MP David Davies (not to be confused with the frontbencher David Davis). ‘Gary Lineker takes vast sums from the BBC and has a very high profile which he uses to push out-of-touch political views. Yet he does not even have the decency to accept the same rate of taxes that the rest of us put up with.’ Fellow Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke adds: ‘He can no longer pontificate, saying the Government isn’t spending enough on things like its response to the refugee crisis, if he has deliberately joined these schemes. How does he think the Government should pay for its services? ‘If you are taking the view that the Government should do more for everyone, but are then trying to avoid paying the same tax rate as any other working man or woman, that’s unrivalled hypocrisy.’ In fairness to Lineker, he’s not the only BBC personality to have used the firm’s products. Also invested in its schemes were TV host Anne Robinson, journalist Katie Adie and former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson’s then wife, Frances In fairness to Lineker, he’s not the only BBC personality to have used the firm’s products. Also invested in its schemes were TV host Anne Robinson, journalist Katie Adie and former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson’s then wife, Frances. Neither is he the only member of the Left-wing establishment to quietly sign up. The Labour Peer Lord Hollick was also involved in Ingenious schemes, as was the multi-millionaire anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof. It should also be pointed out that Lineker might have joined without fully realising the full nature of the tax avoidance he was signing up to. However, naivety in financial matters hardly his hallmark. He made a reputed £3 million from investing in Ingenie, a car insurance firm which was sold in 2014 He has a reputed £2 million salary from broadcasting, plus roughly a million more each year for endorsing Walkers crisps. He also made a reputed £3 million from investing in Ingenie, a car insurance firm which was sold in 2014. On the subject of BBC presenters and money, Lineker has said: ‘I can see why people criticise us for earning good money for doing what we enjoy . . . you can never really justify wages in the entertainment business, but it is what it is.’ It’s possible, of course, that Lineker was motivated to join Ingenious schemes by a charitable desire to help the British film industry, rather than by the enormous tax incentives they offered. However, he declined to respond openly to a request for comment on his relationship with the firm this week, so it’s impossible to say. Sources close to him, however, stressed that his tax reporting to HMRC is fully up to date and all known tax liabilities have been settled in full. Indeed, the only time he has ever publicly discussed Ingenious came in February 2015, when the Sun newspaper reported that he’d been served with a £1.3 million tax bill relating to his involvement in its schemes. He immediately denied the claims via Twitter — where else! — saying: ‘Always paid my taxes, in full, nothing hidden,’ and adding, ‘The Sun has done another truth avoidance piece on its front page. I look forward to the tiny apology on Page 47 in a few weeks’ time.’ When the football manager Peter Reid responded by suggesting that Mr Lineker should sue, he promised: ‘I will.’ That was almost two years ago. Strangely, The Sun never published a correction, and despite the bluster, Mr Lineker (who is prone to using lawyers to muzzle coverage of his colourful love life) never got round to taking them to court. In a sense, however, he didn’t have to: in the world of social media, public attention swiftly moves on, and the awkward matter of involvement with the firm was quickly forgotten. And so, as ever, this sanctimonious member of the liberal elite — whose lifestyle is a million miles from that of most football fans who dutifully pay their taxes — continues to air his political views from that smug moral high ground.
