Moreover, a recent analysis by Capital & Main found that CKE's Carl's Jr. and Hardee's restaurants had more federal harassment and discrimination lawsuits filed against them than any other fast food burger chain since 2000, when Puzder became CEO. Given this record, it is not surprising that Puzder has sung the praises of automation, noting that unlike employees, robots don't file discrimination lawsuits. \nPuzder's record makes clear that he should not be entrusted with the enforcement of laws protecting working women from sexual harassment and assault. In addition, his long and consistent opposition to any significant increases in the minimum wage and his hostility to robust enforcement of wage and hour laws are bad news for women, who make up about two-thirds of minimum-wage workers. Increasing the minimum wage is one important tool for closing the gender wage gap, as women will disproportionately benefit from such an increase, but Puzder stands against it. \nLess well-known is Puzder's role as a leader and strategist in the anti-abortion movement. A self-identified member of the religious right, in the 1980s he was instrumental in the passage of a radical – and unconstitutional – law in Missouri that bestowed legal personhood on embryos from the moment of conception, designed to give the Supreme Court a tool to reverse Roe v. Wade. He has stated he will do whatever he can to make abortion illegal and called the murder of clinic workers inevitable. “The Supreme Court has lifted abortion out of the political debate,” he stated in a 1995 article in the Boston Herald. “Violence has always been politics by other means.” \nAs an attorney, he also defended abortion protesters who were repeatedly arrested for trespassing on clinics; he argued that the criminal trespass law should not be applied to them, because they believed they were preventing a greater crime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:20:51.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
