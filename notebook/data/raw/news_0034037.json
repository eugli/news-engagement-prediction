I have to score 100 goals! The option is already fulfilled. But there’s nothing done yet. From my side. We’ll wait and see. Let’s see what happens.”\nManchester United’s Ibrahimovic says he has made critics ‘eat their balls’ Read more \nAnthony Martial appears to be one of those benefiting from Ibrahimovic’s experience. After enduring a difficult season so far, the 21-year-old marked his return to the starting line-up with a goal and an assist as Watford were beaten 2-0 on Saturday . “He’s not going around with his head down,” Ibrahimovic said of Martial. “He’s positive, training hard and has a lot of energy. Obviously he wants to play.\n“It’s not like we go around to everybody and talk. It’s about the moment, when the situation is there.\n“When we eat breakfast he sits beside me and we talk. Everybody talks to everybody.\n“It’s not like you go to one and try to cheer him up. It’s a good atmosphere, the guys are very professional. Positive vibes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:38:44.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
