(Nathan Denette / THE CANADIAN PRESS) Aleksandra Sagan, The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, February 22, 2017 12:10PM EST Last Updated Wednesday, February 22, 2017 12:22PM EST \nTORONTO -- Hudson's Bay Co. (TSX:HBC) is denying allegations of deceptive pricing practices from Canada's competition watchdog. \nThe Competition Bureau issued a statement Tuesday alleging HBC offered mattresses and foundations sold together at grossly inflated regular prices and then advertised deep discounts on the sleep sets, suggesting significant deals for customers. \nThe bureau says the company has engaged in that practice throughout Canada since at least March 2013. \nHBC disagrees with the bureau's position and will vigorously oppose their application to the Competition Tribunal, company spokeswoman Tiffany Bourre said in a statement. \n\"We believe our mattress pricing process is fair, competitive and in line with industry standards and the Competition Act,\" she said. \nBourre added that the allegations by the bureau are \"considered a reviewable matter... not an accusation that the company has committed an offence.\" \nThe bureau also alleges HBC misled consumers by suggesting it was selling its remaining inventory during clearance and end-of-line promotions, while ordering sleep sets to fulfil each new purchase. \nIt wants HBC to stop these practices and pay an administrative monetary penalty.
