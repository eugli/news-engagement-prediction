He told students at the school that he is 26 credit hours away from his degree, but is motivated and determined to earn it. Especially since it is a goal his mother has always wanted him to accomplish. “I’m taking classes right now. I’m focusing on graduating college. That’s a big accomplishment,” Winston said “I’ve got to get my mama that degree. How many of you are going to get your mama that degree?” \nWinston left college early to pursue his NFL career and has seen a significant amount of success in his first two seasons under center. Instead of being a senior in college this year, the 23-year-old just finished wrapping up a 2016 campaign that resulted in him becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for over 4,000 yards in their first two seasons. He also helped lead the Bucs to a 9-7 record in their first winning season since 2010. However, although Winston has seen a good amount of success on the gridiron, he has made it clear that earning his degree is a priority and something he plans to accomplish very soon. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:31:13.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
