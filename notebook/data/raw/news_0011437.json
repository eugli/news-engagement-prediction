It's just teenagers not listening to their parents and stuff like that,\" he said. \n\"Instead, [they're] going off track and not going back to school. That's the biggest issue back in my hometown. \n\"[We need] more teachers and more staff working at the school, trying to bring the kids back and doing more fun things rather than just sitting in the classroom.\" Education about LGBT issues Photo: Oliver Wood is passionate about LGBT issues. (ABC Heywire: Robert Virtue) \nHe was passionate about eradicating discrimination in regional areas of Australia. \n\"I think discrimination is a big issue and I'm most passionate about discrimination facing young LGBT people,\" he said. \n\"I think that education is really important. We need more education on sexuality and gender in our communities. \n\"My passion has come from my own experiences being LGBT, and also hearing the experiences of my friends and people online who I haven't met.\" \nMr Wood said he hoped to express his views about LGBT issues to prominent politicians when they meet at Parliament House later in the week. \n\"I'm going to take [the message] that we're not big, scary monsters. We're just people and we want to have equal rights,\" he said. \n\"I'm hoping to take away a sense of having done something good for my community and a feeling that things are going to change for the better.\" \nThe 2017 Heywire Regional Youth Summit is, for the first time, incorporating mentor sessions for Heywire Trailblazers — young Australians already affecting change in their communities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:58:09.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
