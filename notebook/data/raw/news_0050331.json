In the just concluded weekend, the Hari directorial flick has been retained in 23 screens across the city and the film had 302 shows screened in the three days of weekend. The shows got 80% of occupancy on an average and the collections in this weekend is estimated to be Rs.89,90,790. The overall collections of the film in Chennai is Rs.4,49,04,870. Despite the good performance in the second weekend, the trade feels that the film still has to go a long way to be profitable for all stakeholders. We hope the third part of the 'Singam' franchise continues its splendid show in the coming weekdays and weekends and emerges as the third blockbuster of the series.
