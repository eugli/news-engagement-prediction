While Perry was in-studio with host Grimmy , she saw the British singer walking past the glass window and called him out for topping the charts and eclipsing her new single, \" Chained to the Rhythm .\" \n\"Oh babes! Hi babes! Thanks for keeping me off the No. 1 spot. Thanks!\" Perry playfully said in an English accent as she flipped him off. \"Oh you're so approachable! Oh, you're everybody's best friend! Oh great!\"   \"artist\", \"id\" : 35141, \"name\" : \"Katy Perry\" } } \nThe two remembered the first time they had ever met, when a sweaty Sheeran wrapped up a show in Toronto and walked off stage where he ran into Perry, who refused to give him a hug. \"I was sweating so bad and then I saw Katy on the side of the stage and I was like, 'Oh God, Katy Perry is here. This is really embarrassing, I'm really sweaty!\" Sheeran said. \"I walked up to her and she was like, 'I would hug you, but ew!'\"   \"artist\", \"id\" : 396790, \"name\" : \"Ed Sheeran\" } } \nPerry added: \" Now that you’re 'Ed Sheeran,' it’s like, put your b**l s**k on me.\" The seven-minute clip also includes other anecdotes about their Grammys losing streak, their Brits performance, and more. \nPerry and Sheeran will reunite at the iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 5, where they will perform alongside Shawn Mendes , Big Sean , and more. The ceremony, hosted by Ryan Seacrest , will broadcast live from the Forum in Inglewood, California starting at 8 p.m. ET on TBS, TNT, and TruTV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:29:38.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
