We've been patting ourselves on the back since the 2015 election for voting in a government that promised to open the doors to refugees and take action on indigenous rights.\nBut now that the time has come to take action on those promises, that bright image is hard to hold onto. The start of 2017 was marred by the revival of the Keystone XL pipeline , tightening restrictions on refugees and the horrific Quebec City mosque shooting by a Canadian white nationalist .\nWhen Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Trump, people were quick to paint them as polar opposites. It's a familiar story . Every selfie Trudeau takes adds to his public image as the progressive answer to a conservative political climate, even though his policy track record is nothing to get excited about.\nD on't let the popularity of Justin Trudeau's telegenic liberal mug distract you — nationalism is on the rise in Canada, and conservative politicians seem to be jumping onboard.\nJustin Trudeau and Donald Trump Source: Alex Wong/Getty Images Canada has seen a remarkable recent expansion of far right nationalism. Rebel Media , an ultra-nationalist news source led by right-wing pundit Ezra Levant, runs stories that harp on \"l iberal elites \" and \" beta male snowflake[s]. \" The outlet drew attention for its incredibly punchable video interview with neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, where he applauded them for \"pushing things in the right direction\" in Canada.\nIn the wake of the Quebec City mosque shooting, the site falsely suggested the shooter was Muslim, claiming the attack was due to a \"bitter rivalry\" between local mosques even after the actual suspect was identified. On Feb. 15, Rebel Media hosted a nationalist \" freedom rally \" condemning a Canadian anti-Islamophobia motion .\nAnd Canada's Conservative Party is paying attention — leaving progressive Canadians fearful the right wing party is creating Canadian versions of Donald Trump. Their anxieties aren't the stuff of typical liberal fretting, either: Four of the party's leadership candidates spoke at Rebel Media 's anti-Islam rally.\nLast year, politician Kellie Leitch made headlines by proposing an undefined, unclear and potentially costly \" Canadian values test\" on all refugees and immigrants . In a recent interview , Leitch described it as a \"common sense policy: having face-to-face interviews with each individual entering Canada, about Canadian values.\" She's also been officially endorsed by two separate white supremacist groups; she officially rebuffed at least one of them , but stood by her statements.\nThe Canadian nationalist shares the race for party leader with Kevin O'Leary , the pro-oil star of Shark Tank who's promised to repeal essentially everything done since the last Conservative government was in power.\nKevin O'Leary Source: Richard Drew/AP Not even the beloved Canadian prime minister is free from blame. In an international climate dominated by right-wing attacks on immigrants and refugees, Trudeau tweeted the following feel-good message:\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\nIt was welcoming, but it was also highly misleading. As kind as Trudeau's words were, the actual policies of the Liberal government tell a different story .\nJust before the beginning of 2017, the government capped private sponsorship applications for Syrian and Iraqi refugees for this year at just 1,000 . That number that was reached within the month . In Quebec — where the mosque shooting took place — the provincial government has suspended private refugee sponsorship indefinitely. In early February, X tra magazine discovered that when the Liberals promised to accept more Syrian refugees, they simultaneously ended their LGBTQ Iranian refugee program.\nAnd while the government was quick to applaud itself for accepting thousands of refugees in 2016, significantly less attention has been devoted to settlement and integration services. As of J une 2016, only around 10% of the budget allotted to those services was actually spent.\nThat means that in some cases, refugees spend over a year with heavily restricted health care coverage, on waiting lists for language classes and with limited economic opportunities. There are no plans to change things any time soon — but the prime minister seems set on winning over the media rather than creating meaningful policy responses.\nJustin Trudeau at the United Nations Source: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trudeau has also spoken strongly in favor of Trump's executive order to resume work on the Keystone XL pipeline. The project will span from the territories of the Cree and Dene nations in Alberta to lands belonging to the Oceti Sakowin peoples in North Dakota. The latter group is also opposing the Dakota Access pipeline, another pipeline Trump revived .\nAs for Trudeau's feel-good media messages, indigenous Canadians are far from impressed. The \" disconnect \" First Nations people see between the Canadian government's middle-of-the-road, camera-friendly messaging and the actual content of its policies is hard to ignore. Trudeau mocking protestors and dodging questions on his broken promises to indigenous communities at a Saskatoon town hall forum on Jan. 25 was a collection of extraordinarily painful moments.\nIn particular, protesters called out the prime minister on his pro-pipeline policies, including Keystone XL. Several First Nations communities have expressed fears over the threats these pipelines pose to the health, territory and status of indigenous rights. But Trudeau seems to be more concerned with shoring up the popular notion of Canadian multiculturalism at the expense of creating and empowering policies to protect minorities in Canada.\nProtesters in Nevada demonstrating against the Keystone XL pipeline Source: Nati Harnik/AP This strategy is telling. The Liberal government seems set on reaching a middle ground with its nationalist opposition, even as it plays progressive for the sake of its public image.\nTrudeau's media-friendly liberalism isn't working out exactly as planned. In late January, the Conservatives narrowed their public opinion gap with the Liberal Party to just six points — two points closer", "external_links": ["http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hate-incidents-up-since-mosque-shooting-montreal-police-1.3264405", "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/01/24/kevin-oleary-conservative-race-poll_n_14361760.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/private-refugee-canada-1.3959329", "http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ezra-levant-the-rebels-unrepentant-commander/", "https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816&quot;", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jan/30/justin-trudeaus-tweets-wont-make-canada-a-refugee-havenbut-popular-pressure-can", "http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/news-and-ideas/news/canada-told-lgbt-iranian-refugees-apply-the-us-trump-happened-214643", "http://www.gettyimages.com/", "http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/warm-hearts-cold-reality/", "https://www.pressprogress.ca/yup_these_4_conservative_leadership_candidates_are_protesting_a_motion_condemning_racism", "http://ap.org/", "https://www.pressprogress.ca/anti_immigrant_white_nationalist_group_endorses_kellie_leitch_for_conservative_party_leader", "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/866363459886/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-saskatoon-1.3952087", "http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2016/12/05/alt-right-in-canada-can-it-happen-here.html", "https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-liberal-motion-is-not-going-to-force-sharia-law-on-canada-duh", "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/keystone-xl-would-destroy-native-lands-we-fight", "https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/12/values-test-for-newcomers-dangerous-immigration-minister-says.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-to-temporarily-suspend-all-new-private-refugee-sponsorship-applications-1.3928227", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/anti-canadian-values-test-leitch-1.3925420", "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/01/31/may-trudeau-refugees-tweet_n_14515254.html", "http://globalnews.ca/news/3219339/kellie-leitch-immigration-screening-canadian-values-quebec-shooting/", "https://news.vice.com/story/hundreds-rally-against-motion-calling-on-canadian-government-to-condemn-islamophobia", "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/sponsors-of-syrian-refugees-are-left-in-limbo/", "https://news.vice.com/story/part-of-canadas-so-called-alt-right-is-endorsing-kellie-leitch", "https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816", "http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/on-cross-country-tour-trudeau-hears-growing-anger-and-frustration-from-indigenous-canadians", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/ishmaeldaro/quebec-shooting-hoaxes-and-bullshit?utm_term=.aokLVQwJ7#.sm5wBZkzR", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kevin-o-leary-trudeau-pivot-trump-1.3953270", "http://poll.forumresearch.com/post/2650/gap-narrows-between-liberals-and-conservatives/", "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/24/trump-to-advance-controversial-keystone-xl-dakota-access-oil-pipelines.html"], "published": "2017-02-26T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:00:08.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
