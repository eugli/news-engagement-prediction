It has a towing capacity of 8,600 pounds. \n“This is what you get, when you take everything great about the Durango and combine it with the performance of the Charger SRT: a 12-second quarter mile, toy-hauling, three-row muscle car,\" says Tim Kuniskis, head of Fiat Chrysler's car brands, in a statement. \nDodge sold more than 68,000 Durango SUVs in 2016 with a lineup that spans nine trim levels ranging in starting price from $29,995 to $42,095. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did not release pricing for the 2018 Durango SRT. \nSRT is a Dodge subbrand that is reserved for performance versions of each model. \nThe SRT version of the Durango comes with a host of special performance features that include: \n•Newly designed SRT hood with cold-air duct and heat extractors to cool the engine and improve overall performance. •Standard eight-speed automatic transmission specially calibrated for the Dodge Durango SRT. •New SRT seven-mode drive system that gives the driver the ability to precisely adjust drive settings to maximize performance or comfort. •New exhaust system tuned to offer a deep, high-performance exhaust note modeled after the Dodge Charger SRT. •New Brembo high-performance brakes. \nIt will begin arriving in dealerships during the fourth quarter of this year.
