His four-point play on the coat-tails of Kevin White’s back-to-back triples allowed the Hawks to control the early stages. \nAnthony Drmic’s three-pointer on the quarter-time buzzer shaved Illawarra’s advantage to 27-24 before Randle, who accused the Hawks of playing “dirty” basketball in the lead-up to the game, led a commanding second term for Adelaide.

Source: Getty Images \nNathan Sobey’s spectacular block of Nick Kay’s dunk attempt was the highlight of a lopsided second period, at the end of which the 36ers transformed their three- point quarter-time deficit into a 10-point halftime lead. \nAdelaide extended its advantage to 64-47 midway through the third after a Matt Hodgson power slam and Mitch Creek’s steal and breakaway dunk. Illawarra pulled the gap back to 73-65 at three-quarter-time but the Hawks, with Coenraad, Marvelle Harris and Rhys Martin all fouling out, were unable to maintain the fightback.
