Do you go, ‘Be the ball, there is no ball’?”\n“He’s a big meditator, Coach Belichick,” Edelman joked.\n“We do a lot of that,” Belichick replied, grabbing Edelman’s hand.\n“That’s the first time he’s ever touched me, by the way,” Edelman riffed.\nFallon then joked about Belichick’s famous scowl .\n“When do you put it on?” Fallon asked Belichick. “Is it the drive to the stadium? When do you get serious?”\n“Look, football’s 24-7,” Belichick said. “The switch doesn’t flip on at 1 o’clock Sunday afternoon or whenever the game is. Every time we’re working on football, it’s serious. And we’re trying to get better. That’s every day.”\nWhen Fallon asked Edelman about his amazing fourth quarter catch , the receiver found a way to critique himself.\n“After it all happened, I was kind of disappointed in my route, I’m not going to lie,” Edelman said. “I should have stuck it a little harder.”\nEdelman also told Fallon that he thought the catch was “70 percent luck” and “30 percent skill,” and that he was screaming at Brady to rush everyone to the line to run a play so the Falcons couldn’t challenge it.\nFallon asked Edelman if the win had really sunk in yet, and the receiver said he needed to get back to Boston to really start enjoying the win.\n“You know, you do all the media stuff, and you have to do obligations for the team,” Edelman said. “Once you get to get back and go to Boston and get towards that parade, have a couple of cold ones with the boys, that’s when it starts to become the real thing.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-5lOHt4c5Y?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:54:32.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
