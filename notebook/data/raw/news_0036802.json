Your hand should look a bit like a spider on its back, curling up its legs — that's your proximal interphalangeal joints (PIJs) bending. \nLet your hand splay out again. This time, curl just your pointer finger and let it uncurl. Now do your ring finger. \nWhat do you think is going on here? If you had to guess, where would you say the muscle involved is? \nHaving never taken a medical anatomy course, I'd always assumed it was located entirely in the finger itself, just like the main muscles for flexing your elbow live in your upper arm. \nTurns out, this intuition is wrong. The main muscle for flexing your PIJs actually runs all the way up your arm. Called the flexor digitorum superficialis, it bends your fingers by contracting and bending them back toward itself. \nThis video (of unknown origin) which we saw Tweeted by the account How Things Work, illustrates the effect using a cadaver limb: \nThis is how you flex your fingers pic.twitter.com/BACT0bub5q — How Things Work (@ThingsWork) February 16, 2017 \nI can't stop staring at it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:28:51.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
