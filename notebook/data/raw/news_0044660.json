Dividends will now resume for the 2017 financial year. \nAnglo will continue to look at ways of divesting its coal assets in South Africa - its historic home, which has been beset by upheaval in the mining industry - but Mr Cutifani warned that even here, the miner may retreat on its plans. \"The retention of these assets remains a viable position given our recent operational and other improvements,\" he said. \nMr Cutifani has said repeatedly that Anglo's future lies with the commodities in which it has a world-class presence - such as diamonds, through its De Beers subsidiary; platinum, used in catalytic converters; and copper, which is used in electronics and housebuilding. \nBut the unexpected recovery in the price of coal and iron, used in steelmaking, put the lie to this plan; Anglo's underlying earnings from these two commodities last year exceeded what it made from diamonds, platinum and copper put together.
