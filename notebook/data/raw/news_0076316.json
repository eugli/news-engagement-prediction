The modus operandi was simple – convert bumiputra housing lots to non-bumiputra lots, which can fetch much higher prices. \nAnti-graft officers uncovered the plot after sifting through stacks of documents seized from the state government and the developers, who were implicated recently. \nHundreds of houses were conver­ted this way, with one of the six suspects rounded up in a swoop on Friday said to be the “chief broker”. \nWe will gather more information and raid more areas,’’ he said, adding that more suspects were expected to be nabbed. \nWe found that many of these bumiputra lots were kept using the names of (developers’) workers under the quota system. \nBut in due time, their status would be converted to non-bumiputra lots, the reason given being that there were no interested buyers,” said a source. \nOnce 50% of the township is constructed, developers can write to the state secretariat for housing, asking for a release when there are no takers for the houses. \nBut the developers must first pay about 7.5% of the initial 15% discount as premium to the state government,” said an insider. \nThere are loopholes in the system. Developers who are not willing to give in will have to wait for a long time to get a release,” said another insider.
