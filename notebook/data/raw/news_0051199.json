The former first daughter, who is interning for the Weinstein Company, was seen partying in the VIP section of Up&Down Friday. “She arrived with heavy security, and stayed till about 2 a.m.,” says a spy. Another source adds, “She was just drinking Red Bull.” The young Obama, 18, has also been spotted at Soho bar the Black Lodge, attending the HBO “Girls” premiere and hitting a Fashion Week afterparty with J.Crew’s Jenna Lyons at Happy Ending. She also recently spent time with the high society crowd in Aspen, Colo. \nSup girl?! Malia Obama is hitting the motherfucking bars. Who would’ve thought the President’s daughter would be slappin’ titties at bars right in our backyard? I never really thought I would have something in common with Malia Obama. She is the beautiful daughter of a former President from Chicago and I am an extremely large Artie Lange-looking college student from New York. Yet, we’ve found common ground- neither of our parents conceived our asses before February 22nd 1996 so we’re just two kids trying to get low key drunk. I really hope I get to see her out one night because I think we’d make a pretty decent power couple. The young and hungry kids of New York, Glennalia. \nI would love to know if Malia is a fake ID girl or not. Do you even need one if you’re a first daughter? I would assume not since her father is a few weeks removed from being able to theoretically hit a button and blow up the Earth, but it’s still a fun thought to process. If she has any brains on her I’d hope she goes with finding someone’s real NY ID that looks like her as opposed to a fake Chicago ID that’s her picture. Fake ID 101. \nI’ve sadly never been to any of those 3 places mentioned in that article. That Black Lodge place scared me a bit in particular. That logo below does nothing but add on to the illuminati theory. I’ve seen that eye on top of the key one too many times before. I may test the waters at Up&Down now that Malia’s been there, but hard pass on the Black Lodge after seeing that. Trying to stay pure. But if Malia slides into my DMs, I wouldn’t be mad about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:42:54.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
