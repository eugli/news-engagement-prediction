T.S. also alleges that administrators did not report the sexual assault to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, as required. \nHazelwood Superintendent Nettie Collins-Hart, former interim Superintendent Ingrid Clark-Jackson, former Hazelwood Central High Principal Audrey Lee and six other Hazelwood administrators and employees were named as defendants in the lawsuit. \nThe district could not be immediately reached for comment. \nT.S. said her daughter, identified in the suit as Jane Doe, was walking back to class from the bathroom one day in December 2015 at Hazelwood Central. \nA male student harassed her, grabbed her, then pulled her into a stairwell and sexually assaulted her, T.S. alleges. \nConsumed with fear from the incident, Jane didn't report the assault to school administration until March 2016, the lawsuit states. After she did, the lawsuit claims administrators conducted an investigation and confirmed the assault. They suspended the student but let him return to school after three days, according to the lawsuit. \nBecause Jane was forced to see and interact with her alleged attacker at school, the lawsuit says administrators failed to ensure equal access to education and protect their student. \nThe lawsuit alleges Jane has suffered from fear, anxiety and trauma as a result of the assault and the continued exposure to her attacker. \n\"The actions and conduct set forth herein was outrageous and showed evil motive, reckless indifference, and/or conscious disregard,\" the lawsuit states. 3 O'clock Stir e-newsletter 3 O'clock Stir from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nShake off your afternoon slump with the offbeat or overlooked news of the day.
