Its deployment against Iranian-backed rebels comes amid escalating tension with Tehran\nWhile U.S. military vessels have carried out routine operations in the region in the past, this movement, first reported by Reuters, is part of an increased presence there aimed at protecting shipping from the Houthis, the officials said.\nThe Houthis are allied to Iran, which is at odds with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The country recently test launched a ballistic missile.\nTrump said on Thursday 'nothing is off the table' in dealing with Iran, a day after his national security adviser, Michael Flynn said he was putting Iran 'on notice.'\nThe officials said the decision to move the USS Cole was made before the most recent comments.\nEarlier this week, the armed Houthi movement attacked a Saudi warship off the western coast of Yemen, causing an explosion that killed two crew members.\nAttack: The Saudi warship lost two sailors as it was attacked by the Houthi rebels in a suicide mission\nIranian support: The Houthis are Shi'ite Muslims who are supported in their rebellion by the regime in Tehran. They are fighting against the Saudi Arabian-backed Sunni government\nThat incident was part of an escalation in combat on Yemen's western coast between the militia and the coalition backing the country's internationally recognized government.\nLast October, the U.S. military launched cruise missile strikes to knock out three coastal radars located in areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi forces, retaliating after failed missile attacks on another U.S. destroyer, the USS Mason.\nTensions with Iran increased further on Friday when the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on 13 people and 12 entities under U.S. Iran sanctions authority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:47:30.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
