But there are a few crucial issues that must be considered before they make a decision. \nSyariah law will make Malaysia ‘regressive’, contribute further to the dipping ringgit, increase political instability and ensure the flight of foreign direct investment to neighbouring countries. \nThe ringgit has dipped to its lowest since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. And we can’t afford a continued weakening of the currency. \nThe Malaysian poor are struggling to make ends meets, caught in the rising cost of living. They have been further burdened by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) while the economy takes a hit because of falling commodity and decreasing exports. \nAnd it’s not like Malaysia doesn’t have its share of issues that need the urgent attention of both state and federal governments. \nPeople get shot dead in public, the latest being the gruesome murder of a transgender person, Shameera Krishnan. \nWe have been trying to get an independent oversight body to monitor death in police custody. \nKelantan and Terengganu are still waiting for concrete action plans to mitigate yearly floods that sweep away homes. Malaysia had the worst floods in 2015, with 21 deaths and 200,000 losing their homes. \nPeople in Kelantan and Terengganu again lost their homes in massive floods on the eve of 2017. Kelantan was badly hit in 2015 as well. \nCapitalising on a weak federal gov’t? \nSo PAS’ child-like adamance makes no sense to me. Unless of course it’s capitalising on a weak federal government that won’t hesitate to pull all stops to ensure victory at the next polls despite PAS’ version of Islamic penal laws in Kelantan going against the Federal Constitution, the country’s supreme law that protects the rights of every Malaysian and against the duality of sentencing. \nHadi’s hudud bill also enhances the power of the Syariah courts in penalising offenders, makes provisions for the chopping off of limbs for theft and may discriminate against the poor and women. \nPAS itself has quite a bit of work to do actually, such as coming up with a plan to mitigate floods, do proper reconstruction exercises following the floods, protect the rights of the Orang Asli with regard to their land and address unemployment and poverty issues in the state of Kelantan. \nAll is not lost yet. We can be responsible and reject Hadi’s bill because it won’t contribute positively to the country, economy or the society. \nOr we can hold on to greed for power and forsake the country and its people. But that won’t be surprising, would it? \nCHARLES SANTIAGO is the Member of Parliament for Klang. \nThe views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:03:25.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
