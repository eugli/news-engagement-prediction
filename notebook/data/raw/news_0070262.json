We are billions of people across the planet fighting in larger, more technical ways about the same things we were squabbling about in the Pleistocene: who gets the most stuff, who has the most status, who's sleeping with the cute guy or girl. Now we're doing it on the scale of nation states and multinational corporations, but at heart the game remains the same. \nAnd it will, until it doesn't. \nThere are a few things that could shock the human race out of its habits. The one we're most ready for, the one we can hope for, is what we've been dreaming of and dreading for centuries now: alien life. \nFor as long as there has been literature, there have been stories that imagine life in the universe besides our own. Since Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, the modern imagination has looked toward the stars and planets for trees of life besides our own, and dreamed about what we could find there and what if would mean for us. \nThe identification of seven Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone around TRAPPIST-1 gets us one step closer to that. It isn't much more — finding an exoplanet with a high oxygen atmosphere or with radio wave traffic similar to our own — to push the possibility that Earth isn't alone into a probability. And, more importantly, a place we can aspire to reach. \nWhen humanity first stepped into space in the late 1960s, it was a heroic effort done with a technology that was barely there. Most people in the U.S.A. are walking around today with more computing power in their pockets than took Neil Armstrong to the moon. The research and development that the moon landings required shaped the technological world we live in now. Digital cameras, CAT scans, water filters, home insulation, GPS, smoke detectors and memory foam all spun off from research for the space race. \nIf there is other life around distant stars, the obstacles to learning about it would dwarf every other project humanity has every taken on. The distance between the stars is vast beyond human comprehension. The conditions in interstellar space are still unexplored. The astronomical tools that let us identify and understand exoplanets are still in their infancy. The technologies that might bring us across that immense void — generation ships, suspended animation, warp drives — don't exist. Yet. \nLike the building of medieval cathedrals where the generation that laid the foundations would not live to see the final bricks laid in place. Developing those tools would be the work of lifetimes. The technical experience and discoveries that would spin off from the research could transform human existence many times over before we were ready to attempt the journey. \nKnowing that something was waiting on the other side of the vacuum could be the goal that let us reach beyond our playground politics to something immensely larger. \nWhat humanity — and all life in our one, fragile ecosphere — means when we see it in the context of a larger, better understood universe is probably beyond your imagination and mine at this point in history. The answers it would give and the questions that would rise from it wouldn't become clear in your lifetime or mine. \nThe science being done right now has let up peep through a keyhole. What we've seen is promising and fascinating. Just that should give us a better sense of our place in the cosmos. As we get better at looking out, the chances seem very good that we'll find that planet or planet that promises more. \nIf we let ourselves be tempted out to the stars, it will be the working out of a dream humans have had since before we were human. Even if we fail, the effort will teach our children and grandchildren things about themselves and the universe they live in that you and I don't even know how to ask yet. It will give humanity an opportunity to invest in the best parts of itself, to grow and learn and reach for something beyond its grasp. \nAnd all it will take is a little more knowledge than we have right now. One more step to let us see that there's something really, really interesting going on out there, if we can just get to it. \nNothing kills boredom like having a goal. \nAbraham writes science fiction under his own name and pseudonymously, including the co-authored series \"The Expanse,\" which is the basis for the Syfy series of the same name.
