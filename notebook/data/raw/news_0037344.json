We caught up with the 73-year-old recently at Cleveland, Ohio’s Hard Rock Rocksino, Northfield Park, where she showed and proved that not only has she earned the title of diva, but she is one of the boldest, brightest and baddest divas there ever was! \nThe term “diva” has been frequently used to describe LaBelle’s stature and success as a world-renowned singer whose vocal prowess defies reason and places her in a coveted category that many singers strive to achieve membership to, but ultimately fail. On the title of diva, LaBelle shares, “So many people, they record and then they’re out for three months and then they’re called a diva. I don’t care about titles. When you call me a diva sometimes I don’t want to accept it, but I know I am a diva, and there are a lot of young people trying to claim that title, but they’re not worthy.” \nPatti LaBelle, affectionately known as Ms. Patti, proved just why she has earned the title of diva, one which she hesitantly accepts, this past weekend when she entered onto the Hard Rock Rocksino stage in a shimmery gold two-piece ensemble and stylish ultra chic bob with bangs hairdo. Looking every bit the diva and with bedazzled mic in hand, Ms. Patti proceeded to dazzle the audience for 90 minutes with some of her classics, including “If Only You Knew,” “If You Ask Me To,” “New Attitude,” “Lady Marmalade,” “Somebody Love You” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” With magical performances like this Hard Rock Rocksino live concert and her appearance last December on VH1 Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night , it’s almost easy to forget that in additional to being a phenomenal vocalist, Ms. Patti has established herself as a seasoned actress as well. \nMs. Patti gracefully and stylishly from one song to the next, pausing only to make a request, which was, “Can you turn the fan on? Ms. Patti’s hot,” and to make a declaration, “I’ve been singing for 53 years, and I’m 73 years young!” As LaBelle kicked off her shoes, dropped the mic and floored the mic stand in dramatic display, old but true adages like and “age ain’t nothing but a number” and “age is like fine wine… it gets better with time!” came to mind. Ms. Patti closed out her hour and a half-long show with a moving performance of “You Are My Friend,” which she sang in tribute to some of our favorite artists and her dearest friends like Whitney Houston , David Bowie , Michael Jackson , Prince , Rick James and George Michael , reminding us all that tomorrow is not promised to anyone, so we should all release our inner diva every once in awhile and live our lives like it’s golden. \nIn addition to her tour Ms. Patti is completing work on a new jazz album, as yet untitled, which she plans to release this May and will feature covers by Frank Sinatra , Nina Simone , and more. The seasoned entertainer also shared with us that she’s always interested in acting, and if the right part comes along she’s always going to say yes. With her acting gigs, line of food products, tour dates and album projects filling up her calendar, Ms. Patti makes 73 look like the new 50, all fly and fierce and focused on shining bright for the world to see. We see you Ms. Patti! \nFor more on Patti LaBelle, her current tour and her upcoming album, visit www.pattilabelle.com . \nPatti LaBelle was snatching wigs for the Holidays with this fierce performance at VH1 Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:15:32.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
