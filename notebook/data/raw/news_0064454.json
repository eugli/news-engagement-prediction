Half of the one hour will be spent outdoors, under a new framework by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). Pre-school teachers will be given educational resources on conducting outdoor lessons. \nStudents in mainstream schools already had their time for Physical Education (PE) classes increased as announced in 2010. They will now get more opportunities to be involved in \"unstructured play beyond the formal curriculum time.\" During recess time or after-school hours, schools will make available facilities and sports equipment, said the joint release. \nIn addition, the Health Promotion Board's (HPB) healthier meals programme will be stepped up not only in pre-schools but also schools at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. \nBy this year, the Healthier Meals in Schools Programme will be rolled out to all mainstream schools, where canteens will provide healthier food and drink options. A total of 319 of the 359 primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges are already on the programme. And the plan is for canteens in all institutes of higher learning to serve healthier meals by 2019, said MOE and MOH. \nSUPPORTING MENTAL WELL-BEING \nThere is also an emphasis on students' mental well-being, to help them manage stress and seek help from their peers if needed. \n\"The taskforce recognises that students experiencing mental stress may not always approach their parents or teachers for help,\" said the joint release, so peer support structures will be set up in mainstream schools and institutes of higher learning, \"to equip students to look out for signs of mental stress among their peers.\" \nAn inter-agency research workgroup to study suicides, suicidal and self-harm behaviours in children and youths will also be set-up. The workgroup, led by Associate Professor Daniel Fung from the Institute of Mental Health, will provide an interim report at the end of a year. \nThe Tote Board has also set aside up to S$10 million to look at ideas from the community on how to achieve better mental well-being and resilience in the young. It will also fund the Institute of Mental Health to support the training of service providers such as voluntary welfare organisations to collect and evaluate data for research purposes. \nThe NutureSG taskforce submitted the recommendations earlier this month and they have been accepted by MOH and MOE. - CNA/gs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:15:39.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
