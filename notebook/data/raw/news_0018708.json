And thus, throughout the journey, a dedicated community of space exploration enthusiasts has ridden along, sharing and discussing Cassini's images, often processing them to create their own spectacular scenes. \n\"We're so gratified that Cassini's images have inspired people to work with the pictures themselves to produce such beautiful creations,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"It's been truly wonderful for us to feel the love for Cassini from the public. The feeling from those of us on the mission is mutual. \nCassini Inspires \nTo celebrate the many ways Cassini's exploration of Saturn has sparked curiosity and wonder, the mission is launching a campaign planned to continue through the mission's dramatic conclusion in September. \nThe activity, called \"Cassini Inspires\" invites members of the public to share their original Saturn-inspired artistic creations in a variety of different media (including painting, music, poetry, fiction, video or any format that can be shared online). To participate, artists post their creations on the social media platform of their choice, and tag them #CassiniInspires.

Cassini has made numerous dramatic discoveries, including a global ocean with indications of hydrothermal activity within the moon Enceladus, and liquid methane seas on another moon, Titan. \nThe mission is in its penultimate phase, performing weekly ring-grazing dives just past the outer edge of Saturn's main rings. In April, the spacecraft will begin its Grand Finale, plunging through the gap between the rings and the planet itself, leading up to a fateful plunge into Saturn on September 15. \nThe Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. JPL designed, developed and assembled the Cassini orbiter. \nMore information about Cassini:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:46:17.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
