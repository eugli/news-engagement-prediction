The charges stem from incidents involving two adult female customers. Court records do not identify the business but give its address as 200 South Kirkwood Road. \nOne of the alleged crimes happened last Dec. 19, the other on Tuesday. The charges are misdemeanors. \nThe charges allege that Deal \"solicited\" the women to \"engage in sexual conduct under circumstances in which he knew that such solicitation was likely to cause affront or alarm.\" \nSt. Louis County prosecutors filed the charges Friday, and a judge set bail at $2,000. The level of misdemeanor Deal is charged with is punishable in Missouri by up to 15 days in jail and a $300 fine. \nAccording to court records, Deal was giving a woman a massage when he moved his hands toward her underwear line, asking \"Is this OK?\" At first she indicated it was alright, because she thought it was part of the massage, police say. But she soon realized it was a sexual advance and said \"no.\" Something similar happened to the second woman, who told police she was shocked and afraid. \nDeal lives in the 1200 block of Covington Manor Lane in unincorporated St. Louis County. Police say he admitted to the sexual contact. \nPolice are asking anyone who has a similar complaint against Deal to contact Det. Jennifer Burton at 314-984-6902 or the Kirkwood Police Department at 314-822-5858.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:40:56.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
