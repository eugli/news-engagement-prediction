I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal,\" he told The Sun . \n\"I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials. \nREAD MORE: * Footballer defends fakery \n\"I thought 'what is happening here?'. They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. \n\"I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight.\" \nThe Iranian stamp in Yorke's passport related to him playing in a charity match in Tehran, in 2015. \nThat charity match in Tehran featured Yorke on a World Stars team that also included Luis Figo, Roberto Carlos, Fabio Cannavaro, Marcel Desailly and Edgar Davids. \nYorke was told by officials that if he boarded the flight from Qatar to Miami, he would be sent back to Qatar from the US. Ad Feedback \n\"I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.\" \nUS President Donald Trump had issued an executive order banning travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, from entering the US for 90 days. \nThe ban has since been suspended in a series of court rulings for constitutional reasons but Yorke still claims to have been prevented from entering the country. - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:45:54.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
