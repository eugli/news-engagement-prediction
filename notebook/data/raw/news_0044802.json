and the article 50 starting whistle is due to sound towards the end of March. In the Brexit match, tactics, teamwork and squad selection will eventually determine whether Team GB crashes ignominiously out of Europe – with the manner of departure dictated by Team EU – or leaves the pitch, head held high, on its own terms\nMonday 20 February 2017 07.00 GMT Last modified on Monday 20 February 2017 07.03 GMT \nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Dan Roberts , Jon Henley and Jennifer Rankin \nMonday 20 February 2017 07.00 GMT Last modified on Monday 20 February 2017 07.03 GMT \nKickoff 15 March? Venue Brussels Attendance 510 million Team GB: playing in red, white and blue. 4-4-2 formation.\nTeam EU: playing in blue and gold. 4-2-3-1 formation.\nManagers May\nTheresa May Job UK prime minister Position Manager The British prime minister has inherited a more divided squad than many realise and will need to field a team that balances the aggressive instincts of hardline Brexiters with those on her side who favour a more collaborative style of play . Morale also depends on maintaining the illusion that this is an equally matched contest rather than one where the venue, referee and rules are all determined by her opponents.\nMerkel\nAngela Merkel Job German chancellor Position Manager The 2015 refugee crisis may have left her exposed in domestic competition, but the German chancellor is still Europe’s most formidable coach. More of a cautious and methodical tactician than a bold, decisive leader and strategist, she will keep her team – which has its off-field problems – focused, moving forward and above all unified for this, a potentially crucial match for its future.\nGoalkeepers Hammond\nPhilip Hammond Job Chancellor Position Goalkeeper The most important defensive role is that of chancellor Philip Hammond, whose job it is to prevent own goals at the expense of the British economy. Inside cabinet, he revels in his role as chief Eeyore, demanding that colleagues calculate the net present value of their more far-flung claims of future trade benefits. But he has also shown growing resistance to continental attacks , recently warning Britain could reinvent itself as a tax haven if the other side play too rough.\nVerhofstadt\nGuy Verhofstadt Job MEP Position Goalkeeper The European parliament’s ebullient Brexit pointman, a former Belgian PM and archetypal European federalist, fully expects to play his part in the match and could kick up if he feels sidelined. In the final stages, though, he will be crucial: MEPs must ratify whatever Brexit deal emerges, and if – as is perfectly possible – they are not happy, they could veto it. Could well be a gamechanger .\nDefenders Hill\nFiona Hill Job Downing Street chief of staff Position Centre back In the centre are May’s two enforcers , joint chiefs of staff Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. Nicky Morgan was barred from Downing Street by Hill merely for criticising May’s expensive leather trousers. A wider rebellion among EU-leaning Tories has so far been kept in check by one of the most disciplined gatekeepers in Downing Street history.\nTimothy\nNick Timothy Job Downing Street chief of staff Position Centre back Like Fiona Hill, Nick Timothy has a fearsome reputation for squashing dissent in government and limited tolerance for whining among City financiers. He is also seen as helping the prime minister focus on the populist mood in the country that she needs to satisfy regardless of what is or is not agreed in Brussels.\nWilliamson\nGavin Williamson Job Tory chief whip Position Full back More serious internal threats such as backbench critic Anna Soubry will be dealt with by Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson. Rebels were kept in check during the Brexit bill’s passage through the Commons, but there is still potential for trouble in the Lords.\nMcLoughlin\nJimmy McLoughlin Job Head of Downing Street business liaison Position Full back Dealing with anxiety outside the party falls to Jimmy McLoughlin, head of Downing Street business liaison and son of Tory party chairman Patrick McLoughlin. He was hired from the Institute of Directors to sell Brexit to nervous industrialists. Lobbyists report he has become a key gatekeeper for a prime minister who doesn’t like to hear bad news.\nMuscat\nJoseph Muscat Job Maltese PM Position Defender The genial Maltese prime minister, whose country will hold the EU’s six-month rotating presidency when article 50 is likely to be triggered, studied in the UK and has said he wants to act as an “honest broker” in the talks. But he, too, will hold the EU line : Brexit “has to be a fair deal but an inferior deal” for Britain, he says – and the EU is “absolutely not bluffing” on free movement. The presidency will move to Estonia, Bulgaria, Austria and Romania as talks proceed.\nCorsepius\nUwe Corsepius Job Adviser to Angela Merkel Position Defender Officially, Uwe Corsepius is European affairs adviser to the German chancellor. Unofficially, he has been described as Merkel’s “blunt instrument” due to his no-nonsense way of getting things done. In a previous job as chief economic adviser, he showed himself to be a ferocious defender of Germany’s interests, resisting repeated calls for bailouts for Greece. He will be a hard man to beat .\nWeyand\nSabine Weyand Job Deputy chief negotiator Position Defender Second in command to Michel Barnier on the commission’s Brexit taskforce, Germany’s Sabine Weyand will be a key fixer in the nuts and bolts section of Brexit and a crucial playmaker for the EU side. A recognised trade expert, who studied English literature at Cambridge University, Weyand also describes herself as an “avid reader, news junkie and foodie”.\nSelmayr\nMartin Selmayr Job Chief of staff Position Defender Martin Selmayr is the most powerful man in Brussels you have never heard of. A workaholic German lawyer, he is the chief of staff – some would say enforcer – of the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Admired for his awesome brainpower but accused of hoarding power, Selmayr brooks no resistance and is adamant the bloc must shield itself from any Brexit fallout.\nMidfielders Barrow\nTim Barrow Job Ambassador to the EU Position Central midfield Supporting the politicians in the negotiations is a clutch of ambitious civil servants whose job is to provide link up play but who may not necessarily pass well to each other . The lead interlocutor, Sir Tim Barrow, was a late addition to the squad after his predecessor, Sir Ivan Rogers, quit as the UK’s permanent EU representative in Brussels. He will need all his foreign office charm to repair relations with Whitehall.\nRobbins\nOliver Robbins Job Permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU Position Right wing Playing on the right is Olly Robbins, the ambitious young permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU. He is said to have “vigorously opposed” the appointment of fellow midfielder Tim Barrow, believing his role as the prime minister’s sherpa in European council negotiations should give him primacy. May will be hoping this is a creative tension .\nRomeo\nAntonia Romeo Job Permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade Position Central midfield Another fast-rising star is Antonia Romeo, who was the first woman to serve as Britain’s consul general in New York but is now being rushed back to work with Liam Fox on striking overseas trade deals. Famed for cutting a dash in Manhattan in snakeskin Louboutins, her job is to prove Team GB still has international flair.\nCarney\nMark Carney Job Governor of the Bank of England Position Left wing Another glamorous international winger is Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who finds himself in an unusual position to the left of the hardline Brexiters, but who has also gone on the attack by warning that Europe risks financial instability if it cuts off the City.\nBettel\nXavier Bettel Job Luxembourg PM Position Defensive midfield A lawyer by training and a former TV talkshow host, Luxembourg’s prime minister has a sharp wit and a sharper tongue (“Before, the British were in and they had many opt-outs; now they want to be out, with many opt-ins”). The first European leader to marry a partner of the same sex, he is also a determined defender of principles – and a strong believer in those of the EU: “Either you’re a member, or you’re not,” he said last monthsaid.\nHübner\nDanuta Hübner Job MEP Position Defensive midfield When she was Poland’s Europe minister, Danuta Hübner helped bring her country into the EU. Now head of the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, she looks on with regret as the UK prepares to leave. But business is business: her committee will vet a post-Brexit free-trade deal with the UK and Hübner will play a critical defensive role in ensuring the EU’s interests are protected.\nHollande\nFrançois Hollande Job French president Position Attacking midfield The embattled French president has suffered a slump in home form (and will be substituted soon after kickoff) but remains a key player in Europe, where France has been the fiercest opponent of the UK’s “have a cake and eat it” ambitions. “There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price” for Brexit, Hollande said in October. Will go in hard, perhaps dirty: France sees opportunity here.\nTusk\nDonald Tusk Job European council president Position Attacking midfield A combative captain , the EU council president has long been the first name his manager puts on the team sheet: Merkel has appreciated Tusk’s often assertive leadership style since he was prime minister of Poland. He has certainly proved effective at the pre-match mind games, infuriating opponents with phrases such as “The only real alternative to a hard Brexit is no Brexit” and “Your argument has nothing to do with reality”.\nSzydło\nBeata Szydło Job Polish PM Position Attacking midfield The energetic, no-nonsense Polish prime minister – a miner’s daughter – will play fair but firm . Poland hopes to oil the Brexit wheels by being Britain’s friend in the EU: wary of Russia, it wants the UK to stay involved in European defence, and it also sees Brexit as a useful means to a less Brussels-centric bloc. But friendship has a price: the Szydło government has said it could veto any deal that does not protect the rights of the 850,000-odd Poles in Britain.\nForwards Davis\nDavid Davis Job Secretary for exiting the EU Position Centre forward In choosing a politician as her lead negotiator, May has opted for an attacking lineup . But the Brexit secretary only has the support of some 330 civil servants at his new Whitehall department, compared with thousands of EU specialists on offer to his Brussels “sparring partner” Michel Barnier. “We are not going into this negotiation as supplicants; we are going as equal partners,” insists Davis.\nFox\nLiam Fox Job Secretary for international trade Position Striker The maverick international trade secretary aims to score by making unpredictable runs and striking deals with trade partners outside the EU as well as carving out a new free trade deal with the bloc. Rather than grinding down the solid continental defence, Fox hopes to run rings around them with a style of play that can be infuriatingly unconventional but aims to prove Team GB has more to gain outside the EU than it has to lose from leaving it.\nBarnier\nMichel Barnier Job Lead negotiator Position Forward The EU’s senior Brexit broker, a silver-haired former French cabinet minister and commissioner, was “the most dangerous man in Britain” when – as the EU’s finance tsar from 2010-14 – he hit the City with a raft of tough post-crisis financial regulations. Barnier may be smooth but he is serious, thorough, and a complete Europhile. He is also a Savoyard, so does not easily give up .\nSubstitutes Johnson\nBoris Johnson Job Foreign secretary Position Substitute Surprisingly on the sidelines for now is the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, whose propensity for undiplomatic language makes him vulnerable to picking up red cards . But he could be brought on later in the game if some attacking flair is needed up front.\nFarage\nNigel Farage Job MEP Position Substitute Another bruiser to bring on if things turn nasty is former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose capacity for making the other side see red should not be underestimated.\nLeadsom\nAndrea Leadsom Job Environment secretary Position Substitute Fellow Eurosceptic, and May’s leadership challenger, Andrea Leadsom could see a return to action when things turn agricultural in the second half. As secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs she is likely to play a growing role when it comes to the nitty gritty of farm tariffs and subsidies.\nCarswell\nDouglas Carswell Job MP Position Substitute Other spiritual leaders of Brexit, such as Douglas Carswell, should not be forgotten either. Best kept on the bench while May hopes to play by the rules with the EU27, the ideologue may be needed to boost morale if she has to throw out the pre-game tactics and opt for disorderly Brexit instead.\nFillon\nFrançois Fillon Job Presidential candidate Position Substitute Francois Fillon, France’s probable next president, is an Anglophile (his wife is Welsh) and also a self-confessed Thatcherite but also a Gaullist who will defend French and EU interests and is unlikely to do the UK any favours.\nMacron\nEmmanuel Macron Job Presidential candidate Position Substitute Macron is passionately pro-European and has said he will be “tough” on Brexit because the top priority is “to protect the EU”.\nJuncker\nJean-Claude Juncker Job EU commission president Position Substitute Jean-Claude Juncker is the ultimate backroom fixer: he ran Luxembourg for almost 20 years, helped create the euro and was appointed European commission president in 2014.\nSeeuws\nDidier Seeuws Job Head of EU Brexit taskforce Position Substitute Veteran Belgian diplomat Didier Seeuws is a master of the compromise and will be one of Tusk’s right-hand men in Brexit talks.\nSchäuble\nWolfgang Schäuble Job German finance minister Position Substitute Germany’s tough, ultra-experienced and often acerbic finance minister, will be a dogged defender of EU interests with zero sympathy for opposing players, such as Boris Johnson, who don’t know the rules.\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Dan Roberts , Jon Henley and Jennifer Rankin \nMonday 20 February 2017 07.00 GMT Last modified on Monday 20 February 2017 07.03 GMT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:04:31.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
