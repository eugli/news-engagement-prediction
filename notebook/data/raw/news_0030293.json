In March last year, J-Lo sat in the passenger seat as the pair belted out lines from her hits Love Don't Cost a Thing, Booty and Jenny from the Block - and at one point Corden gets hold of her phone and sends a joke text to Leonardo DiCaprio. \nJoining her for the Grammys segment were John Legend, Faith Hill, Keith Urban and Neil Diamond. The chosen song was Diamond's Sweet Caroline, though Hill and Legend didn't seem too sure of the lyrics. \nStealing the show at the end was Beyonce's daughter Blue Ivy. Wearing a pink suit in a tribute to Prince, the five-year-old ran over to join in and arguably saved the day. Blue Ivy just saved that Carpool bit. #GRAMMYs — Katelyn Tarver (@katelyntarver) February 13, 2017 Still not over Blue Ivy's act of charity tonight in rescuing Carpool Karaoke. #GRAMMYs — Elaine L.
