While PM Modi’s last episode focused on students and the pressure of board examinations, this time he talked about a variety of topics ranging from women empowerment to digital economy, with a special emphasis on ISRO’s historic moment of sending 104 satellites in space. He praised the Indian scientists for the huge achievement and said that this move will help Indians a lot, especially the farmers. “After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to Mars, recently ISRO achieved a world record in the arena of space. India created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go. Particularly, for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful. It is a proud moment that this team was led by youngsters and women,” PM Modi added.
