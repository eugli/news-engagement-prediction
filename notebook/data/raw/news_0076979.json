IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh A + A - A still from Moonlight \nThe 89th Annual Academy Awards had its 'oops' moment when the Oscar for the Best Picture was read out wrong. La La Land was first announced as the winner and the La La Land team including Damien Chazelle, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone went up on stage. \nIn fact, the error was realised halfway through the La La Land team's acceptance speech, and Moonlight was presented with the award. \nPresenter Warren Beatty apologised for the goof-up and said that he was given the wrong envelope. \"I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land. That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny,\" Warren said. However, his co-presenter Faye Dunaway took a look at the card and announced La La Land as the winner. \nHost Jimmy Kimmel took the blame for the mistake and added on a lighter note, \"We hate to see people disappointed, but the good news is we got to see some extra speeches.\" \nMoonlight, which is based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, is the coming of age story of a black gay man. The film, which was made on a budget of just $1.5 million, also won the award for Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay.
