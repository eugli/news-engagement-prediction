It is one of the hottest places on Earth -- the hottest when considering the annual average temperature -- and it sits well over 100 meters below sea level. A lively and important economic hub for Ethiopia, it is studied by scientists to see how microorganisms can live in such extreme conditions, which might offer clues about the possibility of life on other planets.
