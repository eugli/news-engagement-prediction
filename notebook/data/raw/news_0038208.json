Ad Feedback \nGotty offered the young man the bottom bunk, but then moved his mattress onto the floor from the top bunk, so the pair were sleeping alongside each other. \nThe prosecution argued this was so he was in a better position to make advances - however, Gotty denied this. \nThe conversation moved in a disturbing direction on the night of the first lockdown after the teen moved in. \nHe said Gotty started talking about previous cellmates, \"real twisted stuff and sexual stuff\", and then asked the teen to engage in oral sex. \nThe teen did not want to, but felt he had no choice because Gotty was physically intimidating and had boasted about violence against other prisoners. \nHe did not resist when Gotty pulled his pants down and began performing a sex act. \nGotty argued it was consensual - however, Judge Christopher Field said consent given based on fear did not constitute true consent. \nThe teen later said he felt he could not call out or push the emergency button in the cell, because he was afraid of how Gotty may have reacted during the delay between the time the button was pushed and when prison staff responded. \nJudge Field raised concerns about the length of time taken to respond to emergency alerts, but said that was ultimately a matter for prison authorities. \nGotty then demanded the teen reciprocate the sex act. \nHe held the young man's head and forced it onto his genitals, telling him he was \"his b.... now\". \nThe teen said he had a shower straight afterwards because he felt dirty, and later pretended to have a significant stomach ache to trick Gotty into calling for help. \nOnce he was released from the cell, it became clear to authorities that something out of the ordinary had happened. \nThe teen indicated he had been sexually assaulted, and an investigation proceeded from that point. \nGotty insisted the teen's complaint was a fabrication, and suggested he may be trying to obtain a compensation payout from ACC. \nHowever Judge Field said he found the young man's evidence \"credible and reliable\". \n\"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this happened as the complainant has said,\" he said. \n\"This was done without his consent. There was no way that the defendant could have believed on reasonable grounds that he did consent.\" \nGotty's conviction is his second strike under the three strikes law. \nIf he is convicted of any serious violent offences in the future he will be ineligible for parole or early release, and if convicted of murder he will sentenced to life in prison without parole. \nGotty is scheduled to appear again for sentencing on March 8 in the High Court at Auckland. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:23:55.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
