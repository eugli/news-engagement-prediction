By: FE Online | Published:  38 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses at an election rally in Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. (PTI Photo) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati today. Speaking at a really ahead of the fourth phase of Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi took a dig at Mayawati’s opposition to the centre’s demonetisation drive. “Behenji (Mayawati) said the government had not prepared properly. Whether the government had not prepared, or you?… They (including Mulayam Singh Yadav) said if the government had given one week, it would have been better. They have complaints against note ban because they didn’t get time to prepare.” \nMocking Mayawati’s opposition to note ban, PM Modi said, the nature of BS has changed. “The ‘Bahujan’ of BSP is now limited to Behenji only. BSP is now Bahujan is now Behenji Sampati Party.” \nOrai is in the impoverished Bundelkhand region of the state. “Bundelkhand has to decide if it has to get out of the stranglehold of SP, BSP and Congress or not…You ask your heart if you have been discriminated or not. whether your rights were snatched away or not.” \n“Only Lucknow or Delhi won’t take Bundelkhand out of trouble. It will take the engine of BJP government in the state as well as the centre to take Bundelkhand out of the trouble.” \nPM Modi also talked about the illigal mining business in Bundelkhand. “Illegal mining is the only industry which has prospered in the region. Shouldn’t this end? We want to form a special squad to dismantle illegal mining business,” he said, adding, “We will use the satellite technology to monitor the land resources of Bundelkhand.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:15:04.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
