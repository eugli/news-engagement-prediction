The idea below explains how Robin Fogel-Shrive uses cellphone “selfies” to break the ice and get students writing — an idea inspired by a Times article and Learning Network Student Opinion prompt. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. Idea : Students are asked to take their phone out and photograph themselves in selfie mode. The selfies serve as a springboard for writing and discussion, and along the way they help create classroom connections between teacher and students. Teacher : Robin Fogel-Shrive Institution : Konocti Education Center and William Carle Continuation High School in Lower Lake, Calif. Grade Level : Grades 9-12 Credit Kobie Mathies What Ms. Fogel-Shrive Did, and Why, in Her Own Words My teaching idea originally came from the October 2013 New York Times Sunday Review article, “ My Selfie, Myself ,” and the Learning Network post, “ Why Do We Take Selfies? ” The focus on the selfie phenomenon, including today’s Instagram and Snapchat applications, is a subject that can provide a bridge in the high school classroom, as students express themselves and share their chosen selfie persona with their fellow classmates and their classroom teacher. Continue reading the main story As a way to connect with my students at the beginning of the school year, and additionally to provide an engaging topic for a pretest writing assignment as a diagnostic tool for assessment, I found the selfie reading selection to be a perfect springboard for close reading of a complex text. Students, accustomed to school policy on keeping their phones in their backpacks, were certainly surprised and eager to be requested by me to “take out your phones, take a selfie and send it to me!” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story While some students did not have access at the time (wireless and equipment challenges), and some wanted more time to prepare for their “close-up,” this prereading activity was captivating and enjoyable for students. Students’ background knowledge on the subject was acknowledged, and the article and questions posed provided the opportunity for rich discussion, entering the conversation, and connection to the writing task. Questions posed and then incorporated in a quickwrite were based on those in the Learning Network post, “Why Do We Take Selfies?” They included: • How often do you take selfies — pictures of yourself — with your cellphone camera and send them to someone, or post them on social media? • What kind do you take, and what reactions do you usually get? • Why do you think there has been such an increase in this kind of picture-taking in recent years? We then read the entire article over a period of a few days, while I printed and created a bulletin board of their selfies as they were sent to me. This display was maintained all year, and provided a forum of self-expression and classroom collaboration. Students discussed key concepts of the “selfie phenomenon” and responded to the following questions for their writing task: • Why do we take selfies? How does the selfie differ from a photograph taken by another, and what does this tell us about ourselves and our society? • Is taking selfies about vanity, about trying to understand how others see you, or about something else? Why do you think people take and share them? • Do you agree with the person quoted who says, “The idea of the selfie is much more like your face is the caption and you’re trying to explain a moment or tell a story”? Why or why not? • Do you agree or disagree with the closing statement that selfies can sometimes be “a kind of visual diary?” \nAdvertisement • Is the proliferation of selfies changing the way we have online conversations and interactions? How? Photo Credit Kayla Van Horn Assessment The culminating assignment was a writing diagnostic utilized as a springboard for literacy and writing instruction across curriculums. A norming and scoring session was held after school with the teachers of core classes joining forces to analyze and determine student proficiency based on the California State University (CSU) English Placement Test (EPT) scoring guide. Teachers reviewed and discussed their observations, with an emphasis on content literacy, equity and Common Core State Standards. For my current ninth- and 11th-grade English classes, I plan to include the questioning strategy SOAPSTone (Subject, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Speaker, Tone) into the above lessons after a first or second read of the article. We’ll pay particular attention to the O (Occasion), which can sometimes be a challenge, but here can be discerned in the author’s introduction. SOAPSTone provides analysis of an expository text and supports the writing process. It can also be used as a formative assessment for the teacher, to determine whether students are understanding the text in its rhetorical context. The SOAPSTone strategy is an academic approach recommended by AP Central (The College Board), as well as the California State University’s Expository Reading and Writing Curriculum (CSU ERWC), designed for postsecondary success.
