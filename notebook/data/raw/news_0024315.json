Here's how to make a model of an atom. Learn the Parts of the Atom \nThe first step is to learn the parts of an atom so you know how the model should look. Atoms are made of protons , neutrons , and electrons . A simple traditional atom contains an equal number of each type of particle. Helium, for example, is shown using 2 protons, 2 neutrons, and 2 electrons. \nThe form of an atom is due to the electric charge of its parts. Each proton has one positive charge. Each electron has one negative charge. Each neutron is neutral or carries no electric charge. Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other, so you might expect the protons and electrons to stick to each other. That's not how it works out because there is a force that holds protons and neutrons together. \nThe electrons are attracted to the core of protons/neutrons, but it's like being in orbit around the Earth. \ncontinue reading below our video Trends in the Periodic Table You are attracted to the Earth by gravity, but when you're in orbit, you perpetually fall around the planet rather than down to the surface. Similarly, electrons orbit around the nucleus. Even if they fall toward it, they are moving too fast to 'stick'. Sometimes electrons get enough energy to break free or the nucleus attracts additional electrons . These behaviors are the basis for why chemical reactions occur! Find Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons \nYou can use any materials that you can stick together with sticks, glue, or tape. Here are some ideas: If you can, use three colors, for protons, neutrons, and electrons. If you're trying to be as realistic as possible, it's worth knowing protons and neutrons are about the same size as each other, while electrons are much smaller. Presently, it is believed each particle is round.
