Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton play Mildred and Richard Loving, the real-life interracial couple whose marriage in 1958 placed them in the crosshairs of the vindictive Virginia anti-miscegenation laws. Negga is up for an Oscar and both received Golden Globe nominations. And rightly so – it’s wonderful, delicate work, which fills out not just each character but the space between them. Their bond is palpable. It’s in the way her eyes flit back to catch his one last time before she leaves a room; the way his slab of a hand, battered from building work and tinkering with cars, encloses hers as they drive, silently but companionably. The uncomplicated easy naturalness of their relationship stands in stark contrast to the impossible situation in which the couple find themselves.\nRuth Negga: 'There are films that really mark you. Loving is one of those for me' Read more \nWhen the authorities are tipped off about the marriage (we never learn by whom), both Richard and Mildred are wrenched from their bed and imprisoned. Richard is bailed out the following morning, but the heavily pregnant Mildred must wait until the judge deigns to see her several days hence. They are given a suspended sentence, conditional on their leaving the state for 25 years. They comply, but a life in inner-city Washington DC is not what Mildred had in mind for her three children. Her letter to Bobby Kennedy asking for help catapults the couple into the public eye as their marriage, so private and cherished, becomes public property as part of a landmark supreme court case.\nWith so much focus on the performances, it’s easy to ignore the unshowy but eloquent work of director Nichols, who based this film on Nancy Buirski’s HBO documentary The Loving Story . The recurring motif of bricklaying suggests a future together half-built because they have been denied their foundation; a sequence that builds to a minor accident is uncomfortably potent. Nichols’s understated approach to the story, devoid of dramatic grandstanding, chimes with the dignity of the Lovings who “won’t bother anyone” if only they can be left alone to live their lives.\n  Jeff Nichols on Loving: ‘Everyone’s picking a side’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:52:35.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
