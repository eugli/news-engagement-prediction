Credit: NAO \nM eanwhile, the DfE is facing a bill upwards of £6.7bn to repair state schools urgently in need of repair and improvement in order for them to be considered “satisfactory” under the Government’s own standards for school premises. \nAs many as 40 percent of schools built between 1945 and 1976 require replacement or refurbishment, with the cost of restoring schools expected to double within five years. \nThe disclosure has prompted criticism from MPs and academics, who accused the Government of squandering money that could be better spent on improving existing schools. \nMeg Hillier, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, urged the Government to divert funding for free schools to areas where existing schools are struggling to cope. \n\"The DfE needs to spend at least £6.7 billion just to bring all school buildings up to a satisfactory state,” she said. \"But the department is choosing to open new free schools in areas which do not need them and are failing to fill places. This is taxpayers' money that could be used to fund much-needed improvements in thousands of existing school buildings.\" \nAngela Rayner, the Shadow Education Secretary, echoed the calls for the Government to scrap “arbitrary” targets for free schools, adding that its focus should be restoring schools that are “crumbling and in desperate need of repair.” Angela Rayner, the Shadow Education Secretary Credit: Getty Images \nW hile free schools were originally introduced to meet demand for additional school places, the NAO claims many have been built in areas with plenty of capacity, meaning many are struggling to recruit enough students to break even financially. \nFree schools also receive 60 percent more funding per pupil than local authority run schools, with spend per head averaging £7,761, compared to just £4,767 for pupils enrolled at local authority-run schools, according to figures from 2013-14. \nHowever, they remain the worst performing schools in the state sector according to the Government’s performance indicators, with 84 percent receiving a negative Progress 8 score for this year’s GCSE league table rankings. \nAmyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the report highlighted the “significant challenges” facing the state sector in the future, adding that the Government “must make the best used of funding it has available”. Credit: NAO \nH owever, Toby Young, director of the New Schools Network, argued that free schools remained “better value for money” than previous school building schemes. \nHe added that they were the “most cost effective way” to reach the Government’s target of 750,000 new school places by 2025. \nA Department for Education spokesman said: “As the NAO acknowledges, we have made more school places available, and in the best schools. The free school programme is a vital part of this – more than three quarters of free schools have been approved in areas where there is already demand for new places and the vast majority are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. \n“The Government is making a huge investment in the school estate of £23 billion up to 2021, to create a further 600,000 new school places, deliver 500 new free schools, and rebuild and refurbish buildings at over 500 schools.\" Follow The Telegraph ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:26:21.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
