Joetta Shumba with her son, Zane (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nPatricia, 49, speaking to the Sunday Mirror said : “Zane was waiting for his mummy to come home and I had to tell him she was never coming back. \n“I didn’t know what his reaction would be but I had to be honest because I didn’t want him to think there was a chance he’d see her again. He started to cry and said, ‘Is it because she doesn’t love me?’. That was the worst moment. Zane was Joetta’s world, she’d never have left him.

He admitted causing death by dangerous driving and got eight years – but is only expected to serve four. \nA judge at Manchester crown court also banned him from driving for six years after his release. \nCall centre worker Patricia, who is now bringing up Zane, had expected him to be charged with manslaughter, which can mean life behind bars.

She also wants longer bans for motoring crimes, to prevent similar tragedies. \nPatricia said: “The law is wrong when it comes to dangerous driving and I feel like it protects the defendant more than the victim. \n“I don’t understand why the driver wasn’t charged with manslaughter. I was told the maximum sentence would be 12 years but he’s likely to serve four. It doesn’t make sense. \n“I don’t understand why he was on the road when Joetta was killed but one day he will be allowed to drive again.” \nHR worker Joetta had given her mum a hug before she left the family home in a taxi for a night out in Manchester on January 23 last year.

When Joetta failed to return home the next morning, Patricia assumed she had stayed with a friend. \nThen she saw a headline about the accident on the news, never thinking it could have claimed her girl’s life. She said: “I saw the news but I didn’t think about it. I assumed Joetta was at a friend’s and she’d call in a few hours to ask me for a lift home. I started to worry at 1pm, when I spoke to Zane’s other grandma, who said she hadn’t phoned to check on him. That was unlike her. I knew something was wrong.” \nPatricia reported Joetta missing and it was almost 24 hours before officers discovered she was the victim of the M62 smash, between Eccles and Warrington. \nGrant, who suffered a leg injury, tried to leave hospital before he was arrested. He prolonged the family’s agony by ­refusing to name his dead passenger. Patricia said: “I don’t know how well they knew each other. I’d never heard of him. He didn’t say who was in the car. Maybe he thought it would help his case. Read More Friends of young mum Joetta Shumba killed in motorway smash launch fundraising appeal for her five-year-old son \n“Maybe he was in shock. But he has put himself first. Why didn’t he think about her family? Joetta deserved better.” \nPolice finally identified Joetta thanks to descriptions Patricia gave them of her jewellery. She then had to break the news to Zane and her other daughters Chipo, 19, and Jessica, 13. Her husband Harrison, 51, a chemical engineer, was working in South Africa and had to fly home. \nThe next day, she went to identify Joetta’s body in a morgue. Patricia said: “She was behind glass I couldn’t touch her. Her head was in bandages. She didn’t look like herself but I could see it was her. I wanted to hold her but I couldn’t. I asked to see her hand as she has a birthmark like mine but there were too many cuts.” (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nThe family had to wait a month before holding Joetta’s funeral as Grant’s defence team wanted a second postmortem. Patricia was tortured by thoughts of her girl’s last moments. “There were so many unanswered questions,” she said. “I just hoped it had been quick. She had been drinking, so I hoped she had been asleep. \n“I couldn’t bear to think of the alternative as it makes me even more upset. She hated speeding and was always telling her dad and me to slow down.” Read More Friends and colleagues of Joetta Shumba launch fundraising appeal to help young mum's family \nPatricia could not bear to attend court in May to see Grant, from Birmingham, sentenced. He has not reached out to say sorry but she has toyed with the idea of visiting him in jail to get some answers. \nShe said: “Some days, I want answers, others I don’t want to open that can of worms. I don’t think the answers will make me feel better. They won’t be pretty. \n“If I do it, it will be for our benefit and not his. I don’t want to portray him as a monster as he has to live with what he did and anyone with a conscience would find that very difficult. I want him punished in a way that deters him from driving dangerously again. (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \n“Maybe he should see children who lost parents. I’d like him to have counselling and to write essays on what he has done. \n“He will be allowed to drive again but can he be cured? He made a conscious decision to drive drunk and do the speed he was doing. Maybe it would be safer, given his history, if he never drove again.” \nPatricia is focusing on keeping Joetta’s memory alive for Zane. She has had help from child bereavement charity Once Upon a Smile to help explain things. Yet she cannot bear to take him to his mum’s grave in case he feels rejected again.

He still dreams about her a lot. I haven’t taken him to the grave as I don’t know what to tell him. He won’t understand why he can’t see her and he wants to be where his mummy is. \n“One day we are going to have to explain exactly what happened but I don’t want him to be scared of cars. It’s very hard when he questions why she left him, because she never wanted to.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:54:50.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
