His GP said he needed a full knee replacement. He believed he met Canterbury District Health Board's (CDHB) criteria for need for surgery, but it rejected him in 2014. \nSix weeks ago Edwards received a letter saying he would finally get the surgery he had nearly given up hope of receiving. He is going under the knife on February 10. \n\"For the past year I have been deteriorating pretty badly. A year ago I could use a cane and go for long walks and see my grandkids play sport. Now I can't walk from the car park to the sports field. \n\"It's going to make all the difference in the world. I can't wait.\" \nHe and his wife had recently considered private surgery, but the pair would have had to mortgage their house to pay for it. \nHe said he was puzzled how, in the last 18 months, his two brothers received two new hips and three knees from the public health system between them \"and I couldn't get a look in\". \n\"My doctor did say it's a lottery and you're lucky whether your name gets called up or not.\" Ad Feedback \n\"This is meant to be a first-world country.\" \nEdwards said he suspected talking to Stuff about his difficulty in getting surgery might have changed the CDHB's stance. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:29:36.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
