Image copyright AFP Image caption German broadcaster ARD was criticised for allowing a Swiss woman to wear the niqab on a TV debate last November \nThe CSU - sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) - holds an absolute majority in the regional parliament, so the legislation looks set to be passed before the summer break. \nCommunication is the \"foundation of our interactions with each other and it's the basis of our free and democratic order\", Mr Herrmann said. \n\"Concealing your face is at odds with this culture of communication,\" he added. \nWhen asked by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper how many state civil servants would be affected by the ban, he said none. But he said it was important that legislation was in place to keep the veil out of such public spaces. \nThe newspaper quoted Green deputy Ulrike Gote, who is opposed to a ban, as saying it \"solved a problem we don't have\" and was merely a political gesture that implied that Islam posed a threat to German society.

Rising number of bans \nGermany has not pursued a total ban on full-face veils as it is acknowledged this would violate its constitution. \nBut Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has proposed a ban in public buildings and Mrs Merkel has urged state governments to ban them where possible . \nThere has been a rise in the number of European nations banning the full-face veil over recent years. \nFrance, Austria, Belgium and Turkey have all imposed a ban in certain public spaces. Legislation supporting a ban is in progress in the Netherlands, while local bans apply in other nations including Denmark, Russia, Spain and Switzerland.
