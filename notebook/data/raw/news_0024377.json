Demecillo and Carlo S. Lorenciana   There is no changing the mind of Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña. Yesterday, the mayor said he will close the Magallanes branch of Banco de Oro when he returns from Japan next week. \nThis, despite the statement of the BDO branch that it has complied with all the requirements to renew its business permit. \n“When I come back, that's when I will close them. If I don’t close it, nobody will believe me anymore. If I don’t close it, people think I made money so I will close it. I’m serious. It’s just a matter that I’m giving people to adjust,” Osmeña said. \nThe mayor will leave for Japan today for an official trip. He will return on Monday. \n“Of course, they have all their legal remedies. I hope they sue me because I'll force them to submit all of their records. The most profitable bank in the Philippines can only afford to pay us P6 a day,” Osmeña told reporters. \nOsmeña said he will ask the court to summon all records of the bank, saying BDO cannot fool the city, especially under his watch.   \n“Don't tell me that you can only pay P6 and you're in compliance with the law. That's the only income. Banco de Oro? Losing money? And I'll prove to the Philippines that they are fooling everybody but not here in Cebu. They will not fool me. I will fight. If we have taxpayers like that, the city will not survive anymore,” he said. \nEarly this year, the mayor sued the BDO-Magallanes Branch for allegedly under-declaring and falsifying its declaration of gross sales at only P400,000 when it renewed its business permit with the City Treasurer's Office last year. \n“How can I make this city work? We give all senior citizens P12,000 a year. There are 80,000 senior citizens. We give financial assistance to the police, judges,” he said. \nHe said he is focusing on one branch of the bank, for now, as he is still “testing their defenses.” \n“After this, there will be another branch and another, and then all of them. I'd like to assure the Cebuanos we don’t need Banco de Oro. There are so many banks here in Cebu. I’m just giving people time to adjust and make adjustments,” he added. \nIn a statement issued recently, BDO Unibank apologized to the public for the inconvenience the present controversy has brought. \n\"We would like to apologize for whatever inconvenience the recent threat of branch closures in Cebu City has created.” \n“We have complied with the requirements but despite that, the city government has refused to accept payments for local taxes and fees, and issue the permits contrary to what they did in the past. We have made the necessary arrangements for the clients to be serviced in alternative locations,” it said. \n“This is a local issue and has no bearing whatsoever on the operation of the Bank as a whole,\" it added.
