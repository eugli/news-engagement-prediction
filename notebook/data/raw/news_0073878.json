Related Future: Syrup, Strippers, Heavy Angst With the Superstar MC \"I embraced what I thought people was gonna hate about me. I was gonna turn the hate into love\" \nFuture follows in the Number One footsteps of Evol , What a Time to Be Alive and DS2, with all three topping the charts in the span of 7 months . Industry forecasters predict that the rapper will once again rule the Billboard 200 next week with his just-released follow-up album HNDRXX , giving him five straight Number One albums. \nIf HNDRXX reaches the top spot, Future will also become the first artist ever to debut at Number One in consecutive weeks with different albums, Billboard reports . \nFuture more than doubled the grand total of the week's Number Two album, Bruno Mars' 24K Magic , which ended the week with 59,000 copies. Last week's Number One, the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack, finished at Number Three ahead of the Weeknd's Starboy (Four), Migos' Culture (Five) and Big Sean's I Decided (Six). \nThree new releases landed in the back half of the Top 10: Charlie Wilson's In It to Win It placed Number Seven, Ryan Adams' latest Prisoner claimed Number Eight with 45,000 copies and Alison Krauss' Windy City , the artist's first solo LP in 18 years, placed ninth. The Trolls soundtrack closed out the Top 10. \nBarring an unexpected, massive sales surge from either John Mayer's The Search for Everything: Wave Two or Little Big Town's The Breaker , Future's place in Billboard 200 history is all but cemented.
