The seven year-old, 25-pound (12-kilogram) female went missing early Monday from her enclosure in the US capital, apparently after slipping through a hole in the fencing.\nOllie ultimately turned up near the zoo's bird house, where keepers successfully captured her and took her for a checkup with veterinarians.\n\"We're just over the moon happy,\" said Craig Saffoe, curator of big cats at the zoo. \"I think she was ready to come home.\"\n\"When you find a member of your family that's been missing, it fills you with joy -- crazy joy.\"\nA team of zookeepers, police officers and animal rescue workers had deemed their search futile just hours earlier: it was \"less of a chance than finding a needle in a haystack,\" said Brandie Smith, an animal care specialist at the zoo.\nThe search party assumed the gray-furred, short-tailed feline had found a happy new home in nearby Rock Creek Park. Since bobcats are not aggressive, authorities decided to suspend the hunt in the name of common sense.\n\"She wanted to go out, have a little bit of fun, see what it's like on the outside,\" Saffoe said, visibly relieved to have the cat back safe and sound.\nOllie did arrive home with a small, harmless cut on her left front paw. Animal care workers say they will do a full exam on her to ensure \"no ill effects\" came from her adventure.\nHer escapades did propel her to Twitter stardom: her photo was shared widely on social networks, often accompanied by political commentary.\nSome said her escape proves that fencing is useless, a reference to Donald Trump's order to construct a wall on the US-Mexico border wall.\nMany also associated Ollie with the cat-eared \"pussy\" hat that was symbolic of the recent Women's March peaceful protest against a number of the US president's policy stances.\n\"She chose security over freedom,\" wrote one Twitter user following the bobcat's return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:10:17.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
