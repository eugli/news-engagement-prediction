It’s the 14th arrest in the case since February 9. Read more Pak handlers may have used MP spy racket to plan 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks \nJabbar’s grilling revealed that he was the crucial link with ISI operatives in MP and Jammu and Kashmir. He helped route the lottery and online fraud money parked in banks of Satna and Rewa district of MP to operatives in Jammu and Kashmir via his couriers and hawala. \nThe arrest of two ISI operatives, Satwindar and Dadu in November 2016 from Jammu had thrown the lid off a Chinese SIM box-enabled international call ring in UP and MP which was being used by Pakistani handlers to fund spying and terror in J&K. \nSince last week, 13 men linked to the ring have been arrested in MP. The arrested men include ruling BJP leader Dhruv Saxena. \nJabbar was the key link of the racket working in tandem with Satna (MP) resident Balram and Rajjan Tiwari. \nOn Saturday evening, Chhattarpur (MP) native Sahyog Singh became the 13th person to be arrested in the case by MP ATS. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:28.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
