Yes, you read it right. \nAs per a recent study conducted by researchers from the Queens University Belfast in England, the chemical from the industrial toxins and pesticides in the soil contaminate the rice that is endangering the health of millions of people, reports The Telegraph. \nCancer-fighting foods: Seven reasons to eat more whole grains \nThe findings revealed that by soaking rice overnight the level of toxin - arsenic - was reduced by 80 percent. \nFor the research, Andy Meharg from the University, tested three different ways of cooking rice.In the first, he used a ratio of two parts of water to one part of rice, where the water was \"steamed out\" during cooking. \nPeople living in higher altitudes at lower risk of heart diseases, diabetes \nIn the second, with five parts of water to one part of rice, with the excess water washed off, levels of arsenic were almost halved. \nAnd in the third method, where the rice was soaked overnight, levels of the toxin was reduced by 80 percent.But experiments suggest that the way rice is cooked is key to reducing exposure to the toxic and naturally occurring chemical. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Wednesday, February 8, 2017 - 11:48 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:29:28.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
