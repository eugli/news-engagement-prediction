Their real estate agent found discovered earlier this month that the property had been stripped -- with only walls, bathtubs and some of the flooring remaining. \nAs a burglary investigation began, Fort Worth police received a call from a contractor who explained what happened, according to the Star-Telegram . \nThe contractor, who was not identified, told police he had been hired to gut a nearby house. Although the address on the curb matched that home, the numbers on the house were different. \"2700 Forest Park Blvd\" is written on the curb in front of the house, which has a different address. Google Maps \n“It was a huge misunderstanding,” Fort Worth police Sgt. W. D. Paine told the Star-Telegram . \nThe man who owned the home that was supposed to be dismantled didn’t give the contractor a key and told him to kick the door in to get inside, Paine said. So that’s what the contractor did, and his crew finished the job in three days. \n“We can’t really file a criminal mischief charge because his intent wasn’t to deprive them of the property,” Paine said to the Star-Telegram . “We’re leaving it up to the contractor and victim to settle it.” \nPolice don’t intend to charge the contractor for the mistake. The homeowners have spoken with the contractor, and he has offered to restore the house or buy it for the selling price. \nIt was listed for $369,000, Lelia Beckelman told the Star-Telegram . The Beckelmans plan on the contractor returning everything that had been taken and restore the house. \n“He feels really bad and is willing to make us whole and restore things,” Beckelman said to the Star-Telegram . “He’s an honest guy.” Zillow", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:03:04.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
