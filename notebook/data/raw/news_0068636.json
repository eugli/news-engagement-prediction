Google announced on Friday that Spaces will be shut down on April 17. And on March 3, Spaces will become \"read only,\" meaning you won't be able to use the app for anything other than glancing at your old conversations with friends. \nGoogle \n\"Our goal with Spaces was to create a better small-group sharing experience, and we’ll use what we’ve learned to improve other Google products and services. Thanks again for your support,\" Google said on the Spaces support page . \nSpaces got off to a bumpy start when it was launched in May 2016, with many users expressing confusion as to how the app fit in with Google's already crowded portfolio of messaging apps, such as Google Hangouts and YouTube messaging. Since then, Google has introduced yet another messaging app called Allo . \nFor Spaces though, it's now time to say Goodbye.
