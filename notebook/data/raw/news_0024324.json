But, as the true material, political and religious significance of the relic is revealed, the group’s journey becomes increasingly dangerous. \nJamie Hannigan wrote the script for Pilgrimage , which was produced by Conor Barry and John Keville of Dublin-based production outfit Savage Productions and Benoit Roland of Wrong Men. XYZ Films executive produced. \n“This is the kind of elevated genre film that action fans across the country have been waiting to see,\" said RLJ’s chief acquisitions officer Mark Ward. \"With a stellar cast led by Jon, Richard and Tom, we are very excited to bring this film to theaters nationwide.\" \nNate Bolotin brokered the domestic rights deal on behalf of XYZ Films alongside WME Global and Mark Ward and Jess De Leo for RLJ. \nRLJ Entertainment recently acquired Sundance title Bushwick , another XYZ Films production which stars Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow. XYZ’s current slate also includes Apostle, directed by Gareth Evans and starring Dan Stevens, Anders Walters’ feature debut I Kill Giants starring Zoe Saldana, Imogen Poots and Madison Wolfe, as well as S.Craig Zahler’s Brawl in Cell Block 99 with Vince Vaughn and Don Johnson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:28:04.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
