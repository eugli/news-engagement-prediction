The $9 fare acts as a day pass for limitless rides on a rapidly expanding network of light and commuter rail. The new R Line, which is scheduled to open this month, will add 10.5 miles to the regional system that has more than doubled to about 98 miles. The terminus of the airport train, the newly refurbished Union Station , has trendy restaurants, bars and shops as well as its own stylish lodging, the Crawford Hotel . The station is an anchor in the historic LoDo (Lower Downtown) district, where attractions like the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver and Coors Field are within walking distance. In addition, the bike-share program Denver B-cycle operates from 88 locations and offers a good way to reach neighborhoods like RiNo, or River North, home to many breweries and restaurants, or Cherry Creek for shopping. There’s even a new electric three-wheel vehicle service, eTuk , that offers city and brewery tours. And you can take a day trip without renting wheels, via the new Flatiron Flyer rapid transit bus, which offers service from Denver to Boulder in under an hour. Amtrak’s Winter Park Express runs from Union Station to the ski slopes of Winter Park on weekends through March 26.

Credit Kevin Miyazaki for The New York Times Detroit The Motor City once had a vital streetcar system, including a track that ran down its main corridor, Woodward Avenue. In April, some 60 years after the old lines were eradicated to make way for cars, the new QLine will restore streetcar service to downtown over a 3.3-mile route. “You can’t underestimate the symbolic importance of unveiling mass transit in a city like Detroit, which was built on cars,” said Amy S. Eckert, a freelance writer and the author of “100 Things to Do in Detroit Before You Die.” The streetcar, of course, is limited relative to the footprint of Detroit, and taxis or shuttles, including a service called Skoot that offers van transportation for $20 a person, are still the most common way to get downtown from the airport. But the project has sparked a building boom as residences, restaurants and shops have moved in along the corridor. Visitors will be able to shuttle along the route for about $1.50 a ride from near the Detroit River downtown to the nearby baseball and football stadiums (professional hockey and basketball facilities are being built and are expected to open this fall). The route also passes through the cultural Midtown district, home to the Detroit Institute of Arts and other museums. Hotels along the streetcar include the recently opened Aloft Detroit at the David Whitney . \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Come April, I don’t think you’ll miss having a car, provided you stay in and around Woodward Avenue, and that’s where most of the renaissance is anyway,” Ms. Eckert said. Some areas worth exploring, like the vibrant Corktown neighborhood or Belle Isle Park, are some distance from the streetcar route. For those, there are Uber, Lyft and, also coming in spring, Detroit Bike Share with 43 stations. Photo A new extension of the Metro Rail in Los Angeles reaches west to the beach in Santa Monica. Credit Monica Almeida/The New York Times Los Angeles No American city is more synonymous with congestion — as captured in the opening scene of “La La Land” — than Los Angeles. But alongside and under those clogged highways, the city’s Metro Rail has built 105 miles of subway or light rail in Los Angeles County since 1990. Two extensions opened in 2016 now reach west to beachfront Santa Monica and extend from Pasadena east to Azusa at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. With the growth of the public transit system, the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board has run a Car Free L.A. campaign for nearly five years. It offers 15 sightseeing guides on its website ranging from downtown’s Museum Row, home to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the La Brea Tar Pits Museum, to the restaurants of Koreatown.
