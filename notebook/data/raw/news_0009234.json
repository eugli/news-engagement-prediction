They are giving salaries to the players but we not getting anything,\" Reddy said. \n\n\"If our financial issues get solved, we will be able to perform even better. \n\n\"We are only playing because we love cricket and we have a lot of passion for the game even though we are blind.\" \n\nThe final will be in Bangalore on February 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:33:34.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
