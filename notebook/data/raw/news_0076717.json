The 27-year-old singer shared a snippet of the song with a caption that read “dopest track ever,” and later dished about his decision to team up with Nicki and Ty.\n  SWALLA LALA 🎶🎶♩♩ dopest track ever 🔥🔥 @jasonderulo #jasonderulo #swalla #nickiminaj #derulobaby #newmusic #mixtape \nA post shared by @jasonderulo.de on Aug 23, 2016 at 11:34pm PDT\n\"It&apos;s one that kind of made sense. I never believe in forcing a collaboration,” he told Billboard on the Grammys red carpet. “You know, I&apos;m a fan of both of theirs and I thought that they fit the track perfectly. It&apos;s one of those ones that&apos;ll get you up and doing your thing. I feel like it&apos;s gonna stick out on the radio. There&apos;s nothing that sounds like it.\"\nRelated Jason Derulo Involved in Scuffle at Hollywood’s Bootsy Bellows Nightclub The Game and Jason Derulo Connect on New Song \"Baby You\" Flo Rida and Jason DeRulo Live for the Weekend in the New Video for \"Hello Friday\" “Swalla” definitely has potential. Though there’s a lot going on in the song, the electronic-infused Carribean sound is expected to get a lot of love in the dance clubs. Both Jason and Ty handle their verses nicely, but Nicki is definitely the star.\n“When I&apos;m poppin&apos; them bananas, we don&apos;t link chimps for that,” she raps before throwing shade at another female artist ( Remy Ma, perhaps? ). “I gave these bitches two years, now your time&apos;s up/Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks/I&apos;m in that cherry red foreign with the brown guts/My shit slappin&apos; like dude did Lebron nuts.” That last line she was particularly proud of:\nPull up in that black murc wit da brown guts. My shit slappin like dude on lebron nuts. 😂😂😂😂😂 that&apos;s my 1st try at it. Ima have a few.\n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) June 16, 2016 You can listen to the Ricky Reed-produced track via iTunes and Apple Music .\nTags: News , New Music , Nicki Minaj , Ty Dolla Sign , Jason Derulo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:15:28.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
