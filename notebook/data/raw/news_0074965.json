For Dwight that involved both covering for Sherry — he told Negan that she wasn’t the one who let Daryl out — and convincing Negan somehow to let him go after her by himself. (A bit of a stretch after the initial beating and suspicion of Dwight, but it’s perhaps more evidence that Negan’s overconfidence has become a liability.) Photo Austin Amelio in “The Walking Dead.” Credit Gene Page/AMC For Eugene, it was the same sniveling coward routine and bogus academic bona fides we’ve seen him use throughout “The Walking Dead,” going back to his arrival in Season 4. (You’ll recall that he tricked Abraham into protecting him by saying that he was a scientist with a fix for the zombie plague.) The Dr. Smarty-pants act included a fence-strengthening plan to cover the walkers in molten metal, à la Winslow from last week, as well as a number of typical Eugene comic grace notes. He gave the wives a makeshift science show to the mumbled strains of the 1812 Overture . He bluffed his way into a bedpan, medicine and a security “grimbly-gunk.” He cooked up suicide pills in a housecoat to They Might Be Giants . Dwight meanwhile read a farewell letter from Sherry and tearfully trashed his old house. I parsed Dwight’s complicated relationship with Daryl during their prisoner-jailer episode earlier this season, noting that Dwight’s hostility was a product of his “projected self-loathing, Daryl’s inner strength a rebuke to the moral compromises Dwight made.” Sherry saw it too, explaining in the letter that she had liberated Daryl because he “reminded you of who you used to be, and I wanted to let you forget.” She added, “Sorry that I made you into what you are,” which frankly seemed hurtful — additional salt rubbed into the open wound that is Dwight’s iron-scorched soul. Nevertheless, Dwight decided not to pursue her and to tell everyone else he had killed her. “We don’t get to have big hearts, remember that,” Dr. Carson told him in apparent consolation. Message received. Because the doctor didn’t realize that, even as he was bandaging Dwight, his patient was setting him up for a trip into the furnace, using a bit of Sherry’s letter to implicate him in Daryl’s breakout. \nAdvertisement To paraphrase Negan, why would Dwight do that? I admit I’m not sure — feel free to share your own theories in the comments. Photo Jeffrey Dean Morgan in “The Walking Dead.” Credit Gene Page/AMC Did he betray the doctor simply to cover for Sherry’s having let Daryl escape? He wouldn’t seem to need to if everyone thinks she’s dead. Was it a way to win back Negan’s trust? Or was it because he sensed in the nosy doctor’s persistent questioning a potential threat, and someone who might know more about Dwight and Sherry than he let on? Or was it something else entirely, perhaps tied to the other Dr. Carson whom Negan mentioned after incinerating the first one. That would be the doctor at the Hilltop who’s been helping Maggie through her pregnancy. (The “Walking Dead” series wiki says they’re brothers.) Is there a reason Dwight wants to go to the Hilltop? If so, with Daryl having returned there last week, it’s going to be more complicated than he realizes. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
