A private residence, it has been used more recently for events such as weddings. SACHA LAWSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nEric Watson with former wife Nicky Watson at the Karaka horse sales in 2002. \nWith a private golf course, swimming pool,and floodlit tennis court, the property also features its own lake, gymnasium and helipad. \nREAD MORE: \nThe 1000 square metre.house includes six bedrooms, six bathrooms and a self-contained guest wing. \nLondon-based, Watson made his initial fortune founding the Blue Star Group printing company in the 1990s. \nHe has a diverse range of investments including real estate, an Auckland horse stud, Texas oil interests, Auckland's Soul Bar and Restaurant, and lingerie firm Bendon. \nWatson is also chairman of the the Warriors rugby league team, of which Cullen Investments has been a shareholder since 2001. \nHe was also a director of Hanover Finance which controversially collapsed after it was sold to Allied Farmers in 2009. Ad Feedback \nTe Hihi has been described previously as Watson's main New Zealand residence. \nSothebys agent Jason Gaddes said there were not too many properties so close to Auckland that were like it. \n\"There are very few properties that provide the opportunities that this property does - 33ha of land so close to a major city ... It is quite unique.\" \nConsented as a luxury lodge, the property included four consented titles which could be developed. \nGaddes said there had been interest from both locals and from overseas. \n\"There are varied interests from the commercial opportunities through to a residence.\" \nHe didn't want to put an estimated value on it, but in 2010 it was reportedly marketed above $10m. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:08:02.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
