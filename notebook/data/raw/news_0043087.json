Alex Morton/Getty Images 2/13 1999 - Early beginnings \nHaving joined as a youngster of 14 Terry made his debut on 28 October 1998 in a League Cup tie against Aston Villa. He would spend part of the 1999/2000 season on loan at Nottingham Forest but it wasn't long before Terry established himself in the Chelsea first team. Getty Images 3/13 2001 - Starting to make an impression \nThe 2000/01 season was when Terry carved out a regular role at Chelsea, making 23 starts on his way to being voted player of the season. Getty Images 4/13 2004 - Captain fantastic \nMarcel Desailly's departure saw Terry take the Chelsea armband under new manager Jose Mourinho. It was to be the start of an outstanding relationship between the two that would lead to three league titles. 2004 Getty Images 5/13 2005 - Ending the 50 year wait \nTerry was the PFA Player of the Year as Chelsea won their first top flight crown since 1955, and just their second overall. 2005 ended with him in the Fifa World XI, reward for a remarkable run of form that was to continue into the following year, when Chelsea defended their title with a whopping 91 points. AFP/Getty Images 6/13 2006 - England captain \nOn his promotion in place of David Beckham Steve McClaren said on Terry: \"I'm certain I've got the right man in John Terry. I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had.\" He was to last little over 18 months before being stripped of the armband by Fabio Capello amid allegations regarding his private life. Reinstated in March 2011 he lasted even less time on his second go, with the FA stripping him over allegations he had racially abused Anton Ferdinand. AFP/Getty Images 7/13 2008 - Heartbreak in Moscow \nHaving overcome injury to make the Champions League final against Manchester United Terry put in a solid performance throughout normal time as the match ended 1-1. Then, with the chance to win the trophy for Chelsea, he slipped on his way to take his penalty. United would win the shootout 6-5. 2008 Getty Images 8/13 2010: Champion again \nUnder Carlo Ancelotti Chelsea claimed their third title under Terry's leadership, and he was to make it a double by captaining the side to an FA Cup final win over Portsmouth. 2010 Getty Images 9/13 2012: European glory at last \nHe may not have been able to play in the final but Terry did make himself the centre of attention in the Allianz Arena, sprinting on to the pitch in full kit (including shinpads) after Didier Drogba's winning penalty. It was to be the decision that spawned a thousand memes. AFP/Getty Images 10/13 2015: Back to his best \nUnder Rafa Benitez in 2013 his Chelsea career seemed over, with the interim manager frequently leaving Terry out. But the return of Mourinho reinvigorated the club captain, who was to become only the second outfield player to play every minute in a title-winning side. 2015 Getty Images 11/13 2016: Moving on? \nGuus Hiddink had made clear that he thought Chelsea ought to offer Terry a new contract. The hierarchy disagreed. And so, in shock circumstances, the career of one of the club's greatest-ever players appeared to have entered its final months... Mike Hewitt/Getty Images 12/13 2016: Or staying put? \nAhead of their final match of the season, Chelsea confirmed that they had offered their captain a new one-year extension . Terry's Chelsea future remains in his hands. (BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images) 13/13 2016: Done deal! \nThe Chelsea captain would indeed put pen to paper and signed a new one-year deal with the club. This content is subject to copyright. \nAntonio Conte admits he wants his first season in English football to end with Chelsea captain John Terry lifting the FA Cup at Wembley. \nChelsea beat Wolves 2-0 on Saturday to progress to the Quarter Finals and will now face former manager Jose Mourinho and his Manchester United side at Stamford Bridge next month. \nThe competition has become even more significant for the Blues and not just because they have a chance of winning the Double. \nWhile neither Conte or Terry have confirmed it yet, the veteran centre half is expected to leave Chelsea at the end of the season when his contract expires. \nTerry, whose first winners' medal at Chelsea was in the FA Cup 17 years ago, has played in every round of the competition so far. (Getty Images) \nWhen asked if it would be perfect for Terry to hold the trophy aloft in two months' time, Conte said: \"I'll sign for that now, yes. But it wont be easy, there are eight strong teams with great surprise. We have to think of ourselves and go step by step. Mourinho begins FA Cup mind games as he brands Chelsea 'champions' \n\"JT deserved to play against Wolves and he played very well. I'm very happy for him. He is a very important player, he is my captain, and is important on and off their pitch. \n\"He is helping me a lot and I'm very pleased to have him in my squad and also to know this type of person. \n\"Did I pick him on merit and not sentiment? Yeah for sure, but I want to be very clear: every player can play if they deserve it. I will be pleased to give them the opportunity, but it won't be on sentiment.\" \nTerry was given a 12-month contract extension right at the end of last season, but is expected to make an announcement on his future a lot earlier than that this time.
