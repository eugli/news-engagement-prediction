He said that he used to feel concerned about his lack of hair but is now more positive. \nOur weird lack of hair may be the key to our success \n\"I feel proud. Or maybe I should say, I feel good about being a bald man,\" he said, \"And that is thanks to this bald men's club.\" \nBald Men Club Chairman Teijiro Sugo, 70, said the hope was that the club would attract more members and become much bigger. \n\"I want all the bald men all over the world to gather here so we can organise a bald men's Olympic tournament,\" he said.
