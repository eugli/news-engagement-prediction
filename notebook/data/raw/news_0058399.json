Here are some of our favourite 'unbelievable' characters from Indian shows. A + A - Sudha Shivpuri as Baa in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nIndian television is full of unbelievable characters. And we don't mean that in a good way. Okay, a couple of characters in this particular listicle are legendary. And we will NEVER forget them, but that does not take away from the fact that we had a hard time believing them. \nHere are five such characters: \nBaa from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi A still from the show Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nBaa, played by Sudha Shivpuri, was the head of the Virani family, and she loved to sit on her rocking chair and preach about relationships to her huge family. She bonded particularly well with Tulsi, the protagonist of the show. But what makes her unbelievable, you ask? \nShe was 120. Or maybe 125. No one really knows (or cares), but the fact is that she was too old to be alive, to be brutally honest. The show took leaps, characters were killed off, characters were introduced. But Baa, Baa remained the constant driving force of the moralistic family. \nRancho from Raja aur Rancho \nThe show was an instant hit in the late 90s. And perhaps the major contributing factor to the show's success was Rancho aka the assistant monkey who helped Raja, the main man, solve crimes. Yes, he was adorable, and it was funny. And monkeys are intelligent beings, but solving crimes is taking it to the next level altogether. \nAnand Mathur's first wife in Hum Paanch A promo poster of the show. Picture courtesy: YouTube \nYes, we are talking about the, well, the talking portrait, who was also the first wife of the character Anand Mathur in the show. Played by Priya Tendulkar, the portrait was as much a character of the comedy series as any. The only hitch is that she had died, and she continued to haunt her husband from her portrait. \nOf course, we enjoyed it all; Mr Mathur's frustration, the portrait's comic timing; but the bottom line is that this does not happen in real life. \nFarooq Sheikh's character in Chamatkar \nA man who can 'hear' people's thoughts. A mind-reader. That is what the veteran actor's character was capable of in the show. It was hilarious, but we had a hard time believing our protagonist. \nTanu in Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki \nTanu (Kratika Sengar) falls in love with a perfect guy (Rishi aka Ssharad Malhotra), Tanu dies. Tanu takes birth again to claim her love, Karz style. We will just leave it at that. \nIn fact, the promo of the show pretty much revealed that the serial's basic plot was all about reincarnations, rebirths, and lost loves. \nHave a look: For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
