Editor Advertisement \nOh dear! Read in the news of a 77 year old woman who was found dead in a Tampines flat, with apparently a bloodied knife lodged in her throat. The wheelchair bound woman was then home alone with her maid, and her husband had been out for a routine hospital check-up. \nPolice are still investigating, with the maid seen leaving with the police yesterday to assist in the investigations. The wheelchair bound woman had suffered from stroke three years ago, making her rely on her husband to get around. The Indonesian maid had been with the family for only about a month. \nWe can only wonder what happen. The poor husband has now lost his wife in tragic circumstances. \nTed Lau \nA.S.S.
