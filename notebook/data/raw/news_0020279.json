ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nIsh Sodhi picked up three wickets against Central Districts. \nTo their credit Northern Districts gave the chase for 337 a decent nudge but the loss of key men like Corey Anderson at vital times stunted their chances of taking on Wellington on Wednesday to see who will face Canterbury in the final. \nREAD MORE: \nBruce had the perfect opportunity to build into his innings after he found himself in the middle earlier than he has in recent weeks after Jesse Ryder and Will Young departed cheaply. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nTom Bruce plays through square leg against Northern Districts. \nWhile he clubbed his first ball to the boundary, he and George Worker were prepared to work cautiously for periods before they really ramped things up. \nWorker, who passed 500 runs for the competition during his innings of 79, looked as good as he had from game one as he repeatedly punished anything that was over pitched. \nJust when it appeared he was gong to bring up his second century in a week against Northern Districts he was trapped in front by Ish Sodhi, although he appeared to have a decent argument to say the ball hit him too high while he was also well forward. \nHis departure ended an 128-run third wicket stand but it did not stop Bruce from going on the offensive as he repeatedly sent the ball out of the ground and into the terraces. Ad Feedback \nThe Northern Districts bowlers had little answer to his attack for a period as he brought up his first list A century off 81 balls, finding the boundary six times and going over it on a further eight occasions. \nJust when it looked like he would go on and make a really big score he flicked a short ball off Zak Gibson straight down the throat of James Baker at deep third man. \nHis wicket, combined with the quick loss of Dane Cleaver and Josh Clarkson appeared to leave Central Districts vulnerable at 216-6 but Kieran Noema-Barnett and Ben Wheeler put together an 107-run stand in double quick time to put Northern Districts on the back foot again. \nNoema-Barnett, who spent the last season playing county cricket, put together arguably his best one-day innings for the side as he smashed 74 off just 49 balls. The former skipper took an exceptional liking to anything bowled up to him as he put successive balls over the scoreboard. \nBy the end of their 50 overs Central Districts had racked up 336 and 737 against the Northern Districts attack in their last two matches. \nAgain there was little for the visiting bowlers to feel good about, although Sodhi's second spell was much improved on his first when he was too short, too often. \nScott Kuggeleijn was also impressive as he picked up Ryder early after beating him for pace while he again demonstrated his skill with the bat with a punishing 85 not out. \nAt a glance \nCentral Districts 336-7 (G Worker 79, T Bruce 100, B Wheeler 31no, K Noema-Barnett 74; Z Gibson 2-64, I Sodhi 3-46) beat Northern Districts 288 (C Anderson 79, N Kelly 44, D Mitchell 37, S Kuggeleijn 85no; S Rance 3-47, A Patel 3-43) by 48 runs. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T11:35:32.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
