Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo men hit with Gangbos following a spate of shootings in Salford have been jailed for breaching the orders. \nJoshua Barnes and Jordan Budgen were issued with civil injunctions, nicknamed Gangbos, in October last year, after a series of violent incidents in Little Hulton . \nThe crimes included firearms offences, arson and attempted murder. \nThe conditions of the injunctions meant the individuals were banned from possessing a bat, hammer, wooden stick, or knife and prohibiting conduct that causes or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to any person. \nThey were also prohibited from contacting or associating with each other within the Greater Manchester area.
