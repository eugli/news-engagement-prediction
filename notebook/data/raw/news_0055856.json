The measures were sponsored by Germany and France, which both face crucial elections in 2017, with immigration a major issue. \n“The persistence of the terrorist threat and the effectiveness of the currently [reinstated] border controls at [the EU’s] internal borders demonstrate the need to review the Schengen Borders Code… in the event of a serious threat to the public order or internal security,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and his French counterpart, Bruno Le Roux, wrote in a joint letter on Monday detailing the proposals.

The ministers argued that the existing exemption periods should be extended and the border checks should be allowed under “more normal” circumstances if necessary. \nThe proposals also include suggestions for closer cooperation and data sharing between the EU member states. Some other ideas presented in the letter concerned cooperation in tracking of movements of terrorism suspects as many suspected militants, who arrived in Europe, have crossed many European borders since their first entry.

Instead of relying on catchy populist slogans, we should continue, and deepen, the ongoing work on internal security to better protect European citizens,” they said, as cited by Reuters. \nFrance has recently received the green light for a reestablishment of controls at its borders until mid-July due to a persistent terrorist threat, AFP reports.
