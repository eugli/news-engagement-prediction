If makeup can't give you the beauty you want ... you can turn into a Victoria's Secret model at once!\" \nThis is a description for a children's cosmetic surgery game. \n'Plastic Surgery Simulator' is one of hundreds of surgery apps targeted at kids which is available for download through Apple, Android, Google and Amazon app stores. Screenshot \nThe Surgery Simulator game tells children eyelid surgery will make a woman more beautiful. \nMore than 2700 people have signed a petition started by Endangered Bodies New Zealand - a global organisation set up to challenge negative body image issues - which wants app stores to remove \"dangerous\" cosmetic surgery games. \nREAD MORE: \nEndangered Bodies said in a statement that the games feature animated characters, vibrant graphics, and simple actions young children can understand to glamorise cosmetic surgery and encourage children to go to drastic means to achieve \"perfection.\" Screenshot \nPlayers slice open the nose using a scalpel and are then guided to use forceps to keep the wound open. \nApp users can slice virtual patients open to perform nose jobs and face and eye lifts. \nAfter opening the app, the player is positioned behind the counter of a sterile waiting room. \nA woman walks over to the counter, and a text box pops up: 'She needs a nose job, please help her.' Screenshot \nThe player injects the woman's lips with a drug-filled syringe, dragging their finger downward to pump the lips up. \nThe player uses a syringe to numb the nose and a scalpel to cut open the skin. They can fix the break in her nose, stitch her back up and put her in bandages. Ad Feedback \nThe game issues prompts for each new patient - suggesting double-eyelid surgery will make one woman \"more beautiful\", and that another woman needs lip augmentation because her lips are \"too thin\". \nBarnett said children who view \"flawless\" images of women and men question their own looks and are more likely to diet and suffer from depression and shame. \n\"Games that make dark skin whiter, chisel larger noses, plump up lips, shave off curves, and turn eyes round and Disney-like creates judgment, fear of being different, and fear of not looking like a fictitious ideal. \n\"As a mother of an eight and nine-year-old, I don't want my children growing up looking for flaws or thinking their appearance is some kind of DIY project that needs fixing. With scalpels,\" Barnett said in the petition. \nThere are hundreds of surgery simulators readily available for download - some which even allow users to make changes to their own faces by uploading a photo. \nThe game's developer, Degoo Limited, has created a range of surgery-themed apps, including Mermaid's Plastic Surgery and My Boyfriend's Plastic Surgery. \nDr Virginia Braun, a professor of psychology at the University of Auckland, said games like this could send complicated messages to children. \nBraun, who specialises in gender and gendered bodies, said cosmetic surgery games could reinforce \"really powerful and problematic messages\" which are often fed to women and girls about what is attractive. \n\"It's problematic in that it teaches children an ideal that the body is plastic and can and should be changed in these very permanent ways. \n\"It normalises it - like it's just 'something you do',\" Braun said. \nGames that encourage children to alter someone's appearance are part of a broader cultural narrative that teach young people what is acceptable, and what makes someone \"desirable\", she said. \nBut is a game just a game? \n\"If these kids form an association with fun and pleasure in changing appearances then that could be another issue altogether. We don't know what impact that could have.\" \nIn 2014, the UK-based Twitter account Everyday Sexism rallied to remove plastic surgery apps aimed at children featured on iTunes and the Google Play store. \nWithin 24 hours, both platforms removed the flagged apps, the petition states. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:29:35.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
