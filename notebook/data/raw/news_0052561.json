That compares to the first five years of the survey, when fewer than 2,000 manatees were spotted. \nLast year the federal government downgraded the sea mammal's protected status from endangered — which means they are facing extinction — to threatened because populations have rebounded. \nALSO", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:23:28.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
