Credit Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters IZMIR, Turkey — Turkish officials handed down punishments on Tuesday to two leaders of a major opposition party who have become casualties of a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent that escalated after a failed coup in July . Selahattin Demirtas, a leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party, was sentenced on Tuesday to five months in jail for insulting the Turkish state, the Turkish nation and their institutions. Hours earlier, Figen Yuksekdag, the other leader of the party, was expelled from Parliament after the country’s top court upheld her conviction for a terrorism offense. Both have been in custody since being detained in raids in November . Thousands of members of their party, known as the H.D.P., have also been arrested since the breakdown of Kurdish peace talks in 2015, including at least a dozen of their 59 members of Parliament. The arrests of party members accelerated after the failed coup, which also set off an even larger purge of government officials and people suspected of being dissidents. More than 45,000 government officials, soldiers, police officers, teachers and journalists have been arrested since the coup attempt, most of them suspected of having connections to the Gulenist movement, a group led by Fethullah Gulen , an exiled cleric living in the United States, that Turkey believes was behind the attempted putsch. The government accuses the H.D.P. of links to a Kurdish militia that has been designated a terrorist group by Turkey, NATO and the European Union.

A charismatic leader, Mr. Demirtas had widened the party’s appeal beyond its Kurdish base before the crackdown intensified. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
