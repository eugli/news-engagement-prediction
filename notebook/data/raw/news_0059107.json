Reportedly Signs 4-Year, $16 Million Contract with 49ers John Cordes/Associated Press Adam Wells Featured Columnist February 25, 2017 The San Francisco 49ers ' new regime has made its first major move by signing defensive tackle Earl Mitchell to a four-year contract. ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported Mitchell's deal, with Garafolo adding it is for $16 million total with $5.5 million due in 2017. Mike Klis of 9News reported the Denver Broncos were \"close\" to signing Mitchell before the 49ers ultimately made a better offer. Mitchell has spent the last three seasons with the Miami Dolphins . He only appeared in nine games last season due to a calf injury but was a minimal contributor with just 17 combined tackles and zero sacks. The Dolphins cut Mitchell and Mario Williams on the same day last week to save $12.5 million in salary-cap space, per Omar Kelly of the Sun Sentinel .

Before the start of last season, Eric Eager of Pro Football Focus ranked Mitchell's contract with the Dolphins as the fifth worst among interior defensive linemen: \nPlaying alongside Ndamukong Suh in 2015, Mitchell struggled mightily, finishing 97 th among interior defensive linemen with a 64.1 overall grade . He was especially weak against the run, finishing 60 th among defensive tackles with a 4.2 run-stop percentage (for an overall run-defense grade of 34.2 ). He didn’t grade positively after Week 8 of 2015, accumulating just three stops and four pressures during that stretch. The 49ers badly needed to get bigger on the interior of their defensive line, especially with the oft-injured Glenn Dorsey being an unrestricted free agent. They had the NFL's worst run defense with 165.9 yards allowed per game, 22 more than any other team. Mitchell isn't going to transform the 49ers defense on his own, but he at least gives new head coach Kyle Shanahan depth to play with as he and general manager John Lynch continue to build a roster that fits their vision for the franchise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:35:25.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
