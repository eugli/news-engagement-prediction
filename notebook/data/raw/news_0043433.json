The Eagles will spend that money to improve the wide receiver position going after the likes of Alshon Jeffery , DeSean Jackson and others. \nWith the Eagles expected to release Mathews, Sproles turning 34 years old next season, and Barner becoming a restricted free agent, head coach Doug Pederson will need to get creative in finding ways to replace that production. \nThe best route for the Eagles is to find a No. 1 running back in free agency or the draft. If the Eagles go the free agency route, they need to find a player that would be a low-risk, high-reward signing. \nEddie Lacy is the running back that fits that profile. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have a crucial offseason ahead of them as the franchise looks to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

A powerful rusher who can wear a defense down, Lacy is tremendous at earning yards after contact and is a goal line presence for any team he signs with. If the Eagles release Mathews, they will need a short-yardage back to replace him. \nLacy had 71 carries for 360 yards in 2016 (averaging 5.03 yards per carry) in just five games for the Green Bay Packers, missing the remainder of the season with ankle surgery. \nIn four seasons with the Packers, the 26-year old Lacy has 3,335 yards and 23 touchdowns, averaging 4.4 yards per carry. Lacy had back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in 2013 and 2014, compiling 2,317 yards and 20 touchdowns. He also totaled 3,001 all-purpose yards and had 24 touchdowns. \nThe Eagles easily could get those numbers with Lacy, at the very least close to the totals he compiled in his best seasons with Green Bay behind an offensive line led by Jason Peters and Lane Johnson . \nThere are some obvious concerns if the Eagles were to sign Lacy, who is coming off ankle surgery and has constantly battled weight issues heading into camp. Lacy is still rehabbing his injured ankle and was reportedly fined by the Packers as recently as last season for being overweight during the year. \nSigning Lacy would be a risk, but his market value (set at $2.8 million) may pay huge dividends for the Eagles. If Lacy recovers from his ankle properly, the Eagles will have a bonafide No. 1 running back for 2017. With Lacy in the fold, the Eagles can select their future running back in the later rounds of the 2017 draft, leaving running back an inexpensive position. \nAccording to Spotrac , the Eagles can sign Lacy at two years, $5.7 million. Even if that value goes up in free agency, that's a risk worth taking for Philadelphia.
