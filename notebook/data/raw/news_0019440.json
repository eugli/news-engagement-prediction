Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United could be set to lose out on Benfica defender Nelson Semedo , according to latest reports. \nSemedo was repeatedly linked with United in the January transfer window, but Portuguese outlet O Jogo claims Bayern Munich are now set to swoop. \nPhilipp Lahm has announced his intention to retire in the summer, leaving the Bundesliga Champions searching for a replacement for their captain. \nBack-up right-back Rafinha is also entering the final year of his contract with Bayern. \nAnd that could spark a summer transfer battle for Semedo, who has been valued at around £35m. \nReal Madrid's interest in David De Gea has reportedly been resurrected, with the Spanish side able to sign players again this summer following a transfer ban. Read More Manchester United transfer plans revealed by Ed Woodward \nDe Gea has addressed speculation , which has so far centred on a move back to the Spanish capital for the United No.1. \nBut The Sun reports Juventus could enter the race for his signature - should they fail to sign AC Milan stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma. \nJuve keeper Gianluigi Buffon is a legend of the game, but the Serie A giants are looking for his long-term replacement, and reportedly see De Gea as a plan B should their domestic rivals prove determined to hold on to their teenage star. \nKeita Balde is reportedly the subject of interest from United and AC Milan - and the Lazio fans don’t like it. \nAccording to Gazetta Dello Sport , the fans have 'turned on him' and painted a message on the wall of the club’s training ground telling him to concentrate on his own club. \nHe is currently stalling on signing a new deal at Lazio, and the Italian press believes he will be on his way in the summer.
