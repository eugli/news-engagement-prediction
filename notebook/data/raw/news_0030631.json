A year later — with many of the same players on the court — Pike won, perhaps, its biggest game in program history and found itself just two wins away from a state title. \nFourth-ranked Pike (23-3) used a second-half comeback — with the game-winner coming on a layup by junior guard Angel Baker in the final seconds — to stun top-ranked and undefeated North Central, 61-59, in overtime of the Class 4A Decatur Central regional final. \nIt’s the first regional title in school history for the Red Devils, who advance to semistate to play Columbus North at either Richmond or Jeffersonville. \nNorth Central, which beat Pike twice in the regular season, finishes 27-1. \n“We talked about last season,” Pike coach Bob Anglea said. “We want to build a program, and (last year) was not who we were. These players needed love. It’s about family. I’m so proud of them. In my 12 years of coaching, this has been the most fun year.” Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
