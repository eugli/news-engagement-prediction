If you'd like to learn more... - \nPolice issued a statement Tuesday afternoon to warn the public about a convicted violent offender. They say they have “reasonable grounds to believe he will commit another violent offence against someone while in the community.” \nTimothy Preddy, 51, has a history of violence including “intimate partner violence,” according to police. \nThey said he will be living in the Edmonton area and they are seeking a recognizance order on him, adding he will be closely-monitored by the EPS behavioural assessment unit. \nPreddy has been released but under a number of court-ordered conditions including that he: \n•Must abide by a curfew of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily \n•Must abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption of alcohol and drugs, including marijuana \n•Must not be found in any tavern, bar, lounge, nightclub or any establishment where the primary focus is the consumption or sale of alcohol \n•Must not associate, directly or indirectly, with any person known to have a criminal record or awaiting criminal prosecution without prior approval \n•Must not own, possess, carry or have in a place of residence any weapons. \nThe EPS said it decided to issue the warning after considering privacy concerns but believes that “it is clearly in the public interest to inform the members of the community.” \nIn 2008, Preddy – who is from Edmonton – was accused of holding two women against their will in Valemount, B.C. \nHe was charged with forcible confinement after police said they found a woman running down a street with her hands bound behind her back. Police then checked a nearby motorhome and found another woman who had been tied-up with an electrical cord. \nThey added the warning was intended to give Edmontonians a chance to take “suitable precautionary measures” but warned against people taking any form of vigilante action.Preddy is 6’2″ and 234 pounds with blue eyes and grey hair. \nAnyone with any information about any potential breaches of these conditions by Preddy can contact the Edmonton Police Service at 780-423-4567. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
