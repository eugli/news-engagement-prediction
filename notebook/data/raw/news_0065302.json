But the sad thing is…this seems like some sort of avant garde 4channer parody but given how the world is now, it’s almost impossible to tell. I mean everything this account is saying seems like things that a Jezebel reader might utter (more like udder amirite) if he/she/it were feeling particularly ornery and feeling like deconstructing the very fabrics of civilized society. It’s absolutely believable in the twisted sense that any mad libs view of gender norms is believable these days: \nIt’s a very blurred line between what could be parody and what could be reality given what’s going on out there and especially online these days. Are the things this Twitter account is saying even actual gender definitions? Maybe? I don’t know? It’s sort of hard to keep track unless someone gives me a laminated placard reminding me of what counts and what doesn’t count as a gender or world view or sexual preference these days. But looking at this…you just know someone out there genuinely believes in something very similar to it all and they’re out there waiting to strike or at least huff and roll their eyes the next time you hold the door at Trader Joe’s. \nSo overall I’m going to file this one away as a parody, a parody that hits way too close to home. But a worthwhile parody all the same: \nRIP Club Dave", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:50:01.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
