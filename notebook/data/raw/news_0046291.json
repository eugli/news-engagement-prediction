It is really upsetting and distressing” \nHis mum, nursery manager Sarah Allen, 36, said photos of Jasper’s infected chickenpox sores were stolen by social media crooks. \nFacebook pages had been set up claiming that little Jasper has cancer, and saying his family need money for surgery. \nThe scamming practice is known as “Like Farming”. \nThe Sun Online understands the images were removed by Facebook for privacy violations and the accounts in question have also been disabled for violating Facebook’s policies. What is 'Like Farming' \n“Like Farming” is a practice on social media in which scammers attempt gain as many ‘likes’ or ‘shares’ on a page to gather as large an audience as possible. Once they have achieved enough ‘likes’ through popular or emotive content, they will replace the original post with advertising in a bid to ‘cash-in’ on the popularity of the original posts. It is directly prohibited by Facebook’s rules, however it can be difficult for social media bosses to rule on whether original posts are real or fake until it is too late. \nSarah, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire, claims that she has reported similar instances of the images being used to Facebook at least 30 times in the past. \nMum-of-two Sarah, who also has a daughter Poppy, six, with 38-year-old postman husband Keit, said: “I first saw and reported the pictures two or three weeks ago.

It’s not the fact they stole the pictures, it’s the fact they’re lying – cancer is not something you should joke about. \n“I have had friends and family call up thinking Jasper actually has cancer. It is really upsetting and distressing. \n“I’ve even seen people commenting on the post offering to transfer donations. \n“I think it is disgusting. They are scammers. They can’t be real human beings, because no person would think this is OK. They are making up lies. Mercury Press 9 Jasper’s mum says that photos of Jasper’s infected chickenpox sores have been stolen by social media crooks \n“I commented on the post and said ‘you sick b d, this is my son, he does not have cancer, take these pictures down’ and the page liked my comment. \n“What Jasper went through was awful but it was nothing compared to cancer – that’s why you shouldn’t just throw something like that around. It is not a joke. \n“Facebook can achieve amazing things, but sometimes it fails you.” \nSarah claimed last year that her son was rushed to hospital less than 48 hours after being refused an appointment at her local doctor’s surgery. \nShe claims that a receptionist did not think his condition was severe enough to warrant a visit. Mercury Press Sarah claimed last year that her son was rushed to hospital less than 48 hours after being refused an appointment at her GP Mercury Press 9 The fake post claims: “Facebook has decided to help by giving. 1 Like = 2 dollars. 1 Comment = 4 dollars. 1 Share = 8 dollars” \nSince then she has launched a petition calling on the government to make a vaccination against the disease. \nHowever the fake post claiming Jasper has cancer, which also claims that Facebook bosses have agreed to donate money for his surgery, has more shares than her original awareness message. \nIt reads: “This little baby has cancer and he need money for surgery. Facebook has decided to help by giving. 1 Like = 2 dollars. 1 Comment = 4 dollars. 1 Share = 8 dollars. Please don’t scroll down without typing Amen.” Mercury Press The fake post has not been taken down, racking up 1.2million shares, 239,000 likes and 149,000 comments Mercury Press 9 Sarah says she has similar scams are being carried out using images of other children too \nThe furious mum says she has reported the pictures to Facebook, claiming copyright breach, child nudity and inappropriate content. \nThe post is still visible however and has now racked up 1.2million shares, 239,000 likes and 149,000 comments. \nSarah said: “Seeing those photos keep coming up on Facebook is hard – it was a horrible time. And it isn’t just Jasper – they are doing this to people all the time. Mercury Press 9 The angry mum said: “I keep reporting it constantly, lots of my friends have reported it too” \n“Everyone is commenting on the posts saying it is not cancer, it is a little boy with chicken pox.“I have reported it for nudity, for copyright and for inappropriate content – about 30 times in total.“I have had so many people message me about it and I keep reporting it constantly, lots of my friends have reported it too.“I received a message from Facebook saying it had been removed but it is still there.“Apparently these fake pages share as much as they could to get likes and followers, then when they have enough they sell the page to someone who wants it for business. Mercury Press 9 The fake posts have been shared more widely than Sarah’s awareness campaign \n“Now this fake post has more shares than my petition calling on the government to make the chickenpox vaccination part of the NHS’ routine childhood immunisation schedule.“Facebook need to make the reporting process better and take things like this down straight away. You can’t even have a breastfeeding photograph on Facebook without it being taken down, but somehow this is fine?” \nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
