Monday for meetings about crime, transportation and infrastructure projects after another bloody Chicago weekend that left two innocent girls — one 11, the other 12 — shot in the head.\nBy mid-afternoon, mayoral press secretary Matt McGrath had confirmed what the Sun-Times already had reported: That Emanuel met at the White House with President Donald Trump’s son-in-law (and top adviser) Jared Kushner and other senior administration officials.\nThe mayor was also scheduled to meet with Department of Justice, the Federal Aviation Administration, Amtrak and with Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren.\n“Public safety is a top priority for everyone, and over the course of the day the Mayor reiterated his request for added federal resources including ex-offender programs, mentoring and increased federal gun prosecution in Chicago, as well as additional federal agents,” McGrath wrote in an email to the Sun-Times.\nSources also said Emanuel was to meet with Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs honcho now serving as director of the National Economic Council.\nThe mayor was also scheduled to meet with with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nAlthough Emanuel and Trump strongly disagree on the issues of immigration and stop-and-frisk policing, they are likely to find common ground on the President’s drive for a massive federal infrastructure bill.\nLast week, Emanuel staked his claim to a share of any new federal program by outlining a 40,000-job sequel to the 2012 plan he called “Building a New Chicago.”\nIt includes forging ahead with a high-speed rail line between downtown and O’Hare Airport, delivering on his 2011 campaign promise to extend the CTA’s Red Line South to 130th Street and finally following through on plans to “renovate and expand” Union Station.\n“I am making it a priority to get this done,” Emanuel said of the Union Station project he hopes will be bankrolled by $1 billion in federal funding.\nOn the same day, Trump met with a group of airport and airline executives and voiced his strong support for airport express service.\nAccording to Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans , who was in attendance, Trump noted that his world travels have taken him to cities that have two express trains whisking travelers from downtown centers to major airports. The President bemoaned the fact that the United States doesn’t even have one.\nEmanuel is hoping that Chicago will be the guinea pig.\nIf the Sessions meeting can be arranged, Emanuel was likely to talk about his commitment to turn an agreement in principle with the Justice Department into a detailed consent decree that culminates in the hiring of a federal monitor to ride herd over the Chicago Police Department.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Sessions promised to step up prosecutions of gun crimes to stop a surge in violent crime fueled by the 60 percent spike in Chicago homicides.\nHe also said police officers in Chicago and across the nation were “unfairly” blamed for the “unacceptable actions of a few bad actors” and reaffirmed his opposition to consent decrees.\nAnother top mayoral aide, who asked to remain anonymous, said crime would absolutely be on the agenda. A third Emanuel confidante described the meetings as “relationship building,” noting that there is “no relationship right now” between Emanuel and the Trump administration.\n“He’s not going into these meetings to say, `I need these five things. He’s going in to say, `We need to establish an open line of communication so we can discuss these important issues,’ ” the mayoral confidante said.\n“The mayor has ideas on how the Trump administration can be helpful on infrastructure and public safety. But first and foremost, he needs to establish a relationship” with the new administration.\nThe Washington meetings follow yet another another violent Chicago weekend that saw Takiya Holmes, 11, and Kanari Gentry, 12, shot in the head. Both girls were innocent victims struck by stray bullets.\nTrump has been beating up on Chicago on an almost daily basis for the unrelenting gang violence that has pushed the number of homicides and shootings to levels not seen since the 1990s.\nHe has threatened to “send in the FEDS” if Emanuel can’t find a way to stop the bloodshed. Almost every chance he gets, the president wonders aloud “What the hell is going on in Chicago?”\nAfter a Becoming-a-Man mentoring session at Hyde Park Academy last month, Emanuel made it clear that his patience was wearing thin with Trump’s repeated attacks on Chicago crime.\nThe mayor noted then that, out of 77 Chicago neighborhoods, 37 saw a reduction in shootings and homicides last year. In the first month of this year, 57 neighborhoods saw a reduction from the violence experienced in January 2016, which was a reduction from the same period the year before that.\nObviously referring to Trump’s portrayal of Chicago as an out-of-control war zone, Emanuel said: “It’s not a description of this city. You guys know this. You’re the press. This is your home, too. Come on. … This is a great city. It’s a fabulous city. I’m going to go from here and talk about a half-a-billion investment Major League Soccer announced yesterday that is [the league’s] all-star game [coming to Chicago]. And Caterpillar is making a decision about the Chicago area.”\nThe mayor said on that day that he was well aware of “what the challenges are.” The Chicago Police Department divides the city into 22 districts, and half of the city’s homicides are in three of them. That’s why the city is putting “all of the technology and human resources into those areas to actually deal with the police side.”\n“None of us are gonna rest until all parts of the city — every parent — feels that their kids can enjoy a childhood and have a normal childhood so they can realize their potential,” the mayor said.\nTrump used Chicago as a whipping post during the campaign — so much so that the City Council voted to punish him by removing the honorary street sign outside the riverfront hotel and condominium complex that bears the President’s name.\nThe attacks have continued unabated since Trump took office.\nLast week, the President asserted without proof that “illegal immigrant gang members” were responsible for the surge in Chicago homicides and shootings.\nThe remarks before a law enforcement group marked the eighth time since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration that Trump had shined an unflattering spotlight on Chicago violence.\nThe President’s attacks on Chicago have come with such frequency, it was worth a mention in, yet another “Saturday Night Live” skit lampooning Trump’s top aides.\nIn one skit, comedian Melissa McCarthy reprising her role as White House press secretary Sean Spicer, erroneously claims that “80 percent” of the people living in Chicago had been shot.\n“With all the talk and no action, you have to wonder whether the administration is serious about working with us on solutions, or if they are just using violence in this great city to score political points,” McGrath said last week.\n“We’ve been clear, there are ways the federal government can help, and we’re happy to partner with the administration whenever they decide to stop talking and start acting.”\nEmanuel previously has said there are “other things that have to happen” like mentoring, and that’s where he hopes the federal government steps in.\nEmanuel renewed his pitch for federal help to hire more officers, expand police technology, rebuild impoverished neighborhoods and augment the city’s efforts to provide afterschool programs and mentoring for at-risk youth. He described the federal and state governments as being “AWOL” from those efforts in recent years.\nAsked if he knew why Trump “is so fixated” on Chicago crime, the mayor said: “I don’t. He’s an investor in Chicago, so he obviously believes in it.”\nEmanuel renewed his pitch for federal help to hire more officers, expand police technology, rebuild impoverished inner-city neighborhoods and augment the city’s efforts to provide afterschool programs, summer jobs and mentoring for at-risk youth.\n“You can do what you’re doing in Englewood. But, if there isn’t a mentoring program, a summer job or an activity, it’s not gonna solve the problem. It can prevent bad things from having, but to solve the problem … is what B.A.M. and summer jobs and investments in summer jobs do,” the mayor said.\n“And we’ve got to be honest, guys. The federal government — and our state government — has been AWOL in that mission.”\nTold that Trump would like to visit Chicago, Emanuel said, “What I would really like is the federal resources.”\nAfter joining Emanuel for the mentoring session, Cubs President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein was even more outspoken in his criticism of Trump.\n“Honestly, it seems like grandstanding to me personally,” Epstein said of Trump’s relentless attacks on Chicago.\n“Federal resources are more important than words to create headlines for the President. There are a lot of specific requests that Chicago has made of the federal government. Starting by addressing those specifics in a constructive way would be really helpful.”\nPressed to assess the damage Trump’s attacks have done to Chicago’s image on the national and world stage, Epstein said: “I’m focused more — and I think the mayor is focused more — on progress and solutions than on any damage that might be done by some sort of political grandstanding. The mayor is focused on finding real-world solutions like B.A.M.”\nEpstein then referred back to Trump’s tweeted threat to “send in the FEDS” to fix the problem if Chicago can’t.\n“By feds, what did he mean? Did he mean military? Who knows what he meant? But the solutions are grass-roots, like this mentoring program. They’re economic and social and political. There are myriad ways to improve the situation. But maybe just sort of making headlines isn’t necessarily the right way.”\n Chicago crime donald trump Chicago", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/editboard-09_66442825.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/twogirlsnew021217b.jpg?w=100", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-23ri", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-23g3", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kumar2.jpg?w=100", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-22Tb", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/emanuel-3-5.jpg?w=100"], "published": "2017-02-13T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:07:24.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
