Please don’t make up attacks.”\nIt didn’t end there. Conway responded to the former first daughter several hours later with an equally scathing tweet referencing mother Hillary Clinton ‘s false claim that she landed in Bosnia under heavy sniper fire in 1996.\n“Bosnia lie a Great reminder,” Conway wrote. “And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can’t “invent” quality candidates either. I misspoke; you lost the election.”\nVery grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack …or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre.

I misspoke; you lost the election https://t.co/7TwnX2b5yA\n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017\nConway cited the phony “Bowling Green massacre” on Thursday in an effort to defend President Trump’s controversial executive order temporarily banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\nThe 50-year-old later clarified that she was referring to the two Iraqi men who lived in the city when they were arrested for “terrorist activities.”\nMohanad Hammadi and Waad Alwan admitted to using improvised explosive devices against U.S. soldiers in Iraq — not in Bowling Green — and were accused of attempting to send money and weapons to al-Qaeda, according to the Department of Justice .\nHammadi was sentenced to life in federal prison and Alwan was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison followed by a life term of supervised release, according to the Department.\nIn the interview, Conway also noted that former President Barack Obama first identified the countries affected by Trump’s ban: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\nShe added that Trump’s controversial policy is similar to “what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.”\nHowever, Obama did not ban visas for Iraqi refugees for six months.\nIn 2016, Obama added Somalia, Yemen and Libya to a list of “countries of concern,” slowing down visa approvals for those who had visited the countries after March 1, 2011, according to The Hill . Iraq, Iran, Syria and Sudan have been on the list since 2015, the publication reports.\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\nThe visa restrictions came in the aftermath of Hammadi and Alwan’s arrests, but there was never a point when Iraqi refugees were banned from entering the U.S. under Obama’s administration, the Post reports.\nThere were, however, more extensive background checks and vetting procedures imposed, thus slowing down visa approvals, according to the Post .\nClinton wasn’t the only one to go after Conway on social media. Here are some of the tweets criticizing her “Bowling Green massacre” gaffe:\nSaddened and sickened by Frederick Douglass' silence surrounding the Bowling Green Massacre.\n— Natasha Rothwell (@natasharothwell) February 3, 2017\nI wrote a doctoral thesis on the Bowling Green Massacre and now I have a Ph.D from Trump University.
