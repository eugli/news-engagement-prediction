Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nVeganuary might have been and gone, but there's never been a better time to be vegan - especially in Manchester. \nAs the birthplace of the Vegetarian Society, it's no surprise that Manchester has always been a step ahead when it comes to looking after those who have chosen a meat-free lifestyle. \nBut for the vegans among us, it hasn't always been easy - especially when it came to eating out. \nNow all that is changing, and the city is shouting loud and proud about its vegan offerings. All the food \nFrom slap-up vegan breakfasts, meat and dairy-free supper clubs to Manchester's latest foodie addition Bundobust , the choices for vegans on Manchester's ever growing menus has never been better. \nExcept for a few meat-only establishments ( you know who you are ), a lot of restaurants and bars now cater for vegans. \nAnd not just token dishes either. Never again will you have to pick at a limp, dressing-free salad and a sad-looking baked potato (minus the butter, obviously) as your mates tuck into mountains of food. Or have the choice of just one item from the allergy menu. The Return of the Mac burger at V Rev in Manchester \nNow Manchester has a whole bunch of vegan restaurants catering for all tastes. \nFrom award-winning junk food paradise V Rev on Edge Street , serving up meat and dairy-free burgers, hotdogs, nachos, loaded fries and cake shakes, to fine-dining establishment The Allotment in Stockport , where, according to owner Matthew Nutter, you can get aubergine that tastes better than steak - veganism is being put firmly on the map in Manchester. Matthew Nutter at The Allotment in Stockport (Photo: Sean Hansford) \nThen there's Teatime Collective in Hulme - serving an ever-changing menu of 'steaks', burgers, tacos, and sandwiches in the unique setting of a shipping container; Mod's Cafe at The Thirsty Scholar and The Globe in Glossop dishing out vegan pub grub; The Earth Cafe in the city centre, which has an array of ethical and hearty organic produce on offer; Peacock and Juno an all-vegan bakery on Granby Row also in the city centre and Cowherds - a vegan lunch wagon - which is in the process of relocating. \nFurther out, Lolo's Vegan and Raw restaurant and cocktail bar has brought some 1920s-style glamour to the vegan scene over in Ramsbottom, serving homemade soups, salads and sandwiches and fancy pies and pasta in the evening. And at Altrincham Market, Gud offers fresh vegan street food to the masses, with an ever-changing menu of specials. Lolo's Vegan Restaurant, Ramsbottom \nAnd for those looking after the pennies, Manchester Vegan and Wellbeing Centre has opened in Afflecks, offering healthy vegan food from £3 to £5 - and pizza made from quinoa! \nAnd you can't forget good old Go! Falafel. Read More \nOn top of that there are loads of vegetarian restaurants that offer vegan options . LOADS. \nIf it's Indian you're after then Lily's Vegetarian Cafe in Ashton , newbie Bundobust in the city centre, Fallowfield's Sanskruti and Jaipur Palace offer excellent vegan dishes. Cantonese lovers can't go wrong at Lotus vegetarian Kitchen, while Fuel in Withington, Sidney Street Cafe in The Joyce Layland LGBT centre and Eighth Day on Oxford Road all serve up affordable home-made delights. \nAnd of course, there are also the upmarket destinations of choice for many herbivores - Greens in Didsbury and Bistro 1847 in the city centre. \nNew to the veggie dining scene this year is Malaysian restaurant Secret Diner in Levenshulme - with plenty of vegan options on the menu, including pickle and seitan bao and vegetable rendang rolls. And they do regular supper clubs catering for vegans. \nAnd for lunch on the go, the well-stocked Veggie Deli in Chorlton has a great selection of vegan wraps, calzones, pies, quiches and rolls, as well as lots and lots of delicious cakes. One of Deaf Institute's daily vegan specials (Photo: Deaf Institute Twitter) Read More \nBut if you can't persuade your friends to go even one meal without meat, then never fear. There's a whole range of restaurants that offer up plenty of vegan choices - and even whole separate vegan menus - so everybody wins. \nFrom full vegan breakfasts, sandwiches, pies, pizzas and desserts to full dining experiences, the choices are endless. \nAnd Dough, Handmade Burger Co, The Pasta Factory, Lunya, Mowgli, Ning, Banyan Bar and Kitchen, Pie and Ale, Ocean Treasure 235, The Deaf Institute, This & That, Zouk, The Cosy Club, Evelyn's, The Koffee Pot, Bakerie, Odd, Trof, Soup Kitchen, West Corner deli, and Nexus Art Cafe are just a few in the city centre doing just that. Vegan Tiffin Box at Mowgli's (Photo: Mowgli Street Food) Read More 12 amazing vegan dishes at Manchester restaurants (where your meat-eating mates can also get fed) \nIf that wasn't enough, many chain restaurants have also jumped on the vegan bandwagon offering cruelty-free options for some of their dishes, including Carluccios, Changos, Zizzi, Pret, Las Iguanas, Wagamama, Wahaca, Subway, Pizza Express, Pizza Hut, Bella Italia, Wetherspoons, Greggs and even You Sushi. (Although ingredients can change so check before ordering). For those with a sweet tooth... \nIf you've still got room after all that, then are also plenty of places that serve vegan-friendly desserts - from cakes, ice creams and chocolate brownies to pastries and biscuits, you really are spoilt for choice in good old Manchester. \nIce Shack in Withington offers 75 different vegan items - 75! - from ice cream and truffles to cakes and pastries. They also do soyashakes and have soy milk and almond milk available for hot drinks. \nOver in Chorlton, Tea Hive has a range of vegan dishes and amazing cakes, while vegan artisan bakers Nicely Kitchen in Sale have doughnuts, shortbread, apple cake, brownies and truffles for sale. They also hold a pop up shop at many food festivals. \nBut it's the city centre that really delivers. \nBased in Arndale Market, Simone's - Manchester's first healthy bakery - serves vegan-friendly cheesecakes, brownies, flapjacks and cupcakes. And hidden gem The Oak Street Cafe, tucked away in Manchester Craft and Design Centre, is well worth searching out. They have a huge selection of fresh cakes and always have vegan and gluten-free options. \nCommon also serves up a selection of vegan treats - courtesy of Blawd Bakehouse based in the basement, which also supplies Rapha cycle club and coffee house, off King Street, at weekends. \nFig and Sparrow on Granby Row is an all-vegan bakery with all sorts of sweet treats (as well as savoury offerings and party food) and V-Rev also has its own bakery offering plant-based treats to eat in or take away. \nOrganic bakers Tyler and Hall Bakery produces amazing vegan protein brownies. You can get them at Kettlebell kitchen on Great Ancoats Street, Grano café at MMU, and Village Greens co-op in Prestwich, among others. \nAnd if cake is your thing, then head on down to Ezra and Gill in the Northern Quarter, which has a selection of vegan-friendly sweet treats thanks to Black Cat Cakery (a mostly vegan cake bakers) that also supplies Eighth Day, Z-Arts Café, The Molly House, Wonder Inn, Banyan, and The Spoon Inn in Chorlton, among others. \nFoundation Coffee on Lever Street is another of their customers and a must for any cake-lover - with nine vegan sponges and brownies on offer including raspberry and vanilla cake, almond, chocolate and pistachio sponge, and sticky ginger cake, as well as soy milk for that all-important cup of coffee.

(Photo: Brewdog Manchester Facebook) This brunch club in Manchester could be the answer to every hungover vegan's prayers \nMarble Brewery is another that is vegan-friendly - meaning the The Marble Beer House in Chorlton and the Marble Arch in the city centre are on the list. \nBack in the Northern Quarter, Bakerie does a wide variety of vegan wine, including Genoli Rioja Blanco, Mainklang Gruner Veltliner and Santa Tresa Grillo. And V-Rev Diner - which recently moved to bigger premises on Edge Street in the Northern Quarter - now has a bar selling boozy milkshakes, cocktails, draft lager, ciders and wine - that are all vegan. The Thirsty Scholar on Oxford Road (Photo: The Thirsty Scholar Facebook) \nOver on Oxford Road The Thirsty Scholar - which serves up vegan pub grub - has plenty of vegan beers, ales and wines to choose from. \nIf it's beer you're after then Beermoth is the place top go, with dozens of vegan-friendly bottles on the shelves of the shop on Tib Street in the Northern Quarter. \nAnd if it's wine you want then head over to Cork of the North on Northenden Road in Sale run by New Order DJ Mark Hough. They have a variety of vegan-friendly wines (and beers) in their bar - and also in the shop, so you can stock up. \nLocal breweries that produce vegan beer and ales include Blackjack, Cloudwater, Marble, and Runaway so keep an eye out for them at bars around the city. \nAnd if you do overdo it, you can always enjoy the all-day vegan hangover menu every Sunday at The Deaf Institute. Vegan fairs \nGone are the days where if you went to a food festival you had to lurk about outside eating a falafal wrap before holding your breath and joining your mates at the meat-laden BBQ. \nNow, there are special festivals dedicated to all things vegan. Despite it only being February, there has already been two this year in Manchester, including Grubs Extraveganza. But if you missed them, never fear, there's two huge ones to look forward to....(and no doubt loads more coming up). The Northern Vegan Festival A huge three-day vegan festival is coming to Manchester \nOn April 1 The Northern Vegan Festival will take over four venues when it returns to Manchester. It will bring more than 200 stalls - selling vegan food and drink, medicine, jewellery, and toiletries - as well as cookery demos, film screenings, talks and a pop up street food cafe to Manchester Central. \nThe festival will have a spin-off vegan beer, wine and cider festival, running at nearby pub The Thirsty Scholar, on New Wakefield Street, from noon until 3am. \nAnd the consumer magazine Vegan Life is also launching its first three-day festival celebrating an animal-friendly lifestyle in Manchester this spring. \nTickets for the event on Saturday, April 1 are £5, although under-14s go free with adults using pre-purchased tickets. tacos from Yakumama \nTaking place at EventCity near the Trafford Centre, from Friday May 19 to Sunday May 21, Vegan Life Live will celebrate all aspects of vegan life, from food and drink to charities and cosmetics. \nThe food line-up includes London-based Mooshies Vegan Burgers, street food from The Indian Lunch Box, and fresh vegan sushi wraps from the Brighton-based Happy Maki.
