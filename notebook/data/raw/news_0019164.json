And as he defends the first military mission he approved, Trump, who did not himself serve in the military or Vietnam, is again tangling with fellow Republican John McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former POW. The decision to take on veterans could put Trump on shaky ground: The President never served in the military and received student and health deferments that kept him out of serving in the war. In a string of tweets on Thursday morning, Trump took on McCain for suggesting his first military action -- a raid in Yemen that netted intelligence against ISIS, but cost the lives Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens and a number of Yemeni civilians -- was not a success . Trump also lashed out against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who told reporters on Wednesday that Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court pick, told him that he felt Trump's comments about the judiciary branch were \"demoralizing\" and \"disheartening.\" Trump's tweets appear to be an attempt to quiet dissent, even from those within his party. McCain, who was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and was held as a prisoner of war until 1973, questioned Trump's raid earlier this week, suggesting that the White House should not have called in a \"success\" because Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed.

That drew the ire of Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, who said Wednesday that \"anyone who would suggest it's not a success does a disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens.\" Spicer went on to say those questioning the raid should apologize. Trump, who once dismissed McCain's time as a POW, saying \" I like people who weren't captured \", hit McCain on Twitter over the Yemen raid. ..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a \"failure.\" Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 There is another problem for Trump suggesting that questioning the success of a military raid is out of bounds: He routinely questioned the wisdom of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during the 2016 campaign, despite once saying he was in favor of going into Iraq. \"I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East,\" Trump said during a debate in August 2015. \"And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that's exactly what happened.\" Trump, however, said in 2002 on a radio show that he was in favor of invading Iraq. Trump's comments about McCain came after Blumenthal told reporters that Gorsuch said during a meeting that Trump's tweets about the judiciary were \"demoralizing\" and \"disheartening.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:11:10.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
