So with that in mind, this flight merits a disclaimer: if you are looking to fly direct to India by any means necessary, my flight plan will get you there. However, if you value a pleasant trip, a decent degree of personal space and a business class that feels like actual business class for every reason aside from lay-flat seats, this may not be for you. I flew Economy, in a bulkhead seat (my secret tip for anyone not looking to splurge on business class on airlines where there is no Economy Plus cabin) on Air India.\nOn one of our days touring around Delhi, I snapped this shot of the gates leading to the Prime Minister's home and various government buildings. Carrie Goldberg with Leica Q The flight was direct from JFK to Delhi–and on it I learned the true meaning of patience, and gained an understanding of just how different India would be culturally from my norm. I was seated between two mothers of young children and was immediately thrust into the role of babysitter. I became an in-flight aunt to two adorable young Indian baby girls, and it was assumed that I would relinquish control to my desire to sleep and maintain a sense of personal space during the almost 15-hour flight. There were two movies on board that didn't seem to have issues buffering, and I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada for the 21st and 22nd time–and that was just on the way there. I am no stranger to flying economy on long-distance flights or having to suffer through a crying baby on board, but what I was not accustomed to were the endless calls for in-flight meals. On Air India, it's customary to wake passengers for each of three meals served on board. On the way home, when I discovered that flying on national holidays like Diwali or Holi results in almost empty aircrafts, I sprawled out, requested that nobody wake me for anything other than an emergency, and slept the entire flight.", "external_links": ["http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/640x426/gallery-1487777482-hbz-jbf-india-11.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x1066/gallery-1487777482-hbz-jbf-india-11.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/768x512/gallery-1487777482-hbz-jbf-india-11.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/480x320/gallery-1487777482-hbz-jbf-india-11.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x800/gallery-1487777312-hbz-jaipur-index.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:54:07.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
