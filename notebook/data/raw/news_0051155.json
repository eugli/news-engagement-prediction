On Facebook the filmmaker said the website will function as a “24/7 clearinghouse of the already MASSIVE resistance to Trump, to the Republican Congress and, yes, to many of the spineless Democratic politicians out there,” and he encouraged users to submit details for events including town hall sit-ins and pro-democracy rallies alike. \nWithin 48 hours of its launch, the calendar amassed hundreds of listings leading into the summer, including over a dozen events slated to occur this week when members of Congress hold town hall events with constituents. \n“So much is happening so fast it’s hard to keep track of all the actions popping up — but our intention is to do just that,” Mr. Moore wrote Monday on Facebook. \nMr. Moore was a vocal critic of Mr. Trump prior to his election, and said during a pre-inauguration interview on MSBC last month that he intended to be “busy, busy, busy” fighting Mr. Trump’s policies and leading “100 days of resistance” against his administration.
