Malaysia is ranked 161st in the FIFA list of 209 nations, we last qualified for the Olympic football tournament in 1980 and at the Asian Games level, last won a bronze medal at the Teheran Games in 1974. \nEven at the South-East Asian level, the last success was at the SEA Games in 2011 and the Asean Football Federation Cup a year earlier. \nMalaysian football needs a saviour and after what has been an acrimonious social media spat between Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) owner Tunku Mahkota of Johor (TMJ) Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim and former Kelantan Football Associa­tion (Kafa) president Tan Sri Annuar Musa, the two are now set to square off in the fight to be FA of Malaysia president on March 25. \nThe Tunku Mahkota has been given the go-ahead by his father, Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar while Annuar has already submitted his nomination form. \nAlso likely to be in the fray are Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin and FAM Integrity Committee chairman Tan Sri Aseh Che Mat. \nMany blame the long and unchallenged reign of former presidents as the main reason for the slump in the footballing fortunes. \nThe FAM has seen only five presidents in 59 years. The five are Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tun Abdul Razak, Tan Sri Hamzah Abu Samah and the long-serving Sultan Ahmad Shah who held the post from 1984 to 2014. \nHis son, the Pahang Regent Tengku Abdullah, took over, but stepped down last year. \nNow, the Johor Regent Tunku Ismail has been ordered by his father “to change Malaysian football” after a meeting with 14 FAM affiliates in Johor Baru yesterday. \nTunku Ismail’s success with his club JDT in a short period is commendable, but managing a national football body is a different ball game compared to running a club. \nAs the numero uno with JDT, he had a direct say over club matters, but in FAM, he would have to handle 19 affiliates and oversee various FAM committees. \nThe decision-making process in the national body differs from that of JDT and Tunku Ismail, who is known for his brash and outspoken ways, might have clashes with other officials, pushing Malaysian football further into disarray. \nAs a wealthy club owner, he bought the best talents, but with the national team, he faces the uphill task of making the best out of the limited talents available in the country. \nAnnuar, who openly clashed with Tunku Ismail, said before that he would withdraw if Khairy or the Johor Regent decided to contest for the presidency. \nHowever, the 60-year-old, was the first to throw his name into the ring. Annuar who could not reached for comments, posted a picture of himself handing over the forms to FAM on his Facebook page with the caption: “First nominee to accept the nomination ... on sporting spirit and for the love of sports.” \nAnnuar masterminded Kelantan’s rise from obscurity to Malaysian football’s zenith after he took over Kafa in 2007. \nUnder his leadership, the east coast side became a power house entering six finals in 11 years. \nThe Red Warriors also won the M-Lea­gue treble of the Super League, FA Cup and Malaysia Cup in 2012. \nBut unpaid players’ salaries and recent controversies over allegations of mismanagement in Mara, of which he was chairman, have tarnished his image. \nKhairy had previously served as FAM vice-president from 2007 to 2010, but could not bring much changes to Malaysian football and decided not to contest for a second term. \nAlthough he had pledged to withdraw from the contest if Tunku Ismail stands for election, he is still a favourite for the hot seat. \nHowever, there is a huge concern whether he would be able to juggle his ministerial portfolio and the FAM presidency. \nThere are over 50 national sports associations in the country and a minister should not let one sports association occupy most of his time or show any bias towards it. \nKhairy’s decision to run for the presidency is also subject to the Cabinet’s approval. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had already advised him to withdraw from the contest last week. \nFormer Putrajaya Corporation chairman Aseh is another man who is in with a shout. \nHe was handpicked by Tengku Ismail as the candidate for the presidency based on his experience heading government agencies and his neutrality. \nBut the 65-year-old is not a key figure in FAM and there was a huge question over whether he would be able to turn FAM into a well-oiled ma­­chinery like the government agencies, which he previously handled. \nOn March 25, Malaysian football will have a new head. \nThe question is: Can the winner take Malaysian football to new heights?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:30:03.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
