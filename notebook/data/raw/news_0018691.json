Background to Kingsmills \nNo one has been convicted for the Kingsmills atrocity. \nThe victims - textile factory workers - were shot dead when an IRA gang ambushed their mini-bus in 1976 near the County Armagh village of Kingsmills. \nAfter checking their religion, the gang ordered one Catholic colleague to leave. Image copyright PA Image caption The men were ordered out of their van before being shot \nThe 10 men killed were John Bryans, Robert Chambers, Reginald Chapman, Walter Chapman, Robert Freeburn, Joseph Lemmon, John McConville, James McWhirter, Robert Samuel Walker and Kenneth Worton. \nOnly one man survived the shootings - Alan Black, a 32-year-old father-of-three at the time. \nHe was seriously wounded and spent months recovering in hospital. \nOutlining the PPS decision, casework assistant director Michael Agnew said: \"We have given careful consideration to all the evidence currently available and have applied the test for prosecution. \n\"We have concluded that there is no reasonable prospect of a conviction, based on the available evidence and that the test for prosecution is therefore not met.\" \nThe sole survivor of the atrocity, Alan Black , expressed disappointment that \"no-one has been held to account\" for the murders. \nHowever, he added: \"At the same time, it lets us get on with the inquest, so maybe we'll get a few more questions answered through the inquest process. Image caption Alan Black, left, said he was disappointed no one has been held to account \n\"The PPS have really explained pretty well what they went on and how they made the decision and I'm reasonably satisfied that it was all above board. \n\"A policeman came to the door early this morning and handed me an envelope containing their decision and how they came to it. \n\"They seem to be pretty thorough about it all and I can understand why they didn't go forward with this prosecution.\" \nAsked if he believes justice will ever be served on those who killed the workmen, Mr Black said: \"That is a question I cannot answer, unless the gunmen take an attack of conscience and come forward, I doubt we will get all the truth, but we may get some. I am hopeful that we will get some answers.\" \nMr Agnew said that the families of those murdered had been informed of the decision and the reasons for it, and that the PPS had offered to meet them \"to answer any further questions that they may have\". \n\"We are also conscious that inquest proceedings are currently adjourned to allow for any criminal matters to be concluded and accordingly have advised the coroner of this decision,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:54:04.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
