If the atmosphere is a little awkward as the leaders tee off at Mar-a-Lago , it may have something to do with remarks Trump has made about Japan. \nAlong with China and Mexico, Japan was one of Trump's favorite punching bags on the campaign trail -- and his criticism hasn't stopped since he took office. \nHere are some of the most inflammatory things he has said about one of America's most important allies in Asia: \n'We want deal!' \nAt a rally in August 2015, Trump used broken English to impersonate Asian negotiators he's dealt with during his business career. \n\"Negotiating with Japan, negotiating with China -- when these people walk into the room, they don't say, 'Oh, hello, how's the weather? So beautiful outside, isn't it lovely? How are the Yankees doing? Oh, they're doing wonderful, great,'\" he said. \"They say, 'We want deal!'\" \nHis comments were criticized as an \"offensive parody\" by Mike Honda, a Democratic congressman for California. \nRelated: Wilbur Ross calls China 'the most protectionist country' \n'Abe and all of these killers' \nDuring another rally that month, Trump slammed Obama's choice of Caroline Kennedy as U.S. ambassador to Japan, suggesting she wasn't the right person for the job. \nKennedy was being \"wined and dined by Abe and all of these killers,\" Trump lamented. \"Wined and dined!\" \nThe context of the remarks suggests Trump was implying Abe and his colleagues are ruthless negotiators, but the choice of words to describe government officials from an important ally raised eyebrows. \nRelated: Trump wants to 'speed' up NAFTA talks \n'They're all taking our jobs' \nJapan is one of the countries Trump has repeatedly accused of \"killing\" the U.S. through unfair practices on trade. \n\"Whether it's China or Japan or Mexico, they're all taking our jobs, and we need jobs in this country,\" he said early in his campaign . \nSome commentators have found the inclusion of Japan in Trump's list puzzling, noting that the country has in recent decades become a symbol of economic stagnation. \n\"Mr. Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp about Japan,\" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said, referring to the era when the Japanese economy was still strong and seen as a serious rival to the U.S. \nRelated: Trump in 1989: Japan has 'sucked the blood out of America' \n'They have to protect themselves or they have to pay us' \nTrump sent shock waves through the international community early last year when he suggested some allies could develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the U.S. \n\"Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea,\" Trump told CNN in March . \"We are better off frankly if South Korea is going to start protecting itself ... they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.\" \nJapan remains the only country to have had nuclear weapons used against it -- in the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II -- and has had a pacifist constitution since the end of that conflict. \nRelated: Japan and South Korea hit back at Trump's nuclear comments \n'They can sit home and watch Sony television' \nTrump returned to the theme again and again during the campaign. In August, he laid into the U.S. treaty commitment to defend Japan. \n\"You know we have a treaty with Japan where if Japan is attacked, we have to use the full force and might of the United States,\" he said. \"If we're attacked, Japan doesn't have to do anything. They can sit home and watch Sony television, OK?\" \nUnder Abe, Japan has in fact become more willing to take responsibility for its own security and that of the region. Officials have cited changes to Japanese law that allow the country to take part in limited collective self-defense. \nDefense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defending Japan when he visited the country last week. \nRelated: Mattis in Asia: Fears soothed but uncertainty remains \n'I love Japan' \nAs with some of his other targets, Trump has mixed his jabs at Japan with positive language. \n\"I love Japan,\" he said during the campaign. \"We're going to have a great relationship with Japan.\" \nRelated: Japan says Trump's currency criticism is 'totally incorrect' \nAnd Trump's criticisms haven't deterred Abe from pursuing a close relationship. He became the first foreign leader to meet Trump in person after the U.S. election, emerging from Trump Tower saying he was \"convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have confidence.\" \nBut Trump's attacks on Japan have continued -- recent targets have included its currency and its auto industry -- prompting officials in Tokyo to express bewilderment and try to set the record straight. \nCNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published February 8, 2017: 9:47 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:52:56.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
