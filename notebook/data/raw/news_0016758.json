Pricing usually declines to a reasonable point, but only after those models are no longer shiny and new. If you don't want to wait, or don't have to, here are the tablets that offer a high-end experience for a premium price.\nWith speedy performance, sharp and colorful screens and comfortable-but-cool designs, tablet manufacturers make you pay for the perfect balance of fashion, function and quality -- literally. Whether you've been saving up all summer for a slate or are just picking up a third to use exclusively to buy rare caviar, these tablet picks are the best high-end buys any buck or bitcoin can cop.\nOne of the thinnest and lightest tablets available.\nJosh Miller/CNET For the Netflix addict Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Not to be confused with the smartwatch of the same name, the Galaxy Tab S2 comes in two sizes: a compact 8-inch model and a larger 9.7-incher . Both are stylishly slim and lightweight, rivaling the iPads for sleekest design, and amazingly vivid and colorful screens. If you want a tablet that's great for binge-watching on the go, you can't go wrong with either model. You might want to hold off, though. Rumor has it a new model is right around the corner .\nBig tablet with big dreams.\nSarah Tew/CNET For the artistic type Apple iPad Pro If you're more interested in making content than consuming it, the iPad Pro might be up your alley. It comes in a large 12.9-inch model , as well as a 9.7-inch model that's similar in size to the iPad Air 2 . Apple offers an optional keyboard and stylus -- called the Pencil -- that allows you to treat it like a laptop or notebook . It's not meant for heavy-duty work like a full-size laptop, but if you're an artist, it works as an exceptional digital canvas for making art.\nWrite on with Google's latest tablet.\nJosh Miller/CNET For the writer on the go Google Pixel C Less of a drawing person and more of a writer? The aluminum-wrapped Google Pixel C has one of the coolest, most compact designs of any tablet with a keyboard. Not only that, the keyboard, which attaches magnetically, doubles as a chic protective cover. Google 's known for making great Android tablets, however the company's really outdone itself with the Pixel C's impressive design. I think it's the best-looking tablet since the iPad .\nA tablet that's basically a laptop.\nSarah Tew/CNET For the student or businessperson Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Be honest with yourself: Are you just looking for a tablet that can replace your laptop? If so, look no further than the Surface Pro 4 . It has a larger screen and skinnier design than previous models, and houses the latest Intel processors. It's slim keyboard cover-case accessory is a big part of what makes it so great, but that's sold separately. Expect to pay top dollar for this laptop-replacement-worthy tablet.", "external_links": ["https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/FmeX94HQN3Df08pyXVIKZxIs2uE=/970x0/2015/11/10/ad5536a1-7b8b-4cb7-8061-e09d9036c279/ariel1.jpg", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/WYxpr2E0qYd4Wgtpgv6edVs4rXA=/970x0/2015/12/08/3ae47b5d-247b-4b60-88d4-8d84c5051319/cohchlytpicksyl-0325-003.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/ZMRx8nZFMRuToq0uXPMSt3tuyYs=/970x0/2015/10/16/278bddfb-aec1-4c45-ac20-5dc378770c87/microsoft-surface-pro-4-23.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/1HKudainVvDbbIS5dMigUt8oSuw=/970x0/2015/09/25/4128bf94-665c-4bfe-9590-f0e5fb0133ce/samsung-galaxy-tab-s2-2648-004.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:56:46.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
