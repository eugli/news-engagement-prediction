Image copyright BMC Zoology Image caption The system first identifies the location of the eyes and then breaks down characteristics of each pixel \nIdentifying individuals relied on cataloguing unique identifiers such as differences in body size or shape or the presence of scars or injuries. \nThe system, developed by Prof Anil Jain and his students at Michigan State University, used 462 photographs of 80 red-bellied lemurs living in Madagascar. The system also contained 190 images of other lemur species. Using a modified version of human facial recognition software, it was able to correctly identify the 80 individuals. \nDr Jacobs said that the method could be applied to other species such as red pandas and other bears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:28:35.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
