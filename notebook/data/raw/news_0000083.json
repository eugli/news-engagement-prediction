From “alternate facts” to “fake news” and outright misdirection tactics coined on reality television, the Trump administration seems keen to keep the conversation mill churning, with or without a fact check. Last night, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway (who memorably originated the term “ Alternate Facts ” during an on-air interview) defended Trump’s recent immigration ban of refugees and citizens from seven muslim countries by referencing alleged Iraqi refugee involvement in “the Bowling Green massacre.” If you’re unfamiliar, Conway asserted, that’s because “it didn’t get covered.” In fact, if you’re unfamiliar, it’s because it did not happen. (What did happen, as reported by the New York Times today: in 2011, two radicalized Iraqis were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky after attempting to send weapons and money to Al Qaeda in Iraq; both are currently in prison.) Social media exploded with outrage, and memes, and, you know, the truth, because—and it’s important to be reminded of this from time to time— the fact of the matter is, the truth matters. Especially when the lives of vulnerable people hang in the balance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T20:06:04.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
