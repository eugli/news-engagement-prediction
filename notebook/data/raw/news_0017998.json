It is not free.” \nLIVE: National Assembly filling up as MPs await arrival of Jacob Zuma for #SONA2017 \nAs they headed toward Adderley Street, they were stopped because they did not have a permit to march. Favoured as a protest march route, Adderley was off-limits because EFF supporters were already there. \nShouting the slogan of their political forebears “each one teach one” the children pushed against the riot police, who leaned into their small bodies with their shields. \nSome water was sprayed and a stray stone flew into the air. The children moved back, shouting “Zuma! Zuma! Zuma!”. \nCongress of SA Students’ leaders were in front of the march, which was eventually turned back to the Grand Parade.
