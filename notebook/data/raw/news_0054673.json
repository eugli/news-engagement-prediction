Whether you want to convert documents to PDF files, merge or split existing documents, or annotate and sign forms; macOS can do it all. \nYou’ll only need to reach for your wallet if you want more advanced PDF creation and editing tools, and we’ve got a few suggestions for those too. If you’re just looking for the best macOS PDF readers , we have a few alternatives to Preview for that 4 Best Free Mac Preview Alternatives for Reading PDFs 4 Best Free Mac Preview Alternatives for Reading PDFs If you're looking for a free Preview replacement for your PDF reading habit, here are the best free options out there. Read More too. Create PDFs from Almost Any App \nCreating PDF files is possible from just about any app that allows you to print on your Mac. That includes your browser, word processors, spreadsheet applications, even image editors The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X We thought it was about time we compiled a list of our favourite raster image editors for Mac OS X. Read More . One of the best uses for this is to save webpages as PDFs, directly within your browser. \nTo save as a PDF, head to the File > Print dialogue. In the bottom left corner should be a dropdown box that reads PDF . Click on it and choose Save PDF or one of the other options (like Open PDF in Preview ) to create a PDF document. \nSome applications may not display the PDF drop-down menu, but you can usually find it under the Print Settings or similar menu. You can even use some apps to “convert” supported filetypes to PDF. As an example, Preview can open .DOCX Microsoft Word files, just head to File > Print > PDF to convert. \nPreview can also open the following filetypes: AI, BMP, DNG, DAE, EPS, FAX, FPX, GIF, HDR, ICNS, ICO, JPEG/2000, OpenEXR, OBJ, CR2, PS, PSD, PICT, PDF, PNG, PNTG, QTIF, RAD, RAW, SGI, TGA, TIFF, XBM, PPT, and STL. Merge & Reorder PDF Documents \nYou can use Preview to merge PDF files, and re-order pages. To merge, simply open two or more PDF files with Preview by selecting them (using command+click ) then double clicking to launch Preview. Next enable thumbnail view under View > Thumbnails , then click and drag to reorder the pages as you see fit. \nTo merge two files, simply drag the pages of one document into another and hit save or command+s . You can undo any of your changes using the Undo tool by hitting command+z . \nAny files you want to merge must first be in .PDF format — you can’t open a .DOCX file and a .PDF file and merge the two. You’ll need to convert the .DOCX file to .PDF first , then open it and merge as explained above. Split Existing PDFs \nThere’s also the inelegant option of splitting PDFs, but it’s a bit of a hack. To isolate specific pages simply open your document, enable thumbnail view using View > Thumbnails , then select which pages you want to split into a new document using command+click . \nNote: If you want to isolate single pages into new documents, you’ll need to do this page-by-page. \nWhen you’re ready, head to File > Print and check Selected Pages in Sidebar . Click the PDF drop-down menu and save as a PDF document, send PDF to iCloud, or one of the other options there. You can then open the document and drag the pages to re-arrange them if you want. Annotate, Sign & Edit PDFs \nApple’s Preview app also has a handy toolbox for marking up documents, or even signing your name. Not all of these tools are ideal for use with PDF documents, not all of them work quite as expected. To access the tools click on the toolbox icon in Preview’s main toolbar, or use the shift+command+a keyboard shortcut. \nThe following tools are helpful and work great: The sketch tool is ideal for outlining documents, drawing arrows, underlining and so on. Preview will smooth out the lines, so your circles and squiggles don’t look like a hand-drawn mess. Shapes also work great, including the arrows and zoom feature for highlighting small text or details. The text tool can be handy for adding notes, and works a treat. You can also sign a document using the signature tool, which allows you to scrawl your personal mark using a trackpad (provided you have one) then place and scale it on the document. \nUnfortunately the notes tool doesn’t seem to work outside of Preview, which isn’t much use to people browsing your document using their browser or another PDF reader. Get More from Premium Software \nSo your Mac is a bit of a superstar when it comes to editing PDF documents, but this functionality is still pretty basic. If you’re going to spend a lot of time editing PDF files or creating your own from scratch, you should consider a more capable third-party tool. \nAdobe’s Acrobat Pro might seem like the obvious choice, considering Adobe pioneered the format and Acrobat remains the single most powerful PDF editor on the planet. Unfortunately it’s not the most user-friendly software package, and it’s expensive too. You can “rent” Acrobat Pro from $13/month, or get it as part of the Creative Cloud suite for $50/month. \nFor that reason you might want to go for something a little less costly and complex, like PDFpen ($75, above). It’s a powerful tool and includes sought-after features like optical character recognition How to Extract Text From Images (OCR) How to Extract Text From Images (OCR) The best way to extract text from an image is to use optical character recognition (OCR). We show you seven free OCR tools for the job. Read More (OCR), while remaining easy to learn and straight-forward to use. \nIf you’re really on a budget and can live without OCR, then PDF Expert ($20, below) is a solid budget option. It comes with the basic text and image editing tools you’d expect to see, with solid annotation and page management features that put it just ahead of Preview. \nThere are many other PDF tools on the market, but these three are probably the best tools for the job depending on your budget. While Acrobat Pro might sound like the best option, for most users PDFpen provides the right balance of features for a fair price.
