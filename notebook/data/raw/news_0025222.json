This ensures the tactical, technical, physiological and psychological elements are never worked on independently. Every training drill is organized around (at least) one of the four moments of the game and the tactical principles of play. For Mourinho these methods brought him two Champions Leagues and eight league titles in four different countries. Former Manchester United No 2 Carlos Queiroz was also a fan of the coaching technique WHAT IS TACTICAL PERIODISATION? The theory is based on breaking down the game into four different moments: transition from attack to defence; transition from defence to attack; attacking organisation and defensive organisation. The idea being training is designed as interaction between all the different dimensions. This ensures the tactical, technical, physiological and psychological elements are never worked on independently. Every training drill is organized around (at least) one of the four moments of the game and the tactical principles of play. Queiroz was No 2 at in two spells at United as they won three league titles and the Champions League. He also has two spells in charge of Portugal and a short stint at Real Madrid on his CV. The football model sees the week split into three sections: recovery; high intensity strength, endurance and speed training; before a day of recovery immediately prior to the match. Jones first picked up the practice when he visited Qatar to speak with exercise physiologist Alberto Mendez-Villanuava, a coach who has worked with Lionel Messi and Raul. 'How many games out of our last 15 wins have we won in last 20 minutes? That's not by coincidence,' Jones said. 'It's because we train to win those last 20 minutes. Dylan Hartley says England's training gives them greater confidence in their fitness 'We use a methodology which I've borrowed from soccer called tactical periodisation. 'We have one day where we have a physical session and do more contacts than we would do in a game. Then we have a fast day where we try to train for at least 60 percent of the session above game speed. 'We don't do any extra fitness. It's all done within those training sessions. Because of that we've improved our fitness enormously.' The biggest upset in Rugby World Cup history, when Jones' Japan beat South Africa with a last-gasp try, came as a result of the philosophy after he introduced it in 2013. The methods favoured by Mourinho breaks the game into four different tactical moments Jones has now brought it into his England camp, where players are exposed to double training sessions on a Tuesday before a Saturday game. 'We train fast and it's not just helter-skelter or unstructured,' England captain Dylan Hartley said. 'It's all planned and researched. We have a great performance team who with Eddie they create these sessions where we run more meters in a Test match and make more contacts and collisions. 'The running is secretly being upped - as is the time the ball is in play at training. The rest periods are shortened. Water breaks cut from 30 seconds to 20. It gives us confidence knowing we have trained to a greater intensity.'
