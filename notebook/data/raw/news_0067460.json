The chairman of the interview panel believed he should have been appointed.\" \nThe tribunal also stated that, given the nature of the evidence, \"it seems highly unlikely there can be any innocent explanation of the extraordinary result of this interview process. \n\"If there had been such an innocent explanation, it would have been put forward from the start and maintained consistently thereafter.\" \nIt said that Mr McClean believed the control and funding of community activities should be a matter for communities themselves and not for main political parties. 'Greater transparency' \nSpeaking after the ruling, Mr McClean, said: \"I have always believed that that the only reason I was considered unacceptable for this post was because my political stance did not fit in with the approach of Sinn Féin and the DUP towards community services and funding. \n\"The tribunal decision has clearly shown that the Waterside Community Partnership Ltd. cannot give any credible explanation for refusing to appoint me after I had come top in the interview and met the threshold they had set as the standard. \n\"I didn't take this case for financial reward, but because I hope that, by successfully challenging this process, I can shine a light on the need for greater transparency and accountability in appointments within the community sector.\" \nDr Michael Wardlow, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: \"All appointments, including those in the community sector, must be made without reference to a person's political opinions, or to any other protected ground. \n\"It is also important that the procedures for such appointments meet basic standards of fairness and transparency and that they are accountable to scrutiny.\" \nMcClean did not re-apply, and the post was awarded to another person. \nHe was awarded £10,734 in compensation by the tribunal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:43:23.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
