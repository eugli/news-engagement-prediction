The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health. \nMahlangu's decision was described as \"reckless\" by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba. \nMahlangu's resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier. \nThe EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients. \nThe ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC. \nJack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: \"It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.\" \nBloom continued: \"Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.\" \nThe DA's health spokesman said Mahlangu's replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge. \n\"I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚\" said Bloom. \"She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.\" Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
