The actor was 61 years old. \nAccording to reports, Paxton underwent heart surgery on Saturday, and then died suddenly after having complications in post-op — a fatal stroke appears to have been the cause of death. \nSo sudden — and so awful. \nHis family released a statement on Paxton's death, saying in part: \n\"It is with heavy hearts we share the news that Bill Paxton has passed away due to complications from surgery … Bill's passion for the arts was felt by all who knew him, and his warmth and tireless energy were undeniable.\" \nYou likely remember Paxton from his work in any number of movies, from Twister to Titanic and Aliens . He was also an Emmy winner for his work in Hatfields and McCoys , and he had been working on a CBS series called Training Day at the time of his sudden death. \nShocking, and sad, and so unexpectedly sudden. Ugh. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, including his two children, and his wife of 30 years. \nR.I.P.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T19:40:08.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
