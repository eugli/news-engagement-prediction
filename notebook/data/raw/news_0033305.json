Dave McKee was busy clearing a path outside his McKee For Keys shop in Saint John on Monday night. (Bobbie-Jean MacKinnon/CBC) \nMonday's blizzard will be one for the record books with more than 75 centimetres of snow in some parts of New Brunswick, forcing several schools and businesses to close again today so crews can clean up the mess. \nAll schools in zones three to nine in the Anglophone West school districts are closed today. This includes: Florenceville-Bristol, Bath, Centreville, Hartland, Woodstock Canterbury, Nackawic, Burtts Corner, Millville, McAdam, Harvey Stanley, Boiestown, Doaktown Greater Fredericton Area (including New Maryland, Keswick Ridge, Nashwaak Valley) Oromocto, Geary, Burton, Lincoln, Fredericton Junction Chipman, Minto Cambridge Narrows, Gagetown \nAnglophone South and Anglophone East school districts are also closed today. The Francophone South school district is closed with the exception of Régionale de Baie Sainte-Anne and Carrefour Beausoleil. All schools in the Anglophone North school district are open today, with the exception of schools in the Rexton area. \nMount Allison and The University of New Brunswick's Saint John campus will be closed today. St. Thomas University and UNB's Fredericton campus won't open until at least 10 a.m., but the universities will reassess the situation again at 9 a.m. \nGusty winds are expected to continue blowing snow around this morning. \nThe storm will gradually move towards the northeast throughout the day with the snow dwindling to flurries across eastern New Brunswick by afternoon, said CBC meteorologist Brennan Allen. \n\"Winds will remain quite strong with gusts between 50 and 80 kilometres per hour out of the northwest in many areas,\" Allen said. \"This will cause continued blowing and drifting snow.\" \nSkies are expected to clear for most of New Brunswick on Tuesday with a mix of sun and cloud on the way on Wednesday. \n\"This … should act as a breather before another storm moves in Wednesday night into Thursday,\" Allen said. \n\"This storm will not be nearly as intense as the last but looks like it will drop significant snow –particularly in eastern New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\" \nAllen said right now he expects 15 to 25 centimetres of snow for eastern New Brunswick along with strong winds.
