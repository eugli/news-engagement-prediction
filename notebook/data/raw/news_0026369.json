It clearly said the using period as 28 days. He contacted Grameenphone Customer Care Centre, but they did not give any solution,\" Mamataz said. \nShibli wrote in the complaint to the director general of the directorate that Grameenphone baited him with false advertisement and by concealing information. \nThe details of the incident are available on the Facebook page of the \nDirectorate (https://www.facebook.com/dncrp/?ref=page_internal&hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&fref=nf). \nThe complainant, Shibli, will receive 25 percent of the fines in line with the law. \nGrameenphone in a statement said the Directorate Committee issued the judgment in favour of the complainant. \nIt also said it was not ready to comment on the issue before reviewing the verdict.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:05:01.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
