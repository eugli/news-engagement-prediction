And if the defense has its way, race will also factor in the presentation of evidence to jurors. \nShirley Baccus-Lobel, Price's attorney, wants to raise the question of selective prosecution based on race. The government has objected, claiming it's irrelevant and prejudicial. U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn has not specifically ruled on the matter but may have to rule separately on related issues as they come up during the trial, on a case by case basis. \nBoth defendants in this trial -- Price and his executive assistant Dapheny Fain -- are black. So is Kathy Nealy, Price's political consultant, who will be tried at a later date. None of the mostly white-owned businesses that prosecutors said paid the bribes were charged in the case. Dapheny Fain \nOpening statements are scheduled to begin Thursday morning, after which the government will begin presenting its evidence, contained in more than 2,000 exhibits. \nBoth sides asked prospective jurors on Tuesday how they feel about race in politics and criminal justice. \nIn the end, a jury of 12 with four alternates was picked from 70 people after a lengthy weeding out process that began months ago with jury questionnaires. With a four-month trial, the chance of alternates being used is greatly increased. \nIncluding alternates, there are five African Americans on the jury, which has four men and 12 women. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Walt Junker asked jury pool members on Tuesday whether anyone was concerned that the two defendants are black and the prosecutors are all white. One woman said yes, but added that she could still be fair. \nThe defense asked them how they feel about playing the \"race card.\" Kathy Nealy, left, exits the federal courthouse in Dallas in July 2014 after being charged in the Price corruption case. (David Woo/The Dallas Morning News) \nBaccus-Lobel said in a pretrial filing that the government wants to prevent the defense from bringing up the race of those who were targeted in political corruption prosecutions in Dallas across more than a decade. \n\"Evidently... this is something a jury should not know,\" Baccus-Lobel said. \"It therefore must be their position that the government may attack a political official's motives ...but he must not return fire.\" \nThe last big political corruption trial in Dallas, for a bribery scheme at City Hall, involved mostly African-American politicians and city officials. In that case, former Mayor Pro Tem Don Hill, who is black, was sentenced to 18 years in federal prison in 2010. \nAlso prosecuted by the feds was former Dallas city councilman Al Lipscomb , in 1999, for bribery. \nThe government's insistence that there be no mention of race in the trial will \"hamstring the defense,\" Baccus-Lobel argued. \n\"The government has set forth its narrative in an indictment which leaves no mud unslung,\" Baccus-Lobel said in the court filing. \"The defense will have a much different narrative. It will include a tale of two cities. The defendant will not be the villain in that narrative.\" \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Wes Hendrix said in a reply that the court should deny any attempt by the defense to claim the government had an \"improper motive\" in prosecuting Price and his co-defendants. \n\"Any allegation or suggestion of improper motives in this case's investigation and prosecution are baseless conjecture that could lead to confusion and unfair prejudice,\" Hendrix wrote.

(Michael Ainsworth/The Dallas Morning News) \nThe government has discretion to choose whom to prosecute, he said. If defense attorneys have any evidence of selective prosecution based on race, they should approach the judge, explain why it should be allowed and let her rule accordingly, Hendrix said. \nSuch a question is not a matter for the jury, he added, because it's separate from the question of a defendant's guilt or innocence. \nHendrix also wrote that the defense has to clear two \"significant hurdles\" to show that Price was the victim of an unconstitutionally discriminatory selective prosecution. Former Dallas city councilman Al Lipscomb walks with John Wiley Price outside a federal courthouse in Amarillo in 2000 before he was found guilty of 65 counts of bribery. The conviction was later overturned. \nFirst, Price would have to show that he was singled out for prosecution while others of a different race who were \"similarly situated\" were not targeted, he said. \n\"Second, a defendant must show that the discriminatory selection of him for prosecution was invidious or in bad faith by resting on impermissible considerations like race or religion,\" Hendrix wrote. \"Here, the defendants have not attempted to satisfy these high standards, and the time for filing such a pretrial motion has passed.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:24:13.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
