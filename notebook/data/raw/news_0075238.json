But on several occasions, our targets are reluctant to join us. \n\"We made an attempt for Pato last year but he was not willing to come because our club was still in second division then. After we got promoted, he came. \n\"We also approached Diego Costa and other stars. It remains to be seen who will join us in June, but I can assure you that the new players will be on the same level as Costa.\" Diego Costa was a January target for Tianjin Quanjian. \nCosta's agent Jorge Mendes was pictured meeting Yuhui in January, but the Tianjin owner said discussions had centred around a deal for Monaco striker Radamel Falcao that eventually fell through. \n\"We had an overnight negotiation and Falcao was about to sign the contract to join us,\" he said. \n\"However, the deal was scuppered by [Fabio] Cannavaro [the Tianjin coach] who later told us he doesn't suit our style of play. \n\"Price and reputation are not our only concerns. We had to apologise to Mendes.\" \nCosta scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season in Chelsea's home win over Swansea City on Saturday, and Conte told SFR Sport : \"I'm seeing Diego very committed in this period. His commitment, his behaviour is great.\" \nLiam is ESPN FC's Chelsea correspondent. Follow him on Twitter: @Liam_Twomey.
