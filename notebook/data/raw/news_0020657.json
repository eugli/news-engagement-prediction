'If he wants to evaluate me on the basis of one game, this is wrong,' said Mkhitaryan. 'He has probably forgotten what I did the whole season before. I would have scored a penalty in Berlin. 'But there's a coach and eleven players on the pitch, and we discussed who would take.' Mkhitaryan was criticised for failing to take a penalty in last year's German Cup final Sokratis Papastathopoulos missed the decisive spot kick as Bayern Munich won the trophy Mkhitaryan left Dortmund to join the Old Trafford club for Â£30m last summer Mkhitaryan is the second United player to arrive at Old Trafford from the Bundesliga in the last two seasons, following Bastian Schweinsteiger. And although the German international fell out of favour at the beginning of Jose Mourinho's time in charge, he is now back with the squad, to Mkhitaryan's delight. 'I'm glad he got another chance,' added Mkhitaryan. 'He knows exactly what needs to be done on the pitch. 'I can only report positively about him, because he has a great character.' Mkhitaryan also praised United team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger for his 'great character' RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:45:56.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
