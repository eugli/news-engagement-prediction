Evans was supposed to make his initial middleweight foray against Tim Kennedy at UFC 205, but the New York State Athletic Commission denied him a license due to an MRI issue on a pre-fight medical exam. The fight was rebooked for UFC 206, but the Ontario Athletic Commission followed the NYSAC’s lead and refused to issue the former light heavyweight champion a license. According to multiple reports, “Suga” has been cleared to compete on the March 4 card. He lasst competed at UFC on Fox 19 on April 16, when he suffered a first-round knockout loss to Glover Teixeira in the evening’s main event.
