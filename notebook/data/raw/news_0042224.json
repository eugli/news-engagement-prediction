By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 17, 2017 - 08:45 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nMumbai: Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut were believed to have had problems with each other while shooting for Vishal Bhardwaj’s upcoming film ‘Rangoon’. There were even reports suggesting that the ‘Udta Punjab’ actor had reservations promoting the film with Bollywood’s ‘Queen’.

Shahid and I were sharing the cottages with our respective teams. Every morning, I would wake up to this mad hip-hop music. And he would exercise listening to crazy trance and techno songs blasting from the speakers. I was fed up and wanted to shift out. Sharing the cottage with Shahid was a nightmare.” \nThe curly-haired beauty may have made such a remark in good humour but Sasha is reportedly not very pleased. \n“She has a vivid imagination. I don’t remember half of the things she said in that interview, so I choose not to comment,” Bollywoodlife.com quoted Shahid as saying. \nWell, Shahid and Kangana share an awesome chemistry in ‘Rangoon’. Hope they sort out their differences (if any) soon!
