Ramasamy to a debate over murukku sales, Makkal Osai reported. \nAssociation chairman A. Soundararajan said the community is facing more pressing issues, including people who have no birth certificates or identity cards, yet the central committee member of a major Indian political party is calling for a debate over the selling of murukku instead. \n“If he really wants to go ahead with the debate, perhaps he can face off against the deputy chief minister’s office boy,” the chairman was quoted as saying. \nThe Penang authorities, Soundararajan added, have appointed five officers to assist Indian residents in the state to resolve their documentation issues. \n> A family visiting a wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka, India, had the fright of their lives when their van was attacked by a pack of lions, Malaysia Nanban reported. \nThe popular tourist destination boasts a safari area where visitors are driven through in park vehicles amid the roaming lions. \nAs the van was moving along, a lion blocked it and others began trying to break in. Luckily, the vehicle’s windows withstood the attack and the driver was able to drive away. \nThe park management has suspended the driver, citing his inattentiveness as a cause for the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:31:26.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
