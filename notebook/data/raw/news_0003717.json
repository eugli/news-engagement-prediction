He said no problem I like your passion,” said Klopp. \n“No-one can beat us, was what I said. Obviously that’s not true but it felt for us like this in that moment. I was absolutely the wrong person to say it.” Liverpool 1 Chelsea 1: player ratings from Anfield \nO n Costa, who fell under the challenge of Joel Matip before missing from the spot, Klopp said: “If I had played against Costa I could never be friends, that’s how it is but when you have him in your team it’s much more fun. He is a warrior. \n“What Conte is doing with Chelsea is outstanding but Chelsea without Costa this season? \n“He is not the nicest guy on the pitch but I saw no real big incident and until someone tells me something, if someone tells me it was a dive maybe I will be angry tomorrow but that would be the wrong decision. \n“I am happy about the performance. It was obvious we played a strong outstanding experienced side. Watch | Liverpool v Chelsea - key match stats 01:02 \n“We were in game, we were aggressive.
