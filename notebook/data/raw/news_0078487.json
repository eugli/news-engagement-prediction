A package of two EpiPens now costs more than $600 , up from just over $100 in 2009. In response to public outcry and lawmaker scrutiny, Mylan last December released its own generic version of the device at about half the cost, but that’s still out of reach for many people. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Meanwhile, some insurers have dropped coverage of the pricey name-brand auto-injector pack or made sure customers have access to cost-effective alternatives, and the drugstore chain CVS reduced the price of a generic competitor. But all still cost at least $109. Fixes like Dr. London’s can alleviate the pricing issue, but replicating this approach on a large scale could pose problems, since someone with medical expertise must do the refilling to avoid contaminating the device, meet quality standards for the device itself, and make the user aware of any safety issues that using the injector might pose. Still, for customers with little money to spare, innovations like Dr. London’s might represent a path to more security. In addition to costing less, her process tackles a key issue. EpiPen auto-injectors aren’t reusable, and epinephrine expires after 18 months, so people with serious allergies must get a fresh device each year. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. London charges her patients $50 for an initial device, and $2.50 for a refill. “There’s value to the auto-injector, but it is not built in a way that’s refillable or reusable,” said Stephen Schondelmeyer, a professor at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, who heads its department of pharmaceutical care and health systems.

Credit Tristan Spinski for The New York Times Mylan points out, though, that the EpiPen is designed specifically to administer epinephrine quickly and properly in an emergency situation and quotes the Food and Drug Administration in saying that the “the device that delivers the medication is just as critical.” Nevertheless, critics say that doesn’t justify the skyrocketing of the price paid for a device that has remained unchanged for years. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the past, insurance shielded consumers from most of the rising costs of prescription medicine. But that’s changed in recent years, as health insurance plans have increasingly required greater cost sharing — typically through the form of so-called high-deductible health plans in which beneficiaries pay more out of pocket before coverage kicks in. Many of the health care plans now under consideration by Republicans in their efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act emphasize this style of coverage, meaning that more allergy patients would experience directly the consequences of this price surge, which has already drawn scrutiny from the Senate Judiciary Committee. The issue also came up during a recent confirmation hearing for the Trump administration’s choice to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this time in regard to costs for federal health programs. Dr. London helps her patients sidestep the costs of an EpiPen by purchasing reusable auto-injectors manufactured by the British company Owen Mumford . She fills it with epinephrine herself. (Both the auto-injector and hormone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration.) Patients can come in for an epinephrine refill after they’ve used the dose, or after it’s expired. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s just a no-brainer to do this,” she said. Experts say there’s no easy way to calculate what is spent annually on EpiPens that are thrown away because they are past their expiration date. But given the price tag, it’s likely to be many millions of dollars. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Workarounds like Dr. London’s can help individuals mitigate climbing costs, though they require extraordinary effort on the part of the doctor and trust on the part of the patient. Dr. London did a lot of research to find an auto-injector that was appropriate. The one she settled on is generally marketed for use with insulin syringes, but can also be used for many medications. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The strategy is also not without risks, noted Schondelmeyer, who worries about issues of sterility in a reusable device and other safeguards that come when products are made outside of the F.D.A.’s watchful eye. That’s why he is among those who caution against do-it-yourself remedies and against applying such approaches on a large scale. Meanwhile, if a company were to try to market such a product, it would likely run into federal regulations and safety standards. Setting up a factory, or otherwise mass-producing the device, he added, would face regulatory hoops that could take years to jump through before the product would be available. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “These sound like simple solutions,” said Schondelmeyer. “But these aren’t market-based solutions that can work broadly.” Other health professionals and government health agencies have found their own strategies to deal with the EpiPen’s escalating price tag. In at least a dozen states, pilot programs are either underway or being explored for emergency medical technicians to replace the EpiPens they carry with reusable syringes kits.
