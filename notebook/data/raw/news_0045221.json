The 63-year-old coach told ESPN sideline reporter Holly Rowe at halftime that his internal “defibrillator went off,” but he’s fine.\nWest Virginia coach Bob Huggins needed help off the floor and medical attention late in the first half against Texas. He appears to be ok. pic.twitter.com/qSOd4nMgxj\n— SI College Hoops (@si_ncaabb) February 21, 2017\nHuggins previously suffered a heart attack while on a recruiting trip in Pittsburgh in 2002 and was fitted for the defibrillator. He remained as fiery and enthusiastic as ever on the sidelines ever since, taking over at his alma mater West Virginia in 2007 after stints with Kansas State and Cincinnati.\nIt certainly didn’t seem like Huggins’ let Monday’s health scare affect him the rest of the game. He was cracking jokes within seconds and spent much of the second half bickering with referees.\nBob Huggins just fainted in a timeout and got up and told one of his players, \"It's your fault. You're trying to kill me.\"\n— Steve Layman (@SteveLayman) February 21, 2017\nWest Virginia at least didn’t give Huggins too many anxious moments during Monday night’s comfortable win. The Mountaineers moved into sole possession of second place in the Big 12 thanks to 24 points from Jevon Carter and 23 points from Lamont West.\n– – – – – – –\nJeff Eisenberg is the editor of The Dagger on Yahoo Sports.
