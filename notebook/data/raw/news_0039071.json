Credit: APTN \n\"I've seen video content of a child that's the same age as mine being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia. \n\"And this child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play.\" \nK utcher said his team received a call from the Department of Homeland Security asking for help to find a seven-year-old girl after footage of her being sexually abused was \"spread around the dark web\". \n\"She'd been abused for three years and they'd watched her for three years and they could not find the perpetrator, asking us for help,\" he said. \n\"We were the last line of defence. An actor and his foundation were the potential last line of defence. \n\"That's my day job and I'm sticking to it.\" It's not just my job, it's my duty to the global community. Everyone has the right to pursue happiness. https://t.co/kMJK1SyN6R — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) February 16, 2017 \nK utcher's comments to the committee follows heightened scrutiny of classified advertising websites such as Backpage.com for carrying ads that offer children for commercial sex. \n\"Technology can be used to enable slavery, but it can also be used to disable slavery,\" said Kutcher. \nEach year, up to 300,000 children are at risk of being trafficked for commercial sex in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. \nMost sex trafficking victims are advertised or sold online, according to a US senate subcommittee report that was released last month. \nBackpage.com was hit last week with the latest in a string of lawsuits that accuse the company of promoting sex trafficking by running and rewriting ads that offer children for commercial sex. \nIn a more light-hearted moment at the hearing, Kutcher blew a kiss towards Republican senator and former US presidential candidate John McCain. \nIt came after McCain told the actor: \"Ashton, you were better looking in the movies.\" \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:07:22.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
