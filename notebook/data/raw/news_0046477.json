Anthony Milford was quiet throughout the match against Warrington. Source: Supplied \nCoach Wayne Bennett will be hoping that the loss will have helped Brisbane shake out the cobwebs before the start of the NRL season after an error-riddled performance. \nThe Broncos went over to the UK without their expected starting front rowers Korbin Sims and Adam Blair — as well as usual bench utility Kodi Nikorima — but otherwise had a full strength side. \nWhile Joe Ofahengaue and Herman Ese’ese started in their place, the duo cannot be solely blamed for the loss, with mistakes coming from across the park. \nIt was a worrying start to the year for the Broncos, who will come up against the reigning premiers Cronulla in Round 1 before meeting the Cowboys the following week. \nStar five-eighth Anthony Milford was quiet throughout most of the match while halfback Ben Hunt struggled with his kicking game. Tevita Pangai impressed with his chances against Warrington. Picture: Peter Cronin Source: News Corp Australia \nBrisbane’s pack also did little to help their side overcome Warrington’s momentum, with Tevita Pangai Jnr making the biggest impact as the young forwards fought it out for two bench spots for the season ahead. \nWarrington stamped their authority on the game in the second minute of the first half, with Brisbane struggling to dominate from there. \nFrustrations boiled over   the match, with two fights breaking out, which did little to help the Broncos. \nPerhaps the most promising sign however was the growing combination of James Roberts and David Mead on the right edge, with both contributing to the scoreboard. \nWhile the duo made their own mistakes throughout — and Roberts demonstrated a hot head during one of the fights — they provided some spark to Brisbane’s attack when it was needed most. \nThe club will head back to Australia on Sunday night and will have just over one week to turn their fortunes around before the season opener on March 2. \nWARRINGTON WOLVES 27 (Kevin Brown, Ryan Atkins, Matthew Russell, Tom Lineham tries; Declan Patton 5 goals; Declan Patton field goal) defeated BRISBANE BRONCOS 18 (Corey Oates, James Roberts, David Mead tries; Jordan Kahu 3 goals) View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
