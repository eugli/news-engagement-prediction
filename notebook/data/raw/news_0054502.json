As a result, and following on from a string of Huawei P10 leaks that have come through in recent days, and weeks, much of the design traits that are on offer with the Huawei P10 can now be seen – including the dual rear camera setup which has been widely anticipated to be included with this smartphone. Although the clarity of this new render does provide a much better look at not just the back of the Huawei P10, but also the front and the sides as well. This is a smartphone that is expected to be formerly announced and introduced at MWC 2017 and this render certainly seems to be an official one as the correct date (Feb 26) and correct location (Barcelona) are both listed on the front of the device. \nThis is actually the second press render leak that has come through from Blass today. As earlier on, the tipster also released a press render of the LG G6 . Another smartphone that is expected to make its debut at MWC 2017. Like this one, the other render provides a very clear full of what will be on offer with the LG G6. Although, in comparison, the leaking of details surrounding the Huawei P10 has been far more prevalent lately and as such, most of what you can expect with the Huawei P10 has already become known. \nFor instance, today also saw the Huawei P10 being benchmarked on GFXBench . While many of the Huawei P10’s specs were already rumored, the GFXBench listing seemed to be further confirming the smartphone will come equipped with a 5.1-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. In addition to 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage and powered by a HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor. Cameras are listed to come in the form of a 12-megapixel rear camera (which we can see in the image above will be part of a dual camera configuration), as well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Not forgetting, the Huawei P10 looks set to arrive running on Android 7.0 (Nougat) out of the box.
