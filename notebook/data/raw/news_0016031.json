Iommi gave a thumbs-up as he waved goodbye.\nOzzy Osbourne recalls fans telling him how to look after his dogs Speaking to the BBC before the final show, Osbourne said he was \"a whirlwind of emotions\".\n\"I remember playing the Crown pub in Birmingham and thinking, 'This'll be good for a couple of years - drink a few beers and have a jam'.\n\"But it was the beginning of the most incredible adventure you could think of. I've had the best life out of it.\"\nOsborne said Black Sabbath's farewell tour was the definitive end, vowing: \"This is definitely it. It's run its course.\"\nThe Birmingham street where Black Sabbath's sound began BBC music reporter Colin Paterson said the final concert was heavy on nostalgia, with only one of the songs played having been released after 1972.\nThe audience had come as far away as Australia and Honduras and were emotional, with one telling the BBC: \"People behind me were in floods of tears about it. They were absolutely devastated it was the last one.\"\nAnother said: \"That's the 10th time I've seen them. It feels like I've broke up with a long term girlfriend.\"\nThe fans were also having their portraits taken and memories recorded, as part of the Home of Metal project.\nThe project is asking them to contribute photos and memorabilia for an exhibition celebrating the legacy of Black Sabbath, which will tour internationally in 2018, followed by a summer season in Birmingham and the Black Country in 2019.\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
