A WHO-led team of international experts evaluated systems and procedures at different drug regulatory offices around the country as well as at laboratories and gave ratings based on the assessment. India has scored in four out of five parameters, the highest possible score, according to officials. \"This is indeed a great achievement and we would like to congratulate the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and its affiliated institutions: Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO); Central Drugs Laboratory , Kasauli; Pharmacovigilance Programme and Immunization Division , and other relevant institutions engaged in the regulation, control and testing of vaccines,\" said Dr Alireza Khadem, WHO Team Leader for the National Regulatory Authority Re-benchmarking. The assessment was made by a team of international regulators including representatives from the US and Germany. The comprehensive review was conducted from 13-17 February 2017. \"India is one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of vaccines world-wide; this development further deepens our resolve to maintain the highest quality and efficacy of the products that are manufactured within our country and in this context, we look forward to strengthening our collaboration with WHO,\" health secretary C K Mishra said. The move assumes significance as the Indian drug regulator had come under severe criticism, a few years ago, after it failed to ensure compliance of good manufacturing practices, even as foreign regulators were barring companies from manufacturing products for other markets. Welcoming the positive outcome of international assessment, Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India said, \"It will go a long way in re-affirming India's role in global health, including the strength of its pharmaceutical sector and drug regulatory capacity.\" India is a major exporter of low cost generic medicines to the world, including vaccines. Quality concerns in India had therefore raised concerns across the world. The strengthening of the local regulatory agency is likely to ensure better compliance of norms at manufacturing facilities as well.
