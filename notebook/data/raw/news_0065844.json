Christophe Galtier’s side had eight attempts at goal and must have been kicking themselves after the match for failing to find a way past Sergio Romero. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick separated the two teams heading into last night’s second leg in France, but the vocal St-Etienne fans packed into the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard clearly felt they had a chance.

Article continues below Jamie Carragher sums up Ranieri's sacking with scathing two-word tweet to Leicester The commentary leading to Hargreaves' funny comment... \nIan Darke, BT Sports’ lead commentator, told the story of how a bakers’ strike led to United being chucked out of Europe back in 1977. \n“It was considerably easier in Saint-Etienne for Manchester United than they were on their last visit in the old Cup Winners’ Cup 40 years ago,” Darke explained. \n“It was during a bakers’ strike in the United Kingdom when the French fans hurled croissants and bread rolls at the Manchester United fans. Rioting ensued in the stadium and around the town. Manchester United were thrown out of Europe, were reinstated on appeal, had to play the second leg at Plymouth, went through were then knocked out by Porto in the next round.” Hargreaves' funny response... \nAfter an awkward silence, Darke asked Hargreaves: “Did you bring your bread rolls today, Owen?” \nThe former England international then amused everyone watching by simply replying: “I love my bread rolls.” \nIt was the dead-pan manner in which he delivered the comment which made the piece of commentary so good. \nYou can watch/listen to it here… Reaction on Twitter \nHere’s how Twitter reacted to Hargreaves’ commentary… \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
