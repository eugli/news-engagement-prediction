While Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the U.S. Congress to grant statehood, the process for doing so is not specified.The Constitution merely declares that new states cannot be created by merging or splitting existing states without the approval of both the U.S. Congress and the states' legislatures. Otherwise, Congress is given the authority to determine the conditions for statehood. \"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States…\" -- U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 3 , clause 2 The Typical Process \nHistorically, Congress has applied the following general procedure when granting territories statehood: The territory holds a referendum vote to determine the people's desire for or against statehood. Should a majority vote to seek statehood, the territory petitions the U.S. Congress for statehood. The territory, if it has not already done so, is required to adopt a form of government and constitution that are in compliance with the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Congress - both House and Senate - pass, by a simple majority vote, a joint resolution accepting the territory as a state. The President of the United States signs the joint resolution and the territory is acknowledged as a U.S. state. \nThe process attaining statehood can literally take decades. For example, consider the case of Puerto Rico and its attempt to become the 51st state. The Puerto Rico Statehood Process \nPuerto Rico became a United States territory in 1898 and people born in Puerto Rico have automatically been granted full U.S. citizenship since 1917 by an act of Congress. In 1950, the U.S. Congress authorized Puerto Rico to draft a local constitution. In 1951, a constitutional convention was held in Puerto Rico to draft the constitution. In 1952, Puerto Rico ratified its territorial constitution establishing a republican form of government, which was approved by the U.S. Congress as being “not repugnant” to the U.S. Constitution and the functional equivalent of a valid state constitution. \nThen things like the Cold War, Vietnam, September 11, 2001, the wars on terror, the great recession and lots of politics put Puerto Rico’s statehood petition on Congress’ back burner for over 60 years. On November 6, 2012, the territorial government of Puerto Rico held a two-question public referendum vote on petitioning for U.S. statehood. The first question asked voters if Puerto Rico should continue to be a U.S. territory. The second question asked voters to choose from among the three possible alternatives to territorial status—statehood, independence, and nationhood in free association with the United States. In the vote count, 61% of the voters chose statehood, while only 54% voted to retain territorial status. In August 2013, a U.S. Senate committee heard testimony on Puerto Rico’s 2012 statehood referendum vote and acknowledged that the majority of the Puerto Rican people had “expressed their opposition to continuing the current territorial status.” On February 4, 2015, Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner in the U.S. House of Representatives Pedro Pierluisi, introduced the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Process Act (H.R. 727). The bill authorizes Puerto Rico’s State Elections Commission to hold a vote on Puerto Rico's admission into the Union as a state within one year after the act’s enactment. If a majority of the votes cast are for Puerto Rico's admission as a state, the bill requires the President of the United States to issue a proclamation to begin the transition process that will result in Puerto Rico's admission as a state effective January 1, 2021. Note: While Puerto Rico’s resident commissioners to the House are allowed to introduce legislation and take part in debates and committee hearings, they are not allowed to actually vote on legislation. Similarly, non-voting resident commissioners from the other U.S territories of American Samoa, the District of Columbia ( a federal district ), Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands also serve in the House. \nSo if the U.S. legislative process eventually smiles on the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Process Act, the entire process of transition from U.S. territory to ​U.S. state will have taken the Puerto Rican people over 71 years. \nWhile some territories have significantly delayed petitioning for statehood, including Alaska (92 years) and Oklahoma (104 years), no valid petition for statehood has ever been denied by the U.S. Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:45.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
