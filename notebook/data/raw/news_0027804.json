Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool revolution could have been killed off before it truly got started... but for the unshakable faith of the manager. \nThat is the view of Reds midfielder Giorginio Wijnaldum, who admitted they were suffering a crisis of faith during that miserable January run which destroyed their chances of winning a trophy this season. \nNo league wins since the turn of the year, exits from both domestic Cups and just one victory in 10 matches tested the mental strength and spirit of the team manager Klopp is building, before a spectacular revival against Tottenham on Saturday. \nWijnaldum conceded the run almost destroyed the team - and could easily have done, had their passionate manager not stuck so determinedly to his belief in the players to defy the critics who said the squad isn't good enough.

It would kill the confidence of the players. \n\"When you are a team, you have to believe in each other. You are a kind of family and if one of yours says, 'You’re not good enough’ or what the media has been saying, that is not a good thing.
