His brief tenure in the role amounted to less than a month.\nMr Petraeus now appears poised to replace Mr Flynn. He is a well-known former military figure who came to prominence under the Obama administration. He led troops in Afghanistan before being appointed to the top position at the CIA. \nRead more Michael Flynn resigns over controversial contact with Russia Trump is 'evaluating the situation' over national security advisor David Duke praises Michael Flynn for anti-Semitic retweet Donald Trump selects Michael Flynn as national security adviser However, Mr Petraeus’ career came to a dramatic end after he was forced to resign after a Justice Department investigation found that he had shared classified information with a woman with whom he was having an extra marital affair. \nHe plead guilty to the findings and subsequently served a probation period of two years, as well as paying a $100,000 fine. The probation period is to expire in April.\nSources say he is now tipped to be the most likely contender for the prominent role of National Security Adviser, in the now-vacant position, CNN reports. \nIf chosen by President Trump for the role, it is likely to be viewed by many as a controversial hire amid concerns Mr Petraeus’ past conduct renders him an unviable option for a key security role. Critics might contest the hire as at odds with President Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” of Washington, and potentially hypocritical in light of his vehement criticism of election rival Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, amid concerns that amounting to a security breach. \nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.
