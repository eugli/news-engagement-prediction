ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nJo and her daughter Amanda. Jo says there needs to be better communication between services and agencies to help in the transition from high school. \nMark Shanks has worked with families in the Hutt Valley as a project manager for Life Unlimited, a charitable trust which provides information and support to people with disabilities. He says there is not enough long-term planning at schools for students with special needs. \nREAD MORE: * Wellington father shocked to hear children still being put in 'seclusion' rooms \n\"I think it sits with secondary schools. Once they [students] start ... they should have a plan beginning then for when that student's going to leave.\" \nSchools should have individual education plans for special needs students, and those plans should sit alongside, or morph into, an individual transition plan. \nThere needed to be better collaboration with agencies, as parents weren't always aware of what was available in the community. \n\"Often what happens is a child leaves school and they haven't done the work in time, nothing's there and suddenly parents and the young person are going 'what's next?', they have no idea what they're doing.\" \nElaine Gousmett's 16-year-old daughter, Chardonnay Kyle, finished school last year. She has spina bifida, ADD, dyspraxia and a mild intellectual impairment. \nThe Upper Hutt mother believed if school was not helping her child advance to the next level, there was no point staying. When Gousmett asked what options her daughter had after school, she was told there was nothing. \n\"There is just a big black hole.\" \nParents whose children were eligible kept them at school until they were 21 \"because there was nothing else in the world for them to do\". \nAnother Upper Hutt parent, who would only be identified as Jo, said she faced an uphill battle finding a place for 22-year-old Amanda after she finished school last year. \nAmanda has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, epilepsy characterised by learning impairments. \nThe pair had meetings with staff from the Ministry of Education and the school, but people \"did not have a lot of answers\". \n\"It all seemed to be up to me.\" \nHer daughter was now enrolled in a \"fantastic\" service, but it had been hard to organise. \nHowever, Secondary Principals' Association president Sandy Pasley said that when special needs were identified, schools had individual education plans for those students, and met with parents regularly to look to the future. \nThese included working out what the students' needs would be for literacy and numeracy, and making sure the school had a programme that targeted them into future employment where possible. \nKatrina Casey, deputy secretary Sector Enablement and Support at the Ministry of Education, said every school had systems in place to help young people make the transition. \nSchool staff worked closely with other agencies so families had all the information they needed. \nThe ministry was leading work to improve transitions from school and tertiary education into employment. The project would ensure the ministry started working with families when they were 14. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:55:01.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
