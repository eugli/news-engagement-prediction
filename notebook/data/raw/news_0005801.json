Mark Cuban and Donald Trump (Getty Images) \nPublished on Jan. 31, 2017 \nJan. 31, 2017 \nCNN invited NBA team owner/businessman Mark Cuban to speak about President Donald Trump minutes before Trump announced he was nominating federal Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court on Tuesday. \nCuban's main qualifications for the interview? He's rich and famous and he's a loud, proud and frequent critic of Trump. He maintained that latter stance Tuesday. He was blunt in assessing Trump's executive order last week that temporarily halted the arrival of refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries and barred most people from those nations from enter the U.S. \nSTEELE: NBA speaking up as NFL stays silent \n\"The ban was half-ass, half-baked,\" Cuban said, per a transcript of the interview . \"If the goal was security, why do you leave off any other countries that hosted terrorism?\" Critics noted that Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to cite just two countries, were not listed in the order. \nCuban saw the episode as an example of Trump's inexperience in government and disarray within his administration. \n\"In my mind, if he was presidential, he could have said, 'Look, I want to do A, B and C, but I want to get all of my Cabinet in place, I want to make sure I have everybody vested. Because I know every liberal and every (Hillary) Clinton supporter is going to go bananas when I put this out. And I want every I dotted and Ts crossed because I'm just going to ram it down their throat and do what's best for the country.'\" \nMORE: Gregg Popovich rips into Trump \nCuban said Trump's failure to do that will call future directives into question. \nPeople have suggested Cuban should run for president himself. He hasn't shown much inclination to do that. On Tuesday, he did encourage people to get involved in the political process. \n\"Twenty-five percent of the people voted against [Trump], 23 percent voted for him,\" Cuban said, using percentages of the entire U.S. voting population. \"What those (other) 52 percent do, I think, is the most important thing that happens right now. Because that's what's going to change the balance of power in all the polls and that's what he'll listen to.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:40:23.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
