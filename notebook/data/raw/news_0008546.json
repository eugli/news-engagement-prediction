Share on Twitter Print This Post \nDictators simply cannot tate dicks unless it has a compliant press, or can delegitimize the 4th Estate. [See: Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Mussolini, Chavez, et al.] Emperor Trump didn’t start this. He just exploited what 20 years of propaganda — 15 years as the highest rated cable news channel — had already created. The Fox “News” Fake Filosophy™ has always been, “We’re the only ones telling you the truth.” The rest is “fake media.” \nSound familiar? Fox “News” has put the liar in familiar since inception. Now it has a Demagogue both emulating the station and and manufacturing his own alternative facts, which are then parroted by the Fox “News” Channel. In a very long article (well worth your time), Conservative David Frum (yes, that David Frum ) says in The Atlantic, How to Build an Autocracy : \nDiscipline within the congressional ranks will be strictly enforced not only by the party leadership and party donors, but also by the overwhelming influence of Fox News. Trump versus Clinton was not 2016’s only contest between an overbearing man and a restrained woman. Just such a contest was waged at Fox, between Sean Hannity and Megyn Kelly. In both cases, the early indicators seemed to favor the women. Yet in the end it was the men who won, Hannity even more decisively than Trump. Hannity’s show, which became an unapologetic infomercial for Trump, pulled into first place on the network in mid-October. Kelly’s show tumbled to fifth place, behind even The Five, a roundtable program that airs at 5 p.m. Kelly landed on her feet, of course, but Fox learned its lesson: Trump sells; critical coverage does not. Since the election, the network has awarded Kelly’s former 9 p.m. time slot to Tucker Carlson, who is positioning himself as a Trump enthusiast in the Hannity mold. From the point of view of the typical Republican member of Congress, Fox remains all-powerful: the single most important source of visibility and affirmation with the voters whom a Republican politician cares about. \nSound familiar? \nFAKE FOREIGN FACTS: This week Fox tweeted out the fake fact that the Canadian Trump-supporting domestic terrorist suspect in Quebec City was a Moroccan. [To be fair: A very early report suggested as much.] While Fox dropped that contention, it never deleted the original post, nor corrected the initial impression. Cleverly avoiding the issue allowed its brain-dead followers to continue to believe that. After a demand from the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , Fox issued a correction, deleted the original post , and apologized . But, take a look at this sleight of hand : \n“FoxNews.com initially corrected the misreported information with a tweet and an update to the story on Monday,” managing director Refet Kaplan told the BBC. \nFox.com is *not* where the egregious mistake was allowed to remain and fester. That was on Twitter. And — until the apology — subsequent tweets did not correct the misinformation, but side-stepped the name and nationality of the lone suspect, in order that the original tweet could remain believable to its xenophobic viewers . \nSound familiar? \nFAKES & FRIENDS: This Wednesday’s Fox & Friends was Fox “News” encapsulated: First they called all criticism of the new Emperor, TDS: Trump Derangement Syndrome . Then they attacked Amy Shumer for having defended “distant cousin” Chuck Shumer’s tears, wondering when she was finally moving to Canada. Defending Trump, they dragged out washed up celebrity Chuck Woolery, then pre-attacked Hollywood liberals for opposing SCOTUS pick Gorsuch before any had. While Hollywood liberals are bad, later in the week they devoted segment after segment to play a very long clip of Matthew McConaughey telling people to fall in line under Emperor Trump. \nThose Foxy Friends regularly air hateful segments against Muslims, but can’t even defend their Lord and savior with factual info:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:57:58.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
