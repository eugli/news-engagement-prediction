Not entirely Few places have \"Made in America\" written all over them like the Warren Truck Assembly Plant. \nThey have been making trucks at the factory, outside Detroit, since 1938, and you don't get much more American than the chunky, no-nonsense, big-tyred Dodge Ram 1500s that roll out from the 87-acre site every day. \nSo if I want to buy American, surely I can do no better than buy a Ram? \nWell, no. Actually you'd be better off buying a Honda. \nThe Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington DC compiles an annual index of the cars Americans drive - and where they are made. \nThe Dodge Ram 1500 turns out, according to this index, to be only 59.5% made in America. \nThe Honda Accord, says Kogod, is 81% American. \nNow this is partly because some of the Ram 1500s are made not in Detroit at all, but in Saltillo, Mexico. \nAnd then there is the fiendishly complicated issue of components. Image copyright Honda Image caption The Honda Accord is 81% American, according to the Kogod School of Business \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), which makes the Ram, has a huge supplier network that buys in parts and manufacturing from around the world from Cordoba in Argentina to Serbia and South Korea. \nIt's not just FCA, globalisation is in the lifeblood of the car industry, and its supply lines have become possibly the most complex and finely tuned of any business on the planet. \nNow this model is under threat. \nIn the US, President Trump has pledged to hike tariffs on US cars made abroad, or as he succinctly tweeted : \"Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\" This, he believes, will save American jobs. \nMr Trump may well have caught hold of a global zeitgeist. Before the US election, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reported a spike in trade-restrictive measures imposed by members, averaging 22 per month, the highest since 2011. \n\"In the current environment, a rise in trade restrictions is the last thing the global economy needs,\" director-general Roberto Azevedo said.

Ford, for instance, scrapped a plan to build a plant in Mexico and got tweeted a pat on the back from the president. \nDespite the hype, Ford's decision to build in Michigan is a minor tweak in its global strategy. But if border taxes on car imports work their way from angry tweets to real legislation, the global motor industry is in trouble. \nOne firm ignoring President Trump's criticism is German car giant BMW, who recently announced plans to retool its factory north of Pretoria in South Africa to produce the X3 sport-utility vehicle outside the US for the first time. BMW is also building another Mexican plant in San Luis Potosi. \nIan Robertson, head of sales and marketing at BMW, points out that its Spartanburg plant in South Carolina in the US is the biggest of all its factories, and says its decision to build the San Luis Potosi plant simply reflects how the industry works. \n\"This is part of the normal business development of a company like BMW which has nearly 30 production facilities in 14 countries. And the Mexican investment is one in a plant which will produce a capacity that will ultimately supply many markets.\" UK car production in 2016 1.7 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:00:32.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
