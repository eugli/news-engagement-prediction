'He admits what he has done was reckless and stupid.'\nNicholas Rooke, prosecuting, told the court March claimed to have been the victim of a similar killer clown related incident in Gateshead and that resulted in him carrying on the prank.\nMarch was one of several arrested in the lead up to Halloween last year during a spate of 'killer clown attacks' across the country (stock photo)\nHe said: 'He and his friend had been scaring people with the clown mask when they noticed a couple in the town centre.\n'He banged the axe on the floor in order to scare them, before the woman picked up a piece of brick.'\nThe court heard how the victim did not make an official complaint about the incident because she was 22-weeks pregnant.\nJailing him for six month, Recorder Jamie Hill said: 'Carrying a real axe and threatening innocent people goes beyond anything that is acceptable at Halloween. 'Wearing a clown mask is not an offence but you had armed yourself with an axe, not a fake axe, a real one. 'The fact you were wearing a clown mask in an aggravating factor.'\nMarch was ordered to pay a statutory surcharge and the axe was ordered to be destroyed.\nSentencing him, Judge Hill added March had committed a serious offence and only a custodial sentence was appropriate.\n'The fact you were wearing a clown mask is an aggravating factor because it increased the fear they would have experienced and secondly it was a way of disguising who you were,' he said.\nMarch had previously admitted possession of a bladed article.\n'KILLER CLOWNS': THE BIZARRE CRAZE THAT SWEPT BRITAIN The 'killer clown' craze swept the UK in the lead up to Halloween 2016.\nIt involved people dressing up in clown costumes, brandishing weapons and jumping out on unsuspecting strangers.\nThe first sightings were reported on October 4 last year and few areas of the country escaped the craze.\nIt led to a deluge of calls to Childline from youngsters left terrified by the sinister phenomenon as well as dozens of reports to police.\nIn October in Manchester two people dressed as clowns (pictured) jumped on the car of events organiser Kurtis Mulvaney\nA 10-year-old boy in Plymouth was threatened by a clown who jumped out of a bush carrying a hammer.\nIn Workington, Cumbria, a clown brandishing an axe chased an 11-year-old girl.\nKent Police saw 59 clown-related incidents between October 7 and 10, and Thames Valley Police had 14 reports in 24 hours.\nSouth Yorkshire Police said it had received 61 reports or complaints.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:29:22.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
