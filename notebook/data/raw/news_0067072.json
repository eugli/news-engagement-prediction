NEVER SAID HOW MANY WILL BE FOR THE LOCALS   \nDear A.S.S. Editor Advertisement \nTransport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that about 15,000 engineers are needed for the trains industry by 2030. Currently, there are only 10,000 engineers now. \nWonder out of this number, how many percentage would be reserved for the locals. Have the feeling that the number of foreigners hired as engineers out of these 15,000 by 2030 will be so much more than the number of locals. 13 years is not that long a time. \nNot putting up much hope that more than half hired will be locals. In fact, if locals can get half the number of jobs, then that would be an achievement indeed. \nBen Leong \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
