A 21-story residential tower will include 183 units for CHA residents, 82 units at affordable rents and 217 units at market rates. The development also includes several connected midrise buildings and low-rise town homes.\nHunt was selected from five companies that submitted proposals for the redevelopment. It will collaborate with Imagine Group and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives to develop the property. Nate Lanthrum has been photographing the people in and around the Cabrini-Green rowhouses in Chicago over several years. \nThe project also will include 38,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space along Clybourn. \nOther projects already on the former Cabrini-Green site include a Target store and NewCity shopping center. \nThe Hunt project is the first phase of three-part development of the land that will also include seven acres at Halsted and Division streets and 1.6 acres of residential-only development at Oak and Larabee streets, according to CHA officials. \nThis isn't 46-year-old Hunt's first foray into the Chicago real estate market. The company is also an investor in the Heritage Shops at Millennium Park. \nHunt has developed more than 90 projects and 12,000 units in a mix of affordable and public housing in cities including Chicago, Dallas and Honolulu. Hunt executives could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe project is expected to begin in 2018, according to a CHA statement. \nTwitter @corilyns", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:36:36.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
