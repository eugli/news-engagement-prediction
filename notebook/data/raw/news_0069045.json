I watched Keller quickly sear a patty of Wagyu beef ($100 a pound) and douse it over and over again with rich butter, sealing in the flavor and the juice.\nThen I watched him slice and sear a few slabs of prime foie gras ($45 a pound), and combine the duck fat with more butter to sautee a mound of sliced black truffles ($1,500 a pound). After that, Keller carefully layered the three ingredients onto a freshly baked brioche bun.\nThe top ingredient (and the main reason for its price) was poured rather than cooked: A bottle of 1995 Petrus. The bottle, which can often sell for more than $5,000 in restaurants, comes with the burger as the perfect pairing.\nWith wine in hand, I lifted the earthy, oozing Fleur burger to my mouth and took my first bite. And for the first time ever on \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich,\" I was completely at a loss for words. My exact Quote: , on camera, was, \"Oh! Wow. Oh. My. God.\"\nWould I pay $5,000 for a Fleur burger? Absolutely — if I were a billionaire.\nAnd others certainly agree. Hubert has already sold 28.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://cnbc.com/"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:25:16.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
