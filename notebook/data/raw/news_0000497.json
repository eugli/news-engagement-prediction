But now that she's blown the category wide open, there are tons of other sets that are worth your attention. May we present the best two-step duos that define, prime, and plump with nary a restock waiting list in sight. Courtesy of brand ColourPop Can't Stop, Won't Stop Lip Trio ColourPop took three of their most popular lip products and bundled them up into one handy, coordinated kit . You can choose from nudes, pinks or red, but we love this deep mauve set of an Ultra Matte Lip (ColourPop's popular long-wearing liquid lipstick ), a Lippie Pencil, and a Matte X Lippie Stix (a matte-finish lipstick). Courtesy of brand Tarte Limited-Edition Kiss Bliss Deluxe Tarteist Creamy Matte Lip Paint & Crayon Set If you haven't had the opportunity to try out Tarte's popular Tarteist Quick Dry Matte Lip Paints , this set will give you the chance to catch up real quick and experiment with five different colors. You'll get five mini bottles of pigment, in red, mauve, black cherry, raspberry, and deep nude, plus five coordinating lip crayons. Courtesy of brand Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche Lipstick Duo This handy double-ended stick comes with Bite's super-hydrating satin Amuse Bouche lipstick on one end and a coordinating limited-edition metallic topcoat on the other. Apply the shimmery side to your Cupid's bow like highlighter to help make your lips look poutier than a millennial with a selfie stick. Courtesy of brand M.A.C. Mehr & Soar Lip Kit Let's be real, M.A.C. created the OG lip kit. Before Kylie Cosmetics existed, people, including Jenner herself, mix-and-matched M.A.C.'s iconic shades for the perfect neutral pout. Now, in 2017, matching duos are finally being sold together. Courtesy of brand Benefit They're Real! Big Sexy Lip Kit A feat of packaging and a feat of chemistry: lipstick and liner coexisting in one teardrop-shaped bullet . You have four deeply pigmented shades to choose from: Flame Game (an orangey red), Pink Thrills (a petal pink), Revved-Up Red (a cherry red), and Lusty Rose (a rosy pink). Courtesy of brand Honest Beauty Truly Kissable Lip Kit If even the thought of matte liquid lipstick drys out your lips, there's still a lip kit for you. First, smear on some of the Magic Balm, which can be used on your lids too for a glossy finish. Then, pick from a demi-matte honey shade or a sheer raspberry shade of the Beauty Award-winning", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T18:11:58.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
