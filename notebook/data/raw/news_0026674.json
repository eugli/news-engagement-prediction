(These are the best and worst foods for your cholesterol .) \nSpecifically, the olive oil-based Mediterranean diet improved a process called reverse cholesterol transport, or the removal of cholesterol from the plaque in your arteries to your liver, the researchers reported in a press release . From there, the cholesterol could then be eliminated from your body. \nThe diet also helped relax blood vessels, which keeps them open and helps blood flow through them smoothly. Both of these factors can help reduce your risk of heart disease. \nThe researchers aren’t exactly sure why the Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil was more beneficial than the one emphasizing nuts, but they believe the antioxidants in the oil may help improve the function of HDL cholesterol , Medscape reported. \nMore research needs to be done to see if similar improvements can be seen in healthy people, too.
