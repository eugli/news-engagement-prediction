I’ve never said Mitch was 6-3, so I don’t know where any of that came from, but he’s going to measure probably 6-2 or a little bit taller than that. I don’t know exactly because I’ve never put a tape on him, but he’s going to be tall enough to be successful, I promise you.” \nFedora said he’d be “really shocked” if Trubisky was only “a little over 6-1” as Mayock said he’s been told by scouts, and reiterated that his quarterback’s height wasn’t an issue. \n“At this time of year it’s always about tearing kids down. I think Mitch understands that. He’s very confident in what he can do, and I’m sure he’s going to throw at the Combine and then I’m going to make a bet that he’s going to throw at our pro day (March 21) too. I don’t think he’s going to be scared to hide anything.” \nWhile only a measuring tape in Indianapolis will tell the official truth —unless Trubisky has lifts in his socks (#alternativeheight) — this will hopefully put this mini-controversy to bed. \nNow we can worry about the only real measurement that matters for quarterbacks — How big are his hands ?
