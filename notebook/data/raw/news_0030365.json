The reason why instability continues is that because the world has betrayed us.\" \nOn Friday, the UN refugee agency said tens of thousands of people had been displaced by fighting along Yemen's western coastline.\nWilliam Spindler, UNHCR spokesperson, said 34,000 people fled their homes after fierce fighting erupted in the port towns of Mokha and Dhubab on the Red Sea.\nThe majority of the displaced were headed to the outskirts of Taiz, he said.\nHouthi warning Yemeni forces, allied with the Hadi government that is backed by a coalition of mostly Arab Gulf states , have recently seized Mokha and plan to push northward.\nFor his part, the leader of Yemen's Houthi fighters announced on Friday that his forces have built drones and missiles that will be used against the Arab coalition and would target the Saudi capital.\nIn a speech aired on Al Masirah TV, Abdel Malik al-Houthi offered no evidence or figures for the number of drones and missiles allegedly manufactured by the rebels but the UAE, which is part of the coalition, has recently accused the Iran of providing the Houthis with drones.\nThe speech also followed a Houthi claim earlier in the week that they targeted Riyadh with missiles.\nThere was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia but a week ago, it said a \"suicide gunboat\" belonging to the Houthis rammed into one of its frigates in the Red Sea, killing two crew members.\nYemen artists create beauty from rubble of war \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:10:08.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
