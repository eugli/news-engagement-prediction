Goodwin rocked a stunning red lace gown that came up to her neck. To be honest, she looked more like the Red Queen than Snow White, but we appreciate the bold choice in dress. Dallas went with a classic black tux and velvet jacket with a bowtie. Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas \nCheck out all of our Oscars coverage here \nIt's great to see the couple together on the red carpet. Currently on Once Upon a Time , their characters are separated by a sleeping curse where as long as one of them is awake, the other one is stuck under the curse. They haven't been able to share scenes together for most of Season 6 and when the show returns next week Charming will have his hands full trying to protect Emma ( Jennifer Morrison ) from Gideon ( Giles Matthey ). \nWhat do you think of their red carpet look? \nOnce Upon a Time returns Sunday, March 5 at 8/7c on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:52:58.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
