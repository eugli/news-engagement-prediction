The process can take 30-40 minutes.\nThe technology, described in Nature Biomedical Engineering , sits in the operating theatre.\nIt fires a beam of light at the tissue, and the laser-light's properties are changed depending on what it hits.\nThe differing chemistry of a cancerous cell and normal brain tissue means the laser help surgeons find the outside edge of a tumour.\nNo decisions were made with just the laser-technology while it was still being tested.\nDr Orringer said the aim was to give \"more efficient, safer and more accurate care\".\nHe told the BBC News website: \"It was magical when we made that transition to the operating room.\n\"It makes a huge difference, the process currently in place dates back to the 1800s, and we have something disruptive, in a good way, and the implications are pretty profound.\"\nHe says one of the early lessons is \"a lot of the times we think we're done operating we should probably keep going, with the microscope we have the capacity to see that\".\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the technology will increase survival rates. That will not be known until it has been used in long-term clinical trials.\nFollow James on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0A77/production/_93997620_073-2448_3_heflatrawstacks-1.jpg", "https://twitter.com/JamesTGallagher", "http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/s41551-016-0027", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/54AF/production/_93997612_karenwsonluke.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/117FF/production/_93997617_crsmicroscope_orringer010.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-06T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:49:35.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
