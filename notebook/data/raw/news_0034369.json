If you become a comfortable person, I think that subtracts growth from the equation.\n“I think if you remain somewhat uncomfortable, you continue to grow. You don’t become stagnant. You don’t become set in our ways. On every level, I want us to be uncomfortable.\n“You want to guard against any complacency in the sense that you just expect it to happen, just because you had done it. That’s a bad assumption to make, and I don’t think our guys will jump there.\n“But I think it’s our responsibility to talk about it. Talk about all of the potential pitfalls in advance. Talk about how you attack them, about how you approach them, and eventually, they fall by the wayside.’’\nThe Cubs, bidding to become the first National League team to repeat as World Series champions since the Cincinnati Reds in 1975-76, barely tinkered with their nucleus. They let center fielder Dexter Fowler leave for the rival St. Louis Cardinals, but picked up Jon Jay to share center field duties with Albert Almora. Jason Hammel will be replaced in the rotation by Mike Montgomery, or possibly Brett Anderson. Aroldis Chapman, who was picked up at the trade deadline, is gone but All-Star Wade Davis is the new closer.\nGallery: Best pictures from Spring Training Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Best pictures from Spring Training Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Their biggest offseason pickup simply is the return of Kyle Schwarber, back from his reconstructive knee surgery that cost him all but two regular-season games last year, before starring as a DH in the World Series. He would like to return to catching, but the Cubs plan to keep him as their everyday left fielder.\nReally, the Cubs are going to look a whole lot like they did last year, only with a little bling on those fingers, and a fan base hungry to be spoiled by a dynasty.\n“I don’t think we accomplished what we accomplished last year,’’ Epstein says, “by trying to replicate anything. Or by trying to artificially create something that wasn’t there. It was by being authentic, and by being ourselves.\n“Everybody’s in a little different place in their life now. The relationships will be a little different. The mix isn’t exactly the same. We look forward to that.\n“It’s OK to embrace a little bit of change as long as the important elements remain the same. And we have the important elements in place. Our guys are individually driven.’’\nReally, there’s no reason why the Cubs won’t repeat as NL Central champs, after running away with the division a year ago — finishing 17 ½ games ahead of the Cardinals. While the Cardinals were scrambling Tuesday with the prospect that rookie starter Alex Reyes could face Tommy John surgery, the Cubs’ biggest worry is making sure those World Series rings are ready by the April 12 ceremony at Wrigley Field.\nIf anything gets out of whack, they plan to rely on the same character that got them together during that Game 7 rain delay against Cleveland, with a players-only meeting led by Jason Heyward.\n“Our guys got together in a room, void of any kind of statistical, video, or analytical information,’’ Maddon says. “They went in there as human beings, and came out unified. You do that, and it’s kind of antithetical to what’s going on right now. I don’t want us to forget the heartbeat ever.’’\nA championship was won.\nA tradition was born.\nPerhaps even a dynasty.", "external_links":
