UK could remain a top 10 global economy in 2050, despite Brexit - our #Worldin2050 report is released today https://t.co/QSmQdroM7W — PwC UK (@PwC_UK) February 7, 2017 \nMacroeconomists use PPP to determine the economic productivity and standards of living between countries over a given period. The 32 countries from the ranking currently account for around 85 percent of global GDP. \nThe study found that by 2050, the UK will only drop from 9th to 10th place. Britain’s economy will grow faster than some of Europe's largest economies such as France, Germany, and Italy as a result of “favorable demographic factors and a relatively flexible economy by European standards,” it said.

However, for the next two years, the bank projected slowing growth with GDP expanding by 1.6 percent this year, and 1.7 percent next.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:00:20.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
