He said his department was cooperating with other relevant agencies in this investigation but the Criminal Investigation Department was taking the lead. \nMalaysia's deputy prime minister Zahid Hamidi also said the North Korean embassy confirmed for the first time on Thursday that the North Korean man found dead at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday - who had \"Kim Chol\" written on his travel documents - was Kim Jong Nam.

Intelligence chiefs in South Korea have said that female agents dispatched by their secretive northern neighbour administered the lethal dose, with reports suggesting a toxin was sprayed in his face. \nTwo women - carrying travel documents from Vietnam and Indonesia - have been detained in connection with the case. The Indonesian suspect's boyfriend, a Malaysian man, has also been arrested. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:36:41.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
