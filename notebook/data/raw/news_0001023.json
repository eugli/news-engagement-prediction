The teens' Egyptian-born father, Yaser Abdel Said, fled and is still at large. \nThe footage, obtained by Crime Watch Daily with Chris Hansen and filmed by Yaser Said, shows the girls in their bedroom with Said making comments such as \"Sarah sleeps with her pants?\" \"Mmm, very nice,\" and \"Wow, look at those eyes. I got my eye on you.\" Amina Said, left, and Sarah Said in their Lewisville ISD school portraits. Lewisville ISD \nIn one clip, Amina is playing with a gun. \n\"She started telling me just little by little that it was more than him just being protective, it was more him being controlling and abusive,\" Amina's boyfriend, Joseph Moreno, says. \"I wanted to get her away from that so bad, she was such a good person she didn't deserve to live like that.\" \nThe full episode of Crime Watch will air at 4 p.m. Friday on KDAF-TV (Channel 33). \nAmina and Sarah accused their father of sexual abuse in October 1998, when they were 9 and 8 years old. The allegations were reported to the Hill County sheriff's office, and their mother, Patricia Owens, swore in an affidavit that the allegations were true. For years, friends say, slain sisters lived with their father's threats of violence and abuse \nMonths later, the girls told authorities that they had lied about the allegations because they did not want to attend schools in a rural community south of Fort Worth, and wanted to live with their grandmother. The charges were dropped. \nOwens' relatives have said Said was prone to violence and that he believed Western society was corrupting his daughters' chastity. This prompted speculation that the slayings were \"honor killings,\" however Owens has rejected that. \nFriends and family members say Said moved the family from Euless to Lewisville to break up his daughter and her non-Muslim boyfriend. The teens attended Lewisville High School where they confided in friends about the physical abuse and their dreams of going to college. Mother of slain teen girls still haunted by alleged honor killings \nA month before the shootings, friends and family said Said became angry because he found one his daughters were dating and threatened to harm them. On Christmas Day, Owens, her daughters and their boyfriends fled the state. \nBut they returned to Lewisville on New Year's Eve. Hours later, the daughters were found in the taxi. \nIn December 2014, Said made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List . A $100,000 reward has been offered. The flier says Said always wears dark sunglasses and frequents Denny's and IHOP restaurants. \nSome people believe Said is dead, others believe he could be hiding in plain sight in North Texas, perhaps being sheltered by someone. \nHe has ties in Egypt and Canada, and across the country in Texas, New York and Virginia. \nThe case has also been featured in a documentary entitled The Price of Honor .
