Photo: FADEL SENNA/AFP/Getty Images Jazz legend Al Jarreau died Sunday at the age of 76, his manager confirms . His death comes just days after Jarreau entered a Los Angeles hospital and announced his retirement from touring, citing exhaustion. The singer had been touring for nearly 50 years, making up for a late professional start, as he didn’t secure a recording contract until he was 35. Throughout his career, Jarreau was renowned for his versatility — he won seven Grammys overall and did so across the jazz, pop, and R&B categories. Despite his critical accomplishments, Jarreau never had the mainstream recognition of peers like Al Green and Stevie Wonder, though he did find commercial success in songs like “We’re in This Love Together,” “Mornin’,’” and the theme to Moonlighting . Jarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and his son, Ryan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:14:04.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
