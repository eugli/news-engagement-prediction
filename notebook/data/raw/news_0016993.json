It is prohibited with the exception of some charity organizations.         \nThe City of Dorval issued a warning to citizens on its Facebook page Tuesday, saying a number of residents reported suspicious visits from solicitors at their homes.\n\nPeople in other West Island cities have also reported similar encounters.\n\nThey say the scam involves someone calling or going door-to-door and claiming to be contracted by the city to verify the heating system in the home.\n\nThey insist on looking at the furnace or hot water tank.\n\nSome residents say the solicitor is aggressive, trying to push the homeowner to buy a new one.\n\nSimilar incidents have occurred across Canada and in some U.S. states.\nDorval spokesperson Sebastien Gauthier said they are working with police, adding that what concerns them the most is that the salespeople are falsely claiming to be contracted by the city.\n“If they have any doubts about the good word of that company, we advise they can call the city just to make sure that we haven't given out an authorization,” he said. “We’ve never done it so the bet would be that it's false.”\n\nGauthier advises calling your local public security or the police if you feel you've been approached with a scam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:38:06.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
