Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email The meaning of the word \"no\" seems to be a difficult one for some men to grasp.\nSo when this bikini model told a creepy TV presenter to keep his hands off her backside during a gratuitous sunscreen demonstration, he presumably thought she was joking. \nSo you can imagine his confusion when, after doing precisely what he was instructed not to do, he got a massive slap round the face and had bottles of sunblock launched at him live on television.\nThe model, Rayssa Teixeiro Melo, has won praise online for her response to the lascivious lech's brazen bum-grab, which happened during a supposed health segment of a Brazilian TV show.\nRead More 3 women's shocking stories of sexism they experienced at work Rayssa Mela slaps a TV presenter for touching her bum (Photo: br.blastingnews.com) He can have few complaints having been told quite clearly not to go there (Photo: br.blastingnews.com) With Melo standing awkwardly in a dental floss bikini and heels, the sun lotion 'expert' strides on in tight white t-shirt and begins slowly rubbing the cream onto her thighs.\nAt first, Melo tries to smile through it, as the man spends far too long applying lotion to her legs and stomach.\nBut eventually the creep oversteps the mark, sliding his hand round onto her right buttock.\nShe grabs hold of his wrist and tells him, firmly: \"No, that’s my bottom.\n\"Do you know this part, the bum?\"\nStartled, the man mutters an apology and asks if he continue, which Melo agrees to.\nBut when he squeezes her bum for a second time he is immediately struck around the face with a satisfying clap.\nHow women are still being told to go blonde and wear high heels and short skirts at work \nModel Rayssa Teixeira Melo has a huge social media following (Photo: Instagram/rayssateixeiramelo) She's made no mention of the TV show since (Photo: Instagram/rayssateixeiramelo) Melo walks round the presenters' table and hurls bottles of sun lotion at the goatied grabber, who doesn't seem to understand what he's done wrong.\nEven after all that, the presenter still requires a producer to walk onset and actually, verbally, explain to him where the leg ends and the bottom begins.\nOne social media praised Melo, tweeting: “Good on her. She was making sure she got respect.”\nBut further proving her class, Melo herself has made no mention of it on her Facebook or Instagram pages, where she commands a large following.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Bikinis Bums", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T15:57:56.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
