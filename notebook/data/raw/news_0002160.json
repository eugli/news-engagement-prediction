His grandfather, Maurice King, was the first African-American starter in Kansas basketball history during the 1954 season. So there was no more fitting a place to honor him than at the Allen Fieldhouse. He did so by adding \"King\" before Wainright's last name on the back of his jersey.

He spent four years in Lawrence (from 1953-57) before being selected in the sixth round of the 1957 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. He then spent two years in the Army before playing professionally from 1959-63. King played only one game for the Celtics before joining the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Professional Basketball League. \nKing passed away in 2007. \nOn Wednesday, Wainright scored 8 points on 3-of-8 shooting and added four steals in the Bears' 73-68 loss to Kansas .
