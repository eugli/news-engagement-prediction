Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cardiff's Principality Stadium hosted the FA Cup final between 2000 and 2006 \nAnd Mr Jones said it was the very fact no one yet knows who will star in this year's final which makes the planning so uncertain. \n\"This is the biggest [event Cardiff has hosted] to my mind, no question about that,\" he said. \n\"It's the sheer numbers of people, the sheer size of the event and the fact that we don't know who's going to be in the final so we don't know where the fans are going to come from.\" \nHe said the planners were talking to all the authorities and organisations necessary to make the event a success. \n\"Cardiff is the smallest city to have hosted the event. It's always challenging, of course, but we'll get there and we'll be offering a fantastic welcome to all who come to our capital city,\" he added.
