He said that he was advised to \"bring everyone together\" as a host and to \"say something to unite\" the country. \n\"I can't do that,\" said Kimmel. \"There's only one braveheart in this room, and he's not going to unite us either.\" The camera flashed to Mel Gibson, who smiled. \"Mel, you look great. I think the Scientology is working I really do.\" \nThe host went on to make jokes about President Trump , his faux nemesis Matt Damon, and Meryl Streep \"for her many uninspiring and overrated performances.\" \n\"I want to say thank you to President Trump. Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist? That's gone, thanks to him,\" said Kimmel. He complimented Hollywood for being welcoming to outsiders, pointing out that Hollywood doesn't discriminate based on where people are from, but instead discriminates based on age and weight. \n\"It has been an amazing year. Black people saved NASA and white people saved jazz. That's what you call progress.\" He added that all of the nominated-movies are very sad this year and joked that the only \"happy ending\" was the one in the middle of Moonlight. \nKimmel continued his ongoing feud with Damon, saying he's known the actor forever —\"when I first met Matt, I was the fat one\"— and made fun of him for giving the lead Manchester by the Sea role to Casey Affleck. \"Smooth move, dumbass.\" \nThe Oscars host went around the room calling out different nominees. He told Oscar nominee and French actress Isabelle Huppert that nobody has seen her film Elle but he's glad homeland security let her in. He said that Denzel Washington, who starred and directed in the Oscar-nominated film Fences , had always wanted to work with himself. Kimmel commended Andrew Garfield for losing 40 pounds for his film Silence , saying that that amount of weight lost \"hasn't been attempted since every actress in every role ever.\" \nAmazon is the first streaming service nominated for an Oscar and Kimmel pointed that out, telling founder and CEO Jeff Bezos that if he wins tonight he can expect his Oscar to arrive in 2-5 business days. \n\"Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster career,\" joked Kimmel, alluding to Trump's insult that Streep was overrated. He asked the audience to give her a \"totally undeserved round of applause\" and they responded with a standing ovation . He added, \"Nice dress by the way, is that an Ivanka?\" \nIt's Kimmel's first time hosting the Oscars. In his pre-show interview with The Hollywood Reporter Kimmel said he plans to put a spin on traditions, take a gamble a few times with his bits, and said he will definitely feed the audience. In an interview with Good Morning America he said that it's possible he'll have a \"mean tweets\" segment on the awards show. \nAfter the first award was handed out, Kimmel pretended to kick out any reporters from CNN, The New York Times and the L.A. Times , a joke about several news outlets being denied entry to a White House press briefing last week. \n\"If you're from CNN or the L.A . or New York Times — if you work for anything with the word 'Times' in it, even like Medieval Times — I'd like to ask you to leave the building right now, OK?\" he joked. \"We have no tolerance for fake news. Fake tans we love, but [not] fake news.\" \nJimmy Kimmel drops Red Vines and Junior Mints from the sky: \"Time to find out how well those Spanx really work.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/M4jjGTwQx4 — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \n\nThe Oscars are held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center in Los Angeles and broadcast on ABC.
