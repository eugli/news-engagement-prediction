A federal judge in Washington agreed last week, saying the deal would violate antitrust law. Anthem is appealing. \nRelated: U.S. sues to block 2 major healthcare mergers \nWhen she sued all four companies last year to block the two mergers, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the combinations ran the risk of \"drastically constricting competition\" in health care. \nThe two mergers would have left the health insurance industry dominated by only three giant insurers. The third company is UnitedHealth ( UNH ) .
