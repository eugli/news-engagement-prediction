He brought great energy and leadership to our locker room and I wish him the best.” \nDefensive tackle Paul Soliai also will be cut by the Panthers, his agent confirmed Tuesday on Twitter. \nSoliai played in 10 games last season after signing a two-year, $7 million contract in 2016. \nJackson talks Eagles \nFree agency fuels speculation, and DeSean Jackson's impending availability has sparked ideas of a potential reunion with the Philadelphia Eagles. \nJackson played for the Eagles for six seasons before being released in 2014 by then-coach Chip Kelly. Though the Washington Redskins receiver didn't address his specific plans or the likelihood he would rejoin his former team, he said he understood what having his career come full circle would mean. \n“It definitely is a great story or ending, I guess you could say,” Jackson said. “Starting your career somewhere then going to a division rival team (and) having the possibility of maybe going back. You just kind of think about all of that when you start somewhere maybe you could finish it. There is just a lot of speculation of a lot of thoughts. It all sounds good, but you really never know until the final decision is made. \n\"I’m just a firm believer that if you work hard, you put in the work, continuously go out there and show everybody what you’re capable of [then] the sky’s the limit.” \nJackson added that one of his top priorities for his decision is playing with a top-tier quarterback. \n\"I'm going on my 10th year in the league. I obviously would love to play with a great, great, great quarterback,\" he said, adding that, \"I think Kirk Cousins is a great quarterback; he's done crazy things the past couple of years as far as statistics.\" \nPHOTOS: Best potential NFL free agents Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:31:33.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
