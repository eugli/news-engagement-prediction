(Geoff Scheerer / Pioneer Press) Karen Ann Cullotta now can earn cybersecurity certifications to work in the field.\n\"We're trying to give our students as much experience as we can before they leave high school,\" said Tom Polak, a computer instructor at Hersey. \nStudents from Polak's five-member team recently participated in the Air Force Association's \"CyberPatriot Competition,\" capturing first place in state for the Gold Tier category, along with finishing in eighth place during the Midwest Regional Finish, which was announced last week. \nThe national competition is meant to encourage students' interest in a cybersecurity profession and other fields involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, according to the association's CyberPatriot website. \n\"There are not enough qualified people out there and not enough schools that are teaching students, not only the skills to understand the hardware and software, but also the ethics these employees need to have to do the job properly,\" said Polak, who also teaches computer courses at Wheeling High School. \nCorporate demands in cybersecurity does outpace the number of available trained candidates by \"alarming rates,\"according to a January 2017 study by Trustwave and Osterman Research on the challenges businesses face when trying to recruit cybersecurity professionals Tom Polak Geoff Scheerer / Pioneer Press \nComputer science teacher Tom Polak works with student Josh Bayless in a computer repair class at Hersey High School. \nComputer science teacher Tom Polak works with student Josh Bayless in a computer repair class at Hersey High School. (Geoff Scheerer / Pioneer Press) \nBased on a survey of 147 IT security \"decision makers and influencers,\" the study found that organizations increasingly are vulnerable to data breaches, malware, phishing and other security problems because of a \"fast-moving confluence of skills shortages, worsening threats and disproportionate spending habits.\" \nThe struggles that many businesses and government organizations face when trying to recruit qualified IT cybersecurity workers is no surprise to 17-year-old Hersey junior Mark Thomas. \nThomas is enrolled in a mentorship program at a Prospect Heights company that is using the student's fledgling skills to try and prevent security breaches of network systems. \n\"I'm working on penetration testing and helping them with software that people don't have advanced knowledge about,\" said Thomas, a resident of Prospect Heights. \nThomas also has enrolled in Hersey's three courses that eventually lead students to taking the cybersecurity certification test. \nThe courses begin with a basic class that teaches students how to repair computers, as well as other digital devices, including iPads and iPhones. \nOther classes at Hersey provide instruction on various hardware and software, as well as an advanced networking and security course that prepares students for the certification exam. \nIf successfully completed, the certification can tell potential employers that a student has the knowledge and experience to be hired for entry level IT jobs and internships, Polak said. \n\"One of the things the certification does is get the students in the door,\" said Polak, adding how he is trying to raise awareness of the program at Hersey and increase the number of students currently enrolled in the three IT classes. \nAnd with roughly 90 percent of his current students enrolled in the program being male, Polak said he also is hoping to increase the number of female students in his classrooms. \nPolak also recently invited a representative from Brooksource – an IT placement organization – into his classroom to talk to his students about the industry, how to create online resumes and the specific skills needed to secure IT and cybersecurity jobs. \nStudents who complete the three IT classes, which Polak said are considered to be \"dual credit\" courses, also earn college credit that can let students start a more advanced level of coursework once they are enrolled at a college or university. \nFor Hersey senior Luke Allen, 17, of Arlington Heights, Polak's classes are preparing him for computer engineering classes he plans to take next year at the University of Illinois at Chicago . \n\"I hope to be a 'white hat' hacker, someone you would hire to do penetration tests and potentially find loopholes in your system,\" Allen said, explaining how so-called \"black hats\" are the nefarious hackers using their cybersecurity skills for criminal reasons. \nkcullotta@tribpub.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:37:07.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
