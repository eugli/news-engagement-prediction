The Washington Post website is seen in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017. The Post is featuring a new motto on the paper’s website: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” The words now appear underneath the name of the paper on its website. ... more >   22,   \nSomeone needs to get The Washington Post’s editors an antidepressant — stat! \nIf anyone thought The Post wasn’t upset — or fearful — of Donald Trump’s presidency, all they need to do is visit the paper’s online edition. \nBelow their logo reads: “Democracy dies in darkness.” \nCNN’s Brian Stelter had the skinny on the new logo, asking the paper’s spokesperson what it all meant. \n“This is actually something we’ve said internally for a long time in speaking about our mission,” spokesperson Kris Coratti, told Stelter. “We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year. We started with our newest readers on Snapchat, and plan to roll it out on our other platforms in the coming weeks.” \nAs Mr. Stelter points out, the paper’s owner Jeff Bezos used the phrase at a Post event last year. Interesting, if it’s been the paper’s motto for years, that they’re just rolling it out now. \nIt was quickly mocked on Twitter, with Photoshopped fake logos taking its place. \n“Soon, we will all be dust. In the distance, a lone dog howls mournfully. Ragnarok,” wrote Tom Phillips, the editorial director at BuzzFeed UK. \n“Pay our subscription fee or fascism will literally take over,” Caleb Ecarma penned. \n“(Wake me up!) Wake me up inside. (I can’t wake up!)” scribed Huffington Post reporter Eliot Nelson. \nHorrifying. \nBut at least Matt Nippert, a reporter at the New Zealand Herald, found humor in such a dark time. \n“If you’re not saying the new WaPo slogan with a Christian Bale Batman voice you miss its deeper meaning,” he wrote on Twitter. \nIndeed. \nNewsflash, Washington Post: Just do your job — you’re neither a victim nor a hero. \nMiddle America couldn’t care less about the media as a news story, but would like to read more about the policies and political actions that affect them. They would like you to give voice to the voiceless — and that doesn’t mean your news staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:43:24.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
