The Don't Be Tardy star, 38, posted a photo of a questionnaire that her son Kash, 4, filled out, where he says he loves his dad, Kroy Biermann , because \"he lets me hold his real gun.\" Snapchat \nThe piece of paper appeared to be a homework assignment and was filled in by an adult. Kash also answered that Biermann, 31, enjoys steak and Sprite, plays football and his favorite thing to do is to \"ride his 4-wheeler.\" Kroy Biermann and Kim Zolciak Dimitrios Kambouris/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images \nZolciak clearly was proud of her son. \"I [love] this!\" she captioned the pic. \nLast year, Kash dressed up in a military outfit and carried a fake gun for Halloween. A photo posted by Kash Biermann (@kashbiermann) on Dec 11, 2016 at 6:14pm PST \nIn a second photo, she shared a letter that Kash gave to the former NFL player. \"Dear Dad, I love you.
