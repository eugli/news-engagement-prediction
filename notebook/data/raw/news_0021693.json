If I had been at home and just woken up in a daze and turned on the light without realising all the water was coming out of it. I could have been electrocuted. 'It went on for about five hours in total - apparently a pipe had burst upstairs in a couple of different places. 'We are students and it shouldn't happen while we are living here. It's not really what you want when you have moved to a new town and are making new friends.' First year student Miss Silvente says she could have been electrocuted by the water leak Photos show a steady stream of water pouring from the light bulb during the incident A burst pipe flooded the bedrooms of some students at the site and other said water poured through light fittings and smoke detectors for around five hours. Miss Silvente said: 'One girl whose room was above me, her room was like a swimming pool. In total about five rooms were completely flooded. 'Luckily my room was quite tidy and organised so there wasn't anything on the floor to get damaged, but my Macbook charger is destroyed. 'Luckily, by the time I got back they had turned all the electricity off. When I posted the video a lot of people were really concerned. 'My stepmum said how dangerous it was and my mum was worried. There was a risk of electrocution.' A number of students rooms at the University of Gloucestershire were flooded on Monday Stewart Dove, director of student services at the University of Gloucestershire, said: 'After a burst water pipe our accommodation team acted quickly together with the property owners to swiftly resolve the issue and support the students affected. 'Six students have been temporarily rehoused in alternative university accommodation whilst the building is restored to its normal condition and safety checks are made. 'Students in halls also have insurance as part of their lease and we will provide support to make any claims for any damage caused.'
