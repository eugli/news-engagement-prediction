So yes, it is a historic moment for both teams and the countries as well,” he said on Wednesday. \n“I hope this can happen much more. We have gone there too many times, they should come here more often. It will be great for them to come and play here in India. Great place to play cricket. They will enjoy it. \nKohli, who led India to an 18-Test unbeaten run, is looking forward to the clash. \n“It is a special occasion. I just happen to be the captain at this time. But it will be a special day.” \nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India, however, were not too keen on inviting Bangladesh to their domain. \nThe decision to set up the series, containing just one encounter in Test whites, followed persistent plea from the Bangladesh Cricket Board. \nThe Tigers and their fans would hope Kohli’s words shakes up the Indian board’s view. \n‘More Tests for Bangladesh’ \nLooking back at Bangladesh versus India limited-overs fixtures over the recent years, the tie now promises much excitement in the world stage. \nBut with India being the top-ranked team now and Bangladesh languishing near the bottom, the situation in Tests is quite a contrast. \nThe difference of either team’s abilities to endure pressure and be consistent over five days is too great, even more so when it’s on India’s backyard. \nKohli, who is ranked second behind Australia’s Steve Smith in ICC’s Test batsmen’s list, thinks Bangladesh’s Test prospects have been held back though they have the qualities needed to be a strong team in this format as well. \n“I think they have the skill they just don’t play that many Test matches to gain confidence as a squad. It’s very basic,” he said. \n“They have become a very good one-day side because of the fact that they play so many one-dayers and they have their set combinations. If you don’t play Test cricket very often, you will never understand the mindset.” \nHe underlined the difference in approach as a game changer to get success in various formats. \n“You can practice as much as you want but game time is important. Ability is going to be there. It’s the mindset that changes from format to format. I am sure that if they play more Test cricket they will become solid Test players and a solid Test team as well. \n“I think it should be pushed. They certainly have the ability to compete at the Test level. We are vary of their skills and the talent that they bring to the table. We are going to focus on what we do best as a team. \nKohli’s words will not only provide impetus to Mushfiqur and his men, who were mauled in New Zealand in their last series, but should also draw attention of global authorities of the game. \nExecutives at BCB should also take notice and stop choosing limited-overs series over playing Tests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T21:21:12.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
