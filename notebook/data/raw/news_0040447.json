The charges involve incidents with two different girls, in 2013 and another in 2016. According to the documents, the girl, known as victim No.1, knew Sandusky personally. Her mother dated Sandusky for six years, and Sandusky lived with the woman and her children for five of those years. In the report, the victim claims she could hear Sandusky walking down the hallway when she was showering \"and hears the footsteps stop as if someone is looking into the bathroom.\" \nAccording to the police report, the alleged crimes were brought to the attention of the police in March of 2016 when the girl told her father that Sandusky had texted her repeatedly, asking her to send him naked photos. During the course of the investigation, police found a second girl, the sister of the first victim – referred to as victim No. 2 – who told police that Sandusky asked her to engage in oral sex with him years before . Both victims told the police that Sandusky used a number of different excuses to get photos from them, including saying that he \"studied medicine.\" \nSandusky was arraigned Monday, and a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for February 22nd. \nIn 2011, Jerry Sandusky was the focal point in a child sexual abuse scandal that rocked Penn State University and college football. He was convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys and was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison at the age of 68. The scandal ended the Penn State careers of a number of figures, including legendary coach Joe Paterno. The school took steps to try and fix the damage, including taking down a statue of Paterno . The NCAA levied sanctions on the school, and students rioted after the news broke that the school had fired the coach. \nFive years later, in 2016, the school celebrated Paterno , who was said to have ignored complaints of Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault . \nJeffrey Sandusky is being held in county jail on $200,000 bail and is prohibited from having any sort of contact with minors. It was reported that he had been suspended from his job at the Rockview State Correctional facility pending investigation.
