The Election Commission believes the figure could touch 70% when over a lakh voters who were in queues at 5pm are counted. Many villagers in the Garhwal and Kumaon hills who had threatened to boycott the polls in order to \"teach politicians a lesson\" kept their promise as zero to minimal turnout was recorded in several booths in rural areas. Over 600 villagers of Gangolihat constituency in Pithoragarh who were demanding a road refrained from voting. It was a similar scene in Kweerijimia village of Dharchula where only four votes were cast till 3 pm. Of the main seats, Nainital registered 70%, Haridwar 70%, &Uttarkashi 73%. Polling in 69 of the 70 seats in the hill state was peaceful. Chief electoral officer Radha Raturi said, \"This is the highest polling in the state and a major achievement. There were no complaints and no repolling has been ordered.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:45:05.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
