Stephen Evans: What will Trump do about North Korea? \nThe latest development comes just days after the suspicious killing of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, at an airport in Malaysia. \nKim, who was largely estranged from his family, had spent much of his time overseas in the Chinese territory of Macau, where he was seen to have had the protection of China. \nWill Kim Jong-nam's killing derail North Korea-China ties? A significant development - by Robin Brant, BBC News, Beijing correspondent \nThe tightening from China has been incremental but this is a key move. It follows North Korea's test of a more sophisticated missile earlier this month. It may also be linked to the assassination of Kim Jong-un's half brother this week. \nFor North Korea, this targets the trade it relies on most heavily for cash. Almost all its coal exports go next door to China. Up to now the Beijing authorities had permitted some trade in coal, for \"the people's\" wellbeing'. That should now end. \nChina stopped importing some precious metals almost a year ago and banned the sale going the other way of fuel and other items associated with the weapons programme. \nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency reported last week that the $1m coal shipment had been stopped at Wenzhou port, on China's eastern coast on 13 February. \nA day earlier, North Korea had tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions banning the country from carrying out such actions. \nLast year, China said it would halt coal imports to North Korea with some exceptions. \nDespite this, Chinese data showed that North Korean coal exports to China had risen more than 12% in the past 12 months.
