Article continues below \nThe Portuguese was clearly in no mood for conversation with the press after the final whistle and looked for any excuse to cut short each post-match interview he was obliged to give. \nHowever, he still found time to aim a sly dig at Jurgen Klopp and claimed he doesn't receive the same treatment as the Liverpool boss.
