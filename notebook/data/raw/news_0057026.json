We are now harnessing the energy of the brand and bringing it to the street in a more casual atmosphere.” \nIncluded on the line-up is a duck jam doughnut and a duck burger made with crispy duck leg and the option of whipped foie gras, as well as its parent restaurant’s namesake classic: confit duck leg on a waffle with a fried egg, served with maple syrup. Famous London restaurants: Duck & Waffle \nDan said: “We’ve seen that at Duck & Waffle people are ordering a lot of duck and loving it, so we thought why not explore that and focus on it while showcasing its versatility — it doesn’t have to be duck a l’orange.” \nThere will also be a decent showing for vegetable dishes, including grilled sprouting broccoli with chilli, garlic, lemon and almonds, and baby spinach with peas, avocado, grains and seeds. London Food Month: Standard launches Britain's biggest food festival \nOther dishes from Duck & Waffle to make the transfer include spiced pigs ears and the Full Elvis dessert: a peanut butter and jelly waffle with vanilla cream, peanut brittle, berries and caramelised banana. \nDiners at the new site will order at the counter before being shown to a table in order to allow for speedy service, while there will also be the option of pre-ordering for a set collection slot for those wanting food-to-go. \nDrinks are designed to be equally speedy, with a short selection of specially-designed cocktails from Duck & Waffle’s resident mixologist Rich Woods available on tap alongside some bers and wines. The highest restaurants and bars in London The highest restaurants and bars in London 1/14 OXO Tower Restaurant \n8th floor (fourteenth highest) A bit of a London institution, the restaurant, brasserie and bar within the OXO Tower are no longer the high-up dining spaces they once were, having been overshadowed by neighbours such as The Shard. Still, the views across the river to St Paul’s are pretty special. 2/14 Min Jiang \n10th floor (thirteenth highest) This Chinese restaurant (the first of no fewer than three in this list) is set within the Royal Garden Hotel on Kensington High Street and overlooks Will and Kate (well, Kensington Palace at least) and Hyde Park. It specialises in dim sum as well as Beijing duck cooked in a wood-fired oven. 3/14 Kojowan \n23rd floor (twelfth highest) This recent opening at the top of the HIlton Metropole on Edgware Road is a form of izakaya (Japanese gastropub) on high. Expect fusion dishes such as ponzu popcorn prawns and a glazed lobster-dog along with cocktails and Japanese beers. 4/14 City Social \n24th floor (eleventh highest) Set within Tower 42, this city outpost of Jason Atherton’s empire serves a menu that shows off the best of british produce while also dabbling (rather successfully, we may add) in European styles — it’s currently the only one of his restaurants to serve pasta. 5/14 Galvin at Windows \n28th floor (tenth highest) This Michelin-starred restaurant from the Galvin brothers has been around since 2006, and is still a favourite. Set within the Hilton on Park Lane, it serves high-end French fare complemented by leafy views over Hyde Park. 6/14 Aqua Shard \n31st floor (ninth highest) The lowest restaurant in The Shard (unless you count the ground floor café, Aqua still boasts some pretty impressive views. Its British menu takes classics and gives them a twist, with a large chunk of the produce used coming from Borough and Maltby Street markets below. Its latest chef is Dale Osborne, who previously cooked at Chiltern Firehouse. 7/14 Oblix \n32nd floor (eighth highest) Claiming the title of London’s highest steakhouse, plush Oblix comes with a wine station and plenty of hanging meat, should you want a view other than the streets of London below. Along with high-end flesh, the menu spans Japanese black cod, smoked salmon and ceviche. 8/14 Hutong \n33rd floor (seventh highest) With an interior filled with hanging red lanterns and jaw-dropping views across London, there’s something a tad Bladerunner about this northern Chinese restaurant in The Shard. Highlights include dim sum as well as soft-shell crab served in a bowl of sichuan chillies. 9/14 Ting \n35th floor (sixth highest) This is the highest restaurant in The Shard, and forms part of the Shangri-La Hotel. It boasts 360 degree reviews to complement a Chinese menu and Asian-tinged afternoon teas. 10/14 Darwin Brasserie \n36th floor (fifth highest) The main restaurant in the Walkie Talkie, Darwin Brasserie serves a modern European menu spanning fish and chips, pasta and pies along with breakfast and brunch. It directly overlooks The Shard, so you can sit eye-to-eye with another high-up diner across the river. 11/14 Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill \n37th floor (fourth highest) This highest eatery in the Walkie Talkie's Sky Garden, this restaurant focuses on oysters, seafood platters, fish dishes and caviar. 12/14 Sushisamba \n38th and 39th floors (third highest) Japanese and South American cuisines are fused at this stylish spot in the sky, with sushi and sashimi being the biggest draw. It boasts London’s highest outdoor seating area (complete with fire pits) and a rather special Great Glass Elevator ride to get inside. 13/14 Duck & Waffle \n40th floor (second highest) This iconic London restaurant, led by chef Dan Doherty, is not only the highest in the UK (and second highest bar) but also one of few to be open 24 hours. Take in views over the Gherkin and beyond while tucking into dishes such as its namesake: crispy confit duck leg topped with a fried duck egg and served on a waffle — or pop in for an out-of-hours drink. 14/14 Gong \n52nd floor (highest) Set near the peak of London’s tallest building, The Shard, this cocktail bar isn’t big, but it is impressive. Watch what look like model trains pull into and out of London Bridge station below you while indulging in well-made if fairly expensive drinks. the-shard.com \nThe restaurant will serve right through from 8am to 1am and is due to open in May. It is the latest restaurant to open within the St James’s Market development that also includes Veneta and Aquavit . \nIs this the first of many Duck & Waffle Local’s to arrive around London? Probably. “If people like it and it’s popular then why not,” said Dan.
