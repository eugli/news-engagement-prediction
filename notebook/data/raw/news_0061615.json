'Unexpected outcome' \nThe cross-party F40 group represents 41 local authority members with historically low education funding. \nSupported by MPs, councillors, education directors, heads, teachers and parents, it has long argued that the existing funding model is outdated, has no rationale and is unfair. \nIt has highlighted how pupils on different sides of a council boundary can attract very different levels of funding. \nMinisters agreed the existing system was outdated and unjustifiable, and after a series of delays the government published a final consultation on the proposals in December 2016. \nThe plans are set to be implemented in 2018-19. \nF40 chairman Ivan Ould, a Leicestershire County Council member, said: \"The proposed funding formula indicates a total gain of Â£183m for F40 member authorities once the national formula is fully implemented from 2019-20. \n\"But that has to be tempered by an outcome that none of us really anticipated: that some poorly funded authorities will not gain, and that many schools, both primary and secondary, within poorly funded authorities will actually lose out.\" \nEarlier this week, the group lobbied MPs, many of whom are alarmed that so many schools in their areas are losers. \nThe group argues: Plans to limit budget cuts for losers to 3% will \"lock in\" historical advantages for schools \"overfunded\" for decades As the fair funding formula does not increase the overall schools budget, there could be severe problems for those who have to reduce budgets, especially in lower funded areas The new formula gives too much weight to additional needs as opposed to per pupil funding, and risks replacing one unfairness with another The evidence to support the detail of the proposals is weak and not specific enough Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:39:52.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
