The 35-year-old star is now enjoying the motherhood to the fullest. The 'Jab We Met' star recently talked about how her life has changed after giving birth to son Taimur. \nAccording to a DNA report, originally attributed to a recent ABP news interview, Bebo said, \"There are a lot of responsibilities on you once you become a mother. You feel that your heart is not beating inside you but outside your body and that is the biggest responsibility. Both me and Saif always wanted this. We used to talk about all these things. Both of us see ourselves in Taimur and this is the most special thing.\" \nHer honesty never fails to win our hearts. \nThe name of Kareena's son was being debated online as Taimur was the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia. He also invaded India in 1398. However, the talking point faded away eventually with time. \nTaimur was born on December 20 this year at the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai.
