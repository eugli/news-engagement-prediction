The series will return for a 22-episode third season. \n“We are extremely proud of Superstore , which is one of the smartest and funniest comedies on television today,” said NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke. “Through the show’s expertly drawn characters, our producers and cast do a remarkable job touching on many issues in which audiences can relate. To its credit, not only does Superstore make us laugh, but it makes us think as well.” \nThe single-camera workplace comedy centers on a group of employees at a Wal-Mart-like retail store in St. Louis. Justin Spitzer ( The Office ) created the series and exec produces with Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad, and Gabe Miller & Jonathan Green. Universal Television produces in association with Spitzer Holding Company and The District. \nSuperstore was a solid performer for NBC in it's first season last winter and became one of just two half-hours at the network to return for the 2016-17 season (the other being The Carmichael Show ). Going into its second season, Superstore also got the benefit of airing a special episode behind the Summer Olympics in August -- an episode which drew 9.7 million viewers. So far this season, the series has averaged a 1.8 demo rating among adults 18-49 in live-plus-seven-day numbers. \nAlthough the series was originally only picked up for a 13-episode season two, NBC ordered a back-nine in September. \nSuperstore is the second comedy at NBC to get an early renewal, joining the Kristen Bell-Ted Danson starrer The Good Place. NBC also recently handed out a two-season renewal to family drama This Is Us last month. While the latter hails from outside studio 20th Century Fox Television, Superstore and The Good Place are both produced in-house -- a sign of the times as networks continue to push for vertical integration. \nNBC still has yet to launch several first-year comedies, including legal satire Trial & Error, Marlon Wayans' Marlon and Great News, from 30 Rock exec producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. In addition to Superstore and The Good Place , NBC also the Will & Grace revival on deck for the 2017-18 season.
