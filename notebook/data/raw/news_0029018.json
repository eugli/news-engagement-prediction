Transformation: He has recently shocked fans by showcasing his jaw-dropping five stone weight loss Together? The radio host and the brunette are reportedly 'getting serious' and were pictured looking cosy at the Beautiful The Carole King Musical Birthday gala in London The insider claimed Tiffany even moved to London from Los Angeles at the end of last year so she could spend more time with Chris. Indeed Chris confirmed that he was dating a mystery woman who didn't live in London, during an interview with the Guardian last February. He divulged that his secret girlfriend wasn't 'in the business' - which fits the profile of Tiffany, who is in artist management. The DJ added firmly at the time: 'I've never really wanted to get married and I've never really wanted to have kids.' Chris was previously rumoured to be dating Love/Hate actress Aoibhinn McGinnity, who he first met after watching her perform in 'Elf The Musical' in Dublin. Rumour has it: Tiffany reportedly works in artist management and is from Beverly Hills, where Chris spent a lot of time during his three-year career break until 2015, according to The Sun Inseparable: Last week the pair were pictured at Jamie Oliver's new Barbecoa restaurant He is said to have made two return trips to the Irish capital to see her since meeting her after the play in 2015. Rumours of a romance between Chris and Aoibhinn, 29, first emerged after the pair exchanged a number of flirty messages about meeting in a Dublin nightclub on Twitter, however, the posts have since been deleted. Chris - who previously dated TV producer Sophie Waite - was last linked to former Spice Girls star Mel C after they starred alongside one another in the arena tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar in 2013. The singer, however, insisted that their relationship was purely platonic. Speaking to Metro, she explained: 'Chris is now one of my closest friends, this show has brought me so much more than I ever anticipated.'

And he has been admirably open about his battle with weight, and his fitness goals. Having built a career on early morning broadcasting, Chris has admitted that a lifestyle like that can play havoc with your health. Dubbing it 'the fat breakfast DJ stage' in the past, Chris has now credited his weight loss with running and ditching junk food. Although he first showcased the fruits of his fitness labours back in 2014, the appearance on Wednesday proved that he has kept up with his new lifestyle - despite being a morning DJ on Radio X.
