That's a long time to be playing Arena Football.\n\"It's been a blast. Now, I look forward to my life. I knew I was always going to get into coaching. I'm totally blessed I get to stay here in Arizona with a great organization, a great coach. I'm really fortunate to be here.\"\nRELATED: Rattlers QB Thomas hits ground running \nThis is a new world for Davila and the Rattlers, breaking off from the 30-year-old Arena Football League, where it was all about the offense and passing the ball.\nNow, they're starting work in their first Indoor Football League season.\nThe IFL is made for the dual-threat quarterback, guys who can do as much damage with their legs as they can with their arm.\nDavila, 31, was one of the last remaining pure drop-back passers in professional football.\nNot wanting to unsettle his family in the Valley, Davila decided to stay with the Rattlers as their quarterbacks coach under head coach Kevin Guy.\nDavila built one of the greatest resumes in AFL history. He ranks among the top 10 for career passing yards (32,612), career touchdown passes (766) and career completion percentage (67.4).\nAnd he did that in only seven AFL seasons, all with the Rattlers. His first two seasons were spent with the Spokane Shock in af2.\n\"All of the knowledge that I've gained, I'm going to pass to them (three quarterbacks in camp),\" Davila said. \"It's their time now to shine. It's time for them to lead this organization.\"\nGuy said Davila has embraced his new role. The playbook has changed.\nThere are more advantages for the defense in the IFL. But the offense also can do more things, such as send two players in motion before the ball is snapped.\n\"Everybody is in the same boat, but he's doing a great job,\" Guy said. \"He's going to continue to do a good job.\"\nDavila said he hasn't lost that itch to play.\n\"I think you're always going to have that itch, right?\" he said. \"When you're a competitor and a quarterback like I was, and I was fortunate to play for a great team, that's never going to go away.\n\"I understand that I've had a nice nine-year run. Now, it's my time for me to think about my family, my kids, be a father.\"\nDavila would have had opportunities to play in the AFL, even with the league reduced to just five teams, including expansion Washington and Baltimore.\nBut all of the teams are in the east, and Davila is settled in the Valley with his wife taking on a new job.\n\"She's stable, and she's been waiting to do that,\" Davila said. \"It's not fair to her if I pack up and leave her with three kids and a dog.\"\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Arizona Rattlers season - 2017   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
