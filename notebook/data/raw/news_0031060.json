(Picture: Getty) \nPlease brace yourself for a truly life-ruining bit of information: your dog knows you’re a terrible person . And they’re totally judging you for it. \nA new study published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews explains that dogs are entirely capable of knowing when a human is being a bit of a dick to another human. \nThe study also found that dogs use this information to influence how they interact with you. \nSo your dog can see when you’re not being very nice to other people, and that impacts how they view you. Sorry. \nResearchers asked dog owners to act out a scenario while their dogs watched. Jemima is judging you silently. (Picture: Getty) \nEach dog owner pretended to try and open a container, fail, and then ask two researchers to help out. \nEach time, one researcher stood passively, while the other either helped the dog owner to open the container, or flat out refused to do so. Like a total dick. \nAfter acting out the scenario, both researchers offered the dog a treat. \nIn the first scenario, in which one of the researchers helped while the other stood passively, dogs were just as likely to take a treat from either of the researchers. So they didn’t prefer the more helpful one. Paul thinks you’re a terrible human being and does not approve. (Picture: Getty) \nBut in the second situation, in which one of the researchers actively refused to help to open the container, the dogs were significantly more likely to ignore their offer of a treat and go straight to the researcher who had been passive. \nWhich means that they didn’t like or trust the researcher who’d been a bit of a dick. \nWhich means that dogs are capable of judging humans’ not very nice behaviour – and they’ll reject them if it’s clear that they’re terrible people. \nSo in short: if you’re being horrible, your dog knows about it. They’re judging you on it. And if you want your dog to like you, you’d better shape up.
