The Phoenix City Council on Feb. 15 will address a petition that asks for Phoenix to become a sanctuary city. (Photo: The Republic)\nIn the wake of the executive order from President Donald Trump cracking down on local municipalities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement , Phoenix will soon have to answer community calls about whether to declare itself a \"sanctuary city.\"\nThe City Council on Feb. 15 will address a citizen petition that asks for the designation, and that calls for the Phoenix Police Department to stop following an operations order requiring officers to participate in federal immigration enforcement.\n\"Sanctuary city\" describes a community that has policies that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.\nRELATED: Trump can punish 'sanctuary cities' that protect undocumented immigrants\nUnder the city's charter, Phoenix has 15 days to act on the petition presented Wednesday by resident Rick Robinson in response to Trump's Jan. 25 executive order. City legal staff said \"action\" includes a range of options, from a vote by the City Council to a staff report.\n\"Since this request was just made, staff will need time to review the request and place it on the agenda,\" according a statement from the city.\nGroups seek clarification Various community groups have in the past week called on city leaders to clarify or change Phoenix's enforcement position. Mayor Greg Stanton said in a statement last week that Phoenix will \"fight the federal governmentâ€™s attempt to turn the Phoenix Police Department into a mass deportation force.\"\nBut without a vote, the comments mean \"absolutely nothing,\" Councilman Sal DiCiccio said in a statement. DiCiccio opposes sanctuary city designation for Phoenix.\nMORE: Read the petition here\nPhoenix police contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security regarding immigration violations during some stops and investigations, according to agency policy. Officers may transport people to the federal department under outlined conditions.\nCivil and immigrants-rights groups such as Puente Human Rights Movement have since told Stanton through petitions and rallies to act on his words. Demands include ending existing cooperation by city police on federal immigration enforcement and opening municipal buildings as sanctuaries to immigrants and other groups.\nPLEA official slams mayor Ken Crane, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, responded harshly to Stanton with a letter saying his statements on border security and immigration enforcement \"rise to the level of fear mongering and ethnic bias.\"\n\"Our men and women in law enforcement deserve more from a mayor than someone who would trade the safety of our community partners, our PLEA members and our police personnel for political pandering,\" he wrote.\nRobinson said he presented the petition as an individual to get the city \"off the fence\" regarding Trump's executive order. He said the petition gives the city a resident-driven opportunity to make a decision and determine Phoenix's course of action.\n\"That's the only way the police department will know how to pursue their duties,\" said Robinson, who has served on various city committees. He said he was waiting for the council to make a choice before revealing his personal position.", "external_links": ["https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//azplea.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Letter-to-Stanton-re-executive-orders-1.pdf&embedded=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/636215830027128213-Phoenix-City-Hallx.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2017/02/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/636215830027128213-Phoenix-City-Hallx.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/66df1623c0753c4be0c526255f68b1c4b5a3e2a3/c=0-0-2448-3264&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2017/02/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/636215830027128213-Phoenix-City-Hallx.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-02T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:07:41.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
