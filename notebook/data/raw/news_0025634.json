He stepped away to the restroom so I sat in the seat until he got back. 'When he got back I asked if he wanted to have his seat back and he said, \"No. I'm about to go anyway.\" But before I leave I do need my jacket. ' At that point, she claimed to hear an older man telling the taxi driver: 'You never give up your seat for a n .' For good measure, he then allegedly added: 'You should have made her get her fat n a** up.' Ms Johnson, who works at Answer Quick Telecommunications, LLC, wrote on Facebook: 'I've heard stories about people spewing out hatred but never been the person being spewed upon. I felt so low, embarrassed, unwanted, out of place... all in a place I've visited many times before.' She only learned after the event the man involved was Judge Erwin. Kaneitra Johnson (pictured) said she felt 'so low, embarrassed, unwanted and out of place' The East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office was called in following the argument. The deputies spoke with other people at the restaurant who said they did not hear the argument and were unable to confirm whether Erwin really did use racial slur at Johnson, the sheriff's spokesman Casey Rayborn Hicks said. 'There was a disagreement between patrons, but no arrests or criminal charges or anything,' Hicks said. However Andy McKay, manager at Sammy's Grill, has said the judge is now barred from the establishment. He told The Root : 'I wasn't there that night, so I can't comment on the details, but I know police were called. 'I can also tell you that the owner Sammy Nagem has made it clear that Judge Erwin is no longer welcome here. 'We will refuse his business.' The incident took place at Sammy's Grill (pictured) in Baton Rouge on February 3 Mike McClanahan, president of the Baton Rouge chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Rogue Collection: 'The Baton Rouge Branch of the NAACP take these allegations very serious. We expect our judicial system to be fair and impartial. 'This type of behavior by one so entrusted is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. 'We are calling upon the Chief Judge of the 19th JDC and the State Judicial Commission to launch a full, fair and complete investigation. If these allegations are held to be true, we are demanding that Judge Erwin be removed from the bench and a close scrutiny of all his cases involving people of color be had where his sole discretion was at hand. In the absence of justice, there shall be no peace.' According to the website for Louisiana's 19th District, Erwin was an assistant city prosecutor in Baton Rouge City Court from 1979 to 1981. He then served as an assistant district attorney with the East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney's Office from 1981 to 1990 before his election to the 19th Judicial District Court in 1991. In 2014, he was re-elected to a fifth six-year term. MailOnline had calls unanswered when they contacted Judge Erwin's office.
