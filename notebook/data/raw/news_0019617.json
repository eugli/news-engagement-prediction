So they all needed to come back. \n\n\"Demonetisation sends a very, very strong signal that the day when the central government was complacent was over, that if you are going to misbehave we are going to see to it that you pay for it,\" he added. \n\nThe demonestisation is being followed up by a number of other things like restrictions on contributing funds for elections, and \"the digitsation of the transactions, big time,\" Panagariya said. \"So all in all it was a necessary step in the process.\" \n\nHe also praised the RBI for the \"admirable role\" it paid in keeping the rupee stable in November through two international developments - Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as the US President - that made an adverse impact on most developing country economies.
