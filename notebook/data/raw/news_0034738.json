For what it’s worth, Baseball Prospectus has Sano with 201 strikeouts and Fangraphs 196. Sano already is the only player in Twins history with 150+ whiffs in a season with 178 in 2016. \n\nBP: 136 games, 243/332/443, 22 HR \nFangraphs: 133 games, 247/332/441, 24 HR \nComment: Rumors have it that the Twins are looking for a veteran player to help fill the designated hitter role. Both Baseball Prospectus and Fangraphs seem to feel that Vargas will do just fine, at least in terms of power. \n\nAnd now for the pitchers. Statistics included below are, in order: ERA, WHIP, walks per nine innings and strikeouts per nine innings. \n\nBP: 4.23, 1.41, 3.6, 7.7 \nFangraphs: 4.36, 1.33, 3.4, 8.4 \nComment: Berrios’ rookie campaign did not go well, to put it lightly, so the projections above are actually a vast improvement in every category from what he did with the Twins in 2016. However, still a bit away from what Berrios did in Triple-A the past two seasons (2.62 ERA and 0.965 WHIP in 12 starts in 2015 and 2.51 and 0.988 in 17 starts in ’16). Berrios will turn 23 in May, so patience. \n\nBP: 3.92, 1.32, 2.6, 7.1 \nFangraphs: 4.25, 1.31, 2.5, 7.0 \nComment: Both sites see a return to his 2015 form, when he made 10 starts for the Twins and had a 3.10 ERA and 1.31 WHIP, rather than his disastrous 2016 (6.43, 1.50). \n\nBP: 4.19, 1.40, 3.3, 7.1 \nFangraphs: 4.48, 1.41, 3.1, 6.1 \nComment: Like Duffey, Gibson took a step back in 2016. For what it’s worth, Gibson’s career WHIP is 1.41, but he’s had extremes on both sides in his four years: 1.75, 1.31, 1.29 and 1.56. Both sites playing it safe here. \n\nBP: 4.43, 1.35, 1.8, 6.9 \nFangraphs: 4.77, 1.28, 1.7, 4.7 \nComment: Before last year’s injury-marred season, Hughes posted ERA of 3.52 and 4.40 and WHIPs of 1.13 and 1.29 in his first two campaigns with the Twins. \n\nBP: 4.01, 1.27, 2.3, 8.7 \nFangraphs: 3.82, 1.21, 3.7, 8.6 \nComment: How to project someone coming off an injury which basically cost him all of 2016? Both sites are taking a conservative approach. As Minnesota’s closer from 2013-15, Perkins had a 3.08 ERA and 1.10 WHIP with 1.8 BB/9 and 9.8 K/9. Can he get back to that form? Baseball Prospectus and Fangraphs don’t see it quite yet, at least not in 2017. \n\nBP: 4.20, 1.30, 3.0, 8.0 \nFangraphs: 4.47, 1.32, 2.8, 7.4 \nComment: Interesting projections here as in the last four years Santana has posted ERAs of 3.24, 3.95, 4.00 and 3.38. He has had a WHIP of 1.30 or higher just twice since 2010 (1.32 in ’10 and 1.31 in 2014). \n\nBP: 4.98, 1.45, 3.9, 7.9 \nFangraphs: 4.95, 1.41, 3.8, 7.3 \nComment: Both sites clearly see Santiago trending downward. While he struggled in his 11 starts (5.58 ERA, 1.42 WHIP) last year in Minnesota after being acquired from the Angels, Santiago’s combined 4.70 ERA between the two teams was the highest of his six-year career. His highest WHIP was 1.40 in 2013 with the White Sox. Santiago also has struck out 8.0 batters per nine innings over his career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:23:12.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
