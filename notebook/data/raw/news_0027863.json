Health insurers have struggled to attract enough healthy people to their risk pools to balance the claims they incur from people with expensive medical conditions.\nHumana and Aetna said earlier Tuesday that they were calling off Aetna's roughly $34 billion acquisition of Humana. That deal already had been rejected by a federal judge who was worried about its impact on competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:39:01.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
