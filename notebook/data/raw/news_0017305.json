Source: Thibault Camus/AP In a Facebook post last week, Sandberg called the order \"a policy that could have terrible consequences for women and families around the world.\"\n\"Women’s rights are human rights — and there is no more basic right than health care,\" she added. \"Women around the world deserve our support.\"\nIt's worth noting that only a small fraction of Planned Parenthood's work involves abortions (which federal funds do not support). The vast majority of the non-profit organization's services involve providing basic reproductive health care, such as various forms of cancer screening.\nSandberg joins hundreds of thousands of recent donors to Planned Parenthood Donations to the organization have spiked since the presidential election. In the six weeks after Trump was voted into office, Planned Parenthood received donations at a rate 40 times higher than usual, from some 300,000 people. Other high-profile donors include Amy Schumer , Katy Perry and Gloria Steinem.\nSheryl Sandberg (left) speaks to then Vice President-elect Mike Pence (center) and President-elect Donald Trump during a meeting of technology executives at Trump Tower in December 2016.

Hope is the fuel for social change. When we don’t have hope, we give up on ourselves.\"\n\"This is a particularly challenging time,\" she added. \"But no matter how challenging it looks, history is on our side.\"\nSign visit ", "external_links": ["http://www.recode.net/2017/2/1/14472130/facebook-sheryl-sandberg-kara-swisher-trump-planned-parenthood", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjL3cme4-_RAhWKsFQKHRVqDl0QFggzMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plannedparenthoodaction.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNEkKFB8etul-steSFEhaXxt6YHtuQ&sig2=lZCFdyRgl0fnykHhi8VFbQ&bvm=bv.146073913,d.eWE", "http://ap.org/", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000112760216068703/xslF345X03/form4.xml", "http://www.recode.net/2016/11/30/13797136/sheryl-sandberg-donation-100-million-facebook-stock-option-b", "http://bit.ly/2iuN4TL", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/25/progressive-donations-us-election-planned-parenthood-aclu", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/03/04/10-things-sheryl-sandberg-gets-exactly-right-in-lean-in/#279f88f0466f", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/sheryl-sandberg-planned-parenthood/", "https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10158056267730177", "http://gettyimages.com/", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiN2cfO5-_RAhULwmMKHTfbA-8QqUMIJDAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2017%2F02%2F01%2Fsheryl-sandberg-planned-parenthood%2F&usg=AFQjCNH34LijIPh3I1c4G7TFu5l5pNX94Q&sig2=Pzy9xD0nJ_Yd_hQYz1pWdA"], "published": "2017-02-02T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:44:33.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
