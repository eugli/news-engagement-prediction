Taking to the cobblestone streets, Rocky instead indulged in an extravagant shopping spree before hitting tomorrow’s Gucci front row, in the process patenting the perfect tourist ensemble. Tossing a Guess? jean jacket over his shoulders and slipping into a pair of broken-in jeans emblazoned with scribbles, Rocky made the denim tuxedo his own with a slightly rumpled vintage tee and a black and white long-sleeved striped tee underneath. While somewhat nondescript, the deft layering and washed-out color palette was a nod to a high-minded normcore aesthetic. The effect ran through to his accessories, with Rocky haphazardly lacing into a pair of Nike high-tops and baring just a single chain. While certainly a stylish look to pass the time in, the ’90s-inspired ensemble will most likely shy in comparison to the fantastical Gucci wares he’ll be sporting for tomorrow’s show. Something of the “voice” of the collection—the rapper is featured on the accompanying soundtrack-cum-Fall-2017-invite that was sent out to Gucci show guests—Rocky no doubt will be a man about town this week.
