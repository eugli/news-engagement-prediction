But the conference went on for more than an hour in a performance CNN's Jake Tapper called \"an airing of grievances\" and \"unhinged.\" \nAside from Puzder, Trump had another senior staffing issue he needed to address. Earlier this week, Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned after reportedly misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russian officials before Trump was inaugurated. \nMeyers found Trump's statements around the controversy contradictory. The president said Flynn had done nothing wrong and that he didn't order Flynn to speak with Russian officials, but \"would've directed him\" to do so had Flynn not done it. \n\"He did something that I told him to do, so he had to go,\" Meyers impersonated Trump. \"Clean out your desk, buddy. Why are you cleaning out your desk?\" \nAmong the many headline-driving moments during the Trump conference was his reaction to a reporter asking him if he would take a meeting with black and Latino Congress members. He asked the black reporter if she would like to set up the meeting herself and then asked, \"Are they friends of yours?\" \nMeyers described Trump's response as \"pretty racist.\" \n\"It's racist to assume all black people know each other. You donâ€™t know all orange people. 'Hey Donald, can you set up a meeting with Snooki and the Lorax?'\" \nWatch Meyers' \"A Closer Look\" segment on Trump's press conference below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:45:03.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
