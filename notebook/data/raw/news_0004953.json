Oil is washed ashore on the beaches, including the Marina and Elliots, after the spill on Sunday last following the collission of two cargo ships. 11. 00 a.m. \nCoast Guard officials say that most of the sludge has to be removed only manually. Rajan Bargotra, Coast Guard Commander, says 34,000 square metres of the sea affected in total. Oil spill in 5 different places in Chennai. 10.50 a.m. \nAn Application that was filed at the National Green Tribunal on the oil spill will be heard on February 20, 2017. Feb 3, 2017 - 10.30 a.m. \nThick patch of oil can still be seen some 4 miles off the shore somewhere near Ennore. 34 kms of Chennai's coastline has been affected, reports Udhav Naig Coast Guard ship spraying TC3 chemical which will apparently solidify the oil and let it settle down at the bottom of sea. | Photo Credit: Udhav Naig \n4.55 p.m. Personnel belonging to the Coast Guard and Chennai Corporation remove oil deposits on a shore near Kamarajar Port in Ennore on Thursday. | Photo Credit: G. Sribharath 3.52 p.m. Work on to clear oil, says official \nTiruvallur District Collector E Sundaravalli says, “Our team of officials are here and they are speeding up the work. It is assessed that around 20 tonnes of oil spill continues to be there, floating and we are working to clear it soon.” \nThe authorities have said that besides the local officials, volunteers and fishermen are pitching in to clear the oil spill in and around the Ennore shoreline. 3.12 p.m. \n\nA source in the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) said booms were laid at the Ernavur site to prevent the oil from spreading. At least 1,000 volunteers were removing the sludge. Due to wave action and the southern current, the spill spread some 34 km till Vettuvankeni in the south, making patterns on the sand. \nSources in the oil industry said that 40 tonnes of oil sludge removed from the Ramakrishna Nagar beach near the Ernavur junction would be sent to the hazardous waste processing facility in Gummidipoondi. “For now, it is being sent to the KPL to keep it in storage. Usually, such oil is sent to the refinery but in this case, it cannot since it has saline content,” a source said. \nRead more 3.00 p.m. Early on Saturday, two cargo ships collided at the Kamarajar Port at Ennore, Chennai. MT Maple was leaving the port after offloading an LPG consignment. MT Dawn Kanchipuram (pictured here) was entering with a full load of petrol and lubricants. The collision proved disastrous, as oil from the cargo ships spilled into the sea. “The mishap resulted in a sheen around the vessel. Sheen is a thin layer of oil floating on the water that is caused by shipping operations. It looks like clean white oil. We have deployed oil containment boom,” an official from Kamarajar Port said. Several dead turtles and hatchlings coated with the black oil were washed ashore and discovered among the boulders. By Saturday afternoon, the spread of oil was seen on a 400-metre long stretch, 40 metres wide, near the Ernavur junction. On Monday morning, beach walkers found oil on the sands on the Marina beach, near INS Adyar, at Nochikuppam and at Pattinapakkam. The floating oil along the shore of north Chennai came as a shock to the fishing villages, since the Port authorities had said on Saturday that there was only a thin sheen from the ships and it would disappear soon. \n2.50 p.m. 'Harmful to the skin' \nAn expert on oil spills said people should not be allowed on beaches that had been polluted as it was very harmful to the skin and also to inhale the benzene found in such fuels. “The only way to clean the beaches is to remove the portions that have oil and let the sea replenish it because this is very heavy oil and difficult to clean,” he said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:42:00.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
