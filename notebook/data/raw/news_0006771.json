Now, 17 years later, we look at how the bilingual program has fared, and what future lies ahead. \nThe Methodist missionaries came to Yirrkala in 1935 intending to create a buffer zone between Yolngu and Balanda, to stop the tribal warfare and to bring the good news of Christianity … Some early missionaries prevented our people from performing Yolngu ceremonies on Sundays and were responsible for the loss of some ceremonies. They also banned the use of our languages in the mission school.— Dr Marika, reconciliation advocate, 1998 Wentworth Lecture. \nWhen Yirrkala teacher Banbapuy Whitehead recently gave a conference workshop on maths education, she gave the instructions in Yolngu Matha — a language from north-east Arnhem Land. \nThe participants didn't speak Yolngu Matha so some felt confused and stupid and wanted to leave the session. \nMs Whitehead wanted to make a point about how hard it is for children who grow up speaking an Aboriginal language to have their first experience of school in English. \n\"Imagine you are a Yolngu child in the classroom … What do you expect the child to do?\" Photo: Students at Yirrkala School explore kinship relationships using string (Supplied: Yirrkala School) \nThere was a time that children in Aboriginal communities like Yirrkala were prohibited from practicing their own language and customs. But along with the fight for land rights, came the Indigenous struggle to reclaim other parts of their culture. \nOver 40 years ago, the Yolngu community at Yirrkala was on the vanguard of a move to \"Aboriginalise\" schools. They adopted a bilingual program that used Yolngu culture to teach children to become literate in their own language while learning English and Western culture. \nAccording to late Yolngu leader Dr Marika it was all about strengthening Yolngu culture. \nAmong other things, the local community at Yirrkala worked with teachers and academics to develop a new maths curriculum. \nThe then school principal was the late Dr Yunupingu, who studied education at Deakin University but is probably best known as the lead singer of rock band Yothu Yindi. At the time, he told Quantum reporter Megan James: \n\"We're trying to research and study and make kids happy in learning in their own traditions, their own knowledge structure and then move towards the western number system.\" Using kinship patterns to help teach maths Photo: Children involved in an activity that teaches them base 10 counting (Supplied: Yirrkala School) \nAmong other things, the Yirrkala program took advantage of the children's informal understanding of kinship relationships in Yolngu culture. \nKinship names are repeated in a particular pattern through the generations. Then, as now, the children learn to link these repeated patterns of relationship in kinship to repeated patterns of numbers in maths. \nUsing this culturally-relevant introduction to the concept of \"recursion\", they learn how to count in base 10. The children bundle straws, which represent numbers, into bundles of tens and then using the set of 10 as a base, they repeat the pattern, bundling the 10s into 100s and then 1000s. \nAs explained by Quantum, they learn to see numbers as something that can be used over and over again in the same way as kinship names are. And when they understand this connection, the concept of numbers becomes easier. \nThe bilingual maths program does much more than this, including relating Aboriginal understanding of connection with place, to help teach concepts such location and area. How Yirrkala has fared \nToday, the Northern Territory is the only jurisdiction in Australia where students are performing worse in maths and science than they did 20 years ago . \nWhile some have argued that Aboriginal languages are redundant and don't help people to succeed in a modern society, others disagree. They say that for children to do well in English and maths, they must have a strong foundation in their first language. \nAnd there is some evidence that Aboriginal children who go through bilingual education programs do better than those that learn only in English from the start. \nFor example, according to former Yirrkala teacher Kathy McMahon, who has nearly finished a PhD on bilingual maths education, a multilevel assessment carried out just before NAPLAN's introduction in 2008 showed positive results. \n\"The kids at Yirrkala at year 5 and year 7 were almost on a par with urban kids who speak only English … That program was clearly working,\" said Ms McMahon. \nThese days, the bilingual program includes sending secondary students out on country with teachers, elders and rangers to learn maths and other subjects 'on country'. They map and measure everything from rubbish to turtle numbers, said Yirrkala's current school co-principal Merrkiwawuy Ganambarr. \n\"We want our children to be strong Yolngu people, but we want our children also to be strong in the western world.\" \nMs Ganambarr and others report that graduates of Yirrkala's bilingual program are doing well — working as rangers, health professionals, musicians, and in areas such as multimedia and small business. Some students have even become teachers themselves, working in their homelands.

NAPLAN 'unfair' to Aboriginal children Photo: Teachers at Yirrkala school teach literacy in Yolngu matha language as children are introduced to English (Supplied: Yirrkala school) \nThere have been other challenges for schools like Yirrkala, including the rules for NAPLAN. \n\"All kids are treated as if they are English speakers,\" said Ms McMahon. \"But actually 40 per cent of NT kids are not English speakers — they're becoming English speakers.\" \nShe said teachers are not permitted to translate questions into the child's first language, and this is a barrier to testing their true knowledge of a subject like maths. \n\"They often can't understand the English questions in the maths papers … [but] allowing kids to use another language to understand the question is actually called cheating now.\" \nMs McMahon said NAPLAN is \"not a fair test\", especially for children in Year 3, but sometimes also for older students who are trying to read and understand a particularly complex problem for solving. \nMr Ryan agreed. \n\"In our view NAPLAN is not a useful way of ascertaining where remote and Indigenous students are up to in their learning because it's a standardised test and it doesn't take into account their circumstances.\" \nMr Ryan was initially sceptical about the value of bilingual education, but now argues there is a wealth of evidence to back it. \n\"We systematically deny the language of Indigenous Australians … I believe we set children up to feel like failures.\" \nTo support his argument, Mr Ryan cites a major report on Aboriginal child welfare: \n\"Schools teaching and instructing in English alone … develops a failure syndrome for many children as they return home at the end of the school day often unable to remember what was taught that day — which causes them to become depressed.\" \n— 2007 Little Children Are Sacred report, p. 147 Training the trainers Photo: Teachers trained in the local language and culture are most likely to come from the local community. (Supplied: Yirrkala School) \nAnother challenge for bilingual programs like that at Yirrkala is teacher training. \nTeachers trained in the local language and culture are most likely to come from the local community, and once they were supported by a Remote Area Teacher Education program where the bulk of training was in the community itself. \n\"Now most of the teacher education is online,\" said Ms McMahon, adding this is a barrier for many. \"Most of our people don't have computers at home.\" \nPeople could leave their community to study teaching elsewhere but this is not something many want to do. \n\"It's hard leaving the community,\" said Ms Whitehead, one of the current maths teachers at Yirrkala. \n\"The elders say when you go away, you grow away.\" \nChampions of bilingual schools hope the new Territory Government's move towards \"community-led schools\" will support tailored programs like those at Yirrkala. \n\"That sounds fantastic — if the community gets to lead where the school goes — which has always been the case at Yirrkala,\" said Ms McMahon. \nBut without additional funding, Mr Ryan said the survival of such programs would ultimately depend on the \"heroic efforts of individuals\". \nUnless a teacher is fluent in two languages and has English as a second language experience as well, bilingual education requires team teaching and this is costly. As does the tailored teaching materials they use. \nMr Ryan said this needs to be seen as an investment, weighed against the huge social and economic cost to society that comes from Aboriginal people's social and economic disadvantage. \n\"We have just spent more than $1 billion on building a new jail in Darwin in recent years.\" Under the shade of the banyan tree Photo: Banbapuy Whitehead describes her language as being like the shade of a tree (Supplied: Anna Salleh) \nThe desire for bilingual teaching runs deeper than school performance for Yirrkala teacher Ms Whitehead. For her, language is culture and identity. \n\"It's my pride,\" she said. \"I need to do it to maintain it for my future generations because they need to have that pride in the future.\" \nMs Whitehead likened her language to an ancient banyan tree. \n\"It gives us shade, comfort and the foundation of where we stand,\" she said. \n\"If I know what my language is, I know who I am, then I can see the others clearly … Without language I cannot communicate, I cannot talk, I cannot tell you a story. I can't think. I can't cry.\" You may also like ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:13:12.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
