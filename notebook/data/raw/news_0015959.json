Riddle me this: How was there flowing water on ancient Mars with too little CO2 in the air to help keep it unfrozen? https://t.co/o76DMqUWxy pic.twitter.com/pNH1SdViG0 — NASA (@NASA) February 6, 2017 \n\"It would be really hard to get liquid water even if there were a 100-times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than what the mineral evidence in the rock tells us,\" Thomas Bristow from NASA said in a statement . \nThe rocks studied are believed to be 3.5 billion years old and hail from the planet’s Gale Crater.
