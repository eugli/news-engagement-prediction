And a larger asteroid, measuring 4,200ft in diameter, is the third most likely to hit - but only has a one in 8,333 chance of striking in the year 2880. Meanwhile, the star Gliese 710 - which will pass 77 light days from the Earth in 1.35million years - is set to send asteroids from the outer reaches of the solar system towards Earth, having a potentially catastrophic impact. Of all the asteroids that have been discovered, more than 1,650 are considered to be 'potentially hazardous' by NASA - with only 157 larger than a kilometre in diameter Titanic asteroids over 6.2 miles in size are capable of wiping out life on earth - but the last one known to hit was 66 million years ago. The asteroid destroyed 75 per cent of life on earth, including the dinosaurs. The Earth is hit on average once a year by asteroids measuring around 13ft in diameter - the size of an elephant. Titanic asteroids over 10km in size are capable of wiping out life on earth - but the last one known to hit was 66 million years ago Meanwhile, asteroids around 25ft in diameter - which can cause an explosion the size of Hiroshima - strike the Earth once every four years on average. However, it is rare for these to be witnessed by humans, as 70 per cent of the Earth is water - and many of these objects explode in the upper atmosphere. Asteroids about 66ft in diameter - or the size of a six-storey building - hit the earth on average twice every 100 years.

These techniques include Ion Beam Deflection, Enhanced Gravity Tractor, and kinetic impactors. In Ion Beam Deflection, the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area. A thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid. The Ion Beam Deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid, and it could be demonstrated on either mission option. In the Enhanced Gravity Tractor approach, the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid's surface as in mission Option B. The spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid's velocity vector. The mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid. By flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid's trajectory. A kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle, and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact. They can cause an explosion of 500 kilotons, or about 30 times the size of Hiroshima. The last time an asteroid of this size hit was in 2013, over Chelyabinsk, Russia. It exploded 18 miles above the ground and damaged over 7,000 buildings across six cities.
