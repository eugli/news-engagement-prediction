She has said it before. ] \nConway was the person who ushered the phrase “alternative facts” into the popular American lexicon. It was January on “Meet the Press” and host Chuck Todd was pressing her on why the White House press secretary made easily-disproved claims about the size of Trump's inauguration crowd.

(Olivier Douliery/EPA) \nConway told Todd that Sean Spicer had “alternative facts.” \n“Alternative facts are not facts,” Todd responded. “They're falsehoods.” \nThe statement launched a slew of memes , and Conway's credibility took a hit. Tim O'Brien (@obrienillustration Instagram) has created perhaps the ultimate visual on #AlternativeFacts . https://t.co/S8QhYvh79y pic.twitter.com/MMD7yQ0dZ9 \n— Andy Revkin (@Revkin) January 23, 2017 \nIt got worse a few days later, when Conway used “the Bowling Green massacre” in justifying Trump's travel ban, saying most people don't know about it “because it didn't get covered.” \nConway said she'd misspoken, but The Washington Post's Aaron Blake reported that she had referred to it several times before . On @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\" as reported here: \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017 \nAs The Post's Callum Borchers reported , the “Morning Joe” hosts have characterized Conway as “an attention seeker who texts TV producers in a constant effort to get on air, so she can speak for a White House where she actually isn't in the know.” \nBorchers wrote that the morning show hosts described Conway as pretty much like her caricature on “Saturday Night Live.” \nScarborough also used his time on the show to talk about Conway's boss, the president, who they think is an avid watcher “Based on his Twitter feed. He's watched the show for years, kind of goes in waves. … We'll always look in the camera and say Donald, we know you're not watching the show, but how you doing?” \nColbert pushed back, jesting about calling Trump “Donald” instead of “Mr. President.” \n“The way he's acted over the past month has made it even harder to call him Mr. President,” Scarborough replied. \nSince Trump took office, Colbert's show has gotten more political, a topical shift toward more timely material orchestrated by Chris Licht's takeover backstage, according to The Chicago Tribune . \nIn early February, Colbert's “The Late Show” beat out Jimmy Fallon's “The Tonight Show” for the first time since Colbert replaced David Letterman in Sept. 2015. \nAnd Colbert has kept pouring it on. Last week, he called Trump adviser Stephen Miller a liar . He's made fun of Trump calling the media “ the enemy of the American people ,” and he's channeled Keyser Söze to blast Trump’s Russia ties . \nRead more: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:53:38.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
