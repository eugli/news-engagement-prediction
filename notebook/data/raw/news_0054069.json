JOHN DAVIDSON/PHOTOSPORT \nTom Latham's poor run with the bat in one-day internationals continued in Christchurch. \nTaylor and James Neesham, who impressed with 71 from 57 balls, achieved an unbeaten fifth wicket stand of 123 runs, to get New Zealand through to 289-4. \nREAD MORE: \nNew Zealand finished slightly short of where they would have wanted to be, given they were 155-2 after 30 overs with Taylor and Kane Williamson looking strong at the crease. JOHN DAVIDSON/PHOTOSPORT \nSouth Africa celebrate the wicket of Tom Latham in the second ODI in Christchurch. \nTaylor hit eight fours in his 110-ball innings. He was almost caught by David Miller on the boundary off the penultimate ball, but he chucked the ball back as he clashed with the boundary rope. \nRight-armer Dwaine Pretorius in just his sixth ODI for South Africa, was impressive taking 2-40 from his 10 overs. \nNew Zealand were in danger of falling away once Williamson and Neil Broom were removed within the space of 13 balls, leaving them 166-4 in the 33rd over. \nWilliamson and Taylor consolidated after opener Dean Brownlie went for 32, putting on 104 for the third wicket. \nIn typical fashion, the pair didn't take many risks. They were prepared to work the ball into the gaps and get accustomed to a slower Hagley Oval wicket early on. \nWilliamson brought up his 29th ODI half century, reaching his 50 from 59 balls. \nThe partnership was looking threatening with New Zealand targeting a score well over 300, until legspinner Imran Tahir achieved the key wicket. \nTahir tossed the ball up to Williamson, who mistimed his shot straight to Andile Phehlukwayo at long on, ending their century-run stand. \nAt 155-2 after 30 overs and Williamson and Taylor at the crease, New Zealand were nicely placed. \nWilliamson went at a crucial time for 69 after New Zealand's best two batsmen had frustrated the South African attack for 18 overs. \nTaylor celebrated his 50 shortly after, becoming the quickest New Zealand ODI batsman to post 6000 runs in 166 innings. \nSouth Africa pulled off a double breakthrough with Broom picking out JP Duminy at point and removed for just two. \nOpener Tom Latham again fell cheaply for two, chipping one to Phehlukwayo at square leg from Wayne Parnell's bowling. \nIt was the fifth straight single digit score in an ODI from the Cantabrian, who has scored just 35 runs from six innings since his career-best 137 against Bangladesh at Hagley on Boxing Day. \nWith Martin Guptill set to return from a hamstring injury for game four in Hamilton and Brownlie's solid displays with the bat in his three ODIs since rejoining the Black Caps, Latham will be a nervous man. \nHe may get one last chance to impress in Saturday's third ODI in Wellington. \nBrownlie was beginning to look comfortable after a cautious start, but was trapped in front by Pretorius. \nReplays suggested the ball was missing and heading down leg, but Williamson at the other end declined to review. \nBrownlie and Williamson had taken the score through to 53 after Latham's early departure. \nThe 32-year-old right hander had taken three boundaries of a Chris Morris over and was starting to look like he was on track to notch his second ODI half century. \nSkipper AB de Villiers sent a brief scare through the South African camp.He received medical attention to his right shoulder in the sixth over after landing awkwardly while trying to effect a run out at the non-strikers end. \nThe brilliant South African batsman shook off the discomfort to remain on the field. \nNew Zealand named an unchanged line-up, sticking with legspinner Ish Sodhi, rather than bringing in an extra pace bowler in Lockie Ferguson or Matt Henry. \nThe Proteas made three changes with hard-hitting left-hander Miller recovering from a finger injury to feature for the first time on the New Zealand tour. \nStar pace bowler Kagiso Rabada was scratched due to a knee niggle, while Farhaan Behardien and chinaman bowler Tabraiz Shamsi dropped out of the playing 11 from Hamilton. \nThe world's No1 ranked ODI team brought in pace bowlers Parnell and Pretorius. \nSouth Africa are on a 12-game ODI winning run. Their last loss came on June 24 last year against the West Indies in Bridgetown. \nIf they can beat the Black Caps in Christchurch, they would achieve the South African ODI record and move to second outright on the all-time list behind the Australian team of 2003. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:01:16.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
