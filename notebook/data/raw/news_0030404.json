While you are busy planning your day with your special someone, here is how your favorite television characters are celebrating it on their shows. \nIshqbaaz \nValentine Week has brought a romantic turn in Star Plus’ popular show Ishqbaaz. Shivaay ( Nakuul Mehta ) is seen wooing Anika (Surbhi Chandna), who has unfortunately lost her memory. He is getting romantic with her in a bid to help her recollect all the moments they shared with each other but Anika is finding it difficult to reciprocate his love as she has no idea about his feelings. She is seen scared and uncomfortable. After bringing cow dung, Shivaay will now throw her in the swimming pool. They will share some intimate moments there. It remains to be seen whether Shivaay will be successful in helping Anika regain her memory or not.

Harman (Vivian Dsena) will get worried not to find her in the house and will call her. She will not take his calls, which will further tense Harman. He will refuse to talk to her when she will return. Soumya will cook food for him and feed him with her own hands to say sorry to him. Harman will forgive her and they both will share some romantic moments. \nA post shared by Rishbala.Haya.Rajbala (@madhubala.shakti.rishbala.haya) on Feb 13, 2017 at 11:33am PST \nDil Bole Oberoi \nIshqbaaz’s extension, Dil Bole Oberoi began on 13th February i.e. one day before the-much-celebrated Valentine’s Day. It’s already known that it’s going to revolve around Shivaay’s brothers – Rudra (Leenesh Mattoo) and Omkara (Kunal Jaisingh). Gauri Sharma (Shrenu Parekh) and Omkara’s love story will be the prime focus of the show. Although the first few episodes will be spent in establishing Gauri’s character, we can still expect some love-dovey moments on Valentine’s Day.

Malaika (Smriti Khanna) will come to the party along with her boyfriend Sameer. They will send some goons to kidnap Tanuja in order to blackmail Rishi for property. But things will go for a toss when they will kidnap Rishi instead of her. Tanuja will somehow get to know where have they kept him and reach there. The goons will captivate her too. Things will turn a little scary for the couple but we can definitely expect to see some mushy moments between the two. A post shared by Colors TV (@colorstv) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:28pm PST \nKumkum Bhagya \nKumkum Bhagya celebrated Valentine Week with elan. Right from Pragya’s (Sriti Jha) stunning transformation to her getting locked inside a cold storage with Abhi ( Shabbir Ahluwalia ), the viewers have been enjoying a lot of mushy moments on the show. And we can expect to see some more as Abhi will try to find who tried to kill Pragya in the upcoming episodes. \nA post shared by Kumkumbhagya (@kumkumbhagyaclips) on Feb 14, 2017 at 12:56am PST \nWe are totally looking forward to watching these episodes.
