Timothy Gardner Feb 2nd 2017 5:56PM \nWASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The battered U.S. coal industry rejoiced after the Senate voted on Thursday to repeal a rule that limited companies from dumping mining waste in streams, saying the move could halt the sector's decline. \nThe Senate, approving a resolution passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday, overturned the Stream Protection Rule as part of a broader move by Republicans to reverse what they see as overregulation by former President Barack Obama's administration on energy development. \nThe demise of the rule had been expected. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress, controlled by Republicans, to undo rules finalized at the end of a previous administration. 25 PHOTOS See Gallery US Coal Mines A Caterpillar Inc. front loader scoops coal from a mound at the Arch Coal Inc.
