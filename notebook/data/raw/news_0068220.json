Brothers Gabe, left, and Michael Sanchez worked at their family's Mexican restaurant as… more Arnold Wells Two brothers from a large Round Rock family have found their career niche competing — and sometimes collaborating — with each other on commercial real estate deals in the retail sector. Michael Sanchez , 34, of Don Quick & Associates Inc. and Gabe Sanchez , 31, of Weitzman never expected to be in the same business let alone have ample opportunity to work together. But that’s how the plot unfolded. Brothers Gabe, left, and Michael Sanchez worked at their family's Mexican restaurant as… more Arnold Wells “We try to do as much business as we can together,” Michael Sanchez said. “Even though we work with competing firms what we do is very complementary.” They both know the restaurant business inside and out. Michael even attended Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. Their parents operated a Round Rock eatery for years. “(My parent’s) restaurant was Michael’s Tacos,” Michael said. “I am the first-born so I had the honor of having it named after me.” When their parents retired, Michael opened his own iteration of Michael’s Tacos in February 2010, but sold it in March 2012 after the death of his mother. After the emotional loss of the family matriarch, Michael took some time off. Younger brother Gabe, meanwhile, had landed with Weitzman commercial real estate brokerage. He’d been an intern at Weitzman as a business student at St. Edward's University. Some of the highly esteemed brokers in the retail real estate sector — such as Adam Zimel and Michele Gary , now with Endeavor Real Estate Group — had mentored him along the way. “I was fortunate enough to take a little knowledge from all those brokers,” Gabe said. The real estate industry seemed to suit him. As a sophomore in college, Gabe purchased a house in Round Rock and secured tenants — a rather gutsy move for a student. After graduation, Gabe felt loyal to Weitzman and signed on full time. “They are big on bringing interns through the process. A lot of us here are products of Weitzman’s internship program,” Gabe said. His first full year in the brokerage business was 2009 — a pretty awful time for commission sales. The mortgage market collapse had decimated the real estate industry and practically the entire economy was on life support. “My parents joked that I made more money waiting tables,” Gabe said. “But everything is kind of cyclical and a lot of people urged me to stick with it.” Gabe’s Hispanic background and ability to speak Spanish bolstered his confidence. He helped a colleague, for instance, handle a Mexican meat market transaction and other deals followed. In time, Michael began looking for a new site to open a new restaurant with assistance from Darren Quick of Don Quick & Associates. That brokerage has a deep imprint on Round Rock. During the process, Michael realized he might be a good fit for the commercial real estate business, as well. After all, he’d obtained his residential real estate license right out of high school, and Gabe was thriving at Weitzman . As Weitzman had embraced Gabe, Don Quick & Associates trained and supported Michael. He, too, is greatly appreciative of his employer — a family-owned business like the one he experienced. Michael’s understanding of the Hispanic market and the ability to speak fluent Spanish also enhanced his career. Four years later the synergy between them has helped numerous clients find just the right spot to land. Their respective companies couldn’t be happier. “Our brokerages love it,” Michael said.
