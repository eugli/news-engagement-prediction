Without them, it’s difficult to know what business arrangements tripped him up. This is the first Trump nominee to withdraw from consideration.\nViola, the son of a truck driver and a homemaker, is a West Point graduate and former Army infantry officer who served in the 101st Airborne Division. Viola’s net worth is estimated at $2.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He founded Virtu Financial in 2008 and took the electronic market-making firm public in 2015. An earlier attempt at an IPO was shelved in 2014 after Michael Lewis’s “Flash Boys” brought the high-frequency trading firm under attack.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

He’s also the owner of the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers, which updated their jerseys last year with a crest inspired by armed forces insignia in a nod to Florida’s military community and Viola’s Army heritage.\nTrump and Viola may have forged a connection last year when the plane used by the Florida Panthers was repurposed to fly Trump’s vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence around the country during the campaign, according to a story in the Miami Herald. Viola has an ownership interest in Eastern Airlines, an air charter company based in Miami, that is linked to the old airline of that same name that went broke in 1991, the newspaper reported.\nAs part of his need to divest of assets that could pose conflict of interest issues, Viola was trying to exchange his stake in Eastern Airlines for a smaller stake in Swift Air, the New York Times reported earlier this week. Swift Air is a charter company with millions of dollars in government subcontracts, the newspaper said, citing people with knowledge of the negotiations who it didn’t name.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fbillionaire-vincent-viola-withdraw-secretary-army-nominee%2FX8Lat9yCjln03UKd8y3RUN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tBillionaire", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Billionaire", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fbillionaire-vincent-viola-withdraw-secretary-army-nominee%2FX8Lat9yCjln03UKd8y3RUN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Billionaire", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fbillionaire-vincent-viola-withdraw-secretary-army-nominee%2FX8Lat9yCjln03UKd8y3RUN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Billionaire", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Fbillionaire-vincent-viola-withdraw-secretary-army-nominee%2FX8Lat9yCjln03UKd8y3RUN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:12:46.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
