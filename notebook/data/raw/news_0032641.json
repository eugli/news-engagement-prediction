Some of the jumpers are knitted by women in far flung towns and brought to the centre for the final fit outs. \nUttar Pradesh experiences scorching summers, but winter temperatures drop to as low as 5-6 degrees Celsius with chilly winds sweeping across open swathes of land. \nREAD MORE: Conservationists using exploding condoms filled with chili powder to save elephants \n“We are doing it for these animals, these elephant s. When humans are feeling so cold in this winter – these are poor animals, they must be feeling very cold so we are making sweaters for them,” said Navarti, a local villager who added finishing touches to a recently-knit jumper. \nNavarti and the other knitters are wives of former Kalandars, bear handlers, many of whom are now unemployed since the practice was outlawed in 1972. \nKamini Chander, a consultant with Wildlife SOS, is spearheading the program to train the village women to knit jumpers, which began earlier this year, she said. \nWATCH: Heartbroken elephant calf in India refuses to part with mother’s body \nEach jumper requires nearly four kilograms of wool (8.8 pounds) to be knitted by nearly 6-7 women over a period of two to three weeks. \nKamini said clothing the elephant s has not been a smooth process, with many of the animals refusing to wear the jumpers. \n“Maya gets very ticklish wearing a sweater, so when we tried putting the sweater on her, she absolutely refused to wear it, she actually tried to throw it off. So then, if she doesn’t like it, obviously we would not force it on her. She loves it so she wears it,” said Kamini, just after putting a a brand-new sweater on Maya the elephant . \nREAD MORE: Elephants kill 5 people in 2 separate attacks in eastern India \nSome of the original jumpers also had sleeves, which were even more difficult to make the animals wear, Kamini said. So far, three jumpers have been completed as “pilots” and they are yet to decide if they will produce more. \nHundreds of elephant s across India are held in captivity to perform touristic as well as religious rituals at forts, palaces and large temples. They are often ill-treated and abused by unschooled mahouts and owners. \nSOS’s elephant conservation and care centre was established in 2010 and currently houses 21 elephant s that have been rescued from illegal captivity, poachers, traffickers, and circuses where they were frequently abused. \nThe centre also holds training workshops to teach mahouts, or elephant trainers, more humane methods to treat elephant s. \nREAD MORE: Animal rights group ranks Edmonton zoo fourth-worst for elephants \n“The traditional method that’s been used in India for a long time to manage elephant s, unfortunately, uses a lot of pain, negative reinforcement and fear and intimidation to make elephant s follow discipline. That is a problem, whereas elephant s are extremely intelligent animals, they are emotional, they are social animals, they live in herds, so when you pluck an elephant out of a herd, it is like kidnapping a child and then you beat the hell out of the elephant , you inflict a lot of cruelty and pain and fear and intimidation to discipline it,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS. \nSOS plans to expand its operations to accommodate nearly 50 elephant s in the future and is looking for patrons to help share some of the costs – adding that it costs nearly 60,000 rupees ($850) for the upkeep of just one elephant at the shelter. \nIndia holds 50 to 60 per cent of all of Asia’s wild elephant population. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:11:24.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
