No one’s physical safety is endangered by political ideas from a speaker on campus, but universities have sort of allowed this stuff to happen, and even in some cases encouraged it.” \nThe protests started peacefully, but as night fell, the crowd swelled to more than 1500 and “more than 100 armed individuals clad in ninja-like uniforms who utilized paramilitary tactics” infiltrated the crowd and began hurling commercial grade fireworks, molotov cocktails, rocks and other objects at police, school spokesman Dan Moguluf told the Associated Press. \nThey toppled the metal barricades and used them to bash windows of the student union and then set fire to a kerosene generator, sparking a blaze that burned for over an hour. \nLater that night, after the crowds dispersed, a small group took the chaos off campus and into the nearby city streets of Berkeley. \n“It was not a proud night for this campus,” Mr Moguluf said. “We are proud of our history and legacy as the home of the free speech movement.” \nOfficials knew there was a potential for violence and went to “extraordinary lengths” to prepare for the event, Mr Moguluf said. School authorities believe the instigators were not Berkeley students. \nSome criticised Berkeley mayor Jesse Arreguin for appearing to condone the violence. “Using speech to silence marginalised communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable,” he tweeted. “Hate speech isn’t welcome in our community.” \nHe later issued a statement condoning the violence for providing “the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want to use to try to discredit the vast majority of peaceful protesters”. \nLawyer and author Mike Cernovich flagged possible legal action against the city. “If you were a victim of violence at the Berkeley riots, DM me,” he tweeted. “We are reaching out to lawyers for a civil rights lawsuit.” Revised statement to reflect updated information. pic.twitter.com/w9iykrWveB — Jesse Arreguin (@JesseArreguin) February 2, 2017 Civil Rights section of FBI has opened an investigation into mayor @JesseArreguin , for inciting riots and ordering to police to stand down. pic.twitter.com/uy5EbgcvSm — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) February 2, 2017 \nWorkers at several banks downtown were replacing broken windows Thursday, repairing damaged cash machines and cleaning graffiti from brick walls. \nAmid the clean-up, a 21-year-old student who supports Mr Trump was attacked on campus. The student, Jack Palkovic, was wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap as he headed to class when a white SUV slammed to a halt, and two students jumped out and pommeled him. Police arrived and arrested both men. \nThe unrest sparked a debate Thursday on the floor of the state Senate, where Republicans bemoaned what they characterised as a campus culture that devalues free speech, the Associated Press reported. \n“Universities should be the most open, the most welcoming harbour of all ideas, left or right,” Republican state Senator Ted Gaines said. “But they have turned into rigid ideological prisons where stepping outside the latest progressive liberal path is considered a thought crime.” \nBut Democrats condemned Mr Trump’s threat to withdraw the funding, saying administrators worked hard to facilitate the speech and only cancelled it once the security became untenable \n“Today, it’s academic freedom,” Democratic state Senator Scott Wiener said. “Tomorrow, Lord knows what it’s going to be, and it has to stop.” \n— with AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:00:37.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
