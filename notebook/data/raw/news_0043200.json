I had never seen him before.” NORTH NEWS Rezzas Abdulla has also been convicted of two other attacks on women \nLayla-Jean, who is now two-years-old, was even forced to undergo a series of tests - and doctors warned she may have to have a BCG infection as she could have contracted TB in the sick attack. \nMs Telford added: “I believe he spat on her purely because we are white, I was a lone female and an easy target.” \nAbdullah already has two convictions for racially-motivated attacks on white woman, after being found guilty of racially aggravated common assault after a trial at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court, which he did not attend. \nSpeaking at Newcastle Crown court, Mr Recorder Darren Preston told Abdullah: “You have got a problem, it seems to me, with white women.” \nAbdulla was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with rehabilitation and mental health treatment requirements. \nHe now receives anti-psychotic treatment in the community but his victim says Abdullah has got off lightly - and claims if she had attacked him, she would likely have got a harsher punishment. NORTH NEWS Rebecca Telford, 25, and her daughter Layla-Jean were shocked by the attack \nShe said: “South Shields is really multicultural, and I have never witnessed anything like this before, between any races. \n“It was horrifying. I am glad he has been brought to justice, but I think he has got off lightly. \n“I am not racist at all but I honestly think if it was the other way round and I had been abusive towards him, then I would have been treated differently.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:05:08.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
