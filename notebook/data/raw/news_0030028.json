The California Department of Water Resources urged residents of Oroville to head north, toward Chico. Residents elsewhere downstream should follow the orders of their local law enforcement, the department said. Officials have set up an evacuation shelter at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico. \nThe auxiliary spillway is separate from the main dam structure. It’s essentially an ungated 1,700-foot-wide notch in the rim of the reservoir, which began overflowing Saturday morning, days after the dam’s concrete-lined main spillway began to crumble. \nHere are some photos of the evacuation, and the main and emergency spillways.
