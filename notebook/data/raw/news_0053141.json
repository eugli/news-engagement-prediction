(Submitted)\n\"Aspects of the hospital environment, such as the quality of bathroom and toilet areas, can be highly influential in determining patients' feelings about their hospital experience,\" the report by the public watchdog states.\n\"Regular and thorough cleaning\" can also prevent patients from picking up infections in hospital, the report says.\nHorizon's ​average among its 11 hospitals was 49.7 per cent for patients who felt their rooms and bathrooms were kept clean, while the average for the nine Vitalité hospitals was 55.8 per cent.\nVitalité officials could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.\nMelanson said Horizon values the information the survey provides.\n\"It helps us to improve how we manage our hospital services,\" she said.\n'I don't really think that it is bad as it is reported.' - Penny Ericson , patient family advisory committee \"Since 2013 we have seen improvements in key areas such as the overall impression of care received, patient safety and language of choice. We are proud of the results in these areas.\"\nPenny Ericson, a retired nurse and nursing professor who raised concerns about hospital cleanliness in 2013, and now volunteers as co-chair of Horizon's patient family advisory committee, contends cleanliness has actually improved over the past three years, despite the latest patient survey results.\n\"I don't really think that it is bad as it is reported,\" she said.\nAlthough Ericson thinks \"there are examples that are appalling,\" she believes the rooms are cleaned to a higher standard than they were before, by \"better educated\" staff.\nIn addition, all Horizon facilities are now following the same protocols, and using the same products and equipment, she said.\nPenny Ericson, volunteer co-chair of Horizon's patient family advisory committee, believes part of the problem is that patients and the public don't alert staff when they find a bathroom or other area of a hospital isn't cleaned properly. (CBC)\nEricson, who spent a significant amount of time in Fredericton's Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital while her husband, Carl, was being treated before his death in 2013, had said in a report to Horizon, the Department of Health and the New Brunswick Nurses Union that she was shocked at the lack of proper cleaning in the hospital's hallways, bathrooms and cafeterias.\nAt the time, she blamed government cuts and a lack of experienced cleaning supervisors.\nBut Ericson believes part of the problem is that bathrooms are often shared by up to four patients.\n\"Many times these bathrooms are small, it's awkward to get walkers and wheelchairs in, accidents happen and many times, if the person is there by themselves, they don't know it, they can't see it, they don't have their glasses on or whatever, so they don't tell anybody,\" she said.\n\"And then the next person who comes in to use it finds that it's not clean and they're unhappy and they don't tell anybody, except their family.\"\nIf a patient or visitor feels a bathroom or anything else in the hospital isn't clean, Ericson urges them to report it to a ward clerk, a nurse manager, or even a security person.\n\"They need to speak up because we can't clean something if we don't know it's dirty,\" she said.\nEricson is also calling for a \"team\" approach among cleaning staff.\n\"If someone does report something, whether it's in their job description or not, if it's possible to clean something … help each other out and make sure these things are addressed quickly and efficiently.\"\n\n\n\nThe survey was sent to 14,504 patients who were discharged after spending at least one night in an acute care hospital between December 2015 and March 2016. The survey was answered by 6,733 patients, or 46 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:19:56.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
