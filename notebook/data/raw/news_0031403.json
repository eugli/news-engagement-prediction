Indians fans and their Twitter handle probably didn’t think a 3-1 joke would drop out of the skies and into their face courtesy of the Sacramento Kings when they woke up. But that’s exactly what they got. \nSo of course they responded. \nAnd the no-heart Kings fired back. \nIf you were the Atlanta Falcons Twitter, you head had to be on a SWIVEL right about now. \nThe Kings also sure they made nice with other NBA teams, so Adam Silver didn’t slap them on the wrist/bottom. \nAnd also burying the Stars for losing \nNow is this all silly and stupid and childish? Yeah, probably. But you know what? I absolutely LOVE this move. The Kings being some savage Twitter handle that loves getting in random teams’ kitchens and chirping them about winning is hilarious. There is no reason in the world to give a shit about the Kings other than if DeMarcus Cousins is getting buckets or going crazy. They have been the dysfunctional dumpster fire of the West Coast while my Knicks hold it down back East. They are basically sister franchises. Which makes it even funnier. \nThe Kings chirping ANYONE about losing is crazy. They are your friend that starts fights regardless of if he can win or not just because he loves fighting. Dare I say they even have a little bit of Tex in them? The Kings are giving out Stone Cold Stunners to teams that have NOTHING to do with them despite having the win/loss record of the Brooklyn Brawler instead of Steve Austin. But it has me caring about the Sacramento Kings in the middle of February. And isn’t that what social media is all about? Spreading your #brand for the price it costs to hire a 20-something mercenary with a working set of Twitter fingers. \nSo keep doing you, Kings Twitter guy. If you can’t roast the fuck out of the Knicks for being such a shitty franchise, at least murder some other Twitter accounts for the love of trolling.
