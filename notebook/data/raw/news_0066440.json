the devastated parents made the decision to have their daughter's organs donated when she was pronounced brain-dead\n'We wanted to give her a different life, she was very social and loved the sea so we sold the house and moved on to the boat.'\nThen the accident happened.\n'We had met friends at the marina and she had seen this big boat coming in and asked if she could watch.\n'It wasn't considered a dangerous operation, it was very routine and there were a lot of people on the dock at the time, so we agreed.\n'We were in our friend's boat less than two hundred metres down the dock when there was a knock on the hull, the person said there had been an accident and asked if we were the parents of a young girl.\n'We ran down to where she was, everyone had come out of their boats and because there were a lot of big yachts around there were a lot of trained medical officers helping out.\nAli was still breathing, still had a pulse and 'looked like she was sleeping' when she was wheeled away for the surgery which her parents found confronting\n'Within 15 minutes three German doctors arrived and did what they could for her but told me it was very serious and she would need to see a neurosurgeon as soon as she got to the hospital.'\nMs van Os remembers seeing a lot of blood on the dock, coming from her daughter's ears – but says she didn't have any visible marks on her face.\n'She just looked like she was sleeping, her chest was going up and down, she had a pulse and colour in her face.\n'I knew it was serious she was completely unconscious I just knew that it was not recoverable – but you don't let yourself think that. You never give up hope until there is no chance.'\nShe was rushed to hospital but there was no brain activity. For four days her family sat by her bedside as doctors continued tests, knowing they would soon have to say goodbye.\n'I remember calling her brothers and sister and telling them what had happened,' Ms van Os said.\nHer mother Joanne wants to let others know how organ donation works - that you don't get to see your loved one 'die' before they are taken away\n'I don't remember what I said but it was one of the worst things I have ever had to do.\n'They all came to be with us straight away.'\nFor four days the family surrounded Ali – taking turns to go back to the hotel to sleep.\n'When we found out for the organ donation to work she still had to be attached to a ventilator when she was taken to theater, we were shocked – I guess we just thought that they would wait until her heart stopped beating,' Ms van Os said.\nThe mother believes in organ donation - and was glad her daughter could help others. A 15-year-old Thai girl received Ali's heart which saved her life\n'The doctors told us we could wait until her heart stopped, but then we wouldn't be able to donate the major organs.\n'We went back to our hotel and thought about it and the logic came to the foreground, there was no point in making a donation if it wasn't a proper one.\n'The hesitation came from an emotional response, we knew she was gone she had suffered a catastrophic brain injury, she was brain-dead.\n'After we talked about it we knew logically oxygen needed to be going through the organs to make them viable.'\nThe heartbroken mother and father were joined at Ali's bedside by her older brothers and sister as well as her aunt and uncle.\nIn the eight years since Ali's death her family have been getting the word-out about organ donation – and how it can be confronting to watch a loved one wheeled into surgery with a pulse, attached to ventilators.\nMs van Os believes everybody should understand the organ donation process so if confronted with it they will be able to make a logical decision.\n'They need to understand what to expect - so it isn't as confronting. You are traumatised enough already.'\nThe family agree organ donation is important. Ali's heart saved a 15-year-old Thai girl's life and her other organs were shared between six different people.\nAli loved sailing and socialising with knew people - her learning difficulties had improved during her time at sea with her parents\n'Another family wasn't going to have a funeral. It doesn't make up for what we lost but it makes it seem like not a waste,' she said.\n'Ali was barely sick a day in her life, to not donate her organs would have been a terrible waste, it would be a shame to potentially deny another person life.'\nMs van Os wants families to take the time to talk about organ donation.\nThe Australian organ donation website now has information explaining the donation process.\nThis information wasn't available when Ali died but her mother believes if it was and she was aware of it, the decision to go ahead with the procedure would have been easier emotionally.\n'Ali was barely sick a day in her life, to not donate her organs would have been a terrible waste, it would be a shame to potentially deny another person life,' Ms van Os said", "external_links": ["http://www.donatelife.gov.au/"], "published": "2017-02-24T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:47:33.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
