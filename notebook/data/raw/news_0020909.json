Richardson, Denver Post file Students play chess at the Ricardo Flores Magon Academy, a charter school in Denver. The majority of Colorado school districts do not equally share local tax revenue raised through mill-levy overrides with their charter public school students. It’s no secret that public education funding in Colorado is in a dire state.\nAt $2,685 below the national average, Colorado ranks 41st among all states in terms of per-pupil spending.\nAs House Speaker Crisanta Duran referenced in her opening remarks to the 2017 Colorado General Assembly: “If we cannot fund our schools … then we are not delivering what the people of Colorado need.”\nWe couldn’t agree more.\nThe problem, however, is that the situation is even worse for the nearly 115,000 Colorado children who attend charter public schools. Through no fault of their own, their public educations are being funded at 20 percent less than other students in the state.\nIf combined into a single district, charter public schools would represent the largest school district in Colorado. So why are they so systematically underfunded?\nIt is because the majority of Colorado school districts do not equally share local tax revenue raised through mill-levy overrides (MLOs) with their charter public school students. MLOs are voter-approved property tax increases that fund school district operational expenses such as personnel or programming.\nThe inequitable distributions from MLOs have resulted in a $20 million to $25 million funding disparity between our state’s traditional public schools and charter public schools. This disparity is compounded even further by the fact that students in charter public schools authorized by the Colorado Charter School Institute (CSI) in lieu of a school district have zero access to local tax dollars.\nMeet Amanda, a mother of two. Amanda’s children attend Montessori del Mundo (MdM), an ECE-6th grade, dual-language CSI charter school located in Aurora. Relative to other public schools in the area, MdM receives $1,000 less per-pupil, per-year because it has no access to local tax dollars. This funding inequity means that one of Amanda’s daughters gets speech therapy only one day per week — instead of the two that she needs. Her other daughter loves music, but MdM can only afford to offer a limited music program. How is this fair to Amanda, a taxpayer, and her children?\nOne child’s public education should not be valued any less than another’s simply because his or her parents choose a public school that happens to have the word “charter” in its name.\nThankfully there is a solution on the horizon. Senate Bill 61, which was introduced with the bipartisan support of Democrat Sen. Angela Williams and Republicans Sen. Owen Hill and Rep. Lang Sias, would help equalize funding for Colorado charter public schools. This legislation states that if a MLO is passed for a specific program or operational need that a district charter school offers, then the revenue generated by that MLO should go to charter public school students in that district on an equal per-pupil basis. It also calls on the state to help level the playing field for students attending CSI schools.\nBased on overall performance and accountability, this equal funding opportunity is long overdue. According to a 2016 Colorado Department of Education report, charter public school students outperform students in non-charter schools on state performance measures, both overall and with educationally disadvantaged subgroups. Moreover, Colorado charter public schools are enrolling students of color and English language learners at higher rates than the state’s traditional public schools.\nIn a time of limited resources, it is more important than ever to provide every child equal access to public resources for public education. Supporting Senate Bill 61 is a step in the right direction to ensure that charter public school students no longer have to deal with an injustice they neither signed up for nor deserve.\nTerrance D.

Groff is the former president of the Colorado Senate.\n ", "external_links": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cd08charter1_hr.jpg?w=780&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px", "https://i0.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cd08charter1_hr.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px", "https://i0.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cd08charter1_hr.jpg?w=630&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px", "https://i0.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cd08charter1_hr.jpg?w=810&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px"], "published": "2017-02-09T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:45:43.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
