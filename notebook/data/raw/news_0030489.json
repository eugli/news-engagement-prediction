With a mortality rate above 40 percent, s ome 11,300 died.\nSuper-spreaders have also played a role in the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012.\nSource: AFP news agency \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:48:21.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
