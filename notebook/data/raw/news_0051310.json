Stephen Colbert mocked President Donald Trump’s recent Twitter attack on mainstream media by calling outlets, like CNN and The New York Times , the new ISIS during his opening monologue on The Late Show Monday. \nTo refresh your memory: Trump tweeted on Friday that the “failing” Times , NBC, ABC, CBS, and CNN are “the enemy of the American People!” But Colbert joked that he left out one crucial name on that list of the nation’s most wanted. \n“Do you know who I feel bad for? ISIS,” he said. “They try so hard. Sorry, ISIS, if you want to get on the list, you gotta publish photos of Trump’s inauguration crowd, then he’ll be really, really angry at you.” The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nColbert pointed to Senator John McCain, who likened Trump’s attack on the media to that of a dictator during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press . “He’s not calling [Trump] a full dictator,” the late-night host clarified. “He’s bite-sized. He’s dictator-tot.” \nColbert brought up POTUS’ media attacks again when addressing the appointment of General H.R. McMaster as nation security adviser. Mimicking Trump’s pick, he said, “I swear to do everything in my power to protect the nation from America’s enemies, which I am being told are CBS and the failing New York Times . Wow. Things have really changed since I was in the army five minutes ago.” \nWatch Colbert in the clip above.
