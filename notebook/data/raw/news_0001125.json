'Know your native animals rather than celebrities' \nMr Andrews said it was disappointing Australians know more about celebrities than some of the country's unique wildlife. \n\"I have no problem with Justin Bieber or Kim Kardashian, but it does worry me that more Australians know who they are than know what a bilby, a quokka, a quoll or a night parrot is,\" he said. \n\"I would certainly like more Australians to know what a night parrot is than Kim Kardashian, or what a bilby is than Justin Bieber.\" \nMr Andrews said it was becoming more difficult for people to see native animals in the wild, but he believed there was still hope, because on a recent family holiday, his eight-year-old daughter was lucky enough to see a bilby. \n\"Night parrots share very similar habitats to bilbies, so my hope is that my daughter — and all Aussie kids — will be able to see a night parrot in the wild,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:29:28.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
