The two RPGs that preceded it were beloved by a certain segment of PC players and folks who tackled the imperfect Xbox 360 port of the first sequel, but neither of those previous games were as ambitious or expertly executed as The Witcher 3. In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, though, there's a smaller version of the game The Witcher 3 would become, and even the Xbox 360 version presented it well if awkwardly at times. Long load times and cramped environments sometimes hampered the already excellent storytelling. While CD Projekt Red is busy making Cyberpunk 2077 and Gwent, a proper new Witcher game is many years away. That makes it a perfect time to let another studio get about remastering The Witcher 2 into a smoother, more technologically capable shape on PS4 and Xbox One. (Best skip The Witcher, though. That game is good but it needs a complete remake to be console ready at this point.)
