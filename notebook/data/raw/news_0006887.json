'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said. 'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for [Trump] to honour the deal.' Mr Turnbull is pictured visiting a glass factory south of Melbourne on Thursday Mr Turnbull admitted President Trump would not consider the deal a good deal The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine. The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II. Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005. Washington Post journalist Philip Rucker claimed President Drump does not care about being allies. '[Trump] doesn't care Australia is an ally over many, many years. What he cares about is the refugee policy he views as dangerous,' Philip Rucker told ABC on Thursday. 'The thing you have to understand about Donald Trump is that he is not a natural diplomat, he is not a politician. He has a career in real estate, in business, and deal-making and he ran for President as someone who was going to disrupt the world order. He was going to make changes. He was going to blow up the system, literally. And disrupt what he sees as sort of a world order that is failing the world and making it less safe. Mr Trump complained he was going to get killed politically and accused Australia of trying to export the 'next Boston bombers' (he is pictured on the phone to Mr Turnbull The U.S. President is pictured speaking to Mr Turnbull over the weekend on the phone 'So he doesn't really care so much that Australia is an ally over many, many years. What he cares about is the refugee policy that he views as dangerous for the United States. So he doesn't let diplomatic niceties get in the way about how he felt about that refugee policy.' Mr Turnbull had earlier described their phone call on Saturday, their first since President Trump's inauguration, as 'constructive'. On Thursday, an anonymous source claimed the president hung up on Mr Turnbull 25 minutes into a phone call that was expected to last an hour. President Trump reportedly said the refugee agreement, originally made between Mr Turnbull and former President Barack Obama, was 'the worst deal ever'. 'He thinks it hurts him politically at home, in the US, and he feels like I think most importantly that this would be a threat to national security - and he told the Prime Minister as much,' Mr Rucker told ABC News. 'He said he thought Australia might be trying to export, quote 'the next Boston bomber'. That is the reference to the Boston marathon terrorist attack in the United States a few years ago.' Mr Turnbull visits a glass factory on Thursday as the refugee deal appeared to be thrown into doubt Mr Rucker said President Trump is not concerned with niceties. In a statement on Thursday, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Canberra confirmed President Trump's intention to honour the refugee deal. But shortly after, he called the deal 'dumb' on Twitter. 'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' President Trump wrote. 'President Trump's decision to honor the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman [Sean] Spicer's comments stands,' the spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. At a press conference, Mr Turnbull refused to deny the phone conversation was hostile. 'I'm not going to comment on these reports out of the United States about the conversation,' Mr Turnbull told a press conference from Melbourne on Thursday. 'Australians know me very well. I always stand up for Australia in every forum.' He said it was better to leave the discussion out of the public domain. 'You've got to remember what the president is doing. He committed to honour a deal done by his predecessor, that he no doubt would not have done himself,' he said (pictured at factory) 'It's better that these things, these conversations, are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. 'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and every day to stand up for Australia and that's what I do. 'My business is being the Prime Minister of Australia. That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and to defend the interests of Australians.' Mr Turnbull insisted the bond between the allied countries remained strong through the refugee deal. 'I can assure you the relationship is very strong. The fact we received the assurance that we did, the fact that it was confirmed, the very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness of the alliance. 'But as Australians know me, very well, I stand up for Australia in every forum - public or private.' The U.S. president reportedly told the prime minister he'd spoken with four other leaders – including Russian President Vladimir Putin – and 'this was the worst call by far'. Mr Turnbull had earlier described their phone call on Saturday, their first since President Trump's inauguration, as 'constructive' Mr Trump complained he was going to get killed politically and accused Australia of trying to export the 'next Boston bombers'. After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested the leaders move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, Mr Trump ended the conversation, Washington Post reported. The call was scheduled to go for about an hour, but Mr Trump ended it after 25 minutes. Washington Post journalist Philip Rucker The official statement about the conversation, released by the White House, told a different story. 'Both leaders emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said. Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger. 'We discussed the importance of border security and the threat of illegal and irregular migration, and recognised that it is vital that every nation is able to control who comes across its borders,' he said. The Saturday phone call was their first conversation since President Trump's inauguration.
