But Mr. Brownback and his supporters also viewed their policy prescriptions, including the tax cuts that passed in 2012 and 2013, as a model that could be imitated elsewhere. “We believe this is a strategy that builds a strong state in the future on the red-state model,” Mr. Brownback said in an interview with The New York Times during his first term in the governor’s office. “I think we are doing this aggressively, and I think you’re going to see some very good things moving forward. It’s not as if we haven’t tried the blue-state model, because we have.” Yet Kansas has struggled in the aftermath of the tax reductions, and the state has been rattled by debates about paying for public education and social services. This month, S&P Global Ratings issued a “negative” outlook for its credit rating for Kansas, where the economic growth that Mr. Brownback thought the tax cuts would produce has not materialized. Last summer, S&P downgraded Kansas’ credit rating, to AA-. Mr. Brownback, who said that the proposal before the Legislature this week amounted to a “punitive tax increase on Kansas workers, families and job creators,” is not without his supporters. Business leaders at the annual dinner of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce were delighted when the governor said on Tuesday night that he would veto the tax package, and in a Twitter post on Wednesday, the chamber posed a provocative question in a conservative state: “How much will your taxes increase under HB 2178?” But the reality that Mr. Brownback had to reckon with a pair of veto override votes on Wednesday reflected his diminished standing in the state and the power of a coalition of centrist Republicans and right-leaning Democrats. The results of last year’s election, when conservatives saw their ranks slip in the Legislature in a round of balloting that sometimes seemed like a referendum on Mr. Brownback’s tenure, loomed over the debate. “Approval rating is one thing,” Burdett A. Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas, said in an interview between the House and Senate votes. “When you get 85 votes — over half of them Republican votes — against you, that’s really significant.” Other Republican governors have struggled this year with intraparty clashes over taxation. Last week in Oklahoma, where Gov. Mary Fallin has proposed new levies on more than 150 services, the lieutenant governor resigned from the cabinet. And Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan and Republican lawmakers battled over a proposal that would have eliminated the state’s income tax by 2057. House Republicans abandoned that proposal this week.
