I stick by what I said.\" \nHe also accused Labour of \"politicising\" the disaster. \nThe Labour Party is yet to respond. 'Smear campaign' \nNinety-six people died after a crush at an FA Cup game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's ground. \nMr Banks described the backlash to his comments and the reaction to the false claims on Mr Nuttall's website as a \"Labour smear campaign\". \nHe said: \"Yes, I am sick to death of hearing about Hillsborough. The politicisation of it by the Labour party is atrocious.\" Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption In the UK's worst sporting disaster, 96 fans died after a crush at the Hillsborough stadium \nHe continued: \"I mean, Hillsborough obviously was a disaster, it was wrong, it was covered up... the Labour party want to politicise it as an issue, but I find that deeply distasteful.\" \nOn Saturday, Labour MP Andy Burnham, who was involved in the Hillsborough justice campaign, tweeted : \"We set up an All-Party Group to provide cross-party support for the Hillsborough families & take the issue beyond party politics.\" 'Crass insensitivity' \nIn a radio interview last week, Mr Nuttall said he knew people who died in the disaster, but he was \"appalled\" his website had given the impression that he was close to any of the victims \nHe said he did not check press releases posted by an aide in 2011 and 2012.

You know what happens in politics. The Labour Party goes through whatever anyone's ever said and then brings it up in the last week of a by-election.\" \nMr Nuttall, who is an MEP for North West England, is a candidate in Thursday's Stoke Central by-election. \nHe has been joined in his election campaign by Kieran Aspden, chairman of UKIP Preston, who said his father spent three days in a coma after being in the crush at Hillsborough.
