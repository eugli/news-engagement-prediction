He's running great times. He's really swinging the bat well.\n“He can help you in so many different ways. He can make a defensive play, he can steal a base or he can get a hit. He plays with a lot of energy.”\nEstes is one of 20 newcomers on Auburn's roster this season. Auburn athletics Part of Thompson’s message to Estes before he arrived at Auburn this summer was to come in and help change the culture. The Tigers have made the NCAA Tournament just twice in the last 10 years.\n“They just really want everyone to work hard and not be complacent. They want us to work hard and win,” Estes said. “I'm focused on just making all the plays and doing anything I can to help the team win.”\nAuburn’s infield is just about set for the opening series against George Washington Friday. Josh Anthony is expected to start at third base, Luke Jarvis shortstop, Estes second and Daniel Robert first base. Thompson is fairly confident catcher Blake Logan, who is returning from an illness, will be ready for opening day.\n“We're trying to give him at-bats (Friday), (Saturday), play him Sunday, play him Tuesday and if that goes well, we'll evaluate after Tuesday,” Thompson said. “I think he still has an opportunity to make the opening day start for us and be ready to play.”\nDamon Haecker and Mike Rojas will also play catcher. Conor Davis and Dylan Ingram can DH and play first while Will Holland can play second, short or third.\nFirst pitch at Plainsman Park Friday is set for 2 p.m. CT and will be broadcast on SECN Alternate and Watch ESPN. The two teams will play a doubleheader Saturday starting at 11 a.m. and the series finale Sunday at noon.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/rgl62j6bivh123w2cmga", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/rgl62j6bivh123w2cmga)"], "published": "2017-02-12T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:55:26.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
