Let’s just call it a “Little House” mishap. The U.S. pop singer delivered the night’s most overtly political statement with her performance of \"Chained to the Rhythm,\" with support from Skip Marley , rows of lit-up miniature houses and a pair of giant skeletons decked out in outfits similar to those worn by U.S. president Donald Trump and U.K. prime minister Theresa May. The action, however, wasn’t all center stage. One of those mini homes went off-piste and crashed into the pit, footage of which is blowing up online right now. Some hours after the Brits had wrapped up, Katy Perry was the night's only performer still trending on Twitter in the U.S. Whoever spilled into the Brit Awards sidelines is in good company. Madonna famously took a tumble mid-performance at the 2015 Brits, and she didn’t have the benefit of a mask to hide her blushes (to her credit, she carried on like a pro). Watch the \"Little House\" footage below. — Katy Perry Venezuela (@KatyPVenezuela) February 22, 2017 I'm crying the House fell off the stage -- -- #BRITs2017 #KatyPerryBRITS pic.twitter.com/LlknbQIbsi", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:38:26.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
