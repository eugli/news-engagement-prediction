But he said he was being kept abreast of developments by community leaders. \nMore incidents of looting of foreign-owned shops in Atteridgeville \n“I have been assured that if the mood gets ugly‚ then I will be told to move. But then I will have to leave everything behind. I will be finished‚” he said. \nMohamed said he has always lived in fear‚ with some threatening community members telling him to go home. \nForeign-owned shops have been abandoned in all of the four townships in Tshwane in the wake of the anticipated march on Friday by \"concerned residents\" of Mamelodi‚ who claim foreigners living in the area are taking local jobs. \nThe newly-formed Coalition of Civics Against Xenophobia‚ made up of both South Africans and representatives of local foreigner communities‚ under the auspices of the Lawyers for Human Rights‚ has vowed to try to stop the march. \nThe coalition said other xenophobes in other parts of the country will see the march as a licence to openly speak their message of hatred against immigrants and even to take violent action against them. \n“It is the duty of the state to protect people and their belongings. To allow this march would be a dereliction of duty by state authorities‚ namely‚ the President (Jacob Zuma)‚ the Premier of Gauteng (David Makhura)‚ the Mayor of Tshwane (Solly Msimanga) and other state and government offices and officials. If blood is spilled as a result of this march‚ it will be on their hands‚” the coalition said in a statement. \nIt is still not clear whether the march has been approved‚ with Tshwane metro police spokesperson‚ Superintendent Isaac Mahamba‚ saying they will issue a statement shortly to pronounce on the contentious march. \nTMG Digital/TimesLIVE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:04:46.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
