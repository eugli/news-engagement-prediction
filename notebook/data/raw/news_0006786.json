(Mary Altaffer/AP)  54 PM \nThe flurry of Brooklyn federal lawsuits filed to free detained immigrants and fight President Trump's executive order have been assigned to one judge. \nBrooklyn Federal Judge Carol Bagley Amon was assigned the cases Monday, including the petition that resulted in another judge issuing a Saturday evening emergency stay to block removals. \nJudge Ann Donnelly was the miscellaneous duty judge when that case was first filed. \nThe jobs of judges on miscellaneous duty include immediate rulings when something urgent comes up after hours. \nThough Amon got the Darweesh case and then 16 cases deemed to be related under federal court rules, a number have been voluntarily dismissed. Amon is also fighting to block President Trump's order and to keep detained immigrants in the U.S. (ANDREW HARRER / POOL/EPA) \nThe Darweesh case is ongoing and the sides will put in papers on the matter through next month. \nAmon, a longtime federal prosecutor, was nominated for the bench by President George H. W. Bush in 1990. \nShe served as the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney’s chief judge from 2011 to 2016.
