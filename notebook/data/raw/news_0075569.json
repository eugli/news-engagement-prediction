Over the decades, the Academy Awards has played host to a panoply of outrageous fashion statements. Let’s revisit some of the occasion’s most memorable sartorial shocks. Cher marched to the beat of her own drum in various degrees of bare and bronzed skin, often (scantily) dressed by the designer Bob Mackie. Who could forget that night in 1986 when the musical legend ruffled feathers in a cage-cutout midriff and maxi skirt with gravity-defying headdress up top? Equally iconic was Björk’s Oscar entrance in 2001, when she floated in wearing a literal swan dress, laying bird eggs in her wake.

Before that, Demi Moore peddled up the red carpet in spandex bike shorts with a metallic brocade train behind her. Flash-forward to Gwyneth Paltrow , in 2002, who did her part to free the nipple in a see-through Alexander McQueen.
