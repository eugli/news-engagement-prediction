(ABC News: Chris McLoughlin) \nCraig attended with his wife and said the mark-up on alcohol was \"ridiculous\". \n\"It was expensive at the Gunners â€” as if we don't pay enough for tickets to get through the door.\" \nPublic pressure and criticism forced the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority to marginally reduce food and drink prices during the third Test between Australia and South Africa. \nBut with crowds to attend tonight's T20 cricket match between Sri Lanka and Australia, and with one month to go until the AFL season starts, punters considered those reductions of between 10 and 30 cents to be nothing but \"bullshit\". \n\"Using the 30-cent analogy, I would need to drink 33 cans to save $10,\" Craig said. \n\"Who drinks 33 cans at the footy?\" SACA member takes aim at expenses \nJames is a long-term South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) member and said prices at the oval had \"gone crazy\". \n\"Gone are the days of the old tuck shop out the back of the members where prices were reasonable,\" he said. \n\"And they're taking football out of the reach of the common person.\" \nTicket prices for the 2017 AFL season have not yet been released, but in 2016, two minor round tickets for adults (close to the front) totalled $158.37, while two adults seats (towards the back) during the final between North Melbourne and the Adelaide Crows totalled $137.45.

(AAP: Ben Macmahon) \n\"Going to the footy used to be regular thing but for many it's a treat as families simply can't afford to go,\" James said. \n\"SANFL always provided good value but this brand is no longer supported at Adelaide Oval as the prima donnas don't want the surface to be in any way roughed up before they play, and they want exclusive use of the ground to warm up. \n\"I'll be watching more footy at Prospect Oval than AO this coming winter.\" \nSA Infrastructure Minister Stephen Mullighan said record crowds at the AFL suggested ticket prices were \"acceptable to families\" and were underpinning \"increased investment by both the Crows and Power in their clubs\". \n\"It is important that the Adelaide Oval not only continues to be considered one of the best stadiums in Australia, but also remains affordable.\" Spectators packing their own food \nBut Luke, who regularly attends ALF Matches with his family, said they brought their own food and drinks to make it possible, while Shane Rogers said the prices were becoming \"untenable\". \n\"As a father with a couple of young kids, by the time you're buying food and drinks for a family situation, it's completely unmanageable for a standard family,\" he said. \n\"On top of the escalating ticket prices, it's almost untenable altogether. \n\"Maybe that explains why the free entry on women's football has been such a hit . People can go there and not worry about their hip pocket.\" Food and drinks 'have not changed' since 2016 \nAn AOSMA spokesperson said the oval's food and beverage pricing had not changed since their most recent review in November, \"when we announced an average increase of just 3 per cent\". \n\"This was covered in the media extensively at that time, as was the fact that some items had not increased in price or had reduced,\" she said. \nAOSMA chief executive officer Andrew Daniels said at the time that fans were welcome to bring their own food and non-alcoholic beverages to the ground, while chilled water stations were located throughout the venue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:01:42.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
