Lakers presiden of basketball operations Magic Johnson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:11 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:11 p.m. ET \nFor a second, pretend you’re an NBA legend who has just been named president of basketball operations for one of the league’s marquee franchises. Following a massive restructuring of a front office that saw your ascension to this role, you have no general manager in place, no vice president of communications and no experience yourself in a league front office. Oh, and it’s two days before the trade deadline. \nWhat do you do next? \nMORE: Magic Johnson has had some b d NBA takes on Twitter \nThat’s exactly the set of circumstances staring Magic Johnson in the face after the Lakers announced that he will be in charge following Tuesday’s long-gestating shakeup within the team’s organizational chart. For those reading the tea leaves, this has been coming from the moment that he was named as an advisor to Jeannie Buss on Feb. 2. One only has to look at Johnson’s interview with USA Today eight days after returning to the team saying that he wanted to “call the shots” to understand that. Team president Jeannie Buss echoed that in an interview on Spectrum Sportsnet following the announcement. \n“This was a very difficult decision,” Buss said. “It was probably so hard for me to make that I probably waited too long. For that, I apologize to Lakers fans. But now with clarity and direction and after talking with Earvin, really knowing that change was needed and that’s why we’re here today.” \nAt the time of that USA Today interview, there was some question as to what exactly “calling the shots” would entail. Now, though, there is no gray area. This is Magic’s show, and he has some major decisions to make as soon as possible. This is an unstable moment for an organization that features one of the youngest rosters in the league, a 19-39 record and long-term money tied up in substandard veterans. \nHowever, one decision looms over the future of the franchise. In order to create a successful environment, the Lakers must hit a home run with their next general manager hire. This will be the most important choice of Johnson’s tenure with the Lakers. Just 11 days ago during that interview with USA Today where he made his intentions clear, Johnson also noted some of the weaknesses he had as a front office executive. \n“The main part for me is really learning the other part that I didn’t know, and that is to understand the CBA, the salary cap, where we are in terms of the salary cap and who’s a free-agent-to-be,” Johnson said. “You’ve got a lot of young players so you’ve got to learn when are their contracts coming up, if you can give them the max deal, give them an extension, all those types of things you’ve got to learn.” \nDEVENEY: Magic move shows patience no longer a virtue in LA \nTo put it mildly, that’s an extraordinarily basic understanding of important collective bargaining agreement minutiae. There is so much more that goes into making sound, competent basketball decisions than simply knowing what players are good and bad, and when their contracts end. The strongest organizations know this document in and out, and understand the ways they can use it to their own advantage in order to think forward into the future. The fact that he’s still learning should put some fear into Lakers fans. Some of his recent tweets in regard to his understanding of the modern NBA should equally put some concern into their heads. \nBut that’s not to say that Johnson’s lack of knowledge in this capacity should disqualify him from this role. Johnson brings this own positives to the table as a personality to pitch to free agents, and having relationships around the league. For years, he has been incredibly successful at running companies through his ability to delegate resources to smart people with more experience than him. \nEven taking away his past as a basketball legend, the managerial skills he’s shown throughout his business career should earn him equity to make the right decisions in running the organization. This is not your typical “big name with no experience enters front office” situation. Johnson has made himself a near-billionaire through sound decision-making processes. \nAll of those factors make the hiring of a day-to-day general manager that much more vital. He needs to find an expert in the CBA who also doubles as a smart, forward-thinking scout. Johnson also has to be willing to trust this person and respect his or her knowledge in each capacity, and be willing to work together in order to create and foster a sustainable direction for the franchise. \nAccording to Kevin Ding of Bleacher Report , the choice could be super-agent Rob Pelinka. Pelinka is an interesting candidate in that he’s considered extremely smart by those throughout the industry as an expert in the collective bargaining agreement, and has an extensive history with the Lakers organization as Kobe Bryant’s agent. That experience on the player-side of the aisle, along with Johnson’s personality, should make the Lakers more appealing to free agents. \nMORE: Wizards considering parting with draft pick for Lou Williams \nHowever, Pelinka also has no experience as a front office executive, and will be forced to divest from his agency, Landmark Sports, in order to come aboard. As the agent for players such as James Harden, Chris Bosh, Buddy Hield, Avery Bradley and Eric Gordon, that process could take some time. Given that the team is in the middle of a complicated trade deadline featuring decisions on pending free agents like Nick Young and valuable veterans like Lou Williams, that’s not ideal. \nBut speed shouldn’t be of the essence here. The key is finding the right guy for the job who can not only help Magic learn what he needs to know in order to make informed decisions, but who can also handle many of the day-to-day activities teams need in order to be successful. It cannot be someone with similar skills to what Johnson already possesses. \nHe also needs to litter the front office with smart, experienced front office people who can help out his hand-picked general manager. Running an NBA personnel unit is a complicated enterprise that takes a village, not one man. A piece of that puzzle should be assistant general manager Ryan West, son of legendary player and executive Jerry West. \nWest is considered a rising star throughout the industry, and he should be able to play a large role in the process. Making sure a strong scouting network is in place will also be essential given that Johnson doesn’t have experience on that side of the aisle, either. \nNBA DRAFT: Who goes No. 1 in SN's latest prospect rankings? \nIf handled in the right manner, the Johnson hire could end up being a turning point for an organization that has sputtered along in recent years. If he utilizes his unique skills as a manager, this doesn’t have to go the way of other past legendary figures with no front office experience. If Johnson can learn from, for instance, Phil Jackson’s mistakes, his desire to call the shots could really help an organization in need of a change at the top. \nBut to experience that kind of success, Johnson needs to understand his weaknesses as an executive and surround himself with the right people.
