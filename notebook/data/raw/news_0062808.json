It transferred to the West End in 2015 and has proved a hit at the Barrow Street Theatre, an off-Broadway theatre in Manhattan. \nProducer Rachel Edwards said: “Seeing Tooting written in the New Yorker and the New York Times makes me very proud. It’s the neighbourhood in which we grew up so it’s special to fly the Tooting flag. This started out as a community project and people in Tooting pitched in from all sides, whether it was the pie shop or the people at the end of the street who helped make the costumes. \n“The reach is greater in New York but it still very much feels like a community affair and we’ve had nothing but goodwill.” Arts picks of the week: 20th - 26th February Arts picks of the week: 20th - 26th February 1/9 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead \nDaniel Radcliffe returns to the London stage to play the Rosencrantz to Joshua McGuire’s Guildenstern, celebrating 50 years since the play began.

It opens next Wednesday but is sold out until the middle of April. \nThe Barrow Street Theatre has been reduced from 199 seats to 130 for the intimate show, whose producers weren’t keen on a Broadway berth. Edwards said: “It just wouldn’t feel right in a big house. We wanted to create that pressure-cooker, chamber of horrors experience and we’re still pretty small here. People keep saying to me, ‘I think you’re the only producer in New York who is trying to take seats out of a theatre!’” Sweeney Todd, Harrington's Pie and Mash Shop - theatre review: 'This \nThe cast is a mixture of British and US actors led by Jeremy Secomb and Siobhan McCarthy, who are reprising their roles from the London productions.
