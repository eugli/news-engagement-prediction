Authorities were also releasing water to lower the lake's level.\nThe Yuba County Office of Emergency Services urged evacuees to travel only to the east, south or west. \"DO NOT TRAVEL NORTH TOWARD OROVILLE,\" the department said on Twitter.\nEvacuation centres were set up at a fairgrounds in Chico, California, about 20 miles northwest of Oroville, but roads leading out of the area were jammed as residents sought to drive out of the flood zone.\nIt was not clear how many residents were affected by the evacuation order.\nState authorities and engineers on Thursday began carefully releasing water from the Lake Oroville Dam some 65 miles (105 km) north of Sacramento after noticing that large chunks of concrete were missing from a spillway.\nWater levels were less than 7 feet (2 metres) from the top of the dam on Friday. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday to declare a major disaster due to flooding and mudslides brought on by the storms.\nThe earthfill dam is just upstream and east of Oroville, a city of more than 16,000 people. \nAt 770 feet (230 metres) high, the structure, built between 1962 and 1968, is the tallest dam   besting the famed Hoover Dam by more than 40 feet (12 metres).\n(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Cooney and Mary Milliken)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:43:19.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
