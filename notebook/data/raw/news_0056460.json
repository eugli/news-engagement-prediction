No more. President Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies have cranked up the tension in US-Mexico relations to a high not seen in decades. He's blamed the country for sending rapists into the US, castigated undocumented immigrants from across the border and blasted Mexico for what he says are unfair trade practices. One of Trump's first actions as president was to order the construction of a wall that he insists Mexico will pay for, despite the country's repeated refusals. In response, consumers south of the border are boycotting US brands and goods and lawmakers have introduced a bill to stop buying US corn. Mexicans staged massive anti-US protests Sunday, forming human chains along the border where Trump would like to build a wall. And President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned trip to Washington to meet with Trump in apparent frustration. That's the backdrop as Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly arrive in Mexico for meetings with Peña Nieto, Mexican ministers and military officials. The trip is meant to allow the new US Cabinet members to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues that range from counterterrorism, border security, immigration and trade that amounts to $1.5 billion a day. But the secretaries make their debut under a cloud. Read More \"Today's rhetoric is forcing Mexicans everywhere to question the unquestionable: Did the country make a mistake 25 years ago by betting its future on North America?\" asked Peter Schecter, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council. \"No relationship is perfect, and there is much to develop and improve in Mexico. But by ostracizing our neighbor, we are in imminent danger of dismantling the North American experiment we've built over the last 20-plus years.\" In a reflection of how broad the US-Mexico relationship is, Tillerson and Kelly will meet with the Mexican ministers of Interior, Foreign Relations, Finance, National Defense and Navy. The day in Mexico City will represent the first known high-level meetings between the US and Mexican officials since Peña Nieto canceled a visit to Washington on January 27 after Trump declared that there was no point in his coming if Mexico wouldn't agree to pay for a border wall. \"Unless Mexico will treat the US fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route,\" Trump told GOP lawmakers at a retreat in Philadelphia. \"I have no choice.\" He went on to say that \"border security is a serious, serious issue and a national problem. Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border.\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:24:06.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
