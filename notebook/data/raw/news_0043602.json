Sean Carey, the manager of NASA’s Spitzer Science Center at Caltech and Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nThe foreshadowing of the event has led to intense speculation online. \nThe press release issued by NASA made it to the front page of reddit where at the time of writing it has attracted more than 1650 comments and sparked a lengthy debate about what NASA might reveal. \nOn the basis of the scientists scheduled to conduct the press conference, one reddit user speculated that the announcement could have something to do with the collection of atmospheric data from a potentially promising exoplanet. \n“Here is my guess. They found exoplanets (maybe even earth like) and were able to get atmospheric data (maybe oxygen) from its observation,” they wrote. \nOthers wondered if it might have something to do with Proxima Centauri. NASA has launched a number of missions to discover nearby exoplanets. Source: Supplied \nThanks to NASA’s Kepler Telescope which has been busily scanning 150,000 stars for signs of orbiting bodies in recent years, we’ve discovered that on average every star has at least one planet if not many more circling it. \nIn May last year, the space agency revealed it had found a further 1284 new planets, more than doubling the number of known exoplanets in the universe. And the most important part: nine of them could theoretically be habitable. \nThe public will be able to ask questions during the NASA briefing later this week via Twitter by using the hashtag #askNASA and scientists will conduct an AMA (ask me anything) on reddit following the press conference. \nThe event will air live on NASA Television and the agency’s website.
