His defence barrister claimed he bombarded the group after falling out with his girlfriend. Huge rise in anti-semitic hate crimes in London \nVictim Chaya Stern and her son took shelter in a nearby supermarket - too afraid to leave and face their persecutor, the court heard. \nProsecutor Lee Sergent said: \"Mrs Stern said she tried to stay strong for her son but as they passed the van, some gas canisters were thrown through the van window at them. \n“This incident has brought back bad memories and left me with a shocked feeling inside. \n\"I know it will take time to get over it. We didn't do anything to these men, we didn't agitate or argue with them, we were just in fact people who wanted to go shopping.\" \nPassing sentence, Judge John Dodd QC told the defendant: \"Your conduct was simply disgraceful, any civilised society cannot allow for such conduct to be tolerated or to be considered in any sense acceptable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:48:28.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
