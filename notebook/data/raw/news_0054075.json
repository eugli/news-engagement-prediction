We tried to barge in inside the college to rescue the students but they are attacking us as well. They have come prepared with hockey sticks,” an AISA member said. \nCollege Principal Rajender Prasad said he is in discussion with the teachers who were organisers of the event and requested both the groups to not disrupt the peace and harmony in the college. \nMr. Prasad on Tuesday claimed that though the college advocates freedom of speech, the decision to withdraw invites was taken keeping the situation in mind. \nThe two JNU students were invited to take part in a session during a two-day seminar on “Culture of Protest” organised by Wordcraft, Ramjas College’s literary society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:31:11.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
