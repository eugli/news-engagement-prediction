A bull named Frank managed to escape from a slaughterhouse in 2016. It wandered onto CUNY York College campus before it was captured by officials. \nThe bull was taken to an Animal Care Center facility in Brooklyn, police said. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart picked up the bull and transferred it to an animal safe haven in Watkins Glen, New York. \nA cow named “Freddie” also escaped from the same slaughterhouse. It was captured quickly, but a New Jersey animal rights activist took Freddie in at his animal sanctuary in Wantage. \nCity officials told WNBC that the bull died at some point before 2:30pm, nearly three hours after it escaped a Beaver Road slaughterhouse. \nThe animal’s cause of death wasn't immediately clear, and city officials had no further comment.
