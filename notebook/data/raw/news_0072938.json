( RICK EGLINTON FILE PHOTO ) By Nicholas Keung Immigration reporter Thu., Feb. 23, 2017 Canada has placed more than 200 Canadian children in immigration detention with their non-status parents since 2011, alongside hundreds of formally detained non-Canadian children, says University of Toronto study. Based on data obtained from Canada Border Services Agency, the U of T International Human Rights Program found at least 241 Canadian-born children — an average of 48 a year — were held in the Rexdale Immigration Holding Centre in Toronto between 2011 and 2015. The data does not cover detention facilities in other parts of Canada. On average, they spent 36 days at the detention centre with their incarcerated parents with one boy spending 803 days — over two years — in the detention facility. Two-thirds of the detained children were housed there for longer than a week and about 31 per cent were held for longer than a month. Eighty-five per cent of the children were under age 6. “Children who experience even brief periods of detention have extremely negative psychological reactions that often persist long after they are released,” warned the 63-page study, Invisible Citizens: Canadian Children in Immigration Detention , released Thursday.   “Children who are spared detention but are separated from their detained parents experience similarly grave consequences for their mental health.” Interviews by researchers with nine detained and formerly detained mothers of Canadian children from the Middle East, West Africa, Central America and the Caribbean found the children had difficulty sleeping, lost their appetite for food and interest in play, and developed symptoms of depression and separation anxiety, as well as a variety of physical symptoms. “Many of these symptoms persisted after release from detention,” the study warned. According to the border services policy, Canadian children should only be allowed to accompany their detained parents if there are no family members or friends to care for them, if they are still being breastfed, are too young to be separated from parents or have health issues. “Canadian children are invisible in Canada’s immigration detention system,” said Samer Muscati, the human rights program’s director. “While all detention of children is horrible, these children are particularly vulnerable because they lack important legal safeguards, including their own detention review hearings.” Under the immigration law, these Canadian-born children are citizens and cannot be formally detained, hence they are unable to access legal proceedings that review their continued “de facto” detention, said Muscati. As such, these children do not have access to detention review hearings, and until recently, adjudicators explicitly declined to consider the best interests of Canadian children in the detention reviews of their parents, he explained. Report author Hanna Gros described the situation of the mothers she interviewed for the study as “sheer helplessness.” “The interviews were emotionally intense. It was heartbreaking to see how helpless they felt when it comes to protecting their children,” said Gros, a senior fellow of the U of T human rights program. “Separating from your child is traumatic. It is not a real choice. Some of the women I met were still breastfeeding.” Since the fall, Public Security Minister Ralph Goodale, under public pressure, has initiated a review of the immigration detention system and vowed to explore alternatives to detention. According to the border services agency, the total number of children in detention across the country (both Canadians and non-Canadians) has dropped significantly. From April to December of 2016, only 12 Canadian children were housed in the Rexdale detention facility, for an average of 4.5 days. While progress has been made, Gros said the best interests of the children should take priority and their detention should be avoided altogether.
