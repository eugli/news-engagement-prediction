It's refreshing when an honest Ambi Subramaniam admits that it feels great to hear such things, but is quick to add that his family ' music maestro father L Subramaniam and singer mother Kavita Krishnamurti Subramaniam ' help keep him grounded. The young musician has his hands full, what with releasing his solo album, travelling the world with his parents, releasing singles with his sister for their band SubraMania and doing his bit for the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts (SaPa). In the midst of all this, Ambi took time out to speak to Bangalore Times about all this and more'\nYou are being called the new king of Indian classical music. And this title comes at the age of just 24'\nIt feels great to hear such things. A person gets into music for the love of it, and all these things are bonuses. Although it feels really good to hear these things, you shouldn't be working for it; you can't focus too much on such external things. There are many talented kids aged 13 and 14, but they kind of just stay there. Luckily, I have two parents who have walked the path, and they are also grounded, so they help me be that.\nYour second album, Just Playing, that released recently, comes three years after the first. Why the long wait?\nAfter the first album, Indian Violin, I wanted to make another album when I was significantly better. I didn't want to just keep bringing out albums unless I had something better to say. This album is different; in the first one, I went into the studio and played whatever I felt like, but the second one was more planned. The idea in this one was to take difficult pieces and make them sound simple.\nHow does one make difficult pieces sound simple?\nThe structure is complex in some of the pieces and the scales are challenging to improvize, which is why people normally don't do it ' they just play the piece. I wanted to work on those intricate scales. Musicians will realize the difficulty of the scales, but even if you are just a listener, you should still be able to find it appealing. In that sense, I was trying to simplify it in a way that the general audience shouldn't know if it is a difficult or easy piece.\nSo, your music will appeal even to those who have never heard Indian classical music before?\nComplexity shouldn't be a factor in music. If you know the raaga and taala, great, but if you don't, it shouldn't matter, as good music should appeal to everyone. Music should be able to connect emotionally, whether you know music or not.\nYou have your solo projects, you tour the world, play with your parents, have a band with your sister and teach at SaPa. How do you prioritize everything?\n(Laughs) Good question. It changes from day to day. I'm lucky that I get to do different things, which is why my life is never boring. All the things that I am doing are related to music and each of them kind of helps the other. Whether I am playing a classical concert or making music for SubraMania, it helps the other. Many of my collaborations have helped my music and that goes into teaching at SaPa.\nWhat can we look forward to from you in the near future?\nApart from touring, Bindu and I are releasing another single in a couple of weeks. It is a piece that we composed for a flamenco guitarist when we toured Spain . Apart from that, we started a TV show recently for SaPa to promote kids in a non-competitive environment. In a way, it's an answer to reality shows. The idea is to teach music to very young children who have no exposure and get great artistes to come on the show and talk about different kinds of instruments. Reality shows put too much pressure on kids; children are at the top of their game when they are eight, and by the time they are nine, the next kid comes in. Where do they go from there? So, the idea of our show is not to create eight-year-old prodigies, but to have good musicians even at the age of 25; basically, create sustained musical growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:47:05.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
