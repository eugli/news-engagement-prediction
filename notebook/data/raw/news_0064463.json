The video, recorded last Friday in the crime-riddled Michoacan state city, shows the criminals taking just 40 seconds to corner, grab and kidnap the woman. Then they're gone, leaving her Mercedes sitting empty in the street. Scroll down for video Kidnapped: The video, taken from security footage in the city of Urapan, Mexico, shows a group of men pulling up in front of a woman's white Mercedes. One jumps out in front of her Panic: The woman panics and stops her car, at which point the men surround her, trying all of the door handles, until they get the door open and drag her from the car The kidnappers' white Jetta, which has been lying in wait on the road, pulls out suddenly in front of the woman's car and one of the men jumps in her way. Had she sped on anyway, she might have been free - but she stops instinctively, at which point three others surround her car, trying the doors and dragging her out of the vehicle. She is shoved roughly into their white car, which then takes off down the street. At the same time, a black car is seen pulling away, but it isn't clear whether it was also involved. The security camera video, which went viral on social media, was initially said to have been filmed in Cuernavaca, in the state of Morelos.
