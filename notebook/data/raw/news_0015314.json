lead to the Amalfi coast: walk past sleepy villages, pebble beaches and remarkable views Credit: Pierre-Jean DURIEU - Fotolia Trisha Andres 14 January 2016 • 12:00am \nWalking holidays are the antidote to the pressures of modern life. There is no real goal or to-do list other than to wend your way from A to B at your own pace, typically against a scenic backdrop. There is real benefit in booking a tour, whether it’s self-guided or fully escorted. With your walking routes arranged, accommodation and flights booked and luggage transfers organised, with most meals included, the only thing you will need to remember is your walking shoes. \nBelow, I’ve selected the 10 best walking holidays for 2016. France , Italy and Spain , with their varied terrain and enduring appeal, feature heavily on the list. There are also walks in Switzerland , Portugal , Greece , South Africa and Costa Rica , which offer varying difficulty levels. However, most holidays in the selection are what we might call leisurely; even those which include challenging routes offer easier alternatives. After all, a relaxing ramble is the best way to take in the scenery. \nNine of the tour operators I’ve recommended specialise in walking holidays, while one focuses on adventure holidays to more far-flung destinations. 1.
