We already heard some basic details about the Nokia 5 and now the whispers of the Nokia 3 have reached us. \nNokia 5 will allegedly cost 200, while the Nokia 3 will be 50 cheaper. Supposedly, youll get the same 5.2 720p screen and a similar (even identical?) camera setup - 13MP main, 5MP selfie. Same amount of RAM too, 2GB, and 16GB of storage. \nThe only noticeable downgrade is the chipset - from Snapdragon 430 to 425. Its a pretty major change, mind you. Even though their model numbers are quite close, the Snapdragon 425 has half the CPU cores (4x Cortex-A53) and a much older GPU (Adreno 308 vs. 505). \nThat (if true) will make the Nokia 3 a strictly entry-level offering, though the price suggests something a bit higher up the pecking order.
