Mindbogglingly, calling a Prosecco 'extra dry' actually means it's quite sweet \nIf only there was some way of helping out, using up all those lone little creme eggs before their sell-by dates run out. \nYou want to buy a Cadbury’s Crème Egg six pack but don’t know how to justify the extravagance so far away from actual Easter. \nWell, my friend, help is at hand – for both you and those poor crème eggs. \nBecause someone – at last – has invested a Scotch Crème Egg .

Then you melt a load of milk chocolate and dip your brownie ball in it before covering in sprinkles or cocoa powder.
