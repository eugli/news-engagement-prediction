READ: Deportation does not mean 'treating men like criminals', NGOs tell PM \nHis announcement came just hours before a planned protest over the detention. \nThe nine were originally in a group of 33 arrested in November for deportation to Mali, reportedly as part of an EU initiative. \nThe sudden arrest, which came a few weeks before the Christmas festivities, shocked the migrant community. \nIn December, Gianluca Cappitta – a lawyer at Mifsud and Mifsud Advocates – filed a constitutional case that challenged the validity of the deportation of these nine men, who have been resident in Malta between two and eight years. \nDr Cappitta told this newspaper that it was actually the men’s compliance with the law, which requires the renewal of their migrant document every three months, that had resulted in their turning up at the police station where they were arrested. \nAsked at the press conference whether the Malians deserved an apology, the minister said this was not a question of owing anyone an apology. Malta's action was in line with EU agreements with five African states to accept back their nationals. \nAn identification mission from Mali, including Frontex officials came to Malta on December 5 and these nine were identified as being from Mali. Their documents were therefore still being awaited, the minister said. \nIn view of the delay, the cabinet had decided to free the men from detention. « Lou Bondì earning €22 hourly for consultancy 'PN leader was weak with Toni Bezzina' - Zammit Lewis » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=95731158787&n=226c36c8' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=95731158787&n=226c36c8' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
