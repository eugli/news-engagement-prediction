He has never participated in branch general meetings,” former branch secretary in the Madibeng region, Christine Malula, said. \nShe did not know the former Eskom CEO and said he was never a member of the ANC in Madibeng’s ward 29. \nMalula was a secretary of the branch when Molefe is said to have applied for and renewed his ANC membership. \nShe was speaking hours after regional leadership, members of the ANC Youth League and members of the ANC provincial executive committee produced what they said were Molefe’s membership forms. \nThis followed questions about Molefe’s membership in the ANC. Tshwane regional secretary Paul Mojapelo said Molefe was still a member in good standing in Irene. He said any branch or province could nominate a member to go to Parliament. \nLast week, Parliament released a statement announcing that Molefe would become an MP following a nomination from the ANC North West. \nThe branch Malula previously led rejected this and said it knew nothing about Molefe. Malula claimed the chairperson of the branch, Bethuel Mmutle, was not a legitimate leader. \nMalula said the forms the ANC North West produced to prove Molefe was an ANC member were not legitimate. \nMolefe was in contact with the Gupta family, according to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s “State of Capture” report. He announced his resignation from Eskom on November 11, 2016, to take effect on January 1 this year. \nANC leaders said Malula was no longer a member of the party and had been campaigning for the Forum for Service Delivery during the 2016 municipal elections. She refuted these claims. \n“I am still a member in good standing of Ward 29 Madibeng region,” she told News24. \nParliament said Molefe would not be sworn in on Wednesday, ahead of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan’s Budget Speech. The ANC in Parliament initially said he would be. \nsubmitted via MyNews24 . Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
