Despite having just a single shot on targetâ€”that with which Raggett scored minutes from full timeâ€”manager Danny Cowley's side scythed into the last eight, via The Times Video: The Times Video @TimesVideo Lincoln become the first non-league side to reach quarter-finals of the FA Cup since 1914. Watch all highlights from 17:15 on @thetimes app https://t.co/HcYWLDCOCa 2/18/2017, 3:23:36 PM Burnley boasted a majority in possession and the bulk of shots on goal, but their inability to convert said chances ultimately saw the Clarets pay the price and bow out of the competition under glum circumstances. BBC Sport shared footage of the Imps deservedly celebrating in their changing room after the result, pointing out the fifth-tier side need just one more win to book a place in Wembley's semi-finals: BBC Sport @BBCSport One game away from Wembley! Check out the keeper! ðŸ˜€ This is why we love the #FACup - what an achievement from Lincoln City https://t.co/JP34R5ZX2J 2/18/2017, 4:45:58 PM Chelsea endured a painstaking first half in their trip to Molineux, where the two teams went in scoreless at the break, but goals from Pedro and Diego Costa saw the Blues into a lead tho help book them a place in the next round. Wolves deserved plenty of credit for the fight they put up against top-flight opposition in front of their own fans, but Willian's inch-perfect cross to Pedro meant the Spaniard continued his recent spurt in scoring form, per OptaJoe: OptaJoe @OptaJoe 7 - Pedro has scored seven goals in his last 10 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions. Ahead. https://t.co/FIaJ5A2pdY 2/18/2017, 7:01:56 PM Costa seized upon an unfortunate defensive error from the hosts inside their own box late on to double Chelsea's advantage, sliding the ball inside goalkeeper Carl Ikeme's far post to put the result beyond doubt. Lincoln didn't register Saturday's only upset, either, as Premier League champions Leicester City failed to capitalise upon Millwall defender Jake Cooper's 52nd-minute red card and were beaten 1-0 at The Den. And like Lincoln, Millwall waited to strike late as Shaun Cummings bundled his way through the Foxes' defence in the 90th minute to ensure the Championship will be represented in the last eight, per BT Sport: BT Sport Football @btsportfootball 2/18/2017, 5:15:25 PM Manchester City weren't as fortunate and couldn't unearth a breakthrough in their trip to Huddersfield Town, despite outdoing their hosts with 15 attempts on goal compared to the Terriers' eight. The Citizens will have an unwelcome replay fixture added to an already hectic schedule as a result, although manager Pep Guardiola told the media he was never expecting an easy ride, per BBC Blue Tuesday: Blue Tuesday @BBCBlueTuesday \"I think the objective is so tough, it's not frustrating.\" #MCFC Pep has his say after 0-0 draw at Huddersfield. ðŸŽ§ https://t.co/BVXsqUfStC https://t.co/XtkI4kf7AF 2/18/2017, 5:22:02 PM Middlesborough were at least able to uphold some Premier League prestige on their end, however, as Stuani contributed a late winner to end Oxford United's impressive comeback attempt from 2-0 down. Leadbitter and Gestede put the north-east hosts two goals to the good before Chris Maguire and Antonio Martinez pulled the League One side level, only for Stuani to bury their quarter-final hopes with a close-range strike four minutes from time.
