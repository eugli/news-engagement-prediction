As passengers fled the bus, Baker continued stabbing and mutilating the body before he was arrested.\nHis medical team has said he has been a model patient and understands the need to continue to take anti-psychotic medication.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1999 that a review board must order an absolute discharge if a person doesn't pose a significant threat to public safety.\nThe ruling added there must be clear evidence of a significant risk to the public for the review board to continue imposing conditions after a person is found not criminally responsible.\nManitoba Conservative member of Parliament James Bezan, who represents the Selkirk area, said Baker's request for a discharge should be denied.\nRelated Stories Man who beheaded Greyhound bus passenger seeking discharge: family High-profile cases in which individuals were ultimately released Man who beheaded fellow bus passenger wins right to live on his own", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:40:37.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
