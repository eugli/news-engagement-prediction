Photo: Matt Bedford \nThe bishop, 55, told the commission ordained ministers have too much power in the Catholic church and too little accountability. \nThe lack of women and lay people in leadership positions in the Catholic church has contributed to the high proportion of child sexual abuse allegations , Bishop Long told the inquiry. Advertisement \n\"The marginalisation of women and the laity is part of this culture of clericalism that contributes not insignificantly to the abuse, sexual abuse crisis,\" he said. \n\"If we are serious about reform, this is one of the areas that we need to look at.\" \nThat reform could include giving lay people more power over their parish priest, the commission heard. \n\"The laity have no meaningful or direct participation in the appointment, supervision and even removal of the parish priest,\" Bishop Long said. \"I think that needs to change.\" \nBishop Long, who was installed as Bishop of Parramatta last year, told the inquiry the hierarchal culture of the institution needed dismantling. \n\"As long as the bishop has the backing of the Pope, he's safe,\" he said. \n\"As long as the priest has the backing of his bishop, he's safe. There's no accountability that reaches downwards or outwards and that's the critical problem.\" \nBishop Long, who received a round of applause from observers in the hearing room, said Pope Francis was \"leading the way\" in addressing the power imbalance in the Catholic church. \nSix bishops and archbishops from around Australia gave evidence at the 11th day of the hearing, which is examining factors behind alleged child sexual abuse in the Catholic church. \nArchbishop of Canberra and Goulburn Christopher Prowse told the inquiry revelations of widespread abuse claims have \"been like a bushfire going through the Catholic church or a tsunami effect, on faith and people's trust in us\". \nWhen asked by commissioner Andrew Murray whether he would demand \"no more secrecy; no more cover-up\" from Pope Francis, the Archbishop responded: \"If I had the opportunity, most certainly.\" \nArchbishop Prowse said the church was trying to \"work more transparently with government agencies\" in responding to child sexual abuse. \n\"The gravity of the sex abuse is really starting to dawn on us and we can see that we simply don't have the resources on our own to cope properly with this. And even if we did, it's not appropriate,\" he said. \nThe hearing, before Justice Peter McClellan, continues.
