Brian Vigneault died while playing World of Tanks during a 24-hour streaming session. (Facebook) \n\"We were telling him, 'Go to sleep. The stream can wait,' \" she told AP. \nVigneault, who used the online name Poshybrid, died last Sunday while participating in a marathon gaming session, broadcasted via Twitch.tv, for charity. \nVigneault told viewers that he would play World of Tanks for an entire day to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \nHowever, 22 hours into the session, Vigneault got up for a smoke break and collapsed.

Vigneault was pronounced dead at the scene. \nAlthough Gebauer had concerns about Vigneault during his session, she told AP that she thought her friend took enough breaks to prevent blood clots from forming. \n\"I have a hard time believing that streaming for so long was the cause of his death specifically,\" Gebauer, who's done 24-hour livestreams herself, said. \n\"But at the same time, it wasn't good for him,\" she added. \nA Virginia Department of Health spokeswoman said Vigneault's cause of death is still pending. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:21:49.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
