Visit La La Land’s Los Angeles or the Kolkata that you saw in Lion. Here we list four locations that are inspired from the movies that may win the Academy Award for the Best Picture this year. travel Updated: Feb 22, 2017 08:50 IST AFP, New Delhi You cannot watch La La Land without falling in love with Damien Chazelle’s Los Angeles.(Facebook/La La Land) \nFrom Los Angeles, where Damien Chazelle’s La La Land was poetically shot, to Kolkata, the backdrop that Garth Davis chose to film Lion, this year’s Oscars nominations for the best picture give moviegoers major trave goals. \nSince the locations where these critically-acclaimed films were shot make for fantastic travel destinations, we give you a lowdown on how to navigate through your movie dreams. \nKolkata, India \nMovie: Lion directed by Garth Davis Exploring Kolkata, India, where Lion was partially filmed. (Istock) \nDirected by Garth Davis, this true story of a young Indian boy fostered by an Australian couple treats viewers to landscapes in India and Australia. While the Tasmanian capital, Hobart, and Melbourne, in the state of Victoria, are good options for a trip to Australia, the child’s search for identity also takes moviegoers to the heart of authentic, rural India, on location in the city of Kolkata. \nVisitors can take in the local architecture, stroll over Howrah Bridge — crossed by millions of Indians every day — and admire the reflection of the trees in the water surrounding Victoria Memorial. \nLos Angeles, California, USA \nMovie: La La Land directed by Damien Chazelle LA’s La La Land locations include The Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park. (Istock) \nThis Oscar favourite, with no less than 14 nominations, pays homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and 1950s with a romantic tale that takes viewers on tour of Los Angeles. The movie was filmed at no less than 40 different locations in the City of Angels. \nOne iconic setting, seen on the movie poster, shows a spectacular view over the San Fernando Valley. Scenes were also filmed at The Lighthouse Cafe, a club where legendary artists such as Miles Davis previously performed. Note that this nightclub is no longer a jazz club, and now plays salsa, reggae and country music. \nThe Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park is also a must for visitors following in the footsteps of Mia and Sebastian. In addition to must-visit LA filming locations, visitors to the city can enjoy a trip to Universal Studios, a stroll along Hollywood Boulevard and a trip to Beverly Hills. \nManchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, USA \nMovie: Manchester by the Sea directed by Kenneth Lonergan Head to Cape Ann, Massachusetts, for the Manchester by the Sea experience. (Istock) \nThe American town that lends its name to this feature film is like a character in its own right in the movie’s narrative. However, the film’s main scenes were filmed a few miles away in Cape Ann. Still, moviegoers can rest assured that some movie scenes were also filmed in Manchester-by-the-Sea, as well as Gloucester, Essex, Rockport and Beverley. \nThe nearest major US city is Boston, an hour’s drive away. A trip to this former colonial city should include a stroll around the stylish neighbourhood of Beacon Hill, plus some chill-out time in the USA’s oldest public park, Boston Common. Other sights include Trinity Church and a student-led tour of Harvard. \nSydney, Australia \nMovie: Hacksaw Ridge directed by Mel Gibson Mel Gibson filmed Hacksaw Ridge in the region of Sydney. (Istock) \nThe historical war movie directed by Mel Gibson was filmed in the region of Sydney, New South Wales, where the battlefields of the Second World War were recreated. In fact, the production team set up in Goulburn, around 121 miles southwest of the stunning Australian city, famous for its iconic opera house. Scenes were also filmed in Bringelly and Richmond on the outskirts of Sydney. \nFor a first trip to the Australian city, must-visits include The Rocks, a historic part of town previously inhabited by the first British settlers. Head to the Central Business District — or CBD — to visit the Sydney Opera House, Hyde Park and the Sydney Tower Eye for 360° views over the city.
