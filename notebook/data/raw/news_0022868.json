Brexit: All you need to know \nThe row occurred after the MP for Gordon raised a point of order. \nHe said: \"It is quite clear that the honourable member had not resumed her seat, Sir. Being in the chair accords you many privileges but you cannot reinterpret the wishes of an honourable member who is on her feet.\" \nMr Hoyle responded: \"As the chair I have the right to make decisions on this House. What I would say is quite rightly when I wanted to bring her in [Joanna Cherry MP], which I did ... I certainly don't expect advantages to be taken of the chair on the agreements that I make.\" \nReferring to the Brexit Bill, he said: \"It is a very serious matter, it is so serious that I want to hear what the minister has to say.\" Image caption SNP MP Alex Salmond raised a point of order while deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle was in the chair Image caption Lindsay Hoyle: \"As the chair I have the right to make decisions on this House.\" \nEarlier, Mr Salmond claimed the debate on legislation to allow Theresa May to start formal Brexit talks was being rushed through the Commons. \nSNP and Labour MPs had reacted angrily after just one vote was held on the first group of amendments to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill . \nFormer shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said there had been a \"knife in proceedings\" to curtail debate and the opportunity for MPs to vote. \nDeputy speaker Natascha Engel replied: \"The deputy chairs and clerks spent a very, very long time looking at every single amendment in detail, looking at every single group in detail over a period of three days, and we came to the decision that we would put the lead amendment to a division and then we would move on to the second group.\" \nMr Salmond, also raising a point of order, said: \"There is no challenge to the chair in any of these points of order but honourable members are entitled to point out that this programme motion is railroading debate on the biggest constitutional decision facing this country for 50 years.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:57:09.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
