Pin \nAt Brash & Sassy, a tired Victoria tells Billy the concert was good and hands him a t-shirt as thanks for getting the tickets. They discuss the Jabot/Fenmore’s merger. Billy knew about it from Phyllis, who works with Lauren. He’s sure Jack cornered Lauren to force the deal. They speculate on Jill’s reaction. Billy makes a blowing up noise. Vikki needs Billy to help her launch the next weapon in their arsenal. Soon, Billy is shirtless and she’s spraying him with cologne as they try to pick their next signature scent. Vikki nuzzles into his chest – she likes the second one. \nIn the Chancellor mansion, Cane and Jill discuss the situation with Fenmore’s, and Colin suggests she walk away from this battle. Jill will not. Cane backs up Colin before leaving. Colin continues to try and talk Jill down from making Jack an offer. A red flag goes up for Jill – she demands to know the real reason he doesn’t want her to pursue this deal. Colin wonders how much more success they need to acquire and at what personal cost – it’s the time in their lives to savor the finer things together. Jill believes they can do both. Colin warns her not to make any decision out of spite; life is too short. \nIn Jack’s office, he makes a speech to Ashley, Ravi, Phyllis, Lauren, and some others about the merger. He ignores a call from Gloria. Jack instructs Ravi to work with Phyllis, and the others to help Lauren with the transition. Lauren and Ashley establish they are looking forward to working together. Jack assures Phyllis she will be treated professionally. By the elevator, Phyllis tells Lauren it’s hard to trust that Jack is sincere. Lauren updates her on Jill, and Phyllis urges her to work things out. \nMore: Y&R’s Ray Wise (Ian Ward) in Twin Peaks miniseries \nAt the Club bar, Gloria leaves a message for Jack to call her back immediately. Nearby, Devon and Neil discuss filling Lily’s position. Talk turns to Hilary’s on-air apology. Devon admits it was the last thing he expected. Neil wonders if it changed things for him. Devon says he’d be nuts to give Hilary a second chance. Neil opines that love makes you nuts. Devon admits he always thinks about her. He tells himself taking her back would be the worst possible thing, and wishes he could believe it. Later, Jill meets with an attorney at the bar– she wants him to use every legal resource to get the Fenmore’s stores back where they belong – to her. Suddenly she has an idea. \nIn Jack’s office, he is talking to Ashley when Gloria calls again. He abruptly says he’s in the middle of something and hangs up. He and Ashley bicker – she insists he needs to put Jabot first. Jack reassures her. In Ravi’s office, Phyllis introduces him to Lauren, who tells him to focus on Fenmore’s app fulltime – Ashley will adjust. Meanwhile, Gloria enters Jack’s office and tells him to clear his schedule. They adjourn to the break room, where Glo reminds him he promised her a job. Jack can’t help her. Glo hollers at him to figure it out. He dismisses her. Gloria follows him back to his office and gets up in his face. “I will not be ignored!” Elsewhere, Ashley finds Phyllis bouncing on an exercise ball in Ravi’s office and lays down ground rules. Ash won’t let her monopolize Ravi, who listens as Ashley calls him her right-hand man. \nRelated: Comings and Goings for B&B, Y&R, GH, and Days for January \nHilary arrives at GC Buzz, where Mariah fills her in on the positive feedback from yesterday’s show. Hil is still waiting for her to accept her apology. Mariah thinks the apology was for Devon’s benefit. Hilary claims she’s just glad to have cleared her conscience. Mariah isn’t buying it, but Hil insists she learned a hard lesson with everything that happened. Mariah decides she believes Hil wants to change. Later, Devon arrives and tells Hilary he was impressed by her apology. \nCane arrives at Brash & Sassy where Victoria is smelling Billy’s neck, and asks if they can try to keep things professional. Bickering ensues, as Cane is still feeling left out of decisions. Billy unbuttons his shirt so Cane can smell him too. Later, Jill arrives with an offer for the three of them to buy Brash & Sassy from Chancellor – she needs to free up some cash. \nLauren arrives at the Chancellor mansion looking for Jill, and Colin invites her to chat. He tells her he’s on her side and wishes Jill would accept the merger, though Lauren could have handled things with more sensitivity. Lauren is surprised he’s being so reasonable. “What are you expecting in return?” Colin claims he wants nothing and only cares about Jill. Lauren awkwardly thanks him. \nNext on The Young and the Restless: \nBilly says to Jill, “You already know what you want to do with the money.” Jill grins. “Oh you’re damn right I do!” \nVictor tells Victoria she built Brash & Sassy from the ground up and should own the whole damn thing. “Buy it!” \nGloria, through gritted teeth, informs Jack, “I have the right to talk about whatever I want to.” Ashley appears. “What the hell am I interrupting?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:33:20.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
