Don’t you think the public will have something to say about that outcome when the negotiations end? I think they will,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme.\nMany people were having “collywobbles” about the prospects for Brexit, he insisted – despite polls suggesting voters have not changed their minds since last June.\nBut Elizabeth Truss, the Justice Secretary, dismissed Lord Mandelson as a “blast from the past” who was “trying to frustrate the will of the people”.\nTheresa May has made cutting immigration her ‘red line’ in the Brexit talks, by ending freedom of movement of EU citizens – raising expectations that numbers will fall.\nBut Lord Mandelson said: “We're going to see less trade, you're going to see Britain paying through the nose for the access that we want to negotiate.\n“But you're also going to see, broadly speaking I suspect, the same number of migrants coming to this country as now - partly because already half of the migrants don't come from the EU, they come from the rest of the world, and, in the case of those who come from Europe, we need them to fill jobs in our economy.”\nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill reaches the Lords tomorrow, when up to 150 peers are expected to try to speak in an initial two-day debate.\nLord Mandelson said he was confident an amendment will be passed to give 3m EU citizens in the UK an immediate, unilateral guarantee that their rights will be protected after Brexit.\nHe also forecast success for an attempt to ensure Parliament is given a decisive vote on any final deal that the Prime Minister secures – and, crucially, if she fails to agree one.\nIn the Commons, Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, claimed victory when ministers conceded a vote before the European Parliament starts its consideration, probably in late 2018.\nBut the assurance was verbal only – and could leave Parliament with an unwanted ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ choice, which would see Britain crash out of the EU with no deal if Ms May’s is rejected.\nLord Mandelson said peers wanted to “reinstate” a proper meaningful vote at the end of the negotiations kick-started by the triggering of Article 50.\nThe Government lacks a majority in the Lords, with 252 Conservatives among the 805 peers - giving the opposition and independent crossbenchers a chance to inflict defeats.\nAsked if there will be a long parliamentary battle between the Commons and Lords over the Bill, Lord Mandelson said: “At the end of the day, the House of Commons must prevail because it is the elected chamber.\n“But I hope the House of Lords will not throw in the towel early.”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a6kJzXfgh_._eyf4mJob9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/9245183e4fbea72bb66072098292e13b"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:22:04.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
