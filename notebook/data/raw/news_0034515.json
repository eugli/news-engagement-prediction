Get it straight, @WAGV . #2A \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 13, 2017 Ask gun control activists on #SJR14 what mental eval or due process protections SSA uses when stripping seniors of #2A rights? \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 13, 2017 @DLoesch zero. There isn't one. \n— Michael P. White (@micksemperpater) February 13, 2017 \nAnd that’s a problem. #SJR14 rolls back dangerous Obama exec order that allows SSA to deem beneficiaries unfit to exercise #2A . Zero due process. \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 13, 2017 Again, lie. Bill undoes EO that targeted SSA beneficiaries’ gun rights just for receiving financial management. https://t.co/amlr8b4pYN pic.twitter.com/42F9OmjpDc \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 14, 2017 \nProgressives usually claim to be for due process, but if gun rights are involved, that changes the equation. Imagine the backlash if similar legislation were proposed that could deprive people of their voting rights based on vague criteria provided by the Social Security Administration. \nTwitchy’s well-armed sister site Bearing Arms covered the controversy over SJR14 again Tuesday.

Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) will vote for SJR14. In a statement posted on his website, Manchin explains, in part: \nThis potential overreach by the Social Security Administration is a blatant infringement on the Second Amendment rights of millions of Americans. The assumption by the SSA that seniors and individuals with certain disabilities are a threat to society is both inaccurate and misguided and should not be grounds to revoke someone’s constitutional rights. @DLoesch So funny, even the far left ACLU opposes this gun ban, not to mention numerous mental health activist groups \n— Light Tac LLC (@LighttacLLC) February 13, 2017 \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:58:08.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
