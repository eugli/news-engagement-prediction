His next court date has not been set. \nWright, an accountant, was charged with a hate crime and criminal damage to property for allegedly placing two swastika stickers on the front doors and smashing a front glass window at the Chicago Loop Synagogue, 16 S. Clark St., in the early hours of Feb. 4. \nAt his bond hearing earlier this week, prosecutors said Wright was turned in by a tipster who described him as a local white supremacist who had Nazi paraphernalia outside his Pilsen residence. \nFingerprints taken from the swastika stickers matched those recently taken from Wright for a pending aggravated assault and disorderly conduct case in Elmhurst, prosecutors said. There were also three small cuts on Wright’s hand. \nThe tipster mentioned that Wright was known to drive a Toyota 4Runner. The tipster also said Wright was a “skinhead” and provided authorities with the license plate of the SUV, according to Wright’s police report. \nWright lives in the 2000 block of South Loomis but is also associated with addresses in Oak Brook and Elmhurst, prosecutors said.
