Maybe some portion is implanted on the moon, and some portion is lost into interplanetary space ,” the lead author of the study, Kentaro Terada, explained to The Atlantic . \nThe finding raises the possibility that the moon may hold samples of the earth’s atmosphere dating back billions of years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:30:25.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
