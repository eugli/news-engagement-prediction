Graham Mills told of his \"anger and frustration after the ruling (Lucy Young) \nBut following a two-year legal battle the Court of Appeal last week ruled in her favour, increasing the payments to £1,441. \nMr Mills, 50, told the Standard of his “anger and frustration” after the ruling and has called for a time limit on maintenance payments so that divorced couples can “move on”. \nHowever in an interview with the Mail on Sunday , Mrs Mills defended her position. \nShe said: “I feel like I have been through a character assassination, both at the hands of my ex-husband and the public. \n“They’ve said I’m a gold digger. It’s not true. I’m nothing of the sort. Ex-husband told to support wife for life after she blew £230k payout \n“I genuinely believe women get the rough end of the stick after divorce. They have to juggle working and bringing up the family. Whereas men can just focus on themselves and their career.” \nMrs Mills revealed that she had no wish to go court, but it was her husband who brought the initial court action when he sought to reduce his maintenance payments so he had more money to spend on his new wife and child. \nThis was despite the fact the part time beauty therapist claims she got a bad divorce settlement following poor legal advice. \nAfter they married in 1988 the couple set up a joint company, the successful surveying company Mr Miller still runs today, each owning 50 per cent. \nShe said: “I should never have allowed myself to let go my directorship, shares in the company, pensions and life insurance.” Businessman’s fury as judge orders him to support his ex-wife for life \nShe also dismissed claims her financial situation was the result of a series of poor business decisions. \nShe told the Mail on Sunday: “Just look at the figures. In the years since my divorce I bought a home in Weybridge in Surrey in 2002 for £345,000 and sold it in 2006 for the same price. \n“I bought another in Wimbledon in 2006 for £323,000 that I sold a year later for £435,000 and I paid £520,000 for my final home in Battersea. \n\"I sold it two years later for £580,000. Do these figures look like someone who made “poor financial decisions” or “unwise” property investments? I didn’t make a loss on any of them.” \nShe added it was a \"whole series of problems\", including her own poor health, that devastated her finances.
