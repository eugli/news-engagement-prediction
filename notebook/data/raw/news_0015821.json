By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated:  38 am Parliament to debate Budget, E Ahamed among others. \nCongress MP K C Venugopal and Revolutionary Socialist Party MP N K Premachandram moved an adjournment motion in Lok Sabha over E Ahamed’s death before House proceedings began on Monday. Speaking to news agency ANI, Premachandran said, “Gave adjournment motion in Lok Sabha. Hospital staff showed grave disrespect and announcement of his death was delayed.” \nUnion Minister Venkaiah Naidu claimed that the Opposition is trying to politicise the issue and that the Government is ready to address it when raised. “Govt will answer if issue raised. They are trying to politicise it. Doctors did their best; don’t understand what is the issue?” Naidu said. \nTriple talaq might also come up for discussion as the Law Ministry on Sunday revealed that Muslim organisations across the country are also not in favour of the way it has been practiced. Naidu appealed to political parties to not link the government’s stand on the issue with the assembly elections in five states. “Request political parties not to link it with votes. Government will present its view when matter comes up before Supreme Court,” Naidu said. \nLIVE UPDATES:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:12:04.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
