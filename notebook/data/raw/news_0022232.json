However, witnesses who recorded the deputy’s Facebook post shared it , including his name, along with their dissatisfaction with the punishment, on social media. \nBoyd County Sheriff Bobby Woods learned of the Facebook post in late January and told WSAZ that he does not condone the offensive comment, adding that every Boyd County deputy goes through sensitivity training. \nThe suspended deputy will be subject to review by the Deputy Sheriff’s Merit Board, “ which is the equivalent to a Civil Service Board ,” Woods told WSAZ. \nBrian Hewlett, an attorney for Boyd County’s Department of Public Advocacy, said in a news release that he was “ saddened and deeply troubled ” by the offensive comment, according to The Daily Independent. \nAlthough the deputy was suspended without pay for more than three weeks, some people don’t think that the punishment is enough and are calling for his dismissal.
