Massively groovy, it showed that he could do mysticism as well as funk. Prince's Love Symbol Album 9) Girls & Boys \nThe best track from his Parade album, this song is built around a sax hook so deep and dirty that it should come with a health warning. 8) Purple Rain \nP roving his guitar-playing capabilities as well as his song-writing abilities, this ballad has become an anthem. 7) 1999 \nS till the party song to end all party songs, even though it's now 17 years since it was last apt and there are 984 years until the next millennium. 1999 cover artwork A2Z3AwMzE6Iu6fqDM47MHeVuEVCTZi47 6) Raspberry Beret \nF rom 1985's Around The World in a Day, this is Prince at his catchiest best. Musically it's perhaps his most '80s' track. Lyrically it evokes vintage shops and young lust. Raspberry Beret 5) Gett Off \nT he highlight from 1991's Diamonds and Pearls album, this deeply funky, dirty track featured the immortal line '22 positions in a one night stand'. Arguably, his last great song. Prince Gett Off cover artwork 4) When Doves Cry \nI ts spare rhythm belies its sheer danceability. The 'she's never satisfied' backing vocal line is belted out by listeners whenever they hear it. 3) U Got The Look \nHis rocky duet with Sheena Easton from Sign O' The Times was raunchy pop at its best. U Got The Look cover artwork 2) Sign 'O the Times \nA ddressing everything from AIDS to natural disasters, this 1987 track showed Prince's political edge. Its opening 30 seconds are as distinctive as anything on pop music. Sign 'O the Times 1) Alphabet Street \n1988's Lovesexy album was among Prince's finest works. It's lead single was a majestic slice of uplifting funk-pop.
