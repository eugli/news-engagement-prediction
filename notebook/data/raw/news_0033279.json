A new champion crowned - but for how long? \nIt was advertised ahead of RAW that Bayley would be given a rematch for the Championship, and a second chance to fulfil her lifelong dream. \nSIGN UP NOW \nHow long will Bayley hold the Championship for?

Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time \nDespite the similarities to Sasha Banks' three title wins in 2016, the moment was still one celebrated by the fans in attendance. \nBayley has been a lifelong WWE fan and has been the victim of ridicule at the hands of Charlotte in recent weeks for her lifelong fandom. \nShe was able to silence the queen on RAW but it came with the aid of the former champion Sasha Banks following the interference by Dana Brooke. \nBrooke hasn't been seen on RAW for several weeks but came out just when Charlotte needed her as Bayley had her locked into the Figure-4-leglock. \nBanks would take out Brooke and assault Charlotte while she had Bayley in the figure-8 without the referee seeing. \nBayley would deliver the Bayley-to-belly suplex and pick up the win - earning her first title reign on the main roster. \nA big night for Bayley but one that WWE fans could be forgiven for feeling like they have seen before. \nThe title change now almost guarantees that Bayley and Charlotte will meet again at Fastlane where once again Charlotte will put her undefeated PPV streak on the line. A long road ahead \nFastlane is the final stop on the Road to WrestleMania and for the Women of RAW, it could be the biggest turning point before the big night in Orlando. \nBayley has been expected to be in the Women's Championship picture since her debut on the main roster while Charlotte hasn't left the title picture since capturing the Diva's Championship back in 2015. \nThe role of Sasha Banks is the big question however as she could prove to be the wildcard at both Fastlane and WrestleMania. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
