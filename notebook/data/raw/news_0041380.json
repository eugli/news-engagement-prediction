They also have to provide the passbooks issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) against the cars. \nAccording to customs officials, 16 World Bank officials brought as many cars of different models in 2006, 2007 and 2009. They have left the country but had not provided the required information on their cars. Initial investigation revealed that they had handed the cars to persons who are not considered as privileged ones, without paying the duty as per the rules.\nOn Feb 16, the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) wrote to the World Bank country director asking for details of the 16 vehicles. \nThe CIID move to investigate the alleged irregularities of the World Bank officials coincides with a High Court rule for trying those who had made 'false graft allegations' over Padma Bridge project. \nThe global lender was asked to withdraw its funding request by Bangladesh government after a stink over corruption allegations. \nRecently, a Canadian court published a verdict acquitting three business executives of charges that officials of a Canadian firm had planned to bribe Bangladeshi officials to get contracts in the Padma Bridge prroject. \nCIID Director General Khan said earlier if a privileged person sells such cars to a non-privileged party and takes the money out of the country, he or she will face charges of evading duty and laundering money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:06:22.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
