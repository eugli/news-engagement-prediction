Poobalan and T. Vasantakumari, making their way up to the Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani Hilltop Temple with their three-month-old twin daughters was a journey they had looked forward to for years.\nVasantakumari, 36, said they had been trying to have children for the past six years.\n“I made a vow two years ago that if I conceived, we would bring our child here to seek blessings and give thanks to Lord Muruga.\n“Last year, we were blessed with twins, which has brought us double the joy,” said the teacher when met at the temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga yesterday.\nPoobalan, 38, said as it would be difficult to go up during the actual Thaipusam celebration on Thursday because of the crowd, they decided to come a few days earlier and fulfil their vow.\n“We also brought our mothers along; we wanted to make sure that it would be an easy journey for them,” said the technician.\nPoobalan and Vasantakumari from Kepala Batas, who carried their twins on a makeshift sling suspended from stems of sugarcane, were among the hundreds of devotees who took part in the annual prayer session organised by the Malaysia Hindhudharma Maman­dram Penang branch.\nIts president V. Nanda Kumar said the prayer session was held to offer devotees, especially the elderly, a chance to fulfil their vows without having to deal with the large crowd expected during Thaipusam.\n“We want to teach the younger devotees about the essence of Thaipusam as well and we invited children from the Penang Shan Home for a talk, to teach them the meaning of the celebration,” he said.\nHe urged devotees not to spend too much money on coconuts and milk, and donate the money to charity instead.\n“Traditionally, only one coconut needs to be broken for the chariot to move forward.\n“Devotees need not carry a big paal kudam (milk pot) as a small one is already enough to fulfil their vows,” he added.\nNanda Kumar said devotees should be mindful when discarding their rubbish and help clean up during the celebrations.\n“We should work together to make sure the roads are clean.\n“Food should not be wasted as well as I have heard that many discard the food packets given to them at the thaneer panthals (refreshment stalls),” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:03:32.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
