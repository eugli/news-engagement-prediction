These traps are not only cruel, they are illegal. Wild boars, or any animal, caught in the traps end up suffering very painful and debilitating injuries which may result in death. \nLuckily, we managed to get to this dog in time, thanks to the good hearted people who alerted us to the dog’s plight and our dedicated rescue officers who made multiple attempts before finally catching the elusive dog. \nWhile slightly wary of people, he has been slowly warming up to the staff who have been caring for him and tending to his wound. We are glad he is recovering well and that, in this case, he will probably not be losing his leg. Other animals caught in traps have not been so lucky. \nWe are currently investigating this case of suspected illegal trapping. If you have any information on poaching activity going on in Singapore, please call the SPCA’s hotline at 6287 5355 ext 9 or email Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
