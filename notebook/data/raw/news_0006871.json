The next day she found out she was pregnant with their second daughter.\nGeorgia’s life was turned upside down; emotionally, of course, but also financially because Jon had been the main breadwinner, while Georgia was on maternity leave from a part-time job.\nFortunately a colleague told her about bereavement benefits, to which she would be entitled as a result of the National Insurance payments Jon had made over his lifetime.\nGeorgia Elms, with her two daughters Daisy and Scarlett\n‘They amount to around £500 a month and help me to pay for the day-to-day things I need to bring up my daughters,’ says Georgia, who is chairman of the charity Widowed and Young .\n‘We had prepared for the worst and had life insurance, but although that pays off the mortgage it can't buy things you need to bring up children like school shoes.’\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Who should you get to write your will - and what do you need to put in it? Yet, vital as they are for families in their time of need, the government plans to slash these payments for those who lose a loved one as part of an overhaul of bereavement payments and allowances from April this year.\nThat comes despite the payments being based on the National Insurance contributions of the dead parent.\nThe cut could amount to £31,000 for the hardest-hit families, and over £12,000 for the average working widowed parent.\nInstead of getting support until their youngest child leaves school, widowed parents will now get support for just 18 months.\nBereaved families where the couple was unmarried will continue to receive nothing at all.\nGeorgia Elms with her daughters Daisy and Scarlett at a summer wedding\nSome people will see their payments rise, most notably married widows under the age of 45 with no children.\nThe changes are mooted as a modernisation; the government says the current system has undergone little update since the original bereavement benefits were introduced in 1925.\nMinister for welfare delivery Caroline Nokes says the current system could be ‘unfair, complex and also act as a trap preventing people from moving on with their lives’.\nBereavement experts disagree, and say that children grieving for a dead mother or father need all the support from the surviving parent that they can get - and financial help can make a world of difference here.\nThe new system is designed to focus on helping people immediately after they are bereaved, but not to help families who have suffered a fall in income as they now have just one earner.\nHowever, charities that support widows and children who have lost a parent say that the changes could make life even tougher for families who have suffered a bereavement.\nAlison Penny of the Childhood Bereavement Network says: ‘We know that children’s grief often takes a while to emerge, and they often face new challenges two or three years down the line.\nIt’s vital that their mum or dad have the flexibility to be available to children 'It’s vital that their mum or dad – who are coping with their own grief too – have the flexibility to be available to their children.’\nShe adds that government research shows that most bereaved partners either stay in or take up work within 18 months of bereavement.\n‘The last thing we should be doing is interfering with that by putting them under pressure to find work or face sanctions.’\nFurthermore, bereaved families tend to have considerably higher childcare costs as it becomes the full responsibility of the remaining parent, who must also work to support the family as the sole breadwinner.\nDifficult times: The new system will focus on helping bereaved families immediately after the loss of a loved one - but all payments will cease after 18 months\nWhat are the changes being made? There are three types of payments available to bereaved spouses and civil partners.\nThese are paid for out of the National Insurance contributions of the deceased. Only the partners of those with a certain National Insurance record will receive the full benefits.\nIn many cases the deceased will have paid tens of thousands of pounds in National Insurance contributions, payments which they would have benefited from later in life with a state pension.\nHowever, since they will never receive the state pension, the bereavement payments allow the deceased’s family to claim a small portion of this when they are likely to need it most.\nAll three types of payment are set to undergo major changes under the new rules.\nBereavement Payment\nThis is a tax-free lump sum, currently worth £2,000. This amount will be more generous, increasing to £2,500 for those without children and £3,500 for those with children.\nIt is hoped the sum will help bereaved families with the initial costs such as for funerals. The cost of a basic funeral has risen for the 13th consecutive year to £3,897 on average, according to SunLife Insurance.\nBereavement support groups are concerned that while the cost of funerals has been rising steadily and is likely to continue to do so, there are no plans to increase any of the bereavement payments in line with inflation.\nWidowed Parent’s Allowance\nThis is currently a taxable weekly benefit of up to £112.55 per week, depending on the National Insurance contributions of the deceased. It is paid until the youngest child no longer qualifies for Child Benefit, the claimant remarries or moves in with a partner, or reaches state pension age.\nThis allowance will be cut to £350 a month for those with children and will be given for 18 months only.\nBereavement Allowance\nUnder the current system, this is a taxable weekly benefit of between £33.77 and £112.55 per week paid for 12 months to a surviving spouse or civil partner with no dependent children, and aged between 45 and state pension age. The higher the age of the surviving spouse when bereaved, the higher the weekly rate.\nThe changes will mean that surviving spouses or civil partners with no children will receive £100 a month for 18 months, regardless of age.\nYounger grieving spouses and civil partners without children will get monthly support for the first time.\nTax changes\nThe new payment will now not be taxed, and will be subject to a disregard in the calculation of means-tested benefits and the benefit cap. The government says this will help those on the lowest incomes by providing extra cash at a time when it is needed.\nWho will be better and worse off? The majority of claimants are likely to be worse off under the new system.\nThose who are likely to lose the most are those with young children who could have claimed Widowed Parent’s Allowance for up to 20 years under the current scheme, but now will be able to do so for a maximum of 18 months.\nMeanwhile those aged under 45 with no children will receive monthly payments for the first time. Those aged over 45 with no children will be supported for 18 months instead of the current 12 months.\nWhen will the changes take place? Anyone claiming under the current system will not be affected. Anyone who is bereaved after April 6th this year is likely to be.\nWhat about unmarried couples? Bereaved parents and partners who were unmarried are not eligible for any of the benefits.\nCharities that support bereaved children had hoped that since the changes were labelled a ‘modernisation’ of the current system, they may be changed to acknowledge children born out of wedlock.\nAs many as 47.7 per cent of all babies were born outside marriage or civil partnership in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, and this proportion has been rising steadily.\nThe Childhood Bereavement Network argues that: ‘Children themselves have no influence over whether or not their parents are married or not, so it seems harsh to deprive some of financial support following a parent’s death based on their parents’ marital status’.\nEligible: The bereavement payments will be extended to married couples or those in civil partnerships, but not unmarried couples - even those with children\nLast year, This is Money spoke to Claire Harris , who was just 34 when Gary, her partner of 16 years, died of cancer, leaving her to bring up three young children alone.\nThe family was shattered; by the loss of a partner and father, and having to come to terms with another realisation – a fall in income from £60,000 a year to barely enough to scrape by.\nClaire and Gary did not realise that their relationship would not be recognised for bereavement payments, leaving Claire unable to claim support from the National Insurance Fund that she so badly needed.\nYoung family: Claire and Gary's children were just 10, 11, and 14 when Gary died of cancer\nThe Child Bereavement Network estimates that 53 per cent of people cohabiting with a partner believe wrongly that living together for some time brings them the same legal rights as if they were married: the stubborn myth of the ‘common law’ marriage.\nThe charity claims that this myth may not be helped by the fact that both parents have equal financial responsibility for children, whether they are married or not. Support such as child benefit is calculated on the income of both parents, and should parents separate both are required to pay support. However, the same rules do not apply in the case of the death of one parent.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions says: ‘Marriage and Civil Partnership confer legal rights and responsibilities on individuals that cohabitees do not have.\n‘Allowing the surviving members of cohabiting couples to have access to bereavement benefits would significantly increase complexity and require extensive proof of cohabitation which could be both difficult and intrusive for the bereaved person to establish. For example, this would require the Government to provide a legal definition of a ‘couple’, including determining the period the individuals had been together to be classed as a ‘couple’.’\nIt estimates that extending the benefits to cohabiting couples would cost around £75million a year.\nHowever, extending them only to those with children would cost considerably less than this.\nThe Work and Pensions Committee, a group of MPs who looked into bereavement benefits, last year called on the government to extend the benefits to unmarried couples with children, although not to those without.\nIt calculated that the cost would be just 4.7 per cent of the forecast expenditure in 2020/21, which could be paid for from the savings made from the new reforms.\n'The needs of bereaved children of cohabiting parents are no different to those whose parents were married or in a civil partnership,' it said. 'Penalising children on the grounds of the marital status of their parents is unjust.'", "external_links": ["https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/"], "published": "2017-02-02T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:39:45.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
