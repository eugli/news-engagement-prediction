John Fannon is planning to appeal the ticket (Photo: Coventry Telegraph) \nBut Mr Fannon, from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, said: \"We plan to appeal the ticket if we can’t get it sorted out any other way. \n“My initial reaction was disbelief. I thought ‘what have I done wrong?’ We have never had a problem there before. \n“If we had parked way out of the space when it was busy, it might have been a reason to give a ticket. But the entire row was empty, it doesn’t make sense, it’s silly. \n“The level of the fine doesn’t match the misdemeanour.\" Read More Feel you've been hard done by over a parking ticket?
