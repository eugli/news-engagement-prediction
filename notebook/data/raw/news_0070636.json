Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRichard Hadfield has fired back at his former Collabro bandmates and accused them of LYING over his decision to go solo. \nJamie Lambert opened up to Mirror Online and insisted there was no hard feelings or bad blood between the group - completed by Michael Auger, Thomas Redgrave and Matt Pagan - and Richard, who they said left to pursue a solo career. \nHowever, the soul and jazz star has denied this is the case, and said the band \"know [this] isn't true\". Richard Hadfield has responded to the boys' comments (Photo: Forza Supplements) \nResponding to Mirror Online, he said: \"Due to a contractual disclosure agreement I am not allowed to discuss what really happened but I can assure you I am far happier in the direction I am going and that I am no longer subject to the politics and manipulation that took place during my time in Collabro. \n\"I did not leave to pursue a solo career. Leaving the band was a huge risk. I had 12 months of confirmed work with the band not to mention the awesome support across the country but after the events that took place it just wasn't worth it. I wanted to be happy again. He's had his say (Photo: Forza Supplements) \n\"Now, 6 months down the line I know I couldn't have made a better choice. I've lost 4 stone , I have several brand endorsements and to top it all off I'm about to sign a new record deal! I've already begun writing with some incredible producers who have worked with the likes of Michael Jackson, Shakira, Shirley Bassey and the Fugees to name a few.\" \nIt comes after Jamie said Richard was pursing his own solo career as the group were discussing a third album deal, and he has now insisted \"something had to change\". Collabro insisted there is no bad blood \nJamie said: \"It was not an uncomfortable thing, we've refrained from talking about it out of respect for him, it's not been reciprocated, but at the end of the day we do wish him the very best and this album is by far the best we've ever made and that's not because Richard's not in the group any more and not vocally, it's because we've been able to work together as a four.
