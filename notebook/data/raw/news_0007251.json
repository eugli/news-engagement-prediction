All three acts performed during the World Cup. \nMr. 305 and J.Lo sang the official 2014 World Cup track \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" at the opening ceremony in Brazil, while Shak performed at the closing concert singing \"La La La.\" In 2010, the Colombian singer performed \"Waka Waka\" in South Africa. \nAnd since Super Bowl halftime performers are known to bring out special friends to join them onstage -- last year Coldplay brought out BeyoncĂŠ and Bruno Mars and the year before that Katy Perry featured Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz -- the possibilities of who these Latin superstars would invite are endless. \nRicky Martin and Fat Joe or Christina Aguilera . Shakira with Maluma and/or Rihanna. Daddy Yankee featuring Snoop Dogg and Fergie -- just to point out a few collabs that can potentially happen on the stage. \nBelow, vote for which Latin artist you'd want to see perform at the Super Bowl. If your top choice isn't on the poll, add your personal favorite in the space provided. \nRicky Martin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:30:51.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
