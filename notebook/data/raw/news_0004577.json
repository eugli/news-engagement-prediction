He’s not shy about calling Trump’s ban a “religious litmus test” targeting Muslims. The order contains a provision prioritizing Christians from the seven nations listed for entry into the U.S. He’s also worried about the impact to local college students. The University of South Florida has 123 potentially affected students . Economic development strategies in the region largely target access to a talented, skilled and educated workforce. Buckhorn is standing tough against what he sees as a dangerous step. “The larger issue is the message it sends. I think it becomes a recruiting tool for terrorists,” Buckhorn said. “I’m going to use my pulpit to send the message that Tampa won’t tolerate hate.” Buckhorn is meeting at the Islamic Society of Tampa Bay for a prayer session at 2 p.m. Last Friday, Trump signed the order banning travel to the United States from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The result over the weekend was chaos as people who were already in the air when Trump signed the order were detained at airports nationwide. Protests erupted in airports and cities worldwide. From an economic perspective, Trump’s order could have implications on tourism. The order barred nearly 218 million people from entering the U.S., according to CNN . Visit Tampa Bay estimated that in 2015 tourism in Hillsborough County pumped $5.6 billion into the local economy . Janelle Irwin is a reporter for the Tampa Bay Business Journal.
