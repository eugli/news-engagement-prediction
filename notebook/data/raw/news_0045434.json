For safety and security purposes, the IDOC does not discuss details concerning the placement of offenders who are transferred under the terms of the Interstate Compact Agreement,” Illinois Department of Corrections spokeswoman Nicole Wilson said in an email. \nIn 2013, Peterson was sentenced to 38 years in prison for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. While in prison for that crime, he was convicted of trying to hire a fellow inmate to kill Will County State’s Attorney James Glasgow, and was sentenced to an additional 40 years in prison. \nPeterson, a former Bolingbrook police sergeant, has been named a suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, in 2007, but has not been charged in that case. \nAs authorities were investigating Stacy’s case, they also reopened the investigation into Savio’s death, which originally was ruled an accidental drowning. A new autopsy later ruled Savio’s death a homicide, and Peterson was convicted of her murder.
