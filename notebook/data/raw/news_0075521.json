Call me.\"\nWell @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq\n— Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017\nIn a video clip accompanying the tweet, Jenner added: \"You can still fix it.\"\nLetters from the Justice and Education departments late Wednesday notified the Supreme Court and the nation's public schools that the administration was changing its position on the issue, reversing former President Barack Obama's instructions that public schools must allow transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their chosen gender identities.\nThe new guidance is on hold for the time being, because a federal court blocked the Obama policy shortly after it was issued last May.\n© Caitlyn Jenner attends the Moschino Spring/Summer 17 Menswear and Women's Resort Collection during M... Made LA: Moschino Show Trump appeared to side with LGBTQ activists during the presidential campaign, saying in an interview on TODAY that the North Carolina bill restricting the restrooms transgender youth could use was causing economic \"strife\" and was unneeded because \"there have been very few complaints the way it is.\"\n\"People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble,\" Trump said last April.\nTrump also said Jenner could use whatever restroom she wanted if she visited a Trump property. She later took him up on the offer — using the women's restroom at Trump Tower in New York.\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://t.co/XwYe0LNUOq", "http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/caitlyn-jenner-takes-trump-his-offer-uses-bathroom-trump-tower-n564306", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhOEL?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhOEL?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;768&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;432&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/b5193f47-6", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhOEL?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhOEL?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;768&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;432&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnhOEL%3focid%3dsl&title=Caitlyn+Jenner%27s+message+to+Trump%3a+%27this+is+a+disaster%27&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnhOEL%3focid%3dsl", "http://rmb.reuters.com/rmd/rest/xml/item?id=tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_OV64VX8IZ:1&entityMarkupField=all&token=tO55qum7XNCviyV0Z4Yq000vL9VFyikjyfbfQ+HdRaQ=&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://www.nbcnews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhzC1.img&quot;}}", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnhOEL?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnhOEL&lang=en-us&flow_id=71c8f137-4019-452d-ae14-0937a4a60762", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB5LlM8.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnhOEL%3focid%3dst&text=Caitlyn+Jenner%27s+message+to+Trump%3a+%27this+is+a+disaster%27&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnhOEL%3focid%3dst", "https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/834935434144731136", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/b5193f47-6ce8-48ed-9fd7-7fc3762082fb/1a9199f9-1a7f-435e-b012-aaefd321441c.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:20:39.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
