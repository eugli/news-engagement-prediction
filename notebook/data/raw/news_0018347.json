Both players have been unable to train in preparation for the 2017 NRL season as a result of surgery at the end of 2016 and the inability to receive medical clearance to train. \n\"Manly Sea Eagles are working with the management of both players to give them the farewell they deserve in front of their thousands of adoring fans at Lottoland.\" \nThe Sea Eagles are already prepared for life after Stewart having groomed Tom Trbojevic as his successor during the past two years. \nTrbojevic, considered a NSW Origin bolter in 2017, has followed in Stewart's footsteps scoring 18 tries in his first 32 NRL appearances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:09:11.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
