Article continues below \nAs for downgrades, Claudio Bravo, Nicolas Otamendi and Bastian Schweinsteiger, through a combination of poor performances and a lack of game time, have seen their ratings decreased. \nNot everyone can be given a winter upgrade, of course, but there were a few more players who definitely deserved one. Article continues below \nHere are seven players who EA should have given ratings boosts to. JAMES MILNER \nJames Milner has been brilliant for Liverpool this season and deserves even more credit for how he's seamlessly adapted to left-back under Jurgen Klopp. \nMilner is currently an 81-rated midfielder on FIFA 17 and warranted a left-back card rated 82. HUGO LLORIS \nAlready rated 88 on FIFA 17, Hugo Lloris isn't exactly desperate for an upgraded card. \nHowever, the Frenchman has been fantastic for Tottenham having conceded just 18 league goals, suggesting he should be rated the same as Thibaut Coutois on 89. GABRIEL JESUS \nOkay, so he only made five appearances for Manchester City before breaking his metatarsal, but three goals during that time is a phenomenal return. \nBased on initial showings, Gabriel Jesus should be rated somewhere nearer to 80 than 78. ROMELU LUKAKU \nRomelu Lukaku's omission from the winter upgrades list particularly riled FIFA 17 gamers. \nBar Alexis Sanchez, no player has scored more goals than the Belgian (16) in the Premier League this season. He deserves to be 85 rated. MOUSA DEMBELE \nThe second Tottenham player on this list, Mousa Dembele has been consistently brilliant in the heart of Spurs' midfield this term. \nZero goals and zero assists this season tells it's own story, but his strength, dribbling and creativity suggests an 83 rating would be more suitable. RYAN BERTRAND \nSouthampton's Ryan Bertrand has been one of the Premier League's best left-backs this season yet, somehow, he's only rated 79. \nIf Danny Rose deserves a new 81-rated card, so does the 27-year-old. DAVID LUIZ \nDavid Luiz is already 84 rated on FIFA 17 but, based on his incredible performances this season, he should arguably be rated 85 or 86. \nInconsistency has always been the Brazilian's issue yet he's been a rock at the back for Chelsea under Antonio Conte. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
