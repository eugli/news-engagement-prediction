Whenever one of the women is about to confess some deep, dark secret to the leading man on The Bachelor , we typically assume they're about to divulge that they were married before. Or have a kiddo at home. Or had some sort of tragedy happen in their past that they are still trying to come to terms with. And that's why we couldn't help but have a \"say what?!?\" reaction tonight when Raven told Nick Viall that her ex never made her orgasm. (Talk about anti-climactic.) \nGood grief! Let me get this straight -- she dated the dude for a whole 10 years, and not once did he manage to give her the big O? Gah. No wonder she never bothered saying, \"I love you\" to him. (I mean ... 10 years?!?) \nAnd while you gotta give Raven mad props for putting it all out there and being open and honest with Nick, who else thinks her plan most likely backfired miserably as far as the fantasy suite is concerned? \nThink about it for a second. It would put enough pressure on a guy to tell him that you'd only slept with one other person -- but then to go so far as to tell him that the sex totally sucked? Um ... no pressure. (Not even a little bit.) \nAnd since when it comes to The Bachelor , the whole fantasy suite date thing usually means there's a pretty decent chance of some serious \"fiance type stuff\" happening, Raven basically (albeit unknowingly) told Nick that she was ready to get down to business, but that he'd better freakin' deliver so she doesn't wind up two-for-two in the \"OMG I didn't have an orgasm\" department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:37:48.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
