MacRumors obtained a note from the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who writes that Apple is developing wireless charging features for three iPhones to be released in 2017.\nKuo doesn’t say exactly how Apple plans to implement wireless charging. The company already uses wireless charging for the Apple Watch, so it’s very possible we’ll end up seeing something similar to that — it’s the kind of wireless charging we’ve seen on Android phones for years. But Bloomberg reported last year that Apple is working on “cutting-edge” wireless charging tech that may be able to power devices at a distance, so there’s some possibility Apple is looking to do more.\nThe iPhone might see some big changes this year Though he doesn’t seem to touch on it in this note, Kuo has previously laid out what he expects from the three different iPhone models. All three will receive a new design, with Apple returning to a glass front and back for the phones. Two models are expected to succeed the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, maintaining the models’ 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD displays. And the third model will be a higher end device, with a 5.8-inch curved OLED display.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:56:12.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
