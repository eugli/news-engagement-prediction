Many of the clothes that people now consider work-appropriate incorporate sports-inspired materials, like spandex, Lycra, and other synthetic fibres. It’s combining two trends that have dominated American casual clothing — durability and comfort — in a versatile way. \n“Styling is evolving to merge business casual and sportswear into one,” Clemente said. “Durability of sportswear and the versatility of business casual — put those two things together, and who’s not going to want to buy it?” \nAmericans are being drawn to athleisure in larger numbers every year. In 2015, while the whole of retail sales were flat for the year, sales of athletic wear were up 12%, according to Fortune . Facebook/Lululemon \nDesigners tend to agree with Clemente’s observations. Todd Snyder, the former head of menswear at J.Crew and the founder of his eponymous label, told Business Insider that he thinks athleisure is an “evolution,” as opposed to a trend or fad. \n“Guys have changed the way they dress,” Snyder said. “[Athleisure] is not going to go away for at least 10 years.” \nWhile athletic wear was created for a specific use — sports or athletics, obviously — athleisure clothing isn’t. And it’s this versatility that has attracted many consumers to the category. It can be worn in most offices and social situations without causing anyone to bat an eye. It’s also generally more durable, with properties like wrinkle and odor resistance incorporated into its tech-infused fibres. \n“People want less maintenance of their clothes,” Clemente said. “Technology is such a pervasive part of our lives. To want it in our clothes is simply natural.” \nClemente added that the shift to athleisure might be emblematic of larger cultural trends in America, including the widespread shift to a focus on health and fitness. \n“The clothes fit the culture,” Clemente said. “That’s true of any fashion trends.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:22:27.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
