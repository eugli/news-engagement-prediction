The bus, belonging to Royal Cruiser , left with passengers for Asansol at 7.30am. This is the city's first hybrid bus that runs on ethanol or diesel or a blend of both. \n\n\"Bringing Scania to Kolkata is part of our commitment to environment-friendly sustainable transport solution. We are running Scania successfully in north India. We have plans to increase its number in our long-distance fleet,\" said Royal Cruiser managing director Dhananjoy Singh after flagging off the bus. This bus will ply between Kolkata and Asansol regularly. Singh also rolled out free Wi-Fi in all long-distance buses. Significantly, this bus is designed and manufactured keeping in mind Indian cycle of seasons and road condition. \n\nScania has a 400-million climatic wind tunnel at the Scania Technical Centre in Sodertalje, Sweden, enabling trucks and buses to be operated in simulated climatic conditions.The air channel system can produce snow and rain of various types and intensity, and the fan can simulate everything from a -35°C arctic wind to a50°C desert storm. It can generate blazing hot sun to freezing snowstorms - all in a week.This helps the company to assess the impact of the changing environment on the bus and its impact on the environment. \n\n\"It is a cruise capacity bus with much greater horse-power engine. Its beauty, of course, is climate sensitivity and almost zero-emission combustion system. Scania has some 20 years of experience in developing vehicles that use alternative fuels such as ethanol within the framework for sustainable mobility, de-carbonizing public transport , bio-fuel agenda and smart cities,\" said the chief restructuring officer of Royal Cruiser, Gautam Banerjee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:30:18.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
