Directed by David Ayer, the fantasy thriller stars Smith as a LAPD cop teaming up with an orc, played by Joel Edgerton, to protect a magical wand. \nClocking in at 30 seconds, the new teaser doesn’t give away too much else about the plot. It begins with Smith driving around the city, which might be on the verge of chaos given the high police presence in the street, as “This Land Is Your Land” plays. But, then the song cuts out and we’re shown a flurry of images featuring fantastical creatures and Smith wielding a rusty sword. \n“I’m assuming this doesn’t end well,” says Smith at the end of the clip. \nWatch the clip below. Bright is due in December. Fantasy has become reality. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton star in Bright, only on @netflix . pic.twitter.com/FJueEhMFCO \n— Bright Film (@BrightNetflix) February 27, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:22:35.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
