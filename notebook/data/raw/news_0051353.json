Between the medical bills, child care and college tuition, it’s a wonder parenting hasn’t gone the way of the wet nurse. Fortunately, the government offers some fairly generous tax breaks to help ease the financial burden. It’s up to taxpayers, of course, to take full advantage of them — and in some cases this can be difficult, since it may involve figuring out which breaks are more beneficial than others.\nThere are a few things parents should understand. First, most child-related deductions and credits are available whether families take the standard deduction or itemize deductions. Second, there’s a difference between deductions and the more coveted tax credits. Don’t confuse the two. A deduction, such as the college tuition and fees deduction, merely decreases taxable income. A tax credit, such as the child-tax credit, allows taxpayers to subtract the amount dollar for dollar from their tax bill, or add the amount to their refund.\nThe most generous tax breaks come with income limits. The tax credits in particular are geared more for middle- and lower-income families. If you don’t qualify for a credit or deduction, you can still save money by setting aside pretax dollars in flexible-spending accounts for medical and child-care expenses.\nHere’s a brief summary of the most common tax breaks available for parents. Some of the rules can be complicated, to say the least; when in doubt, consult a tax adviser.\nDeductions Exemptions. Let’s start with the basics. Every member of a household potentially counts toward a tax-deductible exemption on the family tax return. For 2016 and 2017, each exemption equates to a $4,050 deduction. So a married couple with two kids qualifies for four exemptions totaling $16,200 in tax-saving deductions. That is significant!\nTuition and fees. Helping a child pay for college? Uncle Sam will cut you some slack. In 2016, parents can deduct up to $4,000 in tuition expenses and mandatory enrollment fees provided their modified AGI doesn’t exceed $130,000 for married couples or $65,000 for single parents. That deduction gets cut in half to $2,000 for married couples making between $130,000 and $160,000, and for single parents earning between $65,000 and $80,000. The deduction is wiped out entirely for those with higher modified AGIs. Parents should also note that the college tuition and fees deduction can’t be used in conjunction with the higher-education credits, which we will discuss later. Note that this tax break expired at the end of 2016, and its fate for 2017 and beyond is uncertain.\nStudent-loan interest. Even if parents set aside money for their child’s college tuition, chances are they’ll still need to borrow money. Thankfully, a portion of qualifying student-loan interest (loans from family, for example, don’t count) is also tax deductible. The IRS allows parents to write off up to a maximum of $2,500 in loan interest. For 2016, this deduction phases out for married filers with modified AGIs between $130,000 and $160,000 and for single filers between $65,000 and $80,000. For 2017, the phaseout ranges are $135,000-$165,000 and $65,000-$80,000, respectively. The only rule here is that students must be enrolled at least part time in a degree program to qualify.\nTax credits Child-tax credit. In a parent’s eye, a child is priceless. However, Uncle Sam puts the figure at $1,000, in the form of a tax credit. And unlike some other credits and deductions, the government doesn’t limit how many children qualify. So if you have four little darlings under the age of 17, expect to get $4,000 wiped off your tax bill.\nLike most credits, this one also has income restrictions, but they vary depending on how many children parents are claiming. The child-tax credit starts to phase out at modified AGIs that exceed $110,000 for married couples filing together, $55,000 for married filing separately and $75,000 for single parents.\nChild and dependent care credit. Two-income households with children under 13 years old qualify for a dependent-care credit to help cover child-care expenses. The IRS allows working parents and those looking for a job (students and disabled parents also qualify) a credit of 20% to 35% on expenses up to $3,000 in child care for one kid and $6,000 for two or more kids. This translates into a maximum credit of $1,050 for one child and $2,100 for two or more kids.\nThe credit for parents earning more than $43,000 shrinks to just $600 for one child and $1,200 for two or more kids. Higher-income taxpayers should set aside pretax dollars in an employer’s flexible spending account instead. We’ll talk more about these later.\nAmerican Opportunity higher-education credit. There are two higher-education education credits. The American Opportunity credit is to help pay for an undergraduate college education. It is worth up to $2,500 per student per year. To qualify, the student must be in his or her first four years of college. (There is no limit on the number of children who can qualify in any given year.) This credit phases out for married joint filers with modified AGIs between $160,000 and $180,000, and $80,000 and $90,000 for single parents.\nLifetime Learning higher-education credit. The Lifetime Learning credit is less restrictive than the American Opportunity credit. It covers students who have piled up more than four years of college credit and any other family members taking classes. Here’s the hitch: It can be claimed only once on any given tax return. Some families, however, will be able to claim the American Opportunity credit for one student and the Lifetime Learning credit for another. The latter is worth 20% of tuition and other qualified expenses of up to $10,000, for a maximum credit of $2,000. For 2016, the Lifetime Learning credit is phased out for married joint filers with modified AGIs between $111,000 and $131,000, and $55,000 to $65,000 for single parents. For 2017, the phaseout ranges are $112,000-$132,000, and $56,000-$66,000, respectively.\nAdoption credit. No one said adopting a child would be easy or inexpensive. There’s the waiting game, the agency interviews and the lawyer fees. To help ease the process, the IRS allows new parents an adoption credit worth up to $13,570 for 2017. And if parents adopt a special-needs child, they can take the full credit even if their expenses totaled less than the value of the credit. For 2016, the credit starts to phase out when modified AGI exceeds $201,920 and is completely phased out when AGI hits $241,920. For 2017, the phaseout range is $203,540-$243,540.\nHealth care FSA Whenever possible, take advantage of an employer’s flexible spending account (FSA) program, to help pay for medical expenses. These allow employees to use pretax dollars to cover all out-of-pocket medical costs not reimbursed by a health plan. There are no income limitations, but your contribution for 2017 is limited to $2,600.\nDependent-Care FSA\nAs we mentioned earlier, parents earning more than $43,000 are generally better off signing up for an employer’s dependent-care flexible spending account (FSA) program. Like health care FSAs, these plans allow taxpayers to set aside pretax dollars for child-care expenses. The tax-law limit is $5,000.\nWarning: The only danger with FSAs is that any money that isn’t used up to cover qualified expenses is generally lost (you may be able to carry over up to $500 of an unused health care FSA balance to next year). So budget accurately. And don’t forget to save those child-care receipts.\nDivorce Finally, you may have noticed that we haven’t discussed ways divorced parents can divvy up all these tax deductions and credits. As a rule of thumb, the parent with custody for the greater part of the year (the so-called custodial parent) gets to claim them. Of course, sometimes parents share custody, and this can get a little complicated. Whenever possible, try to work these things out early and have them noted in the divorce agreement. This will save headaches at tax return time.\nThis story has been updated.\nMore from MarketWatch The country with the worst traffic in the world — and it’s not the U.S. U.S. stocks powered to new records by energy shares Apple's stock set for record-high open after Morgan Stanley boost price target", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:05:12.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
