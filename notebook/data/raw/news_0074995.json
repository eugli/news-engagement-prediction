Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. \n\"People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist and thank god I did because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.\" \nIn another political moment, boycotting Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman won best foreign language film â€“ his second win in the category in five years. \nIn a statement read from the stage, Farhadi slammed the Trump government's proposed travel ban affecting seven largely Muslim countries. \n\"My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US,\" he said. \n\"Dividing the world into the 'us' and 'our enemies' categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.\" \nBut those moments were overshadowed by the chaotic finale to the Oscars. \nKimmel looked shellshocked as he signed off as host. \n\"Well I don't know what happened,\" he said. \"I blame myself for this. Let's remember, it's just an awards show. \n\"I mean, we hate to see people disappointed. But the good news is we got to see some extra speeches.\" \nExtra speeches, yes. And the biggest fiasco in Oscars history. \nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:38:38.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
