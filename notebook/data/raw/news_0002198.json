He said four Boko Haram insurgents were killed as soldiers repelled the attack. \nMr. Irabor presented a man he said was a Boko Haram member who had surrendered. \nThe man, who gave his name as Muhammed Abubakar, told journalists that his colleagues amputated his leg and hand when they suspected he was about to leave them. \nMr. Irabor said the fight against Boko Haram terrorists had been won “tactically”, despite pockets of attacks that have continued. \nHe requested the support of the public and the media in ensuring the success of the war. \n“I must say the media has been wonderful in their job as far as this operation is concerned,” he said. \n“We may have one or two issues that we may not agree on, but what has come very clear in our mind is the willingness of everybody to see that things move from where they are. And we have to know that terrorism is all about instilling fear in people. And to overcome that we must ensure confidence building and not promoting fear. As such, we have to make people understand that their security is guaranteed by not giving in to fear.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:17:59.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
