Texas is next with 670. Sex trafficking by far is the most common form of human trafficking across all states, and females comprise the vast majority of human trafficking victims, the Hotline statistics also indicate. \nThe U.S. Fund for UNICEF estimates that human trafficking has victimized 21 million people around the world, including 5.5 million children who are exploited for sex work and in other forced labor scenarios such as sweatshops. There are 1.5 million victims of human trafficking in the U.S. alone. Global human trafficking generates profits in the range of $32 billion for criminals, UNICEF added. \nReacting to Operation Reclaim and Rebuild, the L.A. County district attorney declared that “We will not tolerate the sexual exploitation of children by anyone, not the sex traffickers and not the people who pay to sexually assault them.” \n“ We let everybody know throughout the state that … we’re going to aggressively go after the pimps and the exploiters, as well as the johns and especially the johns that think that they can prey on the minors,” added an L.A. County Sheriff’s Department official. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T07:21:58.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
