According to some eyewitnesses, the teen did not know how to swim and was drunk when he was balancing on the bridge rail. Sued Rocha, the commander of the rescue operation, said that the body was found in the deep part of the river, some metres away from where the boy fell. As the group lark around and chat to Filho a girl appears to lunge forward and touch the youth's leg. He loses his balance and stumbles backwards His arms flail as he plunges down into the river and out of sight. A girl can be heard screaming before the camera is dropped and the recording ends Filho's body was found by firefighters 14 hours later in the river Jamari He added that the body is being studied by a forensics team who will determine the cause of death - although it is believed that he drowned. The unnamed girl from the video who appeared to push him was taken to a police station to be interviewed by authorities, along with other witnesses. The group were later released, but it is not clear whether any charges were brought. The girl claimed Filho had been joking about jumping from the bridge, but when she decided to make a joke and pretended to shove him, he flinched from her mock-push and fell. However, the person who recorded the video told police that the girl knew that Filho couldn't swim and gave the film to police. According to Rocha two of the boyâ€™s friends had jumped from the bridge in a failed attempt to rescue the young man. The investigation is ongoing.
