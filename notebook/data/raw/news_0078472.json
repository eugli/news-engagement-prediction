I can't talk too much about the ceremony but it is something we have been planning for a very long time and I cannot wait,\" Kenny said. Everything you need to know about the lady in the yellow dress at the Metros \nHe explained that he had first popped the question in 2015 in Doha, Qatar but was rejected by his lady. \n\"We were on our way back from London when we had a long stopover in Doha. I knew then that she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and so I slipped away and found a jewellery store to buy her a ring. When we got back to the airport I decided that I wanted to give her the ring as a promise of our getting married. She accepted the ring but said she would not get married until she was finished her studies,\" Kenny said. \nHe asked her several more times over the next few months before he finally got down on one knee again in December and she said yes. \n\"We were in Bangkok last year in a restaurant overlooking the city and this time she finally agreed. We had obviously discussed marriage before but this was the first time that we had agreed on a date. When we returned to SA, we told our families,\" Kenny said. \nHe wouldn't go into details about the ring, only saying that it was a \"nice ring\" and followed a design where two rings join into one. \nHe said that the couple would be holding a white wedding soon but said that they were still ironing out the details. Kwesta is livid with #MMA16 snub: The bullsh*t must be called \nHe was also shy to talk about the upcoming birth of the couple's first child together, only saying that they were expecting a baby boy later this year. \n\"We want to keep the birth quiet. We want to protect out child from the public scrutiny. I have three biological children and many children at my home who I look after. I love kids, that is in my nature, so I was over the moon when I found out that my Nonkululeko was expecting,\" Kenny said.
