Photo: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images An aide to Ben Carson who wrote an op-ed last October accusing President Trump of taking the GOP to “a new moral low,” was fired Wednesday from his position at HUD, where he was preparing for Carson’s likely confirmation this month. Why? Someone found a column ripping Trump, written for the Hill two weeks before the election , and decided that he had to go, the New York Times reports .\nShermichael Singleton, who, the Times says, was “one of the few black conservatives in the Trump administration,” had already apologized for the column. But on Wednesday it resurfaced. Singleton, who was reportedly in line to become Carson’s chief of staff, was told the column was the reason he heard the two words that turned Trump into a TV star: “You’re fired.”\nThe 26-year-old Singleton had previously worked on Carson’s campaign before the retired neurosurgeon dropped out of the GOP primary and endorsed Trump. But even after Carson defected, Singleton remained highly skeptical of Trump. In the column that would eventually get him fired, Quote: :\nWith nowhere to turn, Trump supporters turned to a candidate different from the rest. For many of them, anything that is antithetical to Washington is good, even if it could turn out to be the worst thing for all of us.\nRegardless, the moral fiber of the Republican Party and America as a whole is at stake. That is why I continue to speak up against Trump’s candidacy.\nTags: ben carson president trump department of housing and urban development shermichael singleton HUD Official Hears ‘You’re Fired’ After Trump Criticism Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Trump’s Pick to Replace Flynn as National Security Adviser Turns Down the Job Most Viewed Stories The White House Mole Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression Trump Ends the Presidential Press Conference As We Know It Jared Kushner Takes Trump’s Complaints About CNN to Time Warner Executive Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Donald Trump Thinks He’s Good at Being President Melania Trump Is Reportedly ‘Miserable’ in Her Role As First Lady CoverGirl’s First Spokesman Jokes About Africa Having Ebola Will The Great Wall Make Me Mad?
