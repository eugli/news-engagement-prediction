The garage was then entered and keys for another vehicle were stolen.\nBetween 8 p.m. on January 7  and 10 a.m. on January 8, a window was damaged at a commercial property on Woodhull Road, in Middlesex Centre and access to the interior of the building was gained. Canadian currency was stolen.\nIn the early evening hours of January 13, a window at a rural residential property on Ilderton Road in Middlesex Centre was damaged and the interior of the residence was accessed but nothing was removed.\nIn the early evening of January 15, a window was forced open and access to the interior of a residence on Trafalgar Street, in Thames Centre, was gained. The culprit(s) were interrupted by the resident and fled in an unknown vehicle. A television, medication, and a GMC pickup truck (which has since been recovered) were stolen.\nIn the early morning hours of January 16, an insecure garage and cars therein were entered at a property on Dundas Street, in Thames Centre. Then the culprit(s) damaged a window and gained access to the interior of the residence, where they stole a wallet, and were interrupted by the homeowner before fleeing in unknown vehicles.\nSometime between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. on January 20, culprit(s) accessed the interior of a business through an insecure door at a property on Main Street, in Lucan Biddulph. Canadian currency was stolen.\nIn the late evening of January 23, a fence was damaged, and the interior of a secure compound was entered at a commercial retail business on Hyde Park Road, in Middlesex Centre. Tires and a snow blower were stolen.\nOn the afternoon of January 26, culprit(s) accessed the interior of a garage through an insecure door of a property on Bridge Street, in Thames Centre. No property was stolen.\nIn the early morning of January 29, culprit(s) attended a rural property on Westminster Drive, damaged a window, and gained access to the interior of a commercial outbuilding. Saw blades were stolen. They also accessed the interior of an insecure garage and stole a backpack out of a vehicle parked inside.\nMiddlesex County OPP reminds residents to secure their properties:\n•        The more private an area is, the more likely it is to attract the attention of a criminal – trim trees and shrubs that block sight lines to your windows and doors\n•        Install outside lighting to eliminate dark areas around doors or windows\n•        Criminals easily defeat conventional key-in-the-knob locks. Deadbolts should be installed on all exterior doors\n•        Door kick break-ins are becoming common. To secure a door properly, the screws should be at least 2.5” - 3.5” long\n•        Every entrance way should have a convenient way of clearly seeing who is there without opening it. For most doors this will require the installation of a wide-angle lens peephole or door scope\n•        Glass within 40 inches of a door lock can be broken and a criminal can reach inside to unlock the door. The security of windows can be improved by adding a polycarbonate window film\n•        Most window locks are easily broken. Criminals target sliding windows and double hung windows as they are easy to jimmy open. To prevent quiet entry, drill a downward sloping hole through the top of the bottom sash and into (but not through) the bottom of the top sash. Insert a pin or nail in this hole to prevent the opening of either sash. Casement windows usually have secure latches. Make sure your latches are strong and tight fitting.\n•        Thefts from garages are one of the most common yet easily prevented crimes.  Keep garage doors closed and locked, and ladders in the garage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:44:07.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
