It's twice what it was before President Donald Trump won election last November. I guess while Trump enjoys the idea of mingling with \"regular Americans,\" he doesn't want them to be too regular, let alone average. And anyway what's the point of winning the presidency if you can't cash in on it? (The fiction of Mar-a-Lago as a hotbed of \"regular Americans,\" of course, also utterly belies the risible notion that Trump is some sort of populist.) \nAs I wrote Friday, Mar-a-Lago is in a ground-breaking category of its own in terms of Trump's potential ethical problems and broader habit of treating the government like a subsidiary of one of his businesses. \"Never seen it before,\" says Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush's ethics lawyer. \"Never seen any senior U.S. government official do it that way. ... That's official United States government business [occurring in a place] where people are paying for rooms, paid memberships.\" Trump is keenly aware of the kind of money Mar-a-Lago was making him even before he could brand it as a membership-available branch of the White House. When he crashed a wedding there earlier this month, he said of the happy couple , per CNN's Kevin Liptak: \"They've been members of this club for a long time. ... They've paid me a fortune.\" That same CNN article noted that club members have quickly come to see facetime with the president of the United States and his senior staff as a perk of membership. \nAs Painter says: \"It's pay to play.\" \n\"Pay to play,\" just to be clear, is the sort of behavior that's supposed to be swept away when a politician promises to \"drain the swamp,\" as Trump did during the campaign. But rather than drain the swamp, as I've noted before, Trump seems to be turning it into a federally protected wetland.
