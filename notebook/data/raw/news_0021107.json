You don’t need to work out every day to see benefits.

It builds bone density, and it builds tolerance to more intense exercises at the gyms,” she said. \n“It’s the first prescription in getting healthy.” \nFollow Johanna Leggatt on Twitter @Johannaleggatt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:59:59.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
