Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nChristian Eriksen had a good game and got Tottenham off to precisely the start they wanted with an early goal at Wembley, slotting home from close range after a defensive mix-up from the visitors. \nHowever, the lead lasted barely ten minutes as Gent equalised through a rather comical own goal headed past Hugo Lloris by Spurs striker Harry Kane. Victor Wanyama’s strike gave Spurs hope (Picture: Getty) \nThe first half went from bad to worse for the north Londoners, who went down to ten men in the 39th minute as Dele Alli’s wreckless challenge saw him rightly sent off.
