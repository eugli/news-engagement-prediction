This condition is not transmissible to humans.\n\nThe ministry said it is abnormal to spot bats in the winter.\n\nAnyone who sees one should not touch the bat and should call the ministry. In some cases, they will be transported to a refuge in the Granby Zoo.\nRelated Stories Study: Some bats showing resistance to deadly fungus Scientists look at survivors amid mass die-off of bats", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:15:28.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
