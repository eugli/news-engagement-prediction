What an Obamacare replacement could look like under Tom Price Read more \nThe public has just 20 days to comment on the draft rule change – rather than the usual 30. That is despite HHSofficials’ findings that the proposed changes “could reduce the value of coverage for consumers, which could lead to more consumers facing increases in out-of-pocket expenses, thus increasing their exposure to financial risks associated with high medical costs”. \nBenefits to consumers, the rule argued, would come through stabilized premiums and would prompt insurance companies to remain in the market despite the current uncertainty surrounding Republicans’ plans for the system. \n“I don’t believe that for a minute,” said Linda Blumberg, an insurance policy expert at the Urban Institute, of the supposed benefits to consumers. “The ways it can hurt consumers are multiple.” \nBlumberg and other experts have argued the rule does little to stabilize the insurance market, which she and others said could best be done by recruiting more healthy people to join. \n“These are very much directed toward segmenting the risk pool, segmenting the cost of the healthy from the cost of the sick,” said Blumberg. “This has always been the way insurers most profit. They will make much more money doing that than they will by managing the medical care of a broad diverse population.” \nThe new rule comes amid Republican disagreement over how to move forward with repealing the Affordable Care Act, a seven-year campaign promise from conservatives. Many Republican plans to replace the ACA exist, but none have found a way to stitch together the conservative and moderate members of the party. This is not a rule that puts consumers first – this is just giving insurers a wishlist of what they want Lydia Mitts, Families USA \nOn Thursday, House Republican leaders discussed broad outlines for a replacement for Barack Obama’s signature health policy, which led to 20 million people gaining health coverage. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said that after Congress’s forthcoming weeklong recess, “we intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare”, without giving further details. \nRepublicans Rand Paul and Mark Sanford have proposed legislation that would completely repeal the Affordable Care Act and expand savings accounts that come with tax benefits intended for emergency use. But it is unclear which of their ideas might end up in an eventual GOP bill. \nTrump himself claimed at an eccentric press conference on Thursday: “We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.” \nWithout a unifying plan from Republicans looking to avoid political blame for sowing chaos, the insurance industry has offered ideas to stabilize the markets under threat of pulling out altogether. Donald Trump said at a press conference in Washington that his administration was in the ‘final stages’ of its new healthcare plan.

Many of those same actions appeared in a Blue Cross Blue Shield policy document from 30 January, titled “Moving forward: a health insurance market for 2017 and beyond”. \nThe proposed rule, if approved by the department now headed by the vehement Obamacare critic Tom Price , would have a tangible impact on when individuals can buy health insurance, and what they get when they do. \n“The biggest issue, and what’s most important for people to know, is this rule does nothing to help people get coverage or afford care,” said Lydia Mitts, associate director at Families USA, a left-leaning patient advocacy group. “This is not a rule that puts consumers first – this is just giving insurers a wishlist of what they want, making it harder for people to get the coverage they need.” \nFirst, the period to sign up for health insurance would shorten. Last year, 11.3 million people signed up for health insurance through exchanges between 1 November and 1 January. The proposed rule would shorten that period to six weeks, from 1 November to 15 December.

These are special opportunities to sign up for healthcare offered to people who may have lost a job or become pregnant. \nThird, if a customer’s insurance policy were canceled because the customer did not pay, insurance companies could require full repayment before allowing customers to sign up for a new plan. This proposal, the rule argues, would encourage people to “maintain continuous coverage”. \nBecause the ACA required insurers to offer a set of benefits, the new rule would also allow insurance companies to offer less valuable plans, meaning that out-of-pocket costs would increase, and subsidies could go down. The rule would also lower requirements for the number of some types of doctors insurers are required to have in plans. \n“I’m not privy to what is going on in the administration, but these are things that I think are coming from the insurance industry more than they are from policymakers,” said Blumberg. \n“There seems to be a lot of consistency between the big insurers and the policies that are being promoted by critics of the ACA.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:42:38.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
