(Photo courtesy of MCPO) \nIn line with the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) internal cleansing, the Mandaue City Police Office (MCPO) conducted a surprise inspection on its policemen’s vehicles in coordination with the Highway Patrol Group on Monday morning. \nSenior Supt. Roberto Alanas, MCPO chief, said that the inspection is under the operation called “Oplan Sita” which aims to ensure that all policemen are using vehicles with Official Receipts (OR) and Certificate of Registration (CR). \nThe operation also aims to strictly ensure that the policemen are not using evidence and car-napped vehicles. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Number one na project natin dito ay yung pag-check ng vehicles. Kung ang ating mga kapulisan ay nagsisita ng mga sasakyan sa labas, dapat sila mismo ay may proper documentation. Dapat meron silang OR at CR and at the same time updated ang kanilang registration,” Alanas said. \nThe inspection was the first of the series of surprise inspections that the police office will be conducting. Police stations are also directed to conduct their own surprise inspections. \nMCPO inspected 24 motorcycles and four cars which also included Alanas’ vehicle. \n“So far, compliant naman sila,” Alanas said. \nAlong with the surprise vehicle inspection, Oplan Sita also urges policemen not to wear excessive pieces of jewelry so as not to give anybody the notion that they are living a lavish lifestyle.
