Dave Brat ran into the team at several of his town-halls – of which CNN described as “raucous” and the Washington Post dubbed as “fiery”– all without noting the coordinated efforts by Indivisible team to do and be just that. \nThe Richmond Times Dispatch was more honest in its reporting, and noted many of the angry constituents showing up at these town halls throughout the state of Virginia to protest members were from Indivisible Richmond – Indivisible’s local team – and Together We Will. \nThe Dispatch reported in an article entitled “The women who are up in in Dave Brat’s Grill”: “After the election, a group of former Democratic staffers put together the Indivisible guide for how to approach lawmakers, which openly describes successful strategies used by the tea party movement. \nIt said many of Mr. Brat’s most ardent critics were part of this team. \n“What I’m worried about is that the mainstream press can’t Google ‘Indivisible’ and the Soros-funded movement that is pushing all of this,” Mr. Brat told the The Hill on Feb. 11. \nIndivisible gives its progressive followers nationwide a “practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda.” \nIt takes aim at Congressional members, urging activists to go to local town halls to demand their representatives listen to them, and report out if the member doesn’t. The guide tells the activists to spread out in the room, and to not give up the microphone until they’re satisfied with the answer. \n“Keep the pressure on,” the guide details. “After one member of the group finishes, everyone should raise their hands again. The next member of the group to be called on should move down the list of questions and ask the next one.” \nSo who is funding the organization? That’s a good, and open question. As a recently formed non-profit, it hasn’t had to report out its donors yet. \nEarlier this month, Indivisible told the Daily Signal that George Soros didn’t fund the group. \n“We have received donations from more than 4,000 people since putting a donate button on our site two weeks ago. We think George Soros funds many worthy programs, but he has not funded us. We understand why it’s convenient for Republicans to dismiss widespread popular disapproval as astroturf, but anyone looking at the numbers for the Women’s March and other recent events knows better,” the group told the Daily Signal. \nHowever, many of its members have loose ties to Mr. Soros. \nAccording to Matthew Vadum, senior vice president at the Capital Research Center at least three of the group’s five principals have direct ties to organizations funded by Mr. Soros. \nThe Daily Signal reported , that according to Mr. Vadum’s research: \n“Ezra Levin, a former staffer for Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and his wife, Leah Greenberg, are the president and vice president of the Indivisible Guide’s board, respectively. \nLevin is also associate director of the Corporation for Enterprise Development, an anti-poverty nonprofit. Melissa Bradley, who sits on that group’s board, previously worked for Green for All, a group founded by liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones. She was appointed as a Soros Justice Fellow through the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded. \nGreenberg previously worked for Humanity United, which is funded by Soros’ Open Society Institute. \nThe secretary of Indivisible Guide, Angel Padilla, works for the National Immigration Law Center, which is funded by Soros through his Open Society Foundations. And treasurer Matt Traidi is the research team director for the Service Employees International Union, a major donor to and endorser of Democrat politicians, Capital Research Center notes.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:21:45.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
