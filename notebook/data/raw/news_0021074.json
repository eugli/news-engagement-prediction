Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). \nThree Senate Democratic sources told The Hill that lawmakers will again talk all night — from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning — to vent their opposition to Sessions, who has been accused of making racially insensitive remarks as a U.S. attorney in Alabama decades ago. \nSessions has come under fire as well for his strong stance on immigration — he is a vocal critic of illegal immigration and led opposition to the bipartisan 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. \nSen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, criticized Sessions on the floor Tuesday for call voting rights legislation \"intrusive\" on states' rights. \nDemocrats talked all Monday night and into Tuesday morning to register their concern over Trump's Education pick, Betsy DeVos, who narrowly won confirmation Tuesday afternoon by a vote of 51 to 50.
