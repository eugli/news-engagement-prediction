Ka (in Hindi) is for Congress, Sa for Samajwadi Party and Ba for BSP.” \nKasab was the only Pakistani attacker caught alive after the 2008 Mumbai attack and was hanged in 2012. \nOn Thursday, Mayawati said invoking the Pakistani terrorist in a public meeting reflected on the mentality of BJP leaders. \n“The BJP is aware of the fact that it is on slippery ground in UP and the BSP is coming to power. To cover their desperation, the BJP leaders are making obnoxious comments,” she said. \nTargeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mayawati said, “The people of UP should send the adopted son to Gujarat and elect their own daughter (Mayawati) to lead the state.” Read more Akhilesh Yadav engineered Samajwadi Party feud to help BJP, says BSP leader \nModi had claimed himself to be the adopted son of UP at a rally earlier. \nUttar Pradesh is voting in seven-phase polls with the BJP fighting against a Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance and the BSP. \nA large number of people converged on the rally ground to hear Mayawati who has represented Ambedkar Nagar in Lok Sabha four times (1989, 1998, 1999 and 2004). \nHaving a sizable Dalit population, it is considered a strong fort of the BSP but the party failed to open its account in the district in the last assembly elections. \nOn Thursday, Mayawati was elated over large turnout of women and asked them to serve food to men only after they cast their vote. “The safety of the women and their welfare will be my top priority after BSP forms government,” she said.

They braved odds to attend the rally as they are aware of the fact that their dignity and honour will be protected only under the BSP government.” \n“Rule of law will be enforced in the state and strict measures will be taken to check atrocities on women. The girls and women will able to move freely out of their home after sunset. The criminals will be put behind bar,” she said. \nShe also promised cheap electricity, water and ration to the families below poverty line. “Instead of allowance, the BSP government will give employments to youths,” she said. \nEyeing a comeback, the BSP chief has fielded senior leaders on five assembly seats in the district.
