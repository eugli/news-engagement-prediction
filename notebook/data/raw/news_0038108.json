The trio previously pleaded guilty to multiple charges. \nWilson, the ringleader, and Broughton were described as 'amoral' in court, and having no idea of the difference between right and wrong. Jared Smith \nTwo teens were sentenced in the Hawera District Court on Wednesday for the role they played in a crime spree which saw a car burnt out and a house completely trashed. \nThe offending began in the early hours of November 15, when Wilson stole a car from a Patea address and picked up his two co-offenders. The group then travelled onto Waverley. \nREAD MORE: \nAt a Bear St address in the town, the offenders came across three vehicles parked outside. SIMON MAUDE / FAIRFAX NZ \nPolice had to abandon a pursuit of three teens following a crime spree due to it being too dangerous. \nThey broke into one but could not start it. They then stole a Range Rover and a ute from the address, both valued at $8000. \nWith each offender driving a vehicle, they made their way to Waverley beach. On the way, the Range Rover broke down so it was left abandoned on the side of the road. \nAfter arriving at the beach, Wilson set the Mitsubishi car on fire and it was left to burn, gutting the vehicle completely. \nWilson then drove his associates back to Hawera in the ute. Ad Feedback \nAbout 4.30am, police on patrol in Hawera noticed the trio acting suspiciously and attempted to stop the vehicle. \nHowever Wilson sped off, driving at speeds of up to 80 kilometres per hour through residential streets, which have a speed restriction of 50km. \nPolice continued to chase the three teens as they travelled towards Okaiawa, which is about 12km from Hawera. \nReaching speeds of up to 130kmh, Wilson failed to stop at an intersection and due to the dangerous nature of his driving, police abandoned the pursuit. \nShortly afterwards, the ute crashed into a power pole at the intersection of Opunake and Auroa Rds. \nBy the time police arrived, the three teens had fled. \nThe group ran to a nearby farm house, which was not occupied, and threw a brick through a window to enter. \nOnce inside, the defendants used paint which was being used for renovations to extensively graffiti the house as well as splashing paint over the walls and floors. \nThey kicked numerous holes in the newly-installed gib board as well. \nAfter leaving the house, they broke into a shed and found a quad bike, which they used as a getaway vehicle. \nAs they drove around, the trio stole two more cars. \nAfter alerting police, a group of farmers who had witnessed the offending, gave chase. \n\"They were eventually apprehended and held until police arrived,\" the summary of facts said. \n\"When spoken to by police, all three defendants thought the whole situation was a big joke. They did not show any remorse.\" \nDubbed the \"ringleader\" by Judge Chris Sygrove, Wilson appeared in the Hawera District Court for sentencing on 19 charges, including arson, burglary, unlawfully taking motor vehicles and driving offences. \nBroughton also appeared on Wednesday, but Allen is due to be sentenced next month. Both have pleaded guilty to nine charges each. \nJudge Chris Sygrove gave Wilson and Broughton a dressing down as they stood in the dock. \n\"You two young criminals are not immoral, you are amoral. You have no idea as to what is right or wrong. You don't know the difference,\" he said. \nSygrove said he had been shocked at the scale of the offending. \n\"You had absolutely no concern for others' property,\" he said. \n\"I would be failing in my duty to the Taranaki community if I didn't send you to jail.\" \nHowever, despite imprisonment being sought by the Crown, Sygrove was swayed by arguments made by defence counsel about the defendants' youth and that each had an address suitable for an electronically monitored sentence. \nWilson received a 12 months home detention sentence while Broughton was given six months community detention and a year-long term of intensive supervision. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:21:28.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
