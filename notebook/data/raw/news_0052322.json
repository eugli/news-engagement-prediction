Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday morning, shifting the nation from “a country of aspirations” to “a country of deportation.” Espaillat, the first Dominican-American member of Congress and himself a former undocumented immigrant in the U.S., said the shift in policy by the Trump administration towards tougher enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws could alter the country’s identity. \nStory Continued Below\n“We are a country of aspirations. Are we a country of deportation or are we a country of aspirations? I think that's what's on the table right now,” Espaillat said on CNN’s “New Day” Wednesday morning. “Have we changed the course of America? Are we now a heavy-handed, bullying country, or are we a country that anybody could do anything, including an undocumented young boy that's now a member of Congress.”\nBy today’s standards, Espaillat would have been considered a so-called “dreamer” when he was first brought to the U.S. Born in the Dominican Republic, he was brought to the U.S. by his parents as a nine-year-old boy on travel visas, which the family overstayed. Seeking legal permanent resident status in the U.S., the family returned to the Dominican Republican where they were eventually given green cards, allowing them to return to America.\nWhile Trump’s hardline stance on immigration has proven controversial, the policies he has pursued this far in his presidency match closely with those he promised on the campaign trail. He has already taken early steps towards constructing a wall along America’s southern border with Mexico and on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance memos allowing immigration agents wide leeway to arrest, detain and deport all “removable aliens.”\nAt least since securing the GOP nomination for the presidency, Trump has promised that his top priority would be to deal first with those undocumented immigrants who have criminal records beyond their illegal residency in the U.S. Former President Barack Obama made deporting those with violent criminal records a priority, but the DHS memos released Tuesday expand the scope to include those charged with crimes or who have committed acts that could constitute a chargeable offense.\nEspaillat said he supported the deportation of violent criminals who are in the U.S. illegally.\nLiving in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant has a “chilling effect,” Espaillat said, recalling how his grandparents warned him not to talk to strangers and to be careful where he traveled. He said Trump’s executive orders on immigration have left many in his district, which comprises portions of upper Manhattan and the Bronx, nervous. Some, he said, only leave their homes at night, too afraid to do so during the day.\n“What I find now is that many people are afraid. I hear in my district office, people calling in concerned. They don't know how this new guidelines will apply to them,” Espaillat said. “It unleashes the hound dogs, if you may. It sets fear as a mass deportation guideline that he sets out. You know, it expedites removal. It fractures families.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:35:30.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
