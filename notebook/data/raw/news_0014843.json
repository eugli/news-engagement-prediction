we’ve heard very little from Melania Trump since her husband took office more than two weeks ago. \nMrs Trump has not been seen at many official events, is not living in the White House and is still putting her staff together. \nWhile the President’s daughter Ivanka has maintained a noticeable presence in her father’s company, the First Lady herself has been largely absent. \nSome have questioned what sort of First Lady Mrs Trump will make, while the former model has also raised eyebrows over her decision to delay moving to the White House. \nOthers have pointed out the high cost of Mrs Trump deciding to stay in the family’s Fifth Avenue skyscraper while the couple’s son, Barron, finishes the school year. \nIn an analysis last year, CNN revealed the cost of protecting Mr Trump and his family in New York City was around $1 million a day. \nAlong with Mr Trump, his adult children and grandchildren are also entitled to receive Secret Service and police protection.

The First Lady wowed during the inauguration ball.

Bush. The presidential couple pictured hand-in-hand at Saturday night’s Red Cross Gala. Picture: Mandel Ngan/AFP Source: AFP \n“I am putting together a professional and highly experienced team which will take time to do properly,” she said in the statement. \nBeyond admiring Michelle Obama and Jacqueline Kennedy and mentioning a potential campaign against cyber bullying, Mrs Trump has given little indication so far of what kind of First Lady she wants to be. \n‘DEEPLY HONOURED TO SERVE’ \nSince her husband assumed office, the First Lady’s official Facebook and Twitter accounts have issued just one update — on January 21 — proclaiming she was “deeply honoured” to serve. I am deeply honored to serve this wonderful country as First Lady! pic.twitter.com/tRTRVkDG6z — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) January 21, 2017 \nJust one appointment to her staff has been revealed besides Ms Reynolds: longtime friend and New York event planner Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as senior adviser. Other positions such as press and social secretaries have yet to be filled. \nThe absence is not helping her lacklustre approval ratings, partly a byproduct of her husband’s deep unpopularity among half the electorate. She was also mocked during the campaign for a major speech that plagiarised Michelle Obama. \nBut Prof Borrelli believes her unpopularity is not entirely unusual. \n“I think that first ladies often enter the White House with a mix of support and suspicion and then the job is — because they do public outreach — how to capitalise on the support and manage suspicion,” she said. \nMrs Obama, the first African-American first lady, and Mrs Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt, who both defied the meek housewife stereotype, also came in for heavy criticism particularly at the start of their husband’s terms.

Picture: Mandel Ngan/AFP Source: AFP \nOthers point out it is time for an independent first lady who reflects reality in the 21st century, when few American women are defined by their husbands. \nShould Mrs Trump continue to keep a low profile, future generations may credit her as a moderniser who broke free from the confines of her position. \n“It may lower expectations for the next woman,” said Katherine Jellison, who chairs the history department at Ohio University. \n“She won’t feel that she has to be the perfect American wife and mother role model.” \nThe First Lady role is an official rather than a legally binding position.

Picture: Mandel Ngan/AFP Source: AFP \n‘CHILL IN RELATIONS’ \nAs Politico point out, Mrs Trump isn’t the only foreign-born First Lady who has not been a hit with the public at first. \nThe wife to President John Quincy Adams, Louisa Catherine Adams was British and it took a while before the US warmed to her. \nShe “had not catered to the city’s powerful elites, leading to a chill in relations at the start of her husband’s administration,” Politico reveal adding this soon changed. \nMrs Adams proved to be a shrewd asset and soon charmed her husband’s critics and rivals, something Mrs Trump could also do given time. \nDuring the campaign, Mrs Trump was a vocal critic of cyber bullying and said it was one area she would like to concentrate on. \n— AFP, AP, with staff writers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:03:20.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
