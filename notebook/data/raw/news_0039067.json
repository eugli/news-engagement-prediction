just a week after the firm was embarrassed into admitting it had bought ingredients at Asda .\nAn enraged shopper has complained to the fast food outlet claiming they had rumbled the \"sheepish-looking\" member of staff.\nCaroline Foskett, 31, was shopping for groceries in the Dartford branch of Aldi in Kent on Friday when she says she saw a man in uniform \"awkwardly wandering up and down the aisles\" with a trolley.\nThe man - wearing what appears to be a Domino’s coat and cap - was apparently waiting for a supermarket worker to restock the freezer after he had emptied it of chicken wings and dippers.\nCaroline, a teacher from London, claims the man already had six or seven tubs of coleslaw, eight or nine boxes of chicken strips and the same volume in chicken wings in his trolley.\nTeacher Caroline Foskett, 31, complained to Domino's about what she thinks she saw (Photo: Mercury Press) The mum-of-two sent the fast food giant the image in disgust after she'd seen Domino’s hit the headlines last week when staff had been spotted bulk-buying potato wedges in Asda.\nHowever Domino’s say their investigations suggest the member of staff was merely conducting his personal grocery shop - as bottles of water are also clearly visible in the trolley - which they don't sell.\nCaroline claimed: “No-one needs that much chicken for themselves.\n“I just couldn’t believe it when I saw him with a trolley full of frozen chicken – especially after the photo of the Domino’s staff member stocking up on wedges last week.\nDomino's Pizza say the staff member was buying their own personal shopping (Photo: Mercury Press) “I thought ‘as if they’re doing it again’.\n“We used to get pizzas on the weekend because my husband works then and we’d spend well over £20, but now I’m not so sure.\n“He certainly looked a bit sheepish, like he was trying to be very discreet but if he was going to do that he could at least take off his uniform.\n“His trolley was full of chicken legs and chicken strips, as well as bottles of water and about six or seven tubs of coleslaw, which is one of the sides they sell.\n“He had about eight or nine boxes of chicken strips and a similar amount of legs.”\nDomino's Pizza admitted staff shopped in Asda recently - as an 'emergency' Domino’s hit the headlines last week after admitting to buying cheap supermarket wedges from Asda for £1 a bag and selling them for a huge mark-up at £3.99 a portion.\nIn this instance, Domino’s blamed a ‘big sporting weekend’ as the reason some stores ran out of products – though have made no such admission in this instance.\nRead More Outrage as Domino's worker caught out in Asda buying YOUR takeaway food Caroline insisted: “I’m not going to order there again.\n“We even used to get the potato wedges but I’m not doing that anymore. I’ll just go to the supermarket myself.\nThe alleged incident occurred in the Dartford branch of Aldi (Photo: Mercury Press) “You’d at least hope they would cook them fresh and make them themselves.\n“I know they’ve got to get their stock from somewhere else, like their own supplier who has fresh products.\nRead More Prankster dressed as Domino's worker 'caught' on camera buying a stack of pizzas at Asda supermarket checkout “We do shop at Aldi ourselves and it is good quality, but when you are paying what is technically a restaurant price, it’s not fair.\n“We usually go through phases of ordering pizzas but I’ll get it at the weekends when my husband is working and give the kids a bit.\nCaroline says she was shocked by what she allegedly saw (Photo: Dan Rowlands/Mercury Press) “I saw that man and I just thought ‘here they go again’.\n“I’ll think twice about using Domino’s in the future.”\nRead More Domino's delivery driver caught on CCTV urinating on customer's house after dropping off his takeaway pizza A Domino’s spokesperson said: “Our franchisees are not authorised to buy food items from outside sources.\n“Investigations suggest this is a colleague carrying out a personal grocery shop, reinforced by the fact we don’t offer many items in the trolley.”\n Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily Comments Show more comments More On Asda Dominos Pizza Inc.
