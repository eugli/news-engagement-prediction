Anna Iovine, AOL.com Feb 22nd 2017 10:27AM \nOver Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, an interracial couple in Connecticut woke up to a racial slur graffitied on their home . \nThe two, Heather Lindsay and Lexene Charles, refuse to get rid of the graffiti, which is the n-word spray painted on their garage. They are fined $100 per day for keeping it up. Lindsay said that they will not scrub it off until the authorities \"do their job\" and \"not just cover it up and sweep it under the table as they have done in the past.\" \nAccording to Lindsay, their community of Stamford, Connecticut is racist. Her husband has been called slurs by different neighbors. \nThe local NAACP has gotten involved. According to the Stamford Advocate, they held a press conference about the graffiti . Darnell Crosland, legal counsel for the state NAACP, said that the Stamford Police Department told them to erase it. \n\"For them to be called n , it must be so hurtful that they can easily just erase the board and suffer within, quietly by themselves, and act like nothing happened,\" Crosland said. \"And in fact, that's what the Stamford police asked them to do. They were requested to take the sign down ... and to just act normal, like nothing happened.\" \nThere were apparently no witnesses, and no one has been arrested for the crime. According to the Advocate, the Stamford Police offered to wash the graffiti away for free. \n\"The neighbors were very upset when the incident occurred and truly felt for the couple,\" Ted Jankowski, the city's director of public safety, told the Advocate in an emailed statement. \"However, the residents who have condemned the racial incident are upset and are complaining about continuing to see the racial slur and how it is disturbing the peace in the quiet neighborhood.\" More from AOL.com : ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:34:05.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
