The event, which charged up to £100 for tickets, featured shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops, as well as networking and trade discussions. A model showcases an elaborate green design with a gold trim during a runway show at London's first Modest Fashion Week (MWF) at the Saatchi Gallery this weekend Ruffles, ruching and bows galore: While the designs were varied in colour and style, they all focused on modesty with minimal skin on show A hijab-wearing model carries a colourful clutch bag. More than 40 designers from around the world showcased outfits at the two-day event in London this weekend Shows featured designs from labels such as Nottingham-based Amirab, which launched just last year and produces 'modest, modern and fashion-forward Muslim clothing'. Their flowing jumpsuits and maxi dresses retail at between £200 and £350. Describing Amirab's look in Africa Fashion , founder Roda Abdi described modest fashion as: 'Making sure length of the clothes is appropriate, not sheer, and no slits or cuts which would make the clothes unsuitable for modest wear'. Most of the designs featured high necklines and low hemlines. On Twitter, members of the Muslim community and fashion fans praised the show for 'sending a positive message' Speaking backstage, hijabi blogger Dina Tokio, who has more than 1 million Instagram followers, praised the event as 'revolutionary' and 'pretty fabulous' A guest speaks backstage at MFW. Modest clothing is described as 'appropriate [in length], not sheer, and no slits or cuts which would make the clothes unsuitable for modest wear' The woman behind the 'UK's first luxury hijab' also praised high street stores like Debenhams for stocking modest designs, adding: 'I believe in the next four to five years this will be norm.' Meanwhile hijabi blogger Dina Tokio, who has more than 1 million Instagram followers, praised the event as 'revolutionary'. In an interview with Blogosphere magazine, she said: 'I feel like brands are coming on board with diversity now and I think that it’s down to social media and how much talent there is out there. Fashion fans took to Twitter to praise the two-day event for 'sending a positive message' 'I want to show that you can coincide faith with fashion and that there are Muslim women who actually represent that.' MFW comes after Kanye West made headlines by sending a hijabi-wearing model down the runway at his Yeezy Season 5 show in New York last week. Halima Aden, a 19-year-old Somali-American from Minnesota, signed with IMG Models before strutting down the runway at Kanye's latest presentation. The budding model, who was born in a Kenyan refugee camp, donned a hijab and a long fur coat for her first trip down the catwalk.
