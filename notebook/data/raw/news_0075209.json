Welcome home, summer! \nWhile the sunny season is almost officially over, it seems the Kiwi summer has finally arrived. \nAnd the news just keeps getting better, with the sudden rush of summer-like weather expected to continue into the beginning of March. \nMetService meteorologist Lisa Murray said the good weather was set to continue across the country, at least until the end of the week. ALEXANDER RATHS/123RF \nIt's time to get in a great Kiwi barbecue - while you still can. \nMurray said we first caught a glimpse of real summery weather on February 9 and 10. \nREAD MORE: \nWhen the South Island experienced its first ridge of high pressure on February 16, it was clear summer had arrived, she said. Seriously great food service and stellar view @batchwinery #waiheke pic.twitter.com/7OnaQi0Zvy â€” Penny Ashton (@pennypink) February 25, 2017 \nThere was a chance of an Indian Summer, which means a longer, later summer. \nHowever, long-term forecasts didn't suggest a particularly hot autumn. Though it is hard to accurately predict weather in the long-term. Ad Feedback \n\"It's not time to put away the bikinis and the boardies just yet.\" \nMurray said summer-deprived Wellingtonians should be out making the most of the \"perfect barbecue weather\" during the next couple of days. \nThe capital's 10-day forecast was looking quite promising. While some cloudy periods and the chance of rain are on the cards for later in the week, the sun will be hanging around most days. \n\"I highly recommend Wellingtonians get out and enjoy it. That goes for the whole country.\" \nWeatherWatch said the first day of March would kick off with a large high centred both to the east and west of the country - \"putting it firmly in control of New Zealand's weather\". \nThis would means light winds, sea and lake breezes, and daytime cloud build-ups. This could mean the odd heavy downpour for Waikato and the Bay of Plenty ranges. \nBy next week, the South Island looks to lose its good weather, with a cold front moving in. \nBut the high will remain over the North Island for a little longer. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:58:45.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
