The first employees will move into the 175-acre Apple Park campus while building work continues across the large parkland site. \nIt'll take six months for Apple's 12,000 staff to move from the existing Cupertino HQ into the new campus in the Santa Clara valley, which has at its heart a ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building clad in curved glass. \nAlso in the campus is the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs theatre, entered through a 20-foot-tall glass tube measuring 165 feet in diameter. \nDespite Apple's infamous secrecy, the site will be open to the public with a visitor centre, cafe and Apple Store.
