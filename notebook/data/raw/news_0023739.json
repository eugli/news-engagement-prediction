Carmelo Anthony (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:04 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:04 p.m. ET \nGrab your popcorn. \nThe drama in New York between Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony and president Phil Jackson is getting better than anything you'll see on small or big screens. \nTuesday, Jackson, (in)directly took a shot at Anthony, whom the Knicks have ben rumored to be looking to move before the NBA's Feb. 23 trade deadline, posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that appeared to categorize the small forward as a prodigious scorer not receptive to being coached into being a champion. It was a play some believed Jackson made to prompt Anthony to waive the no-trade clause in his contract, hastening his departure from the Big Apple. \nWednesday, it seemed as if Jackson's jab may have backfired. Anthony is digging his heels in an act of defiance, letting his employer know he won't be bullied out of the city, according to The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski. \nMORE: NBA Draft prospect rankings 3.0 \nA source, who understands Anthony's thought process, told Wojnarowski Jackson could be \"underestimating Melo's willingness to stay.\" \nAnthony has been linked with potential deals involving the Cavaliers , which would team him up with good friend Lebron James and Rio Olympics teammate Kyrie Irving, as well as the Clippers and Celtics. Boston, is a destination Anthony reportedly has told Knicks management he'd be willing to waive the the no-trade clause in the five-year, $124-million extension he inked in 2014 to wind up at. \nAnthony is set to earn $25 million this season and $55 million over the course of the next two seasons. His current deal also includes a player option for the 2018-19 season.
