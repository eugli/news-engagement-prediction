And Brereton believes the move will extend his career. \n“The reason I’ll say this — and Jordan won’t like me saying this but this is just a judge of football — Jordan averaged six contested possessions per game and 27 disposals per game,” Brereton told SEN. \n“So I think his days were numbered at Hawthorn. I think he still could’ve been of same value to them in 2017, (but) I think his time would’ve run out shortly after that and Hawthorn would’ve said ‘you’ve been a wonderful servant, we’re going to let you go and you can go wherever you want’.” \nBrereton — who played in five premierships with the Hawks — was especially critical of Lewis’ game style, which he suggested is neither in-and-under or polished on the outside. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.

He notched the second-fewest score assists at Hawthorn of any club, but averaged career-high numbers for intercept possessions and tackles. \n“If you’re not an inside player in this day and age as a fulltime midfielder, you either have to kick it like a mule, kick it like a surgeon or run the lines,” he said. \n“Jordan kicks it really, really well short, (but) doesn’t kick it like a mule, doesn’t run the lines and gets to the stoppage just as the umpire is throwing it up.” \n“By going to the Dees, he’s extended what could be an extra two years on that. He’s turned what I thought would be like a half-a-million-dollar a year wage guaranteed — but that’s all that’s guaranteed at Hawthorn — into somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 (million dollars) over three years.” \nThe 30-year-old will turn 31 the day Melbourne plays Richmond at the MCG in Round 5 and, as one of six Dees on the leadership group, Brereton believes his biggest influence will be from a mentorship perspective. \n“He’ll be of more value to the Dees in terms of his ability to lead young men, tell them where they should be in their footballing life and take charge and control of them in desperate situations,” he said. \n“That’s where he’s going to be great value to them.” \nLewis has been named in Melbourne’s squad that will take on the Western Bulldogs on Saturday evening.
