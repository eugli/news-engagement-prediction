He's gone.\" \nFadi Fawaz discovered Michael's body in bed and told dispatchers the singer was \"cold and he's blue ... and he's very stiff.\" \nFawaz sounds distressed but held it together. He was under a cloud of suspicion after he reportedly said he had spent Xmas Eve sleeping in his car and not at George's home. After the first autopsy proved inconclusive, cops interviewed Fawaz for hours but cleared him of any wrongdoing. \nHe still has not been buried as authorities continue to investigate cause of death. \nFYI ... in England, emergency calls are 999, not 911.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:20:07.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
