So many things are wrong! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2015 \nBut other prominent Republicans let it be known that the cultural divide is alive and well. Mike Huckabee went for a crude anatomical reference. Watch celebs spew ignorant political venom at Oscars?? Nah…think I'd rather have a colonoscopy. Both happen from same location. \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 26, 2017 \nScott Baio apparently didn’t get the memo that Karl Lagerfeld apologized to Meryl Streep for saying she was being paid by another designer for an Oscar dress. Phony Liberal #merylstreep you should donate the dress to charity & forget about $$ in your pockets! Bravo Karl https://t.co/shA51cT2HX \n— Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) February 25, 2017 \nConservative commentators were even nastier, if that’s possible. At least Ann Coulter admitted she was bashing the show without even watching it. GET A LOAD OF THESE SELF-IMPORTANT AIRHEADS! (Tweeted without watching.) \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 27, 2017 \nFox News host Laura Ingraham found Jimmy Kimmel’s anti-Trump humor “strained.” Kimmel is bombing everywhere except in the first 5 rows. Non-stop, strained anti-Trump humor. \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 27, 2017 \nTomi Lahren said, “Such a great time awarding Hollywood’s cry babies tonight!” and touted her own creation, the Snowflake awards, with such witty choices as “Matt Damon for ‘Don’t use guns like Jason Bourne!'” The stars arriving in Hollywood to celebrate themselves! Luckily we have the #SnowflakeAwards instead! LIVE 8pmET! https://t.co/vfx0XCMkzE \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) February 27, 2017 \nShe got even angrier as the night wore on. Feel free to stay in Iran. I hear it's nice there.
