Chris Christie: 'Phillies suck' and their stadium 'not safe for civilized people' Sporting News 4 hrs ago Arthur Weinstein © (Getty Images) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie hasdoubled down on his disdain for Philadelphia sports, saying the Phillies \"suck\" and thatCitizens Bank Park is \"not safe for civilized people.\"\nIn an interview Wednesday on SNY TV, Christie ripped the Phillies and their fans.\nMORE: The 40 most important people in baseball history, ranked\n\"The Phillies suck. Let's just start with that,\" Christie said, via CSNPhilly.com .\"They're from Philadelphia. They're an awful team. They're an angry, bitter fan base and it's not safe for civilized people to go to Citizens Bank Park if you want to root for the other team. Ya gotta believe what? Ya gotta believe we're awful people.\"\nChristie's remarks referred to the Phillies' decision to put the famous \"Ya Gotta Believe!\" slogan on a huge mural at their spring-training facility in Clearwater, Fla. Former Mets reliever Tug McGraw coined that inspirational phrase during the Mets' long-shot run to the 1973 World Series.\nIn fairness,McGraw also used the slogan later after he was traded to the Phillies. Christie, a Mets fan, apparently doesn't care. But it'snot like he needed an excuse to hate on Philadelphia sports.Last month, Christie, a Dallas Cowboys fan,made similarly nasty remarks about the Philadelphia Eagles and their fans.\n\"Now Eagles fans I can understand it from a little more because the Eagles do suck and they’ve sucked for a long time,\" Christie said, via CSNPhilly.com . \"And their fans are generally angry, awful people.”\nOnce mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate or cabinet member in aTrump administration, Christie told CNN this week that, “I have absolutely no intention, nor any understanding, that I will be asked to be in the administration in the years to come.\"\nThat should leave Christie plenty of time to talk sports. No word on how he feels about the Philadelphia 76ers or Flyers.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.csnphilly.com/the700level/angry-awful-human-chris-christie-calls-eagles-fans-generally-angry-awful-people", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/chris-christie-donald-trump/", "http://www.csnphilly.com/the700level/chris-christie-blasts-phillies-says-they-suck-calls-citizens-bank-park-unsafe", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/most-important-influential-people-in-mlb-baseball-history-list-players-owners-general-managers/1uga2utsurjcc19cwjmsz47apr"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:30:28.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
