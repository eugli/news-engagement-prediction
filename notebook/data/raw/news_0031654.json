Loss of friend prompts safety campaign \nRichard Wall's best friend Dave Bailey died when he crashed his bike on the popular weekend route on Mt Nebo, north-west of Brisbane in 2015, just eight weeks after his wedding. \nIt was Mr Bailey's 34th birthday and he had done the ride dozens of times before.

(Facebook: Sarah Bailey) \n\"He came off the road on a left-hand turn ... hit a tree, and received fatal injuries,\" Mr Wall said. \n\"The level of guilt that you feel when you're supposed to be there and you feel like you could have done something to prevent it from happening.\" \nMr Wall organised a memorial ride this month for his friend and started the RideSafely4Me campaign, aimed at reducing rider impulsiveness. \n\"RideSafely4Me is effectively about making people think twice when they throw their leg over the bike, and think about the people that would miss them if they were to do something stupid,\" he said. \nThe Queensland Government recently launched a safety campaign featuring five-time world MotoGP champion Mick Doohan. \nDoohan said riders had to develop a high level of awareness so they could read the road, the conditions, the potential hazards and stay focused and in control. \nInspector Flanders said buying a sports bike or cruiser was often an emotional decision. \n\"The majority of trips are for pleasure and not for work, so the challenge is to sell the objectivity — and I don't know how we actually do that,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:25:55.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
