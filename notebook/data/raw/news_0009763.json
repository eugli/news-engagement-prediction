New army attack vehicles are too big to fit in the planes that will get them to warzones and our ships and can be heard by Russian submarines 100 miles away, it has emerged. Rear Admiral Chris Parry described the navy's Type 45 destroyers, which cost £1billion each, as sounding like 'a box of spanners' underwater. Rear Admiral Chris Parry described the navy's Type 45 destroyers, which cost £1billion each, as sounding like 'a box of spanners' underwater He said they were 'noisy as hell' and slammed the MoD for not 'thinking about the anti-submarine element'. They also suffer frequent engine problems which cause them to break down in warm seas despite being designed to function between 50C and -20C. All six are having new diesel generators installed which involves cutting a hole in the side of the ships and will take around nine years. Meanwhile, the Army's Ajax tanks, which cost £3.5bn each, can't fit on board the A400m transport aircraft without needing to be dismantled. This means they have to be accompanied by a crane which removes they five-tonne side plates to reduce their weight before the flight. The Army's Ajax tanks, which cost £3.5bn each, can't fit on board the A400m transport aircraft without needing to be dismantled The A400m transport aircraft which cannot fit the Ajax tank without it being altered by a crane before the flight The Army's 54 Watchkeeper reconnaissance drones, which were ordered at a cost of £1.2bn 12 years ago, have still not entered full service due to technical glitches. And concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of nine new P-8 Poseidon aircraft, which the MoD is considering buying for £2.6billion from the US. They hunt for enemy submarines by dropping buoys in the sea but reports doubt if the censor systems on board work properly and they could be vulnerable to cyber attack.
