You've seen her go off to Paris and become a major movie star. You've seen him finally open his throwback jazz club. \nAnd you've found out to get there, they had to leave each other behind. \nSince Damien Chazelle's modern musical scored a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations, moviegoers have debated its merits, with some calling the film \"life-affirming food for the soul\" and others deeming it a \"nostalgic, easily forgettable romance.\" \nSunday's Academy Awards (ABC, 7 p.m. ET/4 PT) will decide its awards haul, but how will history remember its curtain call? \nAudiences are emotionally divided on the film's finale, with some finding the takeaway of La La Land's fork-in-the-road ending a poignant sacrifice of love for success, while others have found the plot realistic and even optimistic, showing life offers more than one path forward.

Dale Robinette \"Very early on, I knew I wanted to do a big dream ballet at the end,\" says director Damien Chazelle. Dale Robinette Fullscreen In the resulting \"what if\" sequence, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) dance their way through how life could have gone if they'd stayed together. “We’ve all had that moment in our lives — the road not taken, the moment we turned left when we could have turned right,” Stone says. Dale Robinette This time, when Hollywood beckons, they make different choices. \"That's why you do a musical, because it allows you to do something like this,\" Stone says. Dale Robinette They fight for their relationship. Dale Robinette Behind them, the set pieces grow more abstract. Dale Robinette The closing scenes are \"trying to convey the sort of bittersweet nature of what has happened between these two characters via a completely dialogue-free piece of music,\" says Chazelle. Dale Robinette The idea was to offer a converse plot. \"Let’s re-watch the movie as though it were a musical that completely followed the old musical rules,\" says Chazelle. Dale Robinette The audience is left to reflect. \"Is that actually better than what happened?\" Chazelle says. \"Or are they actually in an even better place in real life than they would be there?\" Dale Robinette Either way, despite their shock at seeing each other again, \"the characters aren’t angry at the end,\" says Chazelle. \"It’s a movie where people (are) growing up, and part of growing up is realizing life has its way.\" Dale Robinette Like this topic?

It's just lovely, so well-made and so charming, all with a deep melancholy that's hard to shake even now.\" Review: Prepare to be enchanted by magical musical 'La La Land' \nOthers were left with more of a lift. \"To me, the ending says that some partners enter our lives to inspire us, even if they don't end up being our soulmate for life,\" says Dave Karger, special correspondent for IMDb.com, calling the ending bittersweet. \"Without each other, Mia and Sebastian would never have achieved their dreams.\" \nUltimately keeping Mia and Sebastian apart was key, Chazelle says. \"It was kind of an acknowledgement that life doesn’t always completely live up to the perfect version that we have in our heads, but that that’s OK,\" he says. \nMia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) fall in love in 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette) \nAfter Mia unwittingly enters Sebastian's jazz club with her husband (Tom Everett Scott), the camera pulls back and a \"what if\" scenario begins: What if he had kissed her when she came into that restaurant? What if he'd said no to joining a top 40 band? What if he'd gone with her to Paris? \nWhile the film reinforced the positive ways the couple pushed each other, \"the 'what if?' aspect resonated the most for me,\" Stone says. \"We've all had that moment in our lives — the road not taken, the moment we turned left when we could have turned right.\" Exclusive: Watch how they created 'La La Land's big opening number \nSebastian and Mia proceed to dance through this dialogue-free dream sequence, with the set pieces growing more abstract. \n\"I knew I wanted to do a big dream ballet at the end,\" says Chazelle, referencing old MGM musicals. \"There’s sort of a tradition that I just loved so much and wondered, why don’t we see sequences like that anymore?\" \nStone calls the final sequence a beautiful exploration of the road not taken, \"using the tools that only a musical can use to flesh it out and run with it.\" \nIn short, the last 10 minutes of La La Land is the feel-good ending Old Hollywood would have scripted. \n\"Let’s give them the old-fashioned musical version of their story, where there’s no real conflict and we can be left to reflect, is that actually better than what happened? Or are they actually in an even better place in real life than they would be there?\" says Chazelle. \"That’s the question the audience can be left with.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2m5Xyvf NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
