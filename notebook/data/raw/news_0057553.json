I’m sweating. Heil.” \nIn another, she asked, ‘How many Jews died in the Holocaust? Not enough, hahaha.” \nA third, “Kiss the Palestine ground for me and kill some Jews.” \nCBS11 stopped by Salem’s house, but no one came to the door and she hasn’t returned our call. \nJesse Stock is the southern regional coordinator for StandWithUs, an Israeli education organization that corrects misconceptions about the Jewish state. \n“It’s absolutely unacceptable to spread ant-semitism. It’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible, and we have an obligation to stand-up against that type of speech,” said Stock. \nIn a statement, The Children’s Courtyard said, “Providing a safe, nurturing and inclusive learning environment is of the utmost importance to us. The offensive comments certainly don’t reflect our views. Our employees are expected to uphold certain standards of personal and professional conduct.” \nThe group Canary Mission, which documents hatred aimed at Israel, Jews and the U.S. reported Salem was an activist at UT Arlington’s chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine or SJP. \nSJP’s president said in an email that they do not know who Salem is and that she was never a part or member of their group at anytime. \nA UT Arlington spokeswoman said Salem was never a student there. \nThe Canary Mission didn’t return our email seeking comment.
