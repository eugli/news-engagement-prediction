That is not to say security is bad there.\n“There are high-resolution ca­­meras in the area and that was how police identified the suspects. \n“The land side is not only guarded by the Malaysia Airports (Holdings Bhd) but the police as well,” Liow, also the MCA president and Bentong MP, told reporters after celebrating Chinese New Year with Bentong prison complex inmates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:37:49.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
