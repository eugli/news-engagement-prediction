An event called Quad Under Occupation at University College London was also cancelled because organisers failed to get the necessary approval in time.\nAt Exeter, the Friends of Palestine Society were furious after the university banned students from staging a street theatre performance called Mock Checkpoint, in which some participants were to dress up as Israeli soldiers while others performed the roles of Palestinians.\nThe event, which had been approved by the students’ guild – the university’s student union – as part of an international week of talks and activities on campuses around the world, was banned for “safety and security reasons” less than 48 hours before it was due to take place on Monday. An appeal against the decision was refused.\nAlmost 250 academics, including 100 professors, have signed a letter condemning attempts to silence campus discussion about Israel and its treatment of Palestinians.\nUK universities urged to tackle rising tide of antisemitism on campus Read more\nThe letter criticises the universities minister, Jo Johnson, who recently wrote to UK Universities, the umbrella organisation for the higher education sector, demanding a crackdown on antisemitism, mentioning Israel Apartheid Week as a cause for concern.\nThe signatories also express concern about the government’s adoption and dissemination of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which it says seeks to conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.\n“These are outrageous interferences with free expression, and are direct attacks on academic freedom,” the letter states. “As academics with positions at UK universities we wish to express our dismay at this attempt to silence campus discussion about Israel, including its violation of the rights of Palestinians for over 50 years.\n“It is with disbelief that we witness explicit political interference in university affairs in the interests of Israel under the thin disguise of concern about antisemitism.”\nHana Elias, the vice president of the Friends of Palestine Society, accused the university of censoring students. “They are not allowing freedom of speech – by cancelling an event that was in support of Palestinian activism and for Palestinian rights, they are directly censoring us,” she said.\nA university spokesman said: “The University of Exeter is committed to free speech within the law, and to allowing legitimate protest to take place on campus.\n“In keeping with guidance from Universities UK, the representative organisation of UK universities, we believe that if protests take place on campus, consideration must be given to the location and prominence of planned events and their impact on the staff and student body, as well as the need to ensure that they do not restrict the ability of the campus community to move freely.\n“The proposed mock Israeli checkpoint street theatre event was planned for a very busy part of campus where students and staff not only congregate but use as a thoroughfare to lectures. There are other events being hosted by the Friends of Palestine this week where there will be an opportunity for views to be expressed and debated in a safe and inclusive environment.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest University College London, where an event called Quad Under Occupation was cancelled. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\nExeter was recently the subject of media reports about antisemitism on campuses after a swastika and a “Rights for Whites” notice were found in halls of residence earlier this month. Last term, students were pictured wearing T-shirts with handwritten antisemitic and racist slogans at a sports club social event.\nAn investigation was launched into the swastika and Rights for Whites notice at Exeter. A university spokesman said: “The investigation has concluded and action has been taken in line with the university’s regulations.”\nOrganisers of the Israel Apartheid Week at Exeter claim the university is conflating antisemitism with Palestinian activism. “It doesn’t have anything to do with antisemitism,” said Elias. “We feel they were indirectly accusing us of antisemitism and discrimination and harassment through this event.”\nOn Monday it also emerged that an investigation had been launched after a newly elected students’ representative at Exeter was accused of publishing antisemitic tweets. Malaka Shwaikh, who is Palestinian, has been elected a vice-president of the students’ guild at Exeter after promising to improve conditions and opportunities for postgraduate researchers.\nShe is already a trustee of the guild. But after tweets attributed to her by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) were revealed, the guild launched an investigation. Shwaikh has been contacted for comment by the Guardian.\nAccording to the CAA, the day before Holocaust Memorial Day in January she tweeted: “The shadow of the Holocaust continues to fall over us from the continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine to the election of Trump.”\nIt also published a tweet from 2015 in which Shwaikh apparently said: “If terrorism means protecting and defending my land, I am so proud to be called terrorist. What an honour for the Palestinians!”\nSafe spaces are not the only threat to free speech | Timothy Garton Ash Read more\nThe CAA raised concerns about material in tweets attributed to Shwaikh from February 2013 when she was drawing attention to the plight of Samer Issawi, a Palestinian prisoner on hunger strike in an Israeli jail . All of the tweets the CAA drew attention to have been deleted.\nGideon Falter, the CAA chairman, said: “So many mechanisms designed to protect students from racist hatred and extremism have clearly failed here, and what is disturbing is that they have broken down in broad daylight and very prominently indeed. Malaka Shwaikh has been very active in promoting her views, yet she has managed to become one of the most prominent figures at the University of Exeter.”\nIn her election pitch , Shwaikh, 26, said: “Few things in life are dearer than education. I have travelled thousands of miles through checkpoints and armed guards to receive education in Exeter. Since then, I have toured the world, giving talks in some 87 universities, to raise awareness about life in war-torn areas, aiming to change our society for the better and help to spread justice and fairness everywhere.”\nA spokesperson for the students’ guild said it was committed to exploring the “allegations of antisemitism” with a thorough investigation. Toby Gladwin, the guild president, said: “The students’ guild are passionate opponents of antisemitism in all forms; overt or subtle.”\nThe university spokesman added: “Our staff and students work tirelessly to ensure everyone feels welcomed, encouraged, supported and embraced, no matter their background, religion or nationality. Antisemitism is not tolerated. Even one incident of discrimination, racism, or harassment is one too many. The students’ guild, Exeter University’s student representative body, is responsible for the election of student representatives. It has launched a thorough investigation.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The University of Central Lancashire said it was working with students to enable such events to take place. Photograph: UClan\nAt UCLan, an event called “Debunking Misconceptions on Palestine and the Importance of Boycott Divestment and Sanctions”, organised by the university’s Friends of Palestine Society, was cancelled.\nAn initial statement from the university said the event would contravene the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance ’s new definition of what constitutes antisemitism and would therefore be unlawful.\nA later statement to the Guardian said the event had not been referred to the authorities in a timely way and therefore could not go ahead. “The content of the event has now been thoroughly reviewed and we are now working with the student society to enable such events to take place, following due process and providing that they are properly managed so that no one in our university community is made to feel unsafe.”\nThe university’s student union president, Sana Iqbal, said: “The union supports free speech within the law and hopes that an event that deals with the issues about which this group of students cares very deeply will be able to go ahead in the future. Free speech on campus is an important principle we will stand up for.”\nBen Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign , said there had been coordinated attempts by pro-Israel lobby groups to pressure universities into cancelling events as part of efforts to suppress activism for Palestinian human rights.\nHe said: “It is important that universities withstand this pressure and uphold both their legal and moral duties to uphold freedom of expression. Discussion of human rights abuses should never be closed down.”\nFreedom of speech Higher education University of Exeter Palestinian territories Israel Middle East and North Africa news ",
