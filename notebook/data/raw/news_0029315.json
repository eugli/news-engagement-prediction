Prashant of Gulf News, Pacquiao’s adviser Mike Koncz confirmed he is “100 percent” sure Pacquiao will fight Australian Jeff Horn in the Middle Eastern country. \n“It took us a while to get this deal together. There was a lot of confusion whether this is going to happen here in the UAE,” said Koncz. \n“[But] I’m here with full authority and power. I have been the marriage counselor for Manny and we have developed a relationship. I’m involved in all aspects of what he does,” he added. \n“We have executed the agreement in the morning and 100 percent the fight will he here in the UAE,” Koncz also said. \nPacquiao’s official Twitter account likewise confirmed that the Filipino icon is bound to the UAE for his return bout, which still doesn’t have a final date. Sportshub   See you in UAE for my next fight. #TeamPacquiao pic.twitter.com/AioncFnlrV \n— Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 12, 2017 \nThe news thus eliminated Australia in the running to host the Pacquiao-Horn fight. Top Rank Inc. chief Bob Arum had been working the past few weeks with Horn’s representatives to stage the fight in Horn’s hometown of Brisbane. \nBut it turned out that Koncz, who had been speaking to interested parties in the Middle East, was the one who successfully clinched a deal. \n“Yes, there was news of the fight in Australia. The way we operate, I would say I’m transparent and I’m an honest guy. If you try to manipulate a situation you have to remember what you say, but if you say the truth you have to remember nothing,” Pacquiao’s adviser continued. \n“I was aware that Bob was talking in Australia about hosting the fight there but it is fine with us. When Bob said it will happen there I asked him what you are talking about? A promoter works for the boxer but the boxer doesn’t work for the promoter,” he said. \n“I don’t have control over what Bob says, he talks a lot of stuff and I apologize to the people of Australia, their government there for all the confusion and also the fans here in the UAE.\" \nAccording to the Gulf News report, the fight will be handled by the event management arm of Al Afag, a tourism company. Diaa Al Khatib, Al Afag’s CEO, said they are looking at either Dubai or Abu Dhabi as the host city. \n“We tried our best to finalize the deal for a year now and we are happy that it is through. Where it will be held, Dubai or Abu Dhabi, will be announced in a couple of weeks and Pacquiao will be there,” said Al Khatib.
