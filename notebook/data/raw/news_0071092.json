Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz has encountered the most intense heat , as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee appears to be mostly indifferent to the president. \nEarlier this month, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer hammered Chaffetz for his apparent apathy in serving as a check on the executive. Blitzer may have spoken too soon, however. On Tuesday, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that the House Oversight Committee will indeed launch a probe on the federal government by looking into a harmless tweet sent by the official Twitter account of Bryce Canyon National Park . \nAfter former President Barack Obama used the Antiquities Act to designate southeastern Utah’s Bears Ears as a national park, Bryce Canyon National Park welcomed Bears Ears to the family.

Nevertheless, he said he has concerns about whether Bryce Canyon communicated with the Obama administration. \n“They regularly complain about lack of resources and more money for maintenance budgets and this is a small item but I want to know if there was communication and were they being truthful with the governor and the delegation,” Chaffetz said. \nAs Chaffetz neglects some potential problems with the Trump administration, the rest of America can be assured that the House Oversight Committee is conducting this very important investigation.
