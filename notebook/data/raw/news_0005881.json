Howell.\nMultiple reports Tuesday said the Blue Jays had signed Howell to a one-year agreement pending physical. The team had not confirmed the deal.\nThe move would fill a hole left in Toronto's bullpen by the departure of free-agent lefty Brett Cecil, who agreed to a four-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals early in the off-season.\nHowell, who is familiar with the American League East after spending six years with Tampa Bay, pitched the last four seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nHe was 1-1 with a 4.09 earned-run average through 64 games (50 2/3 innings) with L.A. in 2016, walking 15 batters while striking out 44.\nThe 33-year-old Howell had a career-best ERA of 1.43 through 44 innings with the Dodgers in 2015.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:26:25.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
