With the opening of the northern portion, the park’s biking trail has been extended from 1.6km to 8.2km, while the hiking trail has been extended from 2.1km to 5.6km. \nHikers can trek directly from Chestnut Nature Park to Dairy Farm Nature Park, while mountain bikers have access to trails with different levels of difficulties, ranging from moderately difficult to extremely difficult. The park also has a pump track where cyclists can attempt stunts. With the opening of the park's northern portion, the mountain biking trail has been extended to 8.2km.

Windsor Nature Park, located near Upper Thomson Road, will open later this year, while Thomson Nature Park will open by end of next year. \n\"Nature parks are special and they play a unique role in our ‘City in a Garden’,\" said Mr Lee, adding that the parks provide opportunities for Singaporeans to experience biodiversity, and act as green buffers to protect the reserves from the impact of urbanisation. - CNA/cy ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:10:10.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
