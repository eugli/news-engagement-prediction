The show's longtime host went all in for the \"Let's Rap Kids!\" category, reciting lyrics by Kanye West , Desiigner , Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar . He Trebek'd Drake's \"Started from the Bottom,\" Desiigner's \"Panda,\" K Dot's \"m.A.A.d. City,\" Weezy's \"6 Foot 7 Foot\" and Ye's \"Famous\" came during the show's collegiate tournament. \nTrebek's rap takes became instant memes, of course, because who can resist the sound of Trebek's forceful, Shakespearean delivery of such iconic lyrics as \"Started from the bottom, now we're here/ Started from the bottom, now the whole team here,\" as well as \"Buy a chopper & have a doctor on speed dial/ I guess, M.A.A.D. city\" and, of course, \"Panda panda panda panda panda panda panda?\" \nIn case you missed the Jeopardy! host's transition to rap god, enjoy some clips below. Watch: Alex Trebek rapping Lil Wayne, Drake, Desiigner, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar on Jeopardy! tonight. pic.twitter.com/Qh0x2XjEze", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:14:55.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
