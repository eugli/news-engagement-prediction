On April 25 last year, the anniversary of the liberation of Italy from fascist dictator and Hitler ally Benito Mussolini, the policeman posted an obituary notice on his site stating: 'Not all have committed treason. Many decided to stay true to the flag and to give their lives for it. I belong to this Italy, to those Italians who have not committed treason and who have not surrendered.' Luca Scata, pictured, posted on Facebook an obituary notice for dictator Benito Mussolini Amri killed 12 people after he crashed a hijacked truck into a popular Berlin Christmas market The posting and others in praise of Italian fascism have since been deleted. According to Bild, Movio was no better and posted racist comments and was once 'delighted' to have received a Coke bottle with 'Adolf' inscribed upon it. Bild published a photo of the dubious Coke bottle with a picture that Movio posted of Hitler beneath it with the words; 'Thanks Bro!' Stephan Mayer of the Christian Social Union (CSU) which rules Germany in conjunction with Angelka Merkel's CDU, told the newspaper; 'The Federal Government's decision to give no medals these two police officers is absolutely right because of their apparent neo-fascist attitudes.'
