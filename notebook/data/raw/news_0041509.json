Credit Sebastien Nogier/European Pressphoto Agency With the United States engulfed in questions about Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, France is determined to head off any such meddling in its coming presidential election. On Monday Richard Ferrand, the director of Emmanuel Macron’s campaign , claimed that the Russians had unleashed “hundreds and even thousands” of hacking attempts against Mr. Macron, and that RT and Sputnik, government-controlled news outlets, are spreading fake news, as they were said to have done during the American election cycle. The stories about Mr. Macron range from allegations that he is engaged in a secret extramarital gay affair to accusations that he used state funds to pay for foreign travel. Marine Le Pen, the far-right National Front candidate, who has received Russian financing, is expected to win the most votes in a crowded field in the first round of voting, on April 23. But Mr. Macron, who is campaigning for a strong European Union that can stand up to Russia, could defeat her in the decisive May 7 runoff vote. The Kremlin’s interest in the outcome is evident — all the more so since the French election result could affect voter sentiment in elections later this year in the Netherlands and Germany, where right-wing populist parties are also on the rise. On Wednesday, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, came out swinging. In an address to Parliament, he said that France would take “retaliatory measures” if Russia or “any other state” tried to interfere in elections. Mr. Ayrault did not specify what those measures might be, but President François Hollande has called a meeting next week of France’s national defense chiefs to discuss “specific monitoring and protection measures” to guard against foreign interference in the presidential race. Facebook and Google, widely criticized for their role in the spread of fake news during the American presidential campaign, are also taking steps to guard against a repeat in France’s election. Facebook is working with multiple French news outlets to fact-check stories. On Feb. 6, Google announced CrossCheck , a collaborative project with major French media outlets aimed at identifying and fact-checking questionable content with “the French presidential election as its primary focus.” France is wise to take steps now, though it is too early to know whether they will have much effect. Mr. Ayrault was absolutely right, however, when he stated on Wednesday what should be obvious to all democratic governments: “After what happened in the United States, it is our responsibility to take all measures to ensure that the integrity of our democratic process is respected.” At stake, he said, is “our democracy, our sovereignty and our national independence.” \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
