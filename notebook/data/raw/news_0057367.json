Related Stories \nArrests soon as assailants of MP Liton have been identified: IGP \nKader, a Jatiya Party presidium member, was arrested on Tuesday at his residence in Bogra city. \nHe was produced before a Gaibandha court on Wednesday, when police secured a 10-day remand to interrogate him. \nAt a media briefing on Wednesday in Gaibandha, Rangpur Range Police chief Khandaker Golam Faruq said it was the former MP from the same constituency, who had masterminded the killing 'to clear his path for election'. \nPolice also said Kader was also planning to murder the Jatiya Party candidate, Shamim Haider Patwary, for the Sundarganj by-election after his failure to get the party ticket. \nThe MP Liton murder case was 'solved' following a loaded magazine left by muggers, police say 52 days after the incident. \n\"Kader Khan had been planning the assassination for the last one year. The four assailants were trained for six months in a warehouse,\" said Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Faruq. \nHe said three of the four assailants − Kader Khan's chauffer Abdul Hannan, 27, his residence's supervisors Shahin Mia, 23, and Rashedul Islam alias Mehedi Hasan, 22, − 'confessed to murdering Liton' before a magistrate court following their arrests. \nKader has been arrested on the basis of their statements, the senior police officer told the media. \nThe other assailant 'Rana' is still at large, he added. \nOn the evening of Dec 31, unidentified assailants shot the ruling party MP from Gaibandha-1 (Sundarganj) constituency at his home several times. \nHe died an hour later at a hospital in Rangpur. \nSundarganj Police Station OC Md Atiar Rahman told the media that muggers left a magazine loaded with six bullets while robbing a mobile phone at Naya Bazar in Sundarganj late on Dec 1. \nFollowing the lead, police asked Kader to submit his licensed pistol and bullets to the police station. \nKader submitted 10 of 40 rounds bullets he had bought but failed to explain why he could not provide the other bullets, the OC said. \n\"Besides this lead, we've also found similarity between Kader's bullets and those used in killing Liton,\" he added. \nDIG Faruq said Shahin, Mehedi and Hannan were arrested at Bogra's Bridge Road early on Tuesday in connection with the mugging. \n\"Later they described the killing of Liton to police during the initial interrogation,\" he said. \nFaruq said driver Hannan helped the three others, who directly took part in the murder, flee. \nHe said police recovered a pistol, a magazine, a shotgun cover and 10 bullet shells, a helmet, a hat, a mobile-phone SIM card and one of the three motorcycles used in the murder. \nThe DIG said the other's involvement, if there is any, in the murder will be found in the investigation. \nOC Atiar said Kader has given the killers Tk 300,000 until now and promised to give them more once he becomes an MP again. \n\"Mehedi confessed to firing five rounds at MP Liton,\" he said. \nOther senior police officers of Gaibandha, Liton's wife Syed Khurshid Jahan Smrity, sister Tahmida Bulbul Kakoli and local leaders of the Awami League were also present at the news briefing. \nFormer Bangladesh Army colonel and a doctor by training, Kader is a presidium member of Jatiya Party. \nHe got the party's nomination in the past two elections but this time the opposition in Parliament has picked its Chairman HM Ershad's legal adviser Shamim Haider Patwary to run for the Gaibandha by-polls after the seat fell vacant following Liton's death. \nThe ruling party has chosen its Sundarganj Upazila unit General Secretary Golam Mostafa Ahmed for the by-election slated for Mar 22. \nKader had collected a nomination paper for the by-polls, but at end did not submit it, said the Returning Officer GM Mahtab Uddin. \nThe deadline to file nominations ended on Feb 19. \nBut four days prior to that, 20 to 25 policemen were deployed at Kader's home in Bogra City citing 'security concerns over a possible militant attack'. \nLaw-enforces kept his residence cordoned-off until Tuesday afternoon when he was arrested. \nA joint team of Detective Branch and units from Bogra and Gaibandha police arrested him at a four-storey building at the city's Rahman Nagar. The building houses his clinic and residence. \nOn Monday, Inspector General of Police AKM Shahidul Hoqe told the media at Dhaka's Savar that arrests over the killing will be made soon as the assailants have been identified. \nSecond round of search at Kader's residence \nDuring the wee hours of Wednesday, the former MP's Bogra home was searched for a second time, said Gaibandha police. \nThe search started at midnight and continued until 4:30am on Wednesday, said OC Mahbubul Alam of Gaibandha police's Special Branch. \n\"We have seized laptops, mobile phones and DVR and hard disks for CCTV cameras.\" \nMohammad Wahed Ali, an employee of the clinic, said eight to 10 law enforcers, including Gaibandha Assistant Superintendent of Police Rezinur Rahman, came around 12am and said they will search the house. \n\"Sir's (Kader Khan) wife Dr Nasima Begum cooperated. They searched the bedroom on the third floor and seized mobile phones of Nasima Begum and three other clinic staffers.\" \nWahed said the policemen told them the mobile phones will be returned within a day or two. \nA search was conducted on Tuesday afternoon, when police arrested Kader but nothing was seized then. \nMore on this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:14:45.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
