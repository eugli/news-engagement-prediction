The SC had reserved its judgment in the case on June 7, 2016. \n\nVidyasagar Rao, the governor for Maharashtra and holding additional charge as the Tamil Nadu governor, in a note sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs, is learnt to have concluded that with Sasikala not being a legislator, the provisions of Article 164 (1) of the Constitution cannot be considered to invite her to prove her strength. \n\nThe circumstances of the present case, Vidyasagar Rao is learnt to believe, present \"a unique set of constitutional issues with no precedent of its kind,\" and needs to be considered not just as per Article 164 (1) but this Article read with Article 164 (4). The latter explains that anyone who is a minister but not elected within six months as a legislator, ceases to be a minister. \n\nIn addition, the Governor in arriving at his decision, is learnt to have relied on a previous SC judgment that dwelt on the nature of disqualification or restriction of a non-member who gets appointed as a minister or chief minister. In that instance, the SC had said that such circumstances can be interpreted as restricting the powers vested in the governor as per Article 164(4). \n\nThe governor is believed to have arrived at the conclusion that \"even where there is an iota of doubt about the ability of the person to get elected to Assembly within six months, Article 164 (4) has to be interpreted as a restriction/disqualification as contained in the interpretation by the Hon'ble Supreme Court....\" \n\nThe Governor is learnt to have also concluded that he \"is also bound by Constitution to satisfy himself that a person staking claim world forma stable government. In view of the impending judgement in the DPA case an uncertainty exists about the qualification of TMT. V.K. Sasikala to become an MLA.\" \n\nThe Governor, it is learnt, believes that with Panneerselvam, after his resignation, having been asked to continue as the chief minister till alternative arrangements are made, there is no vacuum and hence there is no need for being unduly alarmed.\" \n\nVidyasagar Rao, it is learnt, is also concerned over allegations of MLAs being confined and possibilities of horse trading. On Friday, the governor met with the state chief secretary and the director general of police and the commissioner of police Greater Chennai and instructed them to ensure that the MLAs are at their free will.
