When news broke of her curatorial role earlier this month, the singer suggested that her fans send in tips. Now, M.I.A. has taken to Twitter to ask Radiohead to consider performing at the festival this year, saying, “I know it's a long shot but I live for long shots, please come play Meltdown.” The festival takes place from June 9-18. Earlier this year, Radiohead announced European tour dates; they’re playing shows in Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands in the time that Meltdown is taking place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:08:46.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
