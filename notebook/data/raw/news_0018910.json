As she climbed the charts, the Grammy-nominated singer also battled devastating migraines. Here’s how she learned to conquer the condition... Migraines have been a part of Jordin Sparks’ life since childhood. Her mother, Jodi, often suffered from pounding headaches that left her incapacitated, the R&B artist recalls. Although Sparks was familiar with migraines, the 2007 “American Idol” winner never imagined she’d follow in her mother’s footsteps. “I remember getting my first migraine after a performance,” says Sparks, who has recorded two studio albums and starred in TV shows, on Broadway and in a movie with the late singer Whitney Houston. “As I was onstage singing, my head started pounding. After my performance, I had to go back to my dressing room and lie down with the lights off,” Sparks says. As she found out, migraines are more than a bad headache. They affect 36 million men, women and children in the U.S., reports the Migraine Research Foundation (MRF), a nonprofit advocacy organization based in New York City. Three times as many women as men suffer from the debilitating condition, according to MRF. That may be because of changes in a woman’s hormone levels. [Did you know that almost half of women with migraines are undiagnosed ?] About 50% of women who suffer from migraines report having migraine attacks during or near their menstrual periods, according to the Migraine Trust , a nonprofit research organization in London. After menopause, a woman’s risk of developing migraines drops; only 5% of women over age 60 suffer migraines, the MRT says. In addition to hormonal fluctuations, foods, scents, bright lights and too little sleep can trigger migraines. Migraines often are accompanied by visual problems and symptoms including: Nausea Dizziness Extreme sensitivity to sound, light, touch and smell In this exclusive Lifescript interview, Sparks, 27, discusses what she has learned about managing her migraines and why she encourages other women to get help for migraine attacks. When were you diagnosed with migraines? Shortly after I competed on “American Idol” [in 2007], I had my first migraine. I was busy touring and felt a dull ache behind my ears that turned into increasing pain. I saw an aura outside of my eyes and then felt nauseous. It was very scary. I suspected at the time that it was a migraine, since my mom also suffers from them. Later I saw a doctor, who confirmed that I was suffering from migraines. [ Editor’s note: There are two types of migraine, the MRF reports: those with aura, formerly called common migraines, and those without, which were once called classic migraines. Auras are usually visual disturbances but can be sensory, motor or verbal, according to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. About 70% of migraine sufferers have a family history of the condition, the National Headache Foundation reports. A child has a 50% chance of getting migraines if one parent has them; that rises to 75% if both parents have migraines.] How do you manage your migraines? I try to avoid things that trigger my migraines , such as strong floral perfumes, climate and weather changes, not being hydrated, not getting enough sleep and not dealing well with stress. [See 9 Exercises for Stress Relief .] When I first started getting migraines, I would have to lie down with a cold compress in a dark, quiet room until the pain subsided. Since I’ve identified my migraine triggers, I’ve been able to reduce the severity and frequency of my headaches. I drink a lot of water throughout the day and try to get a full night’s sleep even when I’m touring. How did you identify your migraine triggers? I used an app that offers a simple headache diary to help people identify their migraine triggers. Have you made any dietary changes? About five years ago, I committed to making my health a priority. I started exercising regularly and making healthier food choices. I stopped eating when I became full, and became conscious of portion sizes. As a result, I lost 50 pounds over 18 months. I’ve never counted calories; my goal was always to become healthier, not to fit into a certain size. What is your exercise regimen? I love dance fitness classes and hot yoga. I also like to take hikes with my two schnauzer-poodle mixes, Miles and Minnie. How do you handle stress? When I’m on tour and working 12- to 14-hour days and traveling across the country, it can be stressful. It really helps to schedule down days in between performances to adjust to time changes and to ensure I get a good night’s sleep before going onstage. How do you handle migraines today? I try to be proactive and avoid my migraine triggers and take [ medication ] if I feel a migraine coming on. I work hard to make sure I’m properly hydrated and to make sleep a priority. What advice do you have for other migraine sufferers? Learn your migraine triggers. A recent survey found that 90% of women who suffer from migraines found that knowing their triggers helped them to better manage their migraines. Determining my triggers has helped me to stop my migraines before they stopped me! Is there still a stigma associated with migraines? Unfortunately, I’ve had many people tell me no one understands what it’s like to have a migraine unless they have also experienced one. [ Editor’s note: Chronic migraine sufferers experience as much social stigma as do people with epilepsy, a 2013 study found. Much of the stigma is internal, according to the study, because migraine patients anticipate a negative reaction from friends or colleagues. The study found that many people who have migraines don’t seek medical help or mistakenly believe they are suffering from regular headaches.] Who helped support you? I feel lucky that I have my mom to talk to and that having migraines herself, she understands. Since people with migraines can feel isolated, I encourage others to find a friend or family member or a support group where they can speak with someone who understands what they’re going through so they don’t feel alone. What’s next for you? I have a new single, “Double Tap,” and an album entitled “Right Here, Right Now” coming out this summer. I’ll also begin touring in the fall. I’m in a good place physically, mentally and spiritually. I’m really looking forward to whatever opportunities the future brings my way.
