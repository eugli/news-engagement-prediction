High street outlets for novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) have been shut down.\nOne police officer told researchers that 14 out of the 24 shops in his area had closed in the week before the law came into force, before the police had a chance to deliver a warning letter. The north-east area ambulance service reported a significant reduction in NPS-related callouts after May.\nHowever, the report says that as a result of the ban, Spice and other NPSs have become just another street drug being sold by illicit dealers.\n“Even before the act was passed, there were reports of Spice being sold from mobile food outlets. Areas report firesales of branded, head shop NPS stock in the days before the act. As these stocks run out, it is now becoming common for street dealers to sell NPS, mainly Spice, from plain, clear bags with no branding,” says the report.\nThe authors say illicit Spice prices vary enormously, from £30 to £60 a gram in central London to £10 a gram in Leeds and among the hostel and homeless community in Manchester.\nThey say the continuing use of Spice among vulnerable street communities, including rising numbers of rough sleepers, is a cause for concern. Other Spice users are returning to strong cannabis or heroin, depending on their previous drug of choice.\nShapiro, the director of DrugWise, said: “The title of the report reflects the very diverse nature of non-medical and recreational drug use in the UK. Spice as a street drug adds another layer of complexity and is a concern especially as the numbers of those rough sleeping continue to rise. But some of those interviewed thought that once former stocks of head shop Spice sold on to the streets were exhausted, the bad reputation earned by Spice might see use diminish.\n\n“Other concerns are the strength of some street drugs, which interviewees ascribed mainly to drug gangs competing for customers while fuelling the recent rise in drug-related deaths, and also the huge amount of opiate painkillers and tranquillisers in circulation both from legitimate medical and illicit sources. \n“All of which underlines the need to retain investment in drug treatment and mental health capacity allowing the creation of new services to meet the challenges of an ever-changing drug market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:27:56.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
