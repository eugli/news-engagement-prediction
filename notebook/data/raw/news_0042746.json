Editor Advertisement \nYesterday in Parliament, while the most anticipated speech is that of the Finance Minister on the 2017 Budget, Minister of State for National Development Koh Poh Koon also spoke in Parliament, explaining that the culling of animals will only be done as a last resort. This follows the recent public outcry over the culling of 24 free-ranging chickens in Sin Ming last month. \nKoh Poh Koon also said that the population of free-roaming chickens in Sin Ming had doubled to 50, and that studies have shown chickens are more susceptible to the bird flu virus, compared to other birds like pigeons. Is this just another lousy excuse? You culled the chickens already due to noise complaints in the first place, people became unhappy, and you had to come up with some other excuses. So naturally, bird flu is the excuse. Stop this nonsense now. \nYou say pigeons less susceptible to bird flu, but that does not mean they are immune to it. The many pigeons roaming freely in hawker centers, eating at left over food, what is being done? There are many more free-roaming pigeons than there are the 50 chickens in Sin Ming. The 50 chickens pose more of a threat of bird flu to Singaporeans than the many pigeons? Stop your excuses now. \nPolly Tan \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
