INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nSpeaker Pantaleon Alvarez appealed to lawmakers who are against the death penalty to stop their delaying tactics and let the majority prevail. \nIn a television interview Wednesday night, Alvarez said these anti-death penalty lawmakers should be more reasonable instead of resorting to delaying tactics. \n“Kung ide-delay natin iyan ng ide-delay, huwag namang ganoon. Let’s all be reasonable, we debate extensively, but at the end of the day, kailangang magbotohan tayo,” Alvarez said. ADVERTISEMENT \n(Let’s not keep on delaying this. Let’s all be reasonable, we debate extensively, but at the end of the day, we have to put it to a vote.) \n“That’s the essence of democracy, it is always the majority that prevails,” he added. \nHouse Bill 4727 or the bill seeking to restore capital punishment, reached the House plenary for sponsorship on Wednesday, but it was not debated upon because the session was dedicated to delivering privilege speeches and the quorum was not maintained.

Pero kung hindi nila makuha yung majority, well, let us respect the will of the majority,” Alvarez said. \n(Now, if the opposition is the majority when it comes to voting, then congratulations to them. But if they don’t, we have to respect the will of the majority.) \nThe House of Representatives is dominated by a “supermajority” of lawmakers who either aligned themselves with the administration of   or jumped ship to the ruling political party Partido Demokratikong Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban). \nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Alvarez bristled at the brewing opposition in the lower house by saying that if they do not want the death penalty, then there should be a shoot-to-kill order against alleged criminals instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:09:10.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
