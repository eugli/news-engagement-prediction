Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw drops to the ground after giving up a home run to Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series last year. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Andy McCullough attempted to treat this off-season like any other, even as he welcomed the birth of his second child and navigated his first off-season since suffering a herniated disk in his back last summer.\nHe rarely ventured outside his hometown of Dallas. He began his throwing program in December and climbed atop a mound in January. Along the way, during weekly sessions leading up to his arrival at Camelback Ranch on Wednesday, he tinkered with his enigmatic fourth pitch. \n“I worked on a changeup,” Kershaw said. “Every off-season I say my changeup’s getting better.” \nHe paused to set up the punchline. \n“Maybe I’ll throw one this year.” \nThe Dodgers do not require innovation from Kershaw as he approaches his 10th season. They would settle, with glee, for reclamation of the form he displayed before the injury shelved him for 75 days. He appeared set for his fourth National League Cy Young Award until his body betrayed him. \nUpon his return in September, Kershaw seesawed between dominance and rustiness. In moments of triumph, like his first start against the Chicago Cubs in the playoffs, he resembled the man who stood astride the sport in years past. In moments of vulnerability, like his second playoff start against the Cubs, he raised questions about the long-term ramifications of his back trouble. Dodgers this winter.

After two off-seasons of relative austerity under the leadership of Andrew Friedman , with the organization more focused on fortifying its depth than expanding its already sizable payroll, the team splurged. \nThe final... (Andy McCullough) \nProtective about his health and proud of his performance, he understands there is a simple solution for the situation in 2017. \n“I want to make every start,” Kershaw said. “I’ll do whatever I have to do to make that next start. I’ll worry about the next year when I need to. If it costs me somewhere down the road, it does. But I’m here to make every start this year. I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to do.” \nKershaw does not intend to stumble blindly down this path. As he recovered last summer, he modified his workout regimen in order to reduce the strain on his back. Famous for punishing his body between starts, Kershaw cut down on the exertion. He has suggested he would have made these changes anyway as he grew older. The injury merely accelerated his timetable of moderation. \nThrough discussions with physical therapist Stephen Smith, strength and conditioning coach Brandon McDaniel and the rest of the medical staff, Kershaw established a new paradigm. Compromise allowed Kershaw to feel satisfied with his level of activity, while preventing him from subjecting his back to unnecessary risk. \nThe Dodgers believe the summertime adjustments will carry over into this season. Kershaw maintained a dialogue with the organization during his off-season workouts. He turned down an offer to pitch in the World Baseball Classic despite “very serious consideration” on his part, he said, because “I thought it was probably best for me not to do it.” (Bill Plaschke) \nKershaw played a role in an awkward milestone last season. He was one of 28 Dodgers to land on the disabled list. The pileup of ailments set a major league record. \n“Everybody knows that our team was plenty talented last year,” Kershaw said. “We just had a lot of guys get hurt. So hopefully we don’t get hurt, and we should be OK.” \nKershaw completed a bullpen session Wednesday morning. As he pitched to catcher Yasmani Grandal, Manager Dave Roberts stood watch with pitching coach Rick Honeycutt. Roberts pronounced Kershaw’s session as “really sharp.” \n“Clayton is in a good place, physically, mentally,” Roberts said as he sat beside President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman during a session with the media. “He’s excited to be here. That’s what we’d expect out of him.” \nFriedman turned to Roberts. \n“Are you announcing him as the opening-day starter?” \n“I’m going to hold off,” Roberts said with a chuckle. \nThe caution relates more to superstition than Kershaw’s condition. The team expects Kershaw to headline the group. Rich Hill and Kenta Maeda will follow him. The contestants for the final two spots include Scott Kazmir , Brandon McCarthy, Julio Urias, Hyun-Jin Ryu , Brock Stewart, Ross Stripling and Alex Wood. \n“We’ll just get to the end of spring training and see what things look like,” Friedman said. “We’re not spending a lot of time trying to put our opening-day roster in pen right now.” \nIn the coming days, Chase Utley will report to the Dodgers spring training facility in Arizona to take the physical examination required to finalize his new one-year contract.\nFrom the outside looking in, this looks like a minor deal. Utley is 38, and Logan Forsythe will be the team’s primary second... \nIn the coming days, Chase Utley will report to the Dodgers spring training facility in Arizona to take the physical examination required to finalize his new one-year contract. \nFrom the outside looking in, this looks like a minor deal. Utley is 38, and Logan Forsythe will be the team’s primary second... (Dylan Hernandez) \nBased on seniority, resume and a lack of minor league options, Kazmir and McCarthy look like the favorites. The team can stockpile Stewart and Stripling in the minors. Wood can aid the bullpen. More curious is how the club plans to utilize Urias during his second season in the majors and what Ryu can contribute. \nDuring a whirlwind 2016, Urias became the Dodgers’ first teenage pitcher since Fernando Valenzuela, competed his way into the starting rotation for October and logged 127 2/3 innings. He is unlikely to add much more than 40 to that total for 2017, which means the organization must decide how to ration his usage. \nNeither Friedman nor Roberts would commit publicly to a plan for Urias this spring. He will appear in Cactus League games “just like any starter,” Roberts said. But he could be kept at extended spring training in order to preserve his arm for the final months of the season. \n“He’s not at the point where he’s going to make 32, 33 starts, throw 200-plus innings,” Friedman said. “So exactly how we manage that, and when, is something we’ve spent some time talking about this winter. We’ll continue to talk about it throughout the spring.” \nFriedman also expressed optimism about Ryu, who has pitched in the majors only once since undergoing shoulder surgery in 2015. Ryu was battered during his comeback last season, with his fastball stuck in the mid-80s. The Dodgers have been pleased with improvements in his conditioning heading into this year. A fixture in the rotation in 2013 and 2014, Ryu now resembles a wild card. \n“All the reports have been extremely good,” Friedman said. “What that means, obviously, we’ll see. But I think he’s done everything he can this off-season to come into camp and reclaim his spot.” \nUnlike Ryu, Kershaw has little to prove this spring. Informed of Kershaw’s vow to not miss a start, Friedman cracked a smile. \n“We’re in,” Friedman said. “Sign us up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:07:38.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
