It appears a second may be affected. \nThe Can-Am Duels, which determine the order of the Daytona 500 field, face a threat of rain Thursday. The two-race event is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. ET, but The Weather Channel reports an 80 percent chance of rain, beginning early in the day and continuing into the afternoon in Daytona Beach, Fla. There is also a possibility of thunderstorms. \nMORE: Daytona: Passion to race fuels Earnhardt's return \nThough the rain is forecast to stop before the 7 p.m. start time, the Duels could be delayed as the track dries. \nThe Clash at Daytona, a non-points race and the unofficial start to the NASCAR season, was postponed from Saturday night to Sunday morning because of rain. \nChase Elliott and Dale Earnhardt Jr. will start at the front of their 21-car fields for the Duel races at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively. Elliott and Earnhardt earned those spots during qualifying for the Daytona 500 on Sunday.
