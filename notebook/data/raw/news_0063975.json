Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade 2017 \nThe 194th Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade is scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. on Sunday, March 19, 2017 at the corner of Fort and Ste. Catherine and will proceed along the main thoroughfare until the corner of Phillips Square and Ste. Catherine. Consult this map for route details . The parade is made possible by the United Irish Societies of Montreal who've been organizing the procession since 1928. How Long Does the Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade Parade Last? \nAttendees can expect the particularly jovial and animated parade to last about two hours, maybe three. \n\nWhat Goes on Before and After the Parade? \nA LOT . Several Irish pubs in the downtown area serve breakfast and Irish coffee prior to the parade, followed by live music after the parade. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities Here's a list of Irish pub highlights from 2017 . But just bear in mind that downtown area Irish pubs get really packed post-parade, so packed, they overflow with lineups. But there's a way around the chaos. Find out how to beat the crowds . \nWas the St. Paddy's Parade Always on Ste. Catherine Street? \nNope. Held on March 17 or (usually) on the Sunday closest to the day Ireland's patron saint is traditionally honored, Montreal's St. Patrick's Day Parade used to proceed along Notre-Dame Street in Old Montreal, but blocks away from the community's historical home turf, Griffintown . But downtown's commercial artery, Ste. Catherine Street, is the place to be to catch the parade in modern times. \nSt. Paddy's in Montreal: A Wee History \nThe oldest St. Patrick's Day parade in Canada, the Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade has been held every single year since 1824, and no circumstance, from snowstorm to wartime to economic depression, has stopped it from marching on. Historian Don Pidgeon claims Montreal has been celebrating St. Paddy's Day decades earlier than that, , since at least 1759, the year of the Conquest, just not in a parade format. \nLongest-Running St. Paddy's Parade in North America? Not At All \nUp until the 2009 edition, when your humble expert finally outed the error (none of the local papers credited me, but yes, it was in fact me who first took public note), a widespread myth spotted in Montreal's major newspapers, in press releases and various news websites --that Montreal's St. Patrick's Day Parade was the longest-running in North America-- was somehow established as fact. \nBUT the title of longest running uninterrupted North American St. Paddy's parade --at least according to its organizers as well as National Geographic, The New York Times and a slew of other credible publications-- actually belongs to New York City's procession, boasting over 250+ consecutive annual runs since 1762, 14 years before the Declaration of Independence. Meanwhile, Boston lays claim to getting the first North American St. Patrick's Day Parade ball rolling decades earlier, in 1737. Boston did not keep it consecutive though, with 2017 marking its 116th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:40:52.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
