Ruto is today expected to visit Arror, Liter, and Chesongoch areas, which border Marakwet and West Pokot counties. \nMurkomen said: \"Personally I believe that there is a political hand involved (in the attacks) and that is why every time we seek to end the vice, some individuals want it to continue so that they can benefit from the discontentment of the violence.\" \nSeparately, police are investigating six individuals following the killing of Loyamarok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty parliamentary aspirant Pepe Kitambaa in Marigat on Friday. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet Thursday said officers have identified six people who are subject to further forensic inquiries before they are arrested. \n\"Following the murders, the police commenced immediate investigations to unearth the authors of the crime. As at now, we have recorded a number of crucial witness statements and from other persons of interests,\" said Boinnet through spokesperson George Kinoti.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:15:40.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
