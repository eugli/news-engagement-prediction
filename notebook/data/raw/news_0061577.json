They won't let me in and I'm too hot for CPAC.' The fact of the matter is we're not in the business of banning anyone. Anyone can go buy a ticket,\" said Ian Walters, director of communications for the American Conservative Union.\nBut figures like Spencer, who has become a celebrity in neo-Nazi circles and heads the prominent alt-right National Policy Institute, are the exception.\n\"He is not welcome here,\" Walters told the Washington Examiner minutes before asking Spencer to leave here. \"He would like the world to believe that somehow he's part of the conservative movement. Nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n  Spencer was removed from CPAC less than three hours into the conference on Thursday, after interacting with reporters and conference-goers around the venue. Walters confirmed to the Washington Examiner that Spencer's general admission ticket will be refunded.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:25:26.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
