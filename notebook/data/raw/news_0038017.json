That means disposing our rubbish the correct way.\" \nRotorua Lakes Council recently undertook a waste management makeover and has proved residents with wheelie bins for rubbish and recycling so Collins said there was no excuse for chucking household rubbish or any unwanted items in to waterways. \n\"If you would like to swim and drink from it, cool down and even fish from your stream, think carefully about how you treat it. Everyone needs to do their part to keep our town clean and tidy.\" \nCollins said discharges to land, water and air in the Bay of Plenty Region could be reported to the Pollution Hotline via 0800 884 883. \nIt was better is they did so at the time the pollution incident was occurring if possible and provide a clear description of the time, date, location and details of the pollution related incident. \nLocal Council deals with discharges to open stormwater drains, stormwater systems and failures of reticulated sewerage systems. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:37:19.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
