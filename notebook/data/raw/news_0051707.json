It causes swelling of the salivary glands, which are in your cheeks, close to your jaw and below the ears.\nHealth officials in several provinces say the disease is making a comeback in Canada and the U.S. \nSame source of infection likely At a press conference later in the afternoon, Vancouver Coastal Health said it could only confirm that one of the five players has had two full doses of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine. \nDr. Reka Gustafson, a medical health officer with VCH, explained that only people born after 1994 have automatically had the recommended two doses. \nBut a double doesn't ensure full immunization, she explained — it offers 88 per cent protection, as opposed to 78 per cent if only one dose has been administered. \nGustafson said mumps outbreaks do happen periodically, especially when people are living in close proximity. \nShe said the five Canucks players all presented symptoms within a few days so were likely exposed to the same source of infection. \nThis is not the first time a mumps outbreak has hit the NHL. \n\nIn 2014, nine players were diagnosed with the disease as the league struggled to contain it. One of the players who contracted mumps that year was Pittsburgh Penguins player Sidney Crosby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:20:11.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
