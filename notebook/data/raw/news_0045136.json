Follow him here . Feb 19, 2017 Tweet The flat-Earth phenomenon sweeping All-Star Weekend made its way all the way to the podium of the commissioner. After Kyrie Irving sparked the conversation with controversial comments on a Friday podcast, Draymond Green playfully left the door open during media availability this morning. It appeared the NBA was filled with stars who questioned basic scientific theories. With Adam Silver available to the media prior to the big Saturday night events, someone had to ask him about the theory. Silver remained respectful of his players, but he said firmly that he believes the Earth is round: \n\"Kyrie and I went to the same college, and he may have taken some different courses than I did. But in all seriousness, as he made clear today he was trying to be provocative. And I think it was effective, I think it was a larger comment on the so-called 'fake news' debate that's going on in our society right now in terms of what's reported, and it led to an interesting discussion. But personally, I believe the world is round.\" If the NBA's players aren't going to believe in basic tenets of science, it's reassuring to know the guy in charge of running the league does.
