Groups were evicted from Haden Hill Leisure Centre, a public car park in Oldbury and Blakeley Wood Road in Tipton.\nSandwell Council Leader Councillor Steve Eling said:\nThe bill for this clean-up is going to run into thousands of pounds. We estimate that around 50 tonnes of rubbish was fly-tipped within just days.\nWe’re currently spending over £400,000 a year cleaning up after unauthorised encampments and it has to stop.\nWe’re taking firm action to evict travellers from council land while securing sites that they may camp on.\n– Council Leader Councillor Steve Eling Councillor Richard Marshall, cabinet member for leisure, added:\nThe amount of rubbish left behind was mind-blowing. The sheer scale of the rubbish and the speed it accumulated is the worst I’ve ever seen.\nIt’s worth reminding everyone reading this that if you employ someone to work on your home or you pay someone to take away rubbish, you have to make sure they are disposing of the waste legally. They must have a waste carrier’s licence.\nAll households and businesses are under a legal duty to dispose of waste responsibly and they can be prosecuted if they do not.\n– Councillor Richard Marshall An unauthorised encampment that set up on an industrial estate at Black Lake, West Bromwich, yesterday was evicted this morning (Thursday).\nCar parks, parks and other council-owned sites around Sandwell will remain secured in an attempt to prevent further trespass.\nLast updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Politics West Midlands Smethwick", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:11:19.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
