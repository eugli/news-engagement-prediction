While it seems inevitable that Nicki will share a response on record to Ma's \"ShETHER\" eventually, her immediate impulse was to have a laugh at the first week sales of Remy's Plata O Plomo album with Fat Joe . A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Feb 25, 2017 at 10:33am PST \nTo refute Remy's claim that Nicki can't be the \"queen of rap,\" Minaj produced receipts of Beyoncé calling her just that. Is the Bey co-sign enough to support Nicki's crown or does she have to defend it in a diss track of her own? A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Feb 25, 2017 at 10:58am PST \nIf Nicki has a diss track coming, she can start with some rebuttals to these ruthlessly personal lines from Remy's diss .
