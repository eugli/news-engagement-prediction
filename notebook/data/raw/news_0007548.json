A \"Filibuster\" is a procedure in The United States Senate (not The House) from 1809 to require more than 51 votes (a simple majority) to confirm a Presidential appointment or a piece of legislation. People used to stand up for many hours, like in the famous Capra movie, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", but nowadays it is just done by the introduction of a simple motion. Unless and until the Filibuster is ended, through a procedure called \"Cloture\", no vote can be held on the nomination or legislation. \nHow many votes does it take to end a Filibuster? 60 votes \nCan The Republicans end a Filibuster of Neil Gorsuch all by themselves? No. They only have 52 members in The Senate and will need 8 of the 48 Democrats. \nWill 8 Democrats vote to end the Filibuster in order to confirm Gorsuch? Mixed opinions on this: \nThose who say yes say so because: 1. Many Senate Democrats are running for re-election in states that voted for Trump and they don't want to appear \"obstructionist\" 2. Normally great deference is given to the nominations of American presidents 3. Donald Trump wants it \nThose who say no say so because: 1. They believe this open Supreme Court was \"stolen\" from President Obama and his nominee Merrick Garland when Senator Mitch McConnell and The Republicans didn't hold a hearing or bring Garland's nomination up for a vote 2. Some believe that Donald Trump is, himself, not a fully legitimate president and want to wait until an investigation is completed into Trump's alleged involvement with Vladimir Putin and Russia regarding the hack of the 2016 Election 3. They believe that Neil Gorsuch, who joked about forming a club called \"Fascism Forever\" in high school, is a Right Wing extremist who is against women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, voting rights, environmental rights, labor rights, for \"Citizens United\" and a proponent for radical NRA positions. \nWhat if Republicans \"Nuke\" the Filibuster? \nThis would represent an extremely severe change in American government, likely forever. Without the Filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, a President who has 50 or more Senators from his/her own party would be able to nominate virtually anyone, no matter how mainstream or acceptable to the majority of Americans. \nThose who say the Republicans will \"nuke\" the Filibuster say so because: 1. Donald Trump has expressed his desire for Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed and to \"nuke\" the Filibuster if that is what it will take 2. Many Republicans are very excited about the idea of being able to do away with literally ANY Democratic opposition and run the Congress essentially all by themselves 3. Republicans want another pro-life, pro-NRA, pro-\"Citizens United\", anti-gay rights Justice who will also rule against environmental regulations, women's rights, civil rights, voting rights and labor rights and for a more limited role of government and more states rights in American life. \nThose who say the Republicans will not \"nuke\" the Filibuster say so because: 1. The Democrats voted to NOT \"nuke\" the Filibuster for Supreme Court nominees or for legislation when they had 53 members in 2013. (They did \"nuke\" the Filibuster for other Presidential appointment and for lower court federal judges) 2. Many of the more senior Republican Senators (Majority Leader McConnell, John McCain, Lindsay Graham, Orin Hatch and others) have been in \"The Minority\" and they know how it feels and have relied on the Filibuster to defeat nominees and bills that they considered to be too extreme and/or harmful to the country. They knew, for virtual certainty, that one day they will again be in \"The Minority\" and that they will hate being completely powerless to stop these things. 3. Some fear that \"nuking\" the last remaining check and balance on Donald Trump and Senate Republicans' power would be seen as ushering in \"One Party Rule\", \"Authoritarianism\" and even \"Tyranny\" into American government and that voters in their states in the 2018 Elections might respond unfavorably and that it may cause previously unengaged Millennials and others to come out and vote against them in Primaries and the general Midterm Election. \nWhat Can YOU Do to Help or Stop Donald Trump's Nomination? Senators are VERY sensitive to communications from THEIR OWN constituents because you get to vote for, or against, them. \nCall or write or visit your United States Senators (you have 2 of them, see the list below) and tell them either: \"Please vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch\", or \"Please vote to Filibuster and oppose Judge Gorsuch\" \nThe Senate staff will tally the results and communicate this directly to The Senator. \nAnd, if you have one or two Republican Senators you can also lobby them about \"nuking\" the Filibuster and tell them either: \"Please vote to \"nuke\" the Filibuster\", or \"Please don't vote to \"nuke\" the Filibuster\". \nAnd, if you feel very strongly about your position, you can communicate that in a way that politicians will definitely understand, for example, \"If you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T21:09:14.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
