Reflecting this, our latest forecasts were prepared on the basis that growth in consumption was unlikely to run ahead of growth in household income over the next couple of years.\n“This interaction between consumption, saving and borrowing for housing is a significant issue.\n“We are still learning how households respond to higher debt levels and lower nominal income growth,” he said.\nLowe also defended the rules-based open international trading system, saying Australia had benefited greatly from it.\n“Too often these days, a commitment to open international trade, integration into global capital markets, a strong role for markets and a dynamic financial sector are seen as liabilities, not as assets,” he said.\nBut he acknowledged that the benefits from the international trading system could fall unevenly across the community.\n“We recognise that while openness makes the size of the pie bigger, it can also affect the distribution of the pie in a way that our societies feel uncomfortable with,” he said.\n“This is something that we have both tried to address and have had more success on this front than some other countries.”\nHousing affordability?
