By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 6:29 PM Piyush Goyal, MoS for Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines. (Youtube) \nThe MoS for Power, Coal, New and Renewable Energy and Mines, Piyush Goyal while addressing a press conference in Kashi (Varanasi) earlier today slammed Akhilesh Yadav -led Uttar Pradesh government. A power cut made the minister invoke ‘Ganga Maiya’, he said, “Saugandh Ganga maiya ki, aaj Kashi mai samvaddatta sammelanke dauran bijli gul dekh ke SP ke khokle davo ki pol khul gai” (today during the press conference at Kashi, all the promises that were made by the Samajwadi Party were proved baseless.) He slammed the UP government and said, “The people in the state know that if they want to be safe from curroption and wish to go on the road to developments, then the Narendra Modi led government can only help them.” \nWatch the full video here- He attacked the SP government for creating biasness among the people when it comes to electrification and said, “Uttar Pradesh is the most underdeveloped state of the country. Even now more than 1 crore people are still deprived from electrification. The central government alloted money to the state government for development but still the development i no where to be seen in the state. As of now, there are many villages that are still far away from receiving electicity.” Power Minister’s comment has contradicted Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s statement. \nOn February 27, while addressing an election rally in Gorakhpur, Akhilesh Yadav said, “There is a ‘baba’ in the neighbourhood who has raised questions on power supply…I will only say that ‘babaji’ you can touch an electric wire and see whether there is power or not.” This statement came after BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Yogi Adityanath’s made a remarks on the lack of power supply in UP. While talking about the development in the state he attacked PM Modi and said, “We have started Metro train (but) where is your bullet train?…it has been three years now since your government came to power, where has that train gone?…please hurry up as you will not get another chance. You have been chief minister of Gujarat three times but could not get a Metro there…we have started its work at three places.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:46:22.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
