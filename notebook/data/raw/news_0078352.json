AAP Share on Twitter \nA NEWCASTLE grandfather has become a millionaire after cashing in a year-old winning Lotto ticket he found while cleaning his car. \nThe man, who has remained anonymous, bought the ticket in January last year but only discovered it was a winner this month when he checked the ticket online after finding it in the bottom of his shopping bag. \n“I line the bottom of my reusable Aldi shopping bags with old beer cartons to give them some strength,” he said. \n“The ticket was hidden in underneath it and I didn’t know it was there.” \nHe checked the ticket online, discovering he’d won a division one prize of $1,020,496. \n“I’m glad I didn’t just get the old bags and take them to the dump,” he said. Cheryl Tuckerman, owner of the Nextra Marketown Newsagency in Newcastle where the ticket was purchased, said she was relieved the 13-month search for the winner was over. \nThe belated winner plans on using the money to help his children with house repayments and pay for his grandchildren’s education. \nNSW Lotteries has urged players to check their old tickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:13:56.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
