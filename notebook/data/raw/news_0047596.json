The conservative Reagan Battalion blog tweeted video clips Sunday in which Yiannopoulos discussed Jews, sexual consent, statutory rape, child abuse and homosexuality. \nIn one clip, Yiannopoulos defends sexual relationships between men and boys as young as 13 years old. He also speaks approvingly of his own sexual relationship with a 29-year-old priest when he was 17. In brief | Milo Yiannopoulos \n\"In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men - the sort of 'coming of age' relationship - those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can't speak to their parents,\" he said.

They have allowed me to carry conservative and libertarian ideas to communities that would otherwise never have heard them. \n“They have been a significant factor in my success. I’m grateful for that freedom and for the friendships I forged there.” \n“I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone,” \nSimon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint announced on Monday that \"after careful consideration\" they had pulled Yiannopoulos' book, for which pre-orders placed it high on Amazon.com's best-seller lists. \nThe subject of intense controversy from the start, \"Dangerous\" was originally scheduled to come out in March. But Yiannopoulos pushed back the release to June so he could write about the protests during his recent campus tour, including a cancelled appearance at the University of California, Berkeley.
