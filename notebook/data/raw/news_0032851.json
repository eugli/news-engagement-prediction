That ensemble won for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.\nThe spirit of Leonard Cohen’s music was felt during a performance by Grammy-nominee Judy Collins. The folk singer began with a memory of Cohen, a long-time friend and collaborator, and the first time he brought her the lyrics to “Suzanne.”\n“He came into my living room and said, ‘I can’t play the guitar and I can’t sing,” she told the audience.\n“And I don’t know if this is a song.”\nShe then launched into a solo performance of the Montreal poet’s famed song on a grand piano.\nA number of other Canadians are up for Grammys in the pre-telecast, including indigenous singing group Northern Cree. The early show is streaming at Grammy.com/live .\nSeveral Canadians are also going for gold at Sunday’s main Grammy Awards ceremony, including two of the country’s biggest pop performers.\nDrake and Justin Bieber will square off against country singer Sturgill Simpson — already the winner of the country album of the year — and pop powerhouses Adele and Beyoncé, who are all nominated for album of the year.\nThe evening’s biggest prize is only one of eight nominations Drake has in his pocket.\nBefore Sunday, Drake had only won a single Grammy to his name for the 2011 rap album Take Care. \nBieber is another Canadian hoping to grab a few statues at this year’s show.\nHe’s nominated for his single “Love Yourself” in the best song and best pop solo performance categories.\nHis album Purpose is also up for best pop vocal album.\nBieber also only has one Grammy, which he won last year for contributing vocals to “Where Are U Now,” a side project of Skrillex and Diplo.\nThe Grammys main event airs on City and CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.\nWith files from The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:50:24.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
