Here are 6 things to remember \nA lack of walkthrough inspections after a year of home ownership was a recurring problem for the Facebook group’s members. Without walkthroughs, some homeowners have paid out-of-pocket to repair any defects they thought would be covered by warranty. \nWelcome Homes isn’t listed as a member of the New Home Warranty Program of Saskatchewan or the Saskatoon & Region Home Builders’ Association (SRHBA). \nThe SRHBA requires walkthrough inspections after a year for all of its members. \n“If a homeowner is using a builder that’s a member of our association, that’s something that we hold very highly as important for the industry and all of our members have third party warranty,” said SRHBA CEO Chris Guérette. \nThe SRHBA provides tips to homeowners in its ‘Get it in Writing’ online consumer information service. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
