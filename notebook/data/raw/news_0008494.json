PA:Press Association 6 Arsene Wenger has led Arsenal down a path that breeds mediocrity \nCappuccino culture is alive and well at Arsenal . The frothy bits, such as the thumping 5-0 win at Southampton in the FA Cup last weekend, sure taste good to their players. Keep up to date with ALL the Arsenal news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nThey tend not to dwell too long on the bitter experiences, with the steam rising from the stands during their 2-1 home defeat to Watford on Tuesday. \nArsenal’s squad, what with their £100,000-a-week salaries, topped up with bonuses of £15,000 a man when they do win, are on to a very good thing indeed. \nJust finish in the top four, fellas. Wenger could walk away from Arsenal in the summer says Gunners legend Ray Parlour EPA 6 The Frenchman has pocketed £80million since last winning the title \nThey have done that every year since 2004, when the Invincibles went the season unbeaten and Arsene Wenger won his last league title. \nSince then they have finished — on average — 13 points behind the champions. Four wins and a draw away from taking the Premier League down to goal difference is a lot of ground to make up. \nArsenal are no longer the nearly men. They are the nowhere men. \nFinishing in the top four and qualifying for a competition they cannot hope to win is what being around Arsenal is about these days. \nThey are a monied, corporate monster, but winning the Premier League is out of reach. The closest they have come in recent times was in 2008, when they finished third, four points behind champions Manchester United . Getty Images 6 Arsenal do not have a winning mentality like their London rivals Chelsea \nThere is no real pressure around the place, certainly not the kind of intolerable conditions that managers at Chelsea sometimes have to work under. They are into their tenth permanent manager since Wenger lifted the last of his three league titles 13 years ago. \nLook around the dressing rooms before they meet at Stamford Bridge tomorrow. \nChelsea, whatever you think about them, have created a culture of success. The constitution of the place is geared towards success. \nFour league titles (three secured by Jose Mourinho , the other by Carlo Ancelotti ) and the Champions League ( Roberto di Matteo ) since 2004 is an impressive showing. \nWenger, who has been paid around £80million by Arsenal since 2004, gets off the hook with an FA Cup here and there.

It is still a major trophy, just about. \nWith yet another favourable draw, this time at non-league Sutton, there is every chance they can go on to win it again. \nThe Premier League, the trophy the fans would dearly love to get their hands on again, is out of reach. \nPetr Cech , Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil know what it takes to cross the finishing line, but they have never done it with Arsenal. \nNever will, either. \nThat says everything about the torpor around the place. Wenger, who will sit in the stands at Chelsea for the third of his four-game touchline ban, has lost his edge. Reuters 6 Arsenal players have it too easy because their manager is content with getting fourth each year \nHis decisions, such as the one to play Gabriel at right-back ahead of Hector Bellerin on Tuesday, are becoming increasingly erratic. \nSo, too, was the one to leave Danny Welbeck out of the squad. The striker, who scored twice at St Mary’s in the FA Cup win, reported he was 100 per cent fit to face Watford. \nWhatever Wenger’s decisions were for leaving him out, the players failed him. \nArsenal will recover, they always do, because they are programmed to finish in the top four. \nThey are just far too nice to go on to win it.
