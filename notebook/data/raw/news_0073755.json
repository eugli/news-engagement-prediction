But there's one way that she keeps things in perspective—and no, it doesn't involve a team of nannies and assistants. Instead, it's a mindset that everyone can get behind too. \nIn a conversation with Us Weekly reported by the magazine on Friday, Alba explained that she lives by a Japanese philosophy called wabi-sabi , which often pops up in the interior design world as well. \"It’s enjoying and embracing the imperfections of real life,\" she said. \nAs Vogue wrote in 2015, wabi-sabi is less of a curated, Instagram-perfect vibe and more #IWokeUpLikeThis. \"I almost never touch anything in the spaces I shoot, because you want to see what other people have touched, or that an interesting presence has made something there in that space,\" interiors photographer Todd Selby told the magazine. \"In homes, especially, I think that human touch is what has been missing for so long.\" \nAlba went on to explain more about finding beauty in imperfections: “Real wood or this [carpet] being a little bit off or things not being perfect because it has that human touch, it has that natural touch, are things that, to me, are the most beautiful,\" she said. \nIt even inspired her \"first comprehensive campaign\" for The Honest Company, which she collaborated on with will.i.am. Us Weekly reports that the duo \"embraced the concept of wabi-sabi, aspiring for simplicity and intimacy, as they sought inspiration in natural elements.\" \nWe like the takeaway here, even if it's a bit simplistic: By finding the beauty in the little imperfections that make up actual everyday life, it's easier to focus on and celebrate the actual joy of living. And hey, if this is an excuse for us not fold the throw blanket every morning, we'll take that too.
