Timberwolves guard Zach LaVine (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:36 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:36 p.m. ET \nTimberwolves fans won't be seeing those trademark high-flying dunks from Zach LaVine any time soon. \nThe team announced Saturday that LaVine will miss the remainder of the 2016-17 season after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee during Minnesota's loss Friday night to the Pistons. LaVine is the Timberwolves' third-leading scorer this season (18.9 points per game) behind Andrew Wiggins (22.1) and Karl-Anthony Towns (23.0). \nFLASHBACK: Gordon and LaVine gave us one incredible Dunk Contest \nThe former first-round pick has progressed in each of his three years in Minnesota and become a key player as part of the young Timberwolves' foundation. He is shooting 45.9 percent from the field and holds a 54.4 effective field-goal percentage, both career highs. \nThe Timberwolves have yet to announce when LaVine will undergo surgery.
