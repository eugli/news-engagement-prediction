Key points: The State Government plans to sell poker machine licences via tender instead of allowing a monopoly Advocates say problem gambling is having a disastrous effect on society Federal Group has previously dismissed evidence Tasmanians are concerned about poker machines \nA gambling counsellor told the parliamentary inquiry into the state's gaming monopoly that it was \"ethically disgusting\" that the Tasmanian Government was profiting from the industry. \nOnly one company in Tasmania, Federal Group, holds a licence to run casinos and poker machines, but the owner of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart is seeking to build a high rollers casino next to his museum. \nThe CEO of the Holyoake counselling service in Hobart, Sarah Charlton, pleaded with politicians to understand what the gaming monopoly meant for her clients. \n\"We're not talking about people who have a little flutter, we're talking about people whose lives are ruined because they are so addicted to this buzz that they lie to their partner about how much money they're spending, they sell things,\" Ms Charlton said. \n\"There was a guy we had recently who sold precious things from the family that his partner didn't know about, then he sold the house she didn't know about.\" \nMs Charlton said a relatively small number of Tasmanians were losing millions of dollars on poker machines in the state's pubs and clubs. \n\"It's only about 8,000 to 10,000 who have a serious problem, but they spend, as you well know, $90 million of money that they can't afford,\" she said. \n\"And the Government makes $50 million from those people, and I find that ethically disgusting personally, when we see the fallout, the destruction to families, children not being able to afford school uniforms, food, basic stuff like that.\" \nFederal Group's managing director, Greg Farrell, has previously dismissed evidence suggesting the majority of Tasmanians are worried about the social impact of poker machines. State gaming monopoly 'never right': peak body \nThe State Government plans to sell poker machine licences via tender instead of letting Federal Group have a monopoly. \nBut the CEO of the Tasmanian Council of Social Service (TasCOSS), Kim Goodes, told the inquiry poker machines should be banned entirely from pubs and clubs. \n\"As a community, we have let the debate suggest that some people have a problem with poker machines â€” we call them problem gamblers,\" Ms Goodes said. \n\"But this is an inquiry to set the record straight and to be really clear that actually the problem doesn't sit with people, the problem actually sits with the machines.\" \nFederal Group said it was not opposed to MONA building a casino, but argued that Tasmania had some of the lowest rates of problem gambling in Australia and the strongest harm minimisation measures. \nBut Ms Goodes from TasCOSS told the parliamentary committee that Federal Group should never have been given a gaming monopoly. \n\"The other wrong ... lies in the events of 2002 when our Government gave away a public licence of enormous value for nothing without a proper process,\" Ms Goodes said. \n\"We considered that that was never right, and that the significant corporate contribution made to Tasmania by Federal [Group] does not correct the wrong that was done back in 2002.\" \nThe agreement with the State Government that gives Federal Group a gaming monopoly in Tasmania runs until 2023.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:07:11.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
