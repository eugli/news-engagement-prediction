ET's Carly Steel caught up with the diva at the exclusive release party for her new single, \"I Don't,\" where Mimi explained why she burned a wedding dress in the music video. \"It was a moment. How could you not?\" Carey told ET at Catch LA. \"There was a fire pit. There was a dress. Just throw it on the fire and burn it. What's the big deal?\" Carey and her former fianc√©, billionaire businessman James Packer, ended their engagement in October, but the GRAMMY winner is already moving on. \"I think that everything is cyclical,\" the singer said. \"Things come back around and people are happy and people go through things, and that's just the way it is.\" Not only is Carey moving on in her music, she's also restarting her love life. The songstress arrived at the party with her boyfriend, backup dancer Bryan Tanaka, appearing very affectionate. \"He's overall romantic,\" Carey gushed. \"He's got a lot of amazing qualities.\" Carey and Tanaka found themselves in a \"proper relationship\" two months after her falling out with Packer. In December, a source accurately predicted that we would see much more of the new couple together in 2017.

Carey frequently posts pictures of her children on Instagram, and now her friend Beyonce is pregnant with twins.

I just wish her and Jay Z all the best. It's really hard having twins, but there's nothing like it. They're the best.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:33:47.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
