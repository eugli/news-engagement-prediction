After a trip to the mall last night my buddy and his mom returned to their car to find that Curt Schilling finger signed the grime on his moms car. Is this Curts craziest move yet? Curt’s a lunatic but you gotta give him one thing: dude loves the troops. Loves the absolute shit out of them. What’s the last thing you did to show our servicemen thanks, took Veteran’s Day off? Genuinely apologized to a homeless guy holding a “veteran” sign because you didn’t have any money? Slammed a million beers on Memorial Day? That’s rookie shit. That’s convenient thanks. Curt Schilling roams mall parking lots in the dead of night, looking for military bumper stickers, then autographs his name into the crusted dirt. He’s so dedicated to thanking members of the military that if that dirt wasn’t there then he probably would have just keyed his autograph into the side of the car, he wants to show his thanks that badly. So yeah, Curt went off the deep end a while ago, doesn’t change the fact that I respect the hell out of this “giving autographs in dirt that no one asked for” move. Wash me? No, thank you.
