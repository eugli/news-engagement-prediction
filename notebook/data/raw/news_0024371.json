Sources tell Goal that Adu is looking into options in the USL and NASL in an effort to find consistent playing time, something that he has struggled with over the past five years at clubs ranging from the Philadelphia Union to stops in Serbia, Finland and most recently the NASL with the Rowdies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:43:08.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
