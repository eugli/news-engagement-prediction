(Photo: Countable, for USA TODAY) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN FRANCISCO — President Trump isn't the only one venting on politics online. \nMore than 60 mobile apps on politics — from Presidential Actions to Quartz News — have surfaced since Trump's election three months ago, spanning the ideological spectrum. In-between, a swarm of apps such as Countable, VoteSpotter, Political Actions, Congress, Presidential Election & Electoral College Map, Boycott Trump Biz, Hear my Voice, We The People, and Voice Political Advocacy have experienced bumps in downloads. \nSpikes in usage of the apps around election day, the inauguration and breaking news such as the Women's March and immigration ban highlight heightened political activism on social media, says Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research at App Annie, which tracks the app economy. \nAs of Feb 17, 321 out of 2.1 million apps on the iOS App Store contained a form of the word \"politic,\" an increase of 5% since the election. On Google Play, it was 422 out of 3.1 million apps, up 12% in the same time period, according to research by App Annie done for USA TODAY. \nMainstream political apps for CNN and The New York Times also surged, App Annie says. \nCountable, one of the largest political apps, has flourished since the election. It was installed 273,000 on iOS through Jan. 31, bringing its total audience to 623,000. Countable \n\"With the shadow of the election looming, and half of Americans who feel they are not represented, this is an outlet,\" says Bart Myers, CEO of Countable, a news app since 2014 that covers legislation and ways to reach out to lawmakers. \nWhile Trump has communicated directly with nearly 25 million followers on Twitter, both political sides are deploying apps to cover breaking news, poll voters, help organize rallies and closely watch legislators, says Levitas and others. \n\"A ton of people are kicking ideas around now,\" says Jason Putori, co-founder of Votizen, a political advocacy group sold to Causes in 2013, referring to a slew of websites and digital mailing lists such as Daily Action to Wall of Us to raise funds and awareness. \"The urgency is there, as is mass anxiety.\" Tools for Resistance \n\"There has been a huge increase in holding elected officials accountable,\" says Andrew Koehlinger, project director for VoteSpotter, a 3-year-old app whose membership has risen more than 10% to 100,000 since November. It notifies members on their local representatives, how they vote on important topics, and how to contact them. \nIt's all fed into a political discourse unlike any Nicole Nabulsi has seen in her 11 years in politics. A deputy finance director for former Rep. Mike Honda, (D-Calif.), she says political activism on social media has helped candidates and voters maximize their ability to organize and push grass-roots movements. \nBeyond the rancor, some of the apps intend to enlighten. \nWe The People started in May 2016 as an alternative to traditional polls that rely heavily on people with landlines to better gauge where millennials — who eschew landlines for smartphones — and others stood on the presidential election. It also polled people anonymously, and predicted a Trump upset. It's tripling its membership each month, say Jed Breed, founder and CEO of We The People. \nThe app's latest poll is on whether Americans agree with the president's immigration order. The nation is split down the middle, Breed says. \nWe The People conducts polling of people without landlines anonymously.
