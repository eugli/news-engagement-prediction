Source: Barcroft TV Broke Student Dates Sugar Daddies To Pay For College \nLucia Khabzi, 24, from Sydney, has travelled to countless exotic holiday destinations, including Dubai, India and Morocco meeting men she’s been introduced to on travel-based dating site, Miss Travel. \nSince joining the site during a year long backpacking trip, the singleton has taken full advantage of the generosity of the men she meets and lived a luxury lifestyle of cocktails and fine dining. Lucia Khabzi from Sydney travels the world for free thanks to a travel-based dating site. Photo: Caters \nThe unemployed sales-assistant estimates each trip she’s been whisked away on costs her dates at least $10,000, and always includes five-star accommodation, business class flights and adventurous activities.“Before I started using Miss Travel, I was backpacking on a budget and was very conscious of money,” Lucia said. \n“But since joining the site, I’ve been flown to luxury locations, stayed in plush hotels and experienced the high life. \n“The men that pay to jet me somewhere nice are all really good guys, mostly interested in friendship and looking for company. \n“Because of them, my year-long backpacking experience has been far more indulgent than I could have ever afforded alone.” Lucia meets men on the app, who treat her to nights away in 5-star hotels, book her business class flights and let her live a luxury lifestyle. Photo: Caters \nAs a result of her dates, Lucia has enjoyed days lounging by infinity pools, witnessed world-class views and on one trip, was even gifted her own chauffer for the duration of her stay. \n“It’s been pretty outrageous what some guys will pay out for. Flights, hotels, food and drinks… the list goes on,” she said. \n“They literally wont let me buy a single drink which at first was actually really hard to accept. \n“Then I realised, they just wanted someone to share their experience with them, so the guilt faded.” \nDespite being gifted all-expenses paid trips, Lucia insists she’s not in it for financial gain. Here she is pictured on a bike in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Photo: Caters \n“Mostly I use the site because I enjoy meeting new people. If those people want to pay for me to explore a new place with them, that’s a bonus. \nThe forensics graduate embarked on a year-long backpacking holiday in April last year, with just $15,000 in her bank account, but thanks to the dating app, has managed to stay in hotels that cost $1,000 a night. \n“The first trip I went on, I was flown business class to Dubai and picked up from the airport in a Jaguar,” she said. \n“I was then chauffeured to the Rixos hotel at The Palm, and my date didn’t even turn up because of work commitments. \n“Instead, I got to spend a whole week exploring a place I would never have travelled to normally, in complete luxury.” \nIn the last 12 months, Lucia has managed to visit 22 countries, many of which have been aided by the men she’s been travel dating, but she insists it’s not prostitution. The stunner has also visited Morocco, all for free. Photo: Caters \n“For me, I was always going travelling, but meeting the guys I’ve met on the app has just meant I’ve been able to travel in a different style,” she said. \n“The guys I’ve met have all been well respected business men and I’ve made it clear before we met up, that there was no guarantee anything would blossom between us. \n“Unfortunately, love hasn’t developed between any of the men I’ve met. I’ve not even kissed any of my dates. Regardless, they’ve all treated me well and we’ve had a great time. \n“I’m still friends with most of them now and update them with photos of where I am in the world. It’s been a really nice experience.” \nTHE COUNTRIES LUCIA HAS VISITED June 16 - Iran - Hitchhiked through country on budget Aug 16 - Was flown business class to Dubai, stayed in 5* hotel Sep - Dec- Backpacked through Europe, visiting 23 countries and dating men in local cities who paid for fancy dinners and tours.
