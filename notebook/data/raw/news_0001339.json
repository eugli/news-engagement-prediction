Brook and Amir Khan were unable to agree terms for a long-awaited fight \nBut Brook is expected to press ahead with a defence of his IBF welterweight title against mandatory challenger Spence Jr and Hearn fears the Khan fight might never take place. \n\"We've talked about it for three years. I just don't think Amir wants the fight,\" Hearn told Sky Sports . \"I don't think he wants to lose to Kell Brook and it's a 50-50 fight. Kell Brook remains willing to discuss Amir Khan fight \n\"It's one thing losing to 'Canelo', but it's another thing losing to Brook, a guy from your country, who he has a huge grudge with, but he's going to make a career-best purse. \n\"For me, it just seems ridiculous, and it frustrates me that they can't seem to apply common sense to the situation. For that fact, I can only think that they don't actually want the fight.\" The Sheffield man moved up two divisions to face Gennady Golovkin last September \nHearn will meet Brook later this week and has advised the Sheffield man not to make a draining drop in weight after he stepped up to middleweight for a brave defeat against Gennady Golovkin in September. \nBut Brook remains determined to stay in a star-filled 147lb division, including Manny Pacquiao, Keith Thurman and Danny Garcia, and is set to face the unbeaten American Spence Jr. We've got a meeting on Friday and we will make our decision then. It looks like Errol Spence next. Eddie Hearn \n\"I want him to move to 154lbs, he doesn't want to vacate his title, so if he doesn't vacate his title, he has to fight Errol Spence,\" said Hearn. \n\"It's a big fight, but it's a tough fight. I just feel like why be in the fights that are as tough as that when you're going to deplete yourself and take away some of your advantages. \n\"We've got a meeting on Friday and we will make our decision then. It looks like Errol Spence next. At this stage 70-80 per cent [likely].\" Also See: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:43:01.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
