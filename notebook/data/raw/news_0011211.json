Over the years, the advent of machines (read computers) gave a fillip to this sport and five-time World champion Viswanathan Anand has been among the innumerable beneficiaries of this technological revolution.\nHe may have commenced his chess sojourn in an era where computers hadn't made their way, but the 47-year-old feels technology has made his journey fruitful.\n\"The computer doesn't just show you moves; it gives you confidence,\" said Anand, during an event organized by Chennai International Centre which saw him interact with International Master Saravanan .\nTracing his early days, Anand recalled how chess magazines came to his rescue whenever he wanted to learn more about the sport. \"Magazines would have diagrams of the chess board with different pieces on it. That is the easiest way to bring a chess game live. Those days we used to imagine the boards in front of us, analyse the game in our head and make moves,\" Anand reminisced.\nAnand's first brush with computers took place in the late 80s. With each passing year, he began to get more and more comfortable with it. From visualizing the moves in the mind to mastering them through the use of computers, Anand went with the flow.\n\"At each stage I had to adapt. I remember playing a game using a floppy disk which had about 2000 games. You could just search for the games you wanted. For example, I could search how a particular player made his moves against his opponent in a specific tournament and so on. Computers helped me find what I wanted, which in turn helped me prepare (against that opponent) much faster,\" Anand said.\nComputers, according to Anand, have eased the level of uncertainty in chess. \"The powerful computers that we have at present help in analyzing a player's next 10 moves. In the earlier days, you had to find those moves on your own,\" he said.\nFrom playing by using floppy disks to employing the latest computer available in the market, Anand has done it all. \"Today's fastest machines will be the slowest in three years. One of my favourite jokes is that a strong computer will not tell you anything a weak computer does not tell you. A strong computer will simply give you the bad news faster,\" Anand quipped.\nThe bigger question is - do machines kill a player's creativity? \"I don't think the computer kills your creativity. On the contrary, it shows you a range of moves which you may not have thought of otherwise. What it kills is your ability to find thing by yourself. Most chess players today decide to correct their desire to work with a computer by sitting and solving problems on the chessboard because otherwise you will forget how to think for yourself,\" Anand said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:18:04.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
