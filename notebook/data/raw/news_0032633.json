Quanice Derrick Hayes Portland Police \nQuanice Derrick Hayes was suspected of robbing a man near a Northeast Portland motel, police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said. \nHayes allegedly approached a man sitting in his car outside the Portland Value Inn, 1707 N.E. 82nd Ave., on Thursday morning, and had a gun, Simpson said. A motel employee said Hayes took the man's Oregon food benefits card. \nShortly after, police responded to a report of a car prowl at the Banfield Pet Hospital, Simpson said. They encountered Hayes, who fled, Simpson said. \nThey encountered him a third time and Officer Andrew Hearst shot and killed Hayes, Simpson said. No one else was injured. \nPolice haven't released details of what prompted Hearst to shoot. Police said Hayes was armed with this replica firearm. Portland Police \nAbout 12 hours later, Portland police shot another man in a separate case. He was wounded and recovering at the hospital. \n\"Both these incidents are tragic and my heart goes out to the community because we're all impacted by this,\" Police Chief Mike Marshman said at a Friday afternoon news conference. \nMayor Ted Wheeler said he was especially concerned about community reaction to the teenager's death given the national debate over police shootings of black men. \n\"Anytime there's a shooting, that's concerning,\" Wheeler said. \"When an officer-involved shooting involves a death, it's even more so. And when the person who is killed is a black teenager it taps into deep historical wounds. \n\"We can't sit here today and ignore what's happening across our country,\" the mayor said. \"I'm not assigning blame. I'm not assigning judgment today. ... What I am doing is this: I'm affirming that the events that happened here in Portland are happening all too often.'' \nHayes' grandmother declined to comment when reached Friday, saying the family was too devastated to talk. She said on social media that a vigil planned for Saturday had been cancelled. \nHayes is listed on the state's clearinghouse of missing people. \nThe Thursday morning shooting occurred about two hours after the initial robbery report in the 8300 of Northeast Hancock Street, Simpson said. \nSimpson didn't give any details about the encounter leading up to the shooting. \nHearst has worked on the Portland police force for seven years, Simpson said. He was placed on administrative leave, as is standard procedure. \nHearst was one of three officers who fatally shot a man in 2013 . Hearst, Sgt. Nathan Voeller and Officer Royce Curtiss shot Merle Hatch, 50, outside of the Portland Adventist Medical Center. A cellphone video recorded by a witness showed Hatch taunting police officers then running toward them. \nHatch had a mental illness diagnosis and had tried to access the hospital for psychiatric care. He was carrying a broken telephone handset and told hospital staff that he had a gun. \nA grand jury ruled not to indict the officers on March 20, 2013. \nPolice are investigating the shooting of Hayes, Simpson said. When the investigation is complete the case will go to the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office and presented to a grand jury, which is a standard procedure, Simpson said. The case will also be presented to the Police Review Board. \n-- Samantha Matsumoto What do Portland city employees make?
