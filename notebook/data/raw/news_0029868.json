Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA schoolgirl who nearly died after taking ecstasy says her mum was right to shame her online. \nLeah Robinson, 16, fell into a coma after ­taking the party drug with friends at Christmas. \nMum Kerry took photos of Leah as she lay unconscious, her face bloated, with tubes down her throat and wires snaking over her body. \nWhen doctors told her Leah was making a recovery, Kerry put the pictures on Facebook as a warning to her girl and other youngsters. \nThe shocking images went viral. Initially Leah felt humiliated and angry but now she has had a change of heart. \nThe teenager, who took a super-strong E pill, hopes others will learn from her experience.

And it could happen to anyone. I was so stupid but now my eyes have been opened. \n“I want to say to other teens, ‘If you don’t listen to your parents, teachers or the police, listen to me. \n\"This drug nearly killed me and although I was humiliated by those pictures, I’m now glad my mum posted them online.’ \n“It was the wake-up call I needed and hopefully other kids who see them will be put off doing anything so stupid.” \nThe disturbing images recalled the images ­released by the parents of tragic Leah Betts, who died aged 18 after taking the drug in 1995. \nSince then ecstasy has been linked to 727 other deaths. A study in 2015 revealed its use in 16 to 24-year-olds was at an 11-year high.

I don’t even remember taking the pill, let alone what ­happened afterwards. Leah says she doesn't even remember taking the pill (Photo: North West News Service) \n“The first thing I knew was waking up in hospital with machines everywhere. \n“I know one thing – I won’t be taking drugs ever again. I’d gone out all dressed up and the next time I looked in a mirror my face was all bloated and swollen and I looked like I’d been in a car accident. \n“But it wasn’t some big thing. That’s what is scary now . I just thought it was normal. \n\"Parents don’t want to hear it but most teenagers, aged around 13 or 14, find out there are drugs around to buy. Not everyone tries them but everyone is curious. That’s natural. \n“If there’s a party at a weekend it’s usually common knowledge who has ecstasy to sell. \n“It’s usually someone the same age but you never find out who the dealer is. You’ve no idea how pure they are or where they come from. That’s what’s so dangerous. Leah is on the road to recovery \n“But it was only when I saw those pictures of ­myself and the reality of what I was doing to myself that I realised it’s shouldn’t be normal. It’s terrifying.” \nLeah said drug taking was common among her peer group and teenagers will buy them if they have the money. \nShe also claimed drugs education lessons failed to hit home with kids. Leah said: “When I went back to school they had another assembly about the dangers but didn’t mention my name. \n“Everyone is now terrified to take them at school after what happened to me. I think most people have stopped but that’s just a handful of kids in one school. I’m hoping the message will spread to others around the country.” \nLeah freely admits she ignored her school’s anti-drugs message and the warnings from Kerry, herself an ex-heroin addict, when she popped the E at Christmas – not for the first time.

It made me feel nice and affectionate, and that made me feel safer taking it the next time. \n“Nobody was telling me to take it. I took it because I was offered it. It’s that simple. It seemed like a normal thing to do. That is how it has become these days. \n“People don’t think it’s a big deal but it is. I know that now. I could have died.” \nLeah was at a friend’s house when she and a pal bought three pills for £15. \nShe said: “That night is a black hole. I can’t recall anything beyond drinking with my friend. I’m told I was sitting in the middle of the road, refusing to go to the pavement. My friend tried to pick me up but I was a dead weight. \n“Someone later said I looked like a dead cat who had been run over.” \nThere was so much mud in Leah’s hair that doctors at Wigan’s Royal Albert Edward Infirmary initially thought she was a brunette. Leah with her siblings \nThere was mud in her eyes and in the back of her throat. She thinks she must fallen in a big puddle. Her temperature fell to a dangerously low 26C as she battled ­hypothermia – 11C below the norm. \nShe woke in hospital 14 hours later surrounded by sobbing relatives. \nThe publicity surrounding her ordeal was excruciatingly embarrassing for Leah when she went back to school after the Christmas break. \nShe said: “I felt like a bit of a laughing stock. Nobody really said anything but I found the whole thing really ­embarrassing. I felt so ashamed that everyone had seen those pictures of me in a coma on Facebook.” \nBut Kerry sticks by her decision to post the images. \nShe said: “I don’t feel sorry and I’ve told Leah I’ll tell the world if I find out she’s been taking drugs again. If it’s what I have to do to keep her safe then that’s what I’ll do.” Leah Betts died after taking ecstasy (Photo: PA) \nFull-time mum Kerry, 35, who has two other daughters, McKenzie 13, and Kelsey, eight, and a son John Paul, ten, blames herself for the drug taking. \nShe said: “I’m hardly mum of the year.” \nKerry admits she gave up on Leah as a newborn after becoming hooked on heroin. By the time she had turned her life around a year later Leah was living almost permanently with Kerry’s parents Ray and Ann in Wigan. \nSince then, Leah has moved ­between her mum, who moved to Liverpool, and her grandparents, ­attending four different secondary schools 20 miles apart. \nKerry said: “I blame myself all the time because I wasn’t always there for Leah. I should have brought her up. If I’d have been there maybe things would have been different.” \nTo Kerry’s great credit, she went cold turkey to come off heroin just after Leah’s first birthday. \nKerry says of the love in her family: “Mum and dad have done everything for Leah. They spoiled her. But she should have been with me. I should have been stronger and given her a more stable upbringing.” \nLeah said: “I could have died. It was so stupid. If only I’d listened to my mum and taken her seriously. All I can hope is that people now listen to me.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:08:19.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
