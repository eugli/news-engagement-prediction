Read more Turkish MPs back constitutional reform, triggering referendum on sweeping powers for Erdogan \nThe referendum will propose an 18-article amendment to the Turkish Constitution that has been long sought by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its founder, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \nChanges to the constitution need to be approved by at least 367 of the 550 members of parliament to become law. Proposals that receive between 330 and 367 votes should be put to a referendum. The current amendments were approved by 339 MPs. \nIf the Turkish people approve the changes, Erdogan will become the sole executive head of state, with the authority to choose his own cabinet ministers, enact laws, call elections, and declare states of emergency. His presidential term will last five years, and he can be reelected once. \nIn the meantime, according to Turkish media reports from January, the parliament’s oversight over the executive will be limited to a number of functions, including submitting written requests for information, initiating parliamentary inquiries, and holding “general meetings” to discuss issues relating to government actions. \nThe referendum date was announced by the head of the High Election Board on Saturday. \nErdogan claims that the legislation will provide stability, but his critics say it will put too much power in the hands of one individual and could pave the way to an authoritarian state. \nThe Turkish opposition, which is against the proposal, says the changes are merely a blueprint for a power grab. \nDETAILS TO FOLLOW ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:24:08.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
