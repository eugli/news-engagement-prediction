If their children have any concern about their overseas trips, it's not about their inheritance being spent, but whether their parents are being too adventurous. \nThey are planning a trip that takes in Dubai, Budapest, Bulgaria and Amsterdam – what Mrs Wawrzyniak described as \"one of our more sedate holidays\" – and they once travelled with an armed driver and guide to Libya. Advertisement \n\"We're confident enough to just go and do it,\" she said. \"I think it frightens our kids sometimes, but that's OK.\" \nMrs Wawrzyniak said she and her husband had \"worked huge hours to build up what we have behind us\" and their six adult children appreciated that. \n\"We were having a dinner one night with a number of the children and their families and the general consensus was, 'We've watched you two work and study so hard, and work huge hours, and we'd rather you spend it',\" she said. \n\"When people use the term spending the kids' inheritance, it's like the kids have an entitlement. I know a lot of young people nowadays have an expectation that mum and dad really should be saving for them.\" \nThe Seniors Abroad Survey, part of ASIA's Australian Seniors Series, found that 74 per cent of respondents typically went on at least one trip a year, with most saying travelling makes them feel alive (94 per cent) or is a great opportunity for self-discovery and personal growth (89 per cent). \nSixty-eight per cent felt seniors package tours were not for them, with 56 per cent branding them \"boring\" and 49 per cent saying they don't offer enough adventure – something to which the Wawrzyniaks can relate. \nMrs Wawrzyniak said tours made them feel \"we were being herded like cattle\", and they preferred to travel independently. \nShe remembered her father telling her to \"do the things that will give you pleasure while you're young enough to do it. When you get old, you simply won't be able to do what you've dreamed of doing\". \nDavid Beirman, a senior lecturer in tourism at the University of Technology, Sydney, said today's seniors were \"definitely breaking the conservative mould when it comes to their trips, and are far more adventurous than we give them credit for\". \n\"YOLO [you only live once] has become a tongue in cheek acronym but it's true, and is most true for those in the senior years of their lives,\" Dr Beirman said. \"It's only logical they would want to maximise their opportunity to live life to the fullest.\"​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:58:35.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
