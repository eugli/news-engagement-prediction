The volcano's latest eruptions began on Monday evening and eased off on Tuesday morning. The giant orange fountains of lava, spewing toward the sky, could be seen in the city of Catania and the resort town of Taormina. The volcano, one of the most active in the world, has been largely dormant for the last two years. The eruptions can last days and even weeks. Although volcanic ash clouds can cause flight disruptions, Catania airport, which is about 30 miles away from the volcano, was operating as normal on Tuesday. Authorities reported no danger to the towns that dot the mountain's slopes. Etna, at 3,330 metres (10,926 feet), is the highest volcano in mainland Europe and can burst into action several times a year. The last major eruption was in 1992.
