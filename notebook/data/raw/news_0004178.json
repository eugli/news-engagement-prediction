Related Future Islands Debut Hypnotic New Single on 'Letterman' Synth-pop band unveil Baltimore-dedicated track on 'Late Show' and release second new song \"Haunted by You\" \n\"What’s a song without you?\" singer Samuel T. Herring intones. \"When every song I write is about you.\" When Herring is in confessional mode, his urgency is unstoppable. He rides into his battles with an exposed heart. And \"Ran\" perfectly captures a familiar fight: the ticking fever of longing on an open road. \nThe Baltimore-based trio – Herring (vocals, lyrics), William Cashion (bass, guitars), Gerrit Welmers (keyboards, programming) – achieved breakthrough success in 2014 with their album Singles. Rolling Stone named Future Islands' lead track \"Seasons (Waiting on You)\" the ninth best song of 2014. The band's debut live television appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman went viral, becoming the show's second-highest viewed video on YouTube. \nNext week, the synth pop trio will make their late-night return on February 9th performing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon . The band also announced main stage sets Coachella, Panorama and Bonnaroo this year in addition to tour dates across Europe and the United States. \nTheir forthcoming album, The Far Field , was recorded with Grammy Award-winning producer John Congleton at the legendary Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles. Blondie's Debbie Harry is the only featured singer on the record, singing a duet with Herring on the rolling pop song \"Shadows.\" Future Islands' new LP 'The Far Field' will be released April 7th.
