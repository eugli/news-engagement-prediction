Their special show 'Golden Door' was held in Mumbai in aid of the Cancer Patients Aid Association . The 12th edition of Caring with Style Fashion Show was indeed special with Amitabh Bachchan walking the ramp.\nHe was accompanied by Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, and Sonali Bendre, who danced down during the closing walk. While the show was high on star quotient, we must say that Amitabh Bachchan stole the show. From his dance on Tamma Tamma to his kurta look, it was a pleaser for many.\nWhat a special night ! Thank you to #amitabachchan #varundhawan #aliabhatt #sonalibendre #suzzanekhan for #abujanisandeepkhosla #CPAA #caringwithstyle #walkingforacause #trendsetters #original #forever #thankyou #grateful @aliaabhatt @varundvn @iamsonalibendre @suzkr @amitabhbachchan\nA post shared by Sandeep Khosla (@sandeepkhosla) on Feb 26, 2017 at 9:41am PST\nMr. Bachchan was seen wearing a black linen flower work kurta with pleated palazzos, looking posh as always. We may not get to see Mr. Bachchan walk the ramp more often, but this one was indeed special and perfect for the cause. He even made a donation of 11 lakhs to CPAA.\nFor this special show, Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla concluded: \"We have been blessed with so much and consider it an absolute privilege to be able to give back by putting our creativity to the most beautiful of all uses. The empowerment of others, especially in their Right to Health.\"\n(Images courtesy: PTI)", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ-8mlggmwD/"], "published": "2017-02-28T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:42:17.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
