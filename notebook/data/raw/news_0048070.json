Why? \nLater, at the press conference you held together with Israeli   February 15, an Israeli reporter asked you about the alarming rise in hate crimes against Jews in the U.S. since the election. \nYou responded by citing your Electoral College majority and your aspirations to promote peace, stop crime and racism, and bring Americans together. \nYou mentioned “Jewish people, so many friends,” and noted the presence in the audience of your Jewish daughter, son-in-law, and “three beautiful grandchildren.” The press conference then veered off in other directions. \nIn other words, whatever else you said, you never answered the question. \nDuring another press conference the next day, a reporter respectfully, even admiringly, asked what you would do about rising anti-Semitism. \nTaking this as an accusation, which it most assuredly was not, you responded that you are  ,   \nMr. President, questions about anti-Semitism are especially timely now. On the very day you appeared with the Israeli leader, federal officials in South Carolina arrested a man suspected of planning an attack on a synagogue. \nOn that day as well, the New York City Police Department reported that, as of February 12, fully half—28 out of 56—of the hate crimes committed in the city since the start of the year were of an anti-Semitic nature, the only category of hate crimes that reached double digits. \nAnd this comes as we witness this week the fourth round of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers across the country, and as swastikas and other Nazi hate symbols have been proliferating on college campuses and storefronts, at bus stops and train stations across the country. \nFurther, during and after the election campaign, social media platforms have been flooded by anti-Semitic memes. Jewish journalists and bloggers have suffered harassment and ridicule, their names placed inside multiple parentheses to stigmatize them for their Jewish identity. \nAttacks on Jews constitute the largest category, both in the aggregate and proportionally, of religion-based hate crimes in the United States. \nNot surprisingly, purveyors of hate through social media do not always use their real names, and the recent proliferation of anti-Semitism surely cannot be attributed to any one source. \nBut the racist and white supremacist nature of much of it suggests that anti-Semites have been at least emboldened, if not openly supported, by the so-called alt-right, which inhabits the extreme of conservative America and lives on nostalgia for a fantasy of “the good old days” when our country was allegedly white, Christian, and Anglo-Saxon. \nPresident Trump, you are a real estate developer from one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, and, as you like to say,   around. Again, you proudly speak of the Jewish members of your immediate family. Yet, until now at least, you won’t comment on the threats that ultimately menace them every bit as much as the rest of us. \nIsn’t it time that you speak up, loud and clear, including against those who may have totally misconstrued your call to “make America great again” and put “America First” as invitations to turn against one another? \nAt the press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu, you told the reporter who asked about anti-Semitism that during your presidency there would be “a lot of good things” happening, including “a lot of love.” \nLove can do much good, but, contrary to the Beatles’ refrain, it is not “all there is.” To stop Jew-hatred, you must begin by calling it out and declaring it beyond the pale. \nThe U.S. has led the world in the battle for human rights and freedom of religion. In our country, we aspire to judge people on the basis of their character and deeds, not ethnicity or faith. \nMr. President, in the American spirit, we urge you to condemn what has often been called “the oldest hatred”—anti-Semitism ― and unleash the power of government to match deeds with words. \nDavid Harris is CEO and Lawrence Grossman is Publications Director of the   (AJC).
