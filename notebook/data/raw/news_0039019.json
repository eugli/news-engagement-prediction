We do hope that over the next quarter, we will give a reliable and accurate estimate. The writing on the slide is very clear.\" \n\nThe software body's chairman C P Gurnani said, \"If we wanted to give a guidance, we could have guided for 6-10% growth. But due to political uncertainties and state of our own industry due to digital transition, we have deferred guidance till next quarter.\" \n\nNasscom had lowered the forecast to 8-10% (in constant currency) for 2016-17, from 10-12% that it had provided at the beginning of the financial year. The move was widely expected, given that company after company was reporting lower than expected revenue growth. Unexpected outcomes in the Brexit vote and the US presidential election had created a lot of uncertainty, resulting in delayed decision-making and deferment of IT spends. Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research , said that the IT services market is in a state of flux because of Trump 's impending executive order on H-1B visas and other potential immigration issues. \"However, despite the uncertainty, it should be possible to factor these in and make some predictions,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:33:54.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
