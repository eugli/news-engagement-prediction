Position players report Feb. 20, with the first full-squad workout on Feb. 21. \nThe trucks are provided by UPS, which streamlined the packing process of uniform trunks and luggage by placing the equipment on pallets so it would be easily loaded by forklifts. â€” Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) February 9, 2017 \nEach truck holds 20 tons of gear, which includes computers and front-office supplies and even a 1,500-pound bobblehead of Hall of Fame manager Tom Lasorda, which normally resides at the Lasorda Italian Restaurant behind the right-field pavilion at Dodger Stadium. \nGame equipment such as baseballs and bats will be drop-shipped directly to Arizona by manufacturers. \nFor the third year, in addition to the personal items of players and employees, the trucks carry loaded pallets of drinking water and every bit of clothing every player would wear on the field.
