My personal opinion is the Warriors have probably sounded the death knell for this for Auckland city and the NRL will be very keen to take this elsewhere.\" \nAfter four years, Lonergan said the Nines had outstayed its welcome in Auckland and it was time for it to be brought to Australia. \n\"It's probably time to go elsewhere,\" he said. \n\"Maybe Brisbane, maybe Melbourne, maybe Perth. Who knows? The NRL will be the major determiner of that.\" - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:36:58.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
