You just have to hope for the best. But you can expect it when you live on the river.\" James Fipps takes his dogs for a walk on a makeshift raft Tuesday in Lakeport, Calif. (Kent Porter/AP) \nThe water released from Don Pedro is expected to reach its peak along a stretch near Vernalis that's already at danger stage, said Tim Daly, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. The water isn't expected to spill over the levees but rather increase pressure on them, causing possible breaks in any weak places. \nFarther south, the Anderson Dam in Santa Clara County reached capacity over the weekend and after heavy rain it began overflowing into the Coyote Creek. \nRescuers chest-deep in water steered boats full of people, some with babies and pets, from a San Jose neighborhood inundated Tuesday by water from the creek.

Only residents who could prove they had been cleaned of the floodwaters were allowed to board buses to shelters. \n\"The water started to seep in the driveway, and then it started to creep up into the front door. It kept getting worse and worse,\" said Alex Hilario, who walked in knee-high water to get to his car and leave. A fish marker floats on to Esplanade Street off Clear Lake in Lakeport, Calif. (Kent Porter/AP) \nEarlier Tuesday, firefighters rescued five people stranded by flooding at a homeless camp along the same creek in San Jose. \nFirefighters knocked on doors to tell residents to get out of their homes because the city does not have sirens or another emergency warning system, San Jose spokesman David Vossbrink said. \nThe rains were the latest produced by a series of storms generated by so-called atmospheric rivers that dump massive quantities of Pacific Ocean water on California after carrying it aloft from as far away as Hawaii.

(Kent Porter/AP) \nIn the Sierra Nevada range, one of the main routes to Lake Tahoe was in danger of collapsing after a roadway shoulder gave way following heavy storms, leaving a gaping hole on part of Highway 50, Caltrans engineer Jarrett Woodruff said. \nCrews opened one lane Tuesday as Caltrans workers tried to fix the road failure after numerous mudslides blocked it for days in recent weeks. \nThe water level rose at Lake Oroville for the first time since authorities ordered an emergency evacuation of 188,000 people more than a week ago after a damaged spillway caused major flooding concerns. \nThe rains have saturated the once-drought stricken region and wreaked havoc for residents hit hard by the heavy rain. At least four people have died in the storms throughout the state in the last week.
