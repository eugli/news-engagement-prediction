Five males against 100 females, the seventh decrease since 2009. \nZhai Zhenwu, a sociologist at the Renmin University of China, said the continued imbalance was caused by the development of ultrasound technology in the 1980’s, which aided the traditional family preferences for a son, the People’s Daily report said. \n“The family planning policy which also promoted late birth had the negative effect on increasing the desire for people to select the sex of their child. \nCoupled with new, cheap and safe sex determination and selection technologies, this made the existing preference for a son become a reality,” Yuan said. \nChina bans any testing for gender or selective abortion over gender preference. \nData released by the National Bureau of Statistics on January 20 shows that Chinas male population reached more than 708 million at the end of 2016, while the number of females was more than 675 million. \nChina’s sixth national population census in 2010 showed that unmarried Chinese women above 30 years old accounted for 2.47 per cent of the female population - almost two times higher than the figure reported in the 2,000 census. \nYuan cautioned that recent trends of more well-educated Chinese women choosing to remain single will exacerbate the situation. \n“Besides the marriage issue, a high single male population might also cause many other social problems such as sexual violence, women and child trafficking, not to mention the pension burden they will bring about when they get old,” Yuan said. \nThe National Health and Family Planning Commission said early this month that China would reduce its sex ratio at birth to 112 boys for every 100 girls by 20. \nAlready the widening sex ratio prompting rural Chinese men to marry women from neighbouring east Asian countries like Vietnam. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:56.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
