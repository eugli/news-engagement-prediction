Stay with us.\nKey Events PM dodges the question as Corbyn warns one in SIX A&Es set to be downgraded 12:09 Fury as hospital by-election petitioner told: \"Come back after Thursday\" 12:04 12:12 \"No answer\" TWICE from Theresa May Corbyn demands to know if the target of 10,000 nurse training places was met after bursaries were axed.\nAnd once AGAIN, the PM completely fails to answer.\n“No answer,” says Corbyn, on social care.\n“No answer,” he says, on nurse places.\n“In reality 10,000 fewer places have been filled because there are fewer applications,” he says.\nThere’s a shortage looming of 3,500 midwives in England and the nursing staff levels are “in crisis”.\n12:10 PM demands Corbyn apologises for \"destroyed\" Surrey claims Jeremy Corbyn moves on to the claims of a ‘sweetheart deal’ for Surrey Council, which scrapped a 15% council tax rise after secret talks.\nBut the defiant PM storms: “Those claims were utterly destroyed the same afternoon.\n“Rather than asking the same question he should stand up and apologise!”\nMr Corbyn replies: “It’s the PM who ought to be reading her correspondence and reading the letter from 62 council leaders... who want to know if they’re going to get the same deal as Surrey.”\n12:09 KEY EVENT PM dodges the question as Corbyn warns one in SIX A&Es set to be downgraded Jeremy Corbyn says the BMA warns 15,000 beds have been cut in six years - the equivalent of several hospitals.\n“The PM claims the NHS is getting the money it needs. So why is it that one in six A&E units in England are set for closure or downgrading?”\nOnce again slippery Theresa May does not answer the question.\nInstead she says there are more of certain numbers of staff in the NHS.\n“What it needs is more doctors. We’re giving it more doctors.\n“What it needs is more money. We’re giving it more money.\n“What it does not need is a bankrupt economy, which is exactly what Labour would give it.”\n12:06 “Why is the Prime Minister’s government cutting the number of beds in our NHS?” Jeremy Corbyn’s first question is simple.\n“Why is the Prime Minister’s government cutting the number of beds in our NHS?”\nThe PM doesn’t address the numbers.\nInstead she says the average time spent in hospital has been slashed thanks to advance in technology.\nShe says during one period in Labour’s administration, 25,000 hospital beds were cut.\nShe adds that ex-Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham: “What I’d cut are hospital beds.”\n12:05 Theresa May faces groans from Labour as she accuses them of “doing nothing” to address the schools funding system.\nThere are shouts of opposition from the opposition - they don’t like that.\nSome primary schools are set to lose out.\n12:04 KEY EVENT Fury as hospital by-election petitioner told: \"Come back after Thursday\" And we’re off! Theresa May’s first question is from the Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi.\nShe is furious that MP Sue Hayman, who was delivering a petition on hospital cutbacks in Copeland, was turned away at the gates of No10 yesterday.\nShe was apparently told: “Today isn’t a good day, come back after Thursday.”\nThis is a “disgraceful dismissal of the people of Copeland”, the MP says.\nBut Theresa May snipes back that although the MP was turned away her petition WAS accepted.\n11:46 Jack Blanchard The Morning Briefing While we wait for PMQs to kick in, why not get up to speed with the Mirror Politics Morning Briefing?\nIt never rains but it pours. Especially if you’re Jeremy Corbyn.\nVoters in Copeland go to the polls tomorrow, with the by-election absolutely in the balance.\nLabour are protecting a small majority of just 2,564 from the Tories – which in normal times should be plenty for an Opposition party to resist any challenge from the Government.\nBut these are not normal times.\nLabour are 18 points behind in the national polls . The result is on a knife edge.\nYou can read the full Morning Briefing - and sign up to get it in your inbox every morning - here\n(Photo: Getty) 11:32 Batting order A pre-by-election bust up It’s a big week for Jeremy Corbyn.\nTomorrow will see Labour defend two crucial by-election seats in Stoke Central and Copeland.\nAnd before that he’s got to get through today’s PMQs. But will he use the prime-time platform to raise key issues for the campaign?\nThe NHS is a favourite topic for the Labour leader at his weekly clash with the Prime Minister - and Copeland’s local maternity ward is under threat of closure or downgrade, something Mrs May repeatedly refused to address on a visit to the region.\nMeanwhile, Ukip leader Paul Nuttall’s campaign to take the Stoke Central seat away from Labour is increasingly in disarray - with party donor Arron banks ‘sticking by’ his incendiary comments about Hillsborough.\nWe’ll have all the action and reaction from PMQs as it happens.
