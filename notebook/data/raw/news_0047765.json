Photo: Bloomberg \nIn the opinion piece, Mr Turnbull did not say he supports recognising Palestine, something several Labor elders, including former Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Bob Hawke, have done in recent days. \nLabor Leader Bill Shorten has said he will confront Mr Netanyahu about Israel's planned expansion of thousands of new settlement units in the West Bank during their discussion this week. \nThe Israeli government has also recently passed a law legalising settlements on privately owned Palestinian land. \nThe Jewish and prominent pro-Israel Labor MP Michael Danby says the Israeli Supreme court would overturn the government's \"silly\" new law. \nHe said he did not agree with Mr Rudd and others in calling for Palestine to be recognised now and attacked the Labor elders for their stance. \n\"I might say to the heroes who are beating up on a democratic country, why don't they beat up on China when the Chinese President comes to Australia? \n\"Where is Bob Carr, Gareth Evans and Bob Hawke when the terrible things that are happening in Tibet are discussed?\" \n'They never raise their heads to power, they want to try and provoke the Israeli Prime Minister and upset relations between him and the Labor party prior to Netanyahu's visit,\" he said. \nThe government is hoping to highlight Australia's economic ties with Israel during Mr Netanyahus' visit and not just on the conflict with Palestinians. \n\"We will discuss expanding cooperation in cyber-security, innovation and science, agri-tech, energy and resources, and the environment,\" the prime minister said in a statement. Australia has a landing pad in Tel Aviv for entrepeneurs hoping to tap into Israel's booming start-up scene. Mr Turnbull said he would sign an agreement on Technological Innovation and Research and Developments and one on Air Services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:23:29.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
