After the two were separated, Sabres defenceman Justin Falk took a high-speed run at Burrows and bowled him over.\nLehner, Falk and Burrows were penalized for roughing, and Vancouver's Bo Horvat scored on the ensuing power play by deflecting Ben Sutton's shot in.\nMichael Chaput scored twice and Horvat added an assist, helping the Canucks to their second win in seven games. Jacob Markstrom stopped 26 shots filling in for starter Ryan Miller, who allowed four goals on 30 shots in a loss to Boston on Saturday.\nTyler Ennis and Kyle Okposo scored for Buffalo, and Lehner had 27 saves.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-13T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:59:09.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
