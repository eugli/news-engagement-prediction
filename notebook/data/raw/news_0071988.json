Sure, every 'Ye-designed model sells out instantly without fail, but having more than one shot to maybe get your hands on a pair helps keep some hope alive. Unfortunately, you might not be so optimistic with this weekend's newest Yeezy Boost 350 V2 release. \nAdidas surprised sneakerheads and Yeezy disciples with the news that this Saturday, yet another Yeezy Boost 350 will hit shelves—but only those owned by Adidas (both physical and digital—it is 2017). That means this time around there are no raffles or Instagram contests to be won. Why would the athletic giant want to mess with a good thing? One reason might be that production of the \"Zebra\" colorway is a limited production run, meaning there aren't enough pairs to stock all off Adidas' thirt party doors as well as their own. What it really means is that these will be harder to get than any other Yeezy Boost 350 V2 thus far, which only makes them more covetable. \nThere is some good news: the scarcity of the sneakers won't affect the price. The latest Yeezy release will still retail for $200. And what you get for two Benjamins is a fresh spin on the already-classic kick, including a striped upper that's most similar to the first tan and orange 350 V2 that debuted in 2016. However, like the \"Core Black\" before it, the \"Zebra\" pairs feature a back tab that was featured on the original Yeezy Boost 350s, but was not included on the first two V2 releases. \nThe only way to get a pair of the Yeezy 350 V2 \"Zebra\" sneakers is to 1) scoop them up through Adidas's (sometimes frustrating) Confirmed app or to try your luck on Saturday on adidas.com/yeezy. Registration for the sneakers is open until tomorrow at 12PM EST, and the drop will take place at 4PM. \nIf the Confirmed App proves unsuccessful, adidas.com/yeezy will be another source of hope—and likely an equally as brutal hair-pulling exercise. On drop will likely happen around 11PM. You could also wait a few months until the all-new Yeezy Runners hit retailers, which truthfully are a welcomed change of pace from the hyper-futuristic styling of the Yeezy Boost line. Below are a few useful tips for attempting to buy the kicks online. Just know that with bots and the backdoor efforts of certain sites likes Yeezy Mafia, buying the sneakers through legitimate could prove to be a futile task. And with more scarcity, don't be surprised if these new Yeezys fetch $1,000+ online. Anyway, good luck! How to Be a Better, Faster Online Shopper \nCheck Your Internet Connection Check out Speedtest.net to see how fast your internet is actually running. Then call your Internet provider to correct any issues or upgrade to the highest of high-speed connections. When thousands of ravenous customers all crash a website, even the smallest fraction of megabyte speed can make the difference. \nUse the Buddy System If you really want these shoes, increase your odds by telling some friends and family to try their best to get them at the same time you are. But don’t inundate them with tons of information, because chances are they don’t care. Simply send them a link, a specific time, the size you would like, and your credit card information. \nType Your Credit Card Info into a Word Doc You don’t want to be the idiot who gets the sneakers in his cart, only to realize you can’t find your wallet. Write all of the info in a Word document, then simply copy and paste. \nResist the Urge to Refresh Once a link goes live, remember that the site will be slow. There are way more people on the site than at any other time, all vying for a handful of sneakers. But the way these systems work is in order, so all refreshing will do is kick you to the back of the line. Be patient, hold your place, and make attempts to add your size to your cart about once every minute. Feverishly clicking on the same link won't help. \nOr, Don’t Do Any of This Sleep in, wait ’til these kicks hit the aftermarket, and pick them up for $1,000+ tomorrow afternoon. The choice is yours.
