One bidder had made the trip from Japan in person. We examined the decoration to the collar and felt that it lacked sophistication of these early pieces Mark Huddleston, Fellows \nF ellows Senior specialist, Mark Huddleston said: \"Two buyers in the room battled each other strongly before, at around the £600,000 mark, the final telephone left standing sparked into life. There was a lot of interest through the online bidding platforms as well. \n\"Finally at £800,000 the final bidder in the room admitted defeat, and with the next bid the telephone bidder, via his translator, secured the lot - to a round of applause for the auctioneer and Managing Director, Stephen Whittaker.\" \nFellows claim their low price originally came from the seller but they were also dubious that it was the real deal. — Fellows (@FellowsAuctions) February 25, 2017 \nMr Huddleston said \"We are delighted with the house-record sale of the Chinese wucai vase. This vase was consigned via a Chinese client. \n\"Initial research when cataloguing had pointed to a number of historic precedents sold in the tens and hundreds of thousands. \n\"We examined the decoration to the collar and felt that it lacked sophistication of these early pieces. \n\"Whilst we dealt with a number of condition enquiries before the sale, little could have prepared us for the result. \n\"Bidding began at £1,000 and, with a handful of telephone bidders plus the usual hundreds online, predicting the final price became impossible. \n\"The most gratifying aspect is that a number of bidders were actually in the saleroom and had viewed it in person. \n\"One bidder even flew in from Japan and has a number of these in his collection.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:06:50.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
