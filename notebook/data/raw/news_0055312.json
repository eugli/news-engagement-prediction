And on any given day, the scents and smells of those faraway countries emerge from pots and pans such that the air is pregnant with cardamom and coriander from Nepal, turmeric and cubeb from Iraq, and daqqa , Aleppo’s famous seven-spice powder, which Carmen uses in her specialty, hashwe, a traditional rice stuffing studded with ground chicken. \nThe idea for Eat Offbeat came to Manal Kahi and her brother, Wissam, shortly after Manal arrived from her native Lebanon to study environmental management at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. “I couldn’t find any good hummus,” she says, “so I began making it myself.” Among the graduate students, her hummus caused a sensation. But, she says, “I knew my grandmother could do better.” This was in 2013, shortly after the Syrian Army launched the deadly Aleppo offensive, and it quickly occurred to Manal, whose grandmother is Syrian, to seek out refugees to make food from their home countries—the dishes that are part of their cultural identity—as a way of preserving and promoting it. And why constrain it to the Middle East? she thought: “There are refugees from everywhere, and they are often from places not well represented in the culinary scene.” © Megan Swann \nEat Offbeat officially launched in November 2015. Already, it has served more than 15,000 meals to companies and universities, families and nonprofits, to groups of 10 to 700 people. One of the reasons for the success, says Manal, is that “people want to help.” She notes, with a faint smile, “Some people find us by Googling ‘How to help refugees in New York.’” They come back, however, for the food. “We always emphasize,” she says, “that our cooks are refugees by status but chefs by nature.” \nOver the past year, the menu at Eat Offbeat has been refined and iterated, and the skills of the cooks honed with the help of chef Juan Suarez de Lezo, a tall Spaniard who spent time in the kitchens of El Bulli, Arzak, Mugaritz and Per Se. As Eat Offbeat’s chief culinary officer, he has helped train the cooks to operate in a professional kitchen; to say “behind” when passing another cook and “hot” when holding something straight out of the oven; to boil, drain and rinse garlic three times in order to dull its potency but retain its sweetness; to keep their stations clean; and to portion a homemade recipe for a party of 300. But, by and large, what these women use day in and day out is the intuitive and unadulterated knowledge from their homes. \nAs a rule, each chef at Eat Offbeat learns how to prepare the recipes of her fellow chefs. Rachana, a mild-mannered cook from Nepal, might be mixing the berbere spice used in an Eritrean lentil stew, while Mitslal, who is from Eritrea, might be rubbing rosewater on phyllo dough for Carmen’s baklava. But sometimes it doesn’t work that way. “No one can make potato kibbeh like Dhuha does,” says Manal, watching as a pretty 29-year-old with jet-black hair drops perfectly formed croquettes of ground beef wrapped in potato dough into bubbling oil. As the kibbeh turns brown and crispy, Dhuha explains that she’s been making it this way since she was a little girl in Baghdad. “My mother taught me,” she says, “and her mother taught her.” The trick, she says, pushing her palms together and slightly rotating them, is in the formation of the patties for the right density and shape. It took years of sitting at the same kitchen table in their apartment, making kibbeh for birthdays and graduations, marriages and anniversaries, for the movement to become automatic. \nWhen Dhuha came to America, she left everything behind. She couldn’t bring her parents or the table or her kitchen or its view. But what she could bring was the secret to making tremendous kibbeh. It’s not home, but it’s a gesture of home. Sometimes a gesture is all that remains, and it’s nourishing just the same. eatoffbeat.com . \nF&W contributing editor Joshua David Stein is author of the children’s book Can I Eat That? and co-author of the cookbook Food & Beer .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:56:50.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
