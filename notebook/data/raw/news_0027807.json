I think I'd be too frightened to live anywhere in the bush again,\" Ms Rice said. \nLast year the Rices were married in the church in Uarbry. \nAll that is left of it now is the bell and the stairs. \n\"We chose to get married here and have our reception in the dance hall â€” both are now gone,\" Ms Rice said. \n\"It doesn't even look like a village anymore.\" \nThe couple said that as they were driving out of town it looked, in the rear-view mirror, as though \"an inferno (was) coming towards us\". Putting cattle down 'heartbreaking' \nAt Leadville, the home that NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) volunteer Murray Coe grew up in is gone and he has lost dozens of cattle. \nMr Coe was out defending other properties when his was wiped out. \nHe said the fire was \"horrendous\" and like nothing he had seen during his 40 years of service. \nMr Coe said seeing the fire's effect on his livestock was the most traumatic part. \n\"It's been devastating to see the cattle in the state they are in,\" he said. \n\"Putting them down ... that was heartbreaking for me.\" Fire danger expected later this week \nAcross the valley,flames surrounded Saxon McGregor's home while he was out volunteer firefighting, but he saved it just in time.

(ABC News) \n\"There were smouldering embers, there was a fire in one of the gutters and we managed to put all of that out... had it been another half hour or hour we would have lost it,\" he said. \nThe Insurance Council of Australia has declared the bushfires an \"insurance catastrophe\" and the council estimates losses to be at least $20 million, with claims still coming in. \n\"We'll be able to get a much better idea of the extent of the damage in the coming days and weeks,\" the council's Campbell Fuller said. \n\"People should take photos of damaged property when it was safe to do so and speak to insurers before authorising any repairs.\" \nThe RFS says the emergency is not over yet with weather conditions set to worsen later this week. \nRFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said severe fire danger ratings may develop in the south of the state on Thursday. \n\"That's expected to contract further northward and we're likely to see elevated fire dangers throughout the affected fire areas,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:12:23.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
