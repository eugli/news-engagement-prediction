Camping gives me a chance to unwind, catch up on reading and just enjoy some peace and quiet. However, I know there are those of you who would be bored by too much solitude. And, many actually prefer to be entertained, at least some of the time. I'm happy to say that there are Florida campgrounds that can offer the best of both worlds. These really unique campgrounds cater to campers who enjoy specific activities and even enjoy being entertained, but you can still find a quiet place to unwind when needed. \nFarmer's Opry \nWaking up to the sound of a rooster is just the beginning of a unique \"country\" camping experience in Florida's Panhandle.
