The next two hosts will be decided in 2018. \nREAD MORE: Jess Herbst, transgender Texas mayor, has had ‘overwhelming support’ \nThis month’s Super Bowl was expected to bring the Houston area a net economic benefit of around $350 million, according to the Host Committee. The Dallas-area city of Arlington hosted the 2011 Super Bowl in the stadium where the Cowboys play. \nTexas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican who is the main backer of the Texas bathroom bill, has downplayed talk that the state’s economy would suffer if the measure became law. He was not immediately available on Friday to comment on the NFL statement. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:11:19.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
