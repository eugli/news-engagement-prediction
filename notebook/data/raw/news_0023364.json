CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. \n“Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood — perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East — as a terrorist organization,” the editors charged. \nThis is silly. \nThe mosque that was attacked in Canada recently “was founded by followers of the Muslim Brotherhood and donated money to front organizations that directly support terrorists groups like Hamas, via Gateway Pundit . \nIf it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.
