His sentence is due to end in October. \nLast year, he became the unenviable face of the Indigenous youth detention crisis engulfing the territory. \nIt was the disturbing footage, aired by the ABC’s Four Corners program, of Voller and several other Indigenous boys being brutalised by detention centre staff that prompted prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to set up the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory. ABC ID: 10456330 \nOn Thursday the Northern Territory Supreme Court approved Voller to be bailed to BushMob, a residential program for young people with substance abuse issues. \nVoller will participate in the four-month program and must adhere to 16 strict bail conditions, after which a judge will assess his suitability for early release. \nWhen he steps through the doors of BushMob’s nondescript compound in an industrial area on the outskirts of Alice Springs it will be history repeating itself. ID: 10455327 \nVoller was a 12-year-old boy the last time he was in the care of BushMob. \n“We had him here around 2012, 2013”, Will MacGregor, the CEO of BushMob, tells BuzzFeed News. \n“The problem then was the lack of follow-through care. Government agencies that were meant to look after him dropped the ball. He was completely set up to fail by the system,” MacGregor says. Young people attending BushMob's program. Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed ID: 10453899 \nFor Voller, who has spent only a year and a half out of custody since the age of 12, BushMob is the last hope of turning his life around. \nThe question now is whether BushMob’s brand of hands-on therapy will be enough to undo the damage caused by an adolescence behind bars. \nBuzzFeed News spent time at BushMob in Alice Springs and met a handful of young Aboriginal people who’ve experienced more trauma in their short lives than most Australians will in a lifetime.

I started drinking just to let the memory [of being beaten] go. She hit me a lot, she’s in jail [now],” Martin tells BuzzFeed News. \n“I got burnt by cigarette butts a lot, she bashed me a couple of times.” Top : Shaznay Martin riding a horse as part of BushMob’s programs.

Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed ID: 10456386 \nMartin is one of the thousands of young Aboriginal people in the NT who can’t see a way out of poverty and trauma. \n“I got in trouble by the police for walking the street and I was a smartass to them cops. Some of them are racist and they swear a lot. They call us a black mutt… I got locked up in the watch-house” Martin said. \nBut Martin’s criminal career was cut short when the court agreed that she could attend BushMob’s 16-week course. \n“Now I got a job at KFC. It feels good to work. BushMob saved my life. I am proud of myself,” Martin says before jumping on a horse and cantering around Love’s Creek, a property owned by BushMob. \nHorse riding is part of BushMob’s Apmere Mwerre program, which takes some of the NT’s most troubled young people to the vast East Arrernte farm to work. \n“If they weren’t here they would be in Don Dale [detention centre] or juvie somewhere else or in town running amok,” Eileen Bloomfield, a traditional owner of Love’s Creek who oversees the Apmere Mwerre program, said. \n“They find out here there’s more to life than walking the streets, sniffing [fuel and inhalants] and getting in trouble with police.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:04:05.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
