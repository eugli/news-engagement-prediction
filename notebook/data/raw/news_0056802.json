REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo \nWASHINGTON The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, but the four-week average of claims fell to its lowest level since 1973, pointing to strengthening labor market conditions. \nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Feb. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new claims for unemployment benefits rising to 241,000 in the latest week. \nThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better \nmeasure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week \nvolatility, fell 4,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest reading since July 1973. \n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) Next In Business News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:58:24.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
