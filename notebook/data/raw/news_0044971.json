An entire span of the walkway (pedestrian bridge) fell on to the highway (see videos below). Some vehicles were trapped and one person was reported injured. \nThe accident occurred about 11am near kilometre marker 50 in tambon Tha It of Ang Thong's Muang district, in front of a petrol station on the North-bound side of the highway . \nNo further details were available. \nThe question that still remains unanswered is: was the truck carrying too much or was the bridge built too low? \nThe accident bears an uncanny resemblance to an accident outside of Don Muang Airport not so long ago when the load that a truck was carrying hit and damaged the pedestrian bridge outside the airport (see here & photo below). \nPassing motorcyclists look at the 22-wheel truck after the accident . The failed hydraulic system that controls the truck bed can be seen projecting up from the truck bed. \nAlthough this week's accident is arguably more freakish than most, more horrific accidents involving construction equipment involved out of control cement trucks in Chiang Rai and Krabi killing twelve people in total a week or so ago (see here and below). \nThe wreckage of the van hit by a cement truck in Chiang Rai. (Photos from Facebook of NattyRescue ChiangRai) \nSometimes, drivers escape miraculously unscathed from horrific construction equipment accidents as was the case in a cement truck crushes a taxi cab accident with photo below (see here ). \nA cement truck hit the back of a taxi waiting for a green light and pushed it under a public bus, crushing the taxi.
