Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nTwitchy readers might remember Keegan Stephan . Back in December, we did a post on a tweet of his accusing “4 or 5” Trump supporters of attacking “about 20” Black Lives Matter protesters after an event in New York City. Some of my friends got jumped by Trump supporters when leaving a #BlackLivesMatter event in NYC last night. pic.twitter.com/QKCNiuy2iC \n— Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) December 18, 2016 \nBack then, we — and many others — asked for more information about the attack questioned why there was no police report filed: 20 people attacked by four trump supporters. what's the police report tell us? https://t.co/Ygke268mN2 \n— GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) December 18, 2016 \nAnyway, Stephan popped up this morning in our timeline with this sad news to report: My bike was just stolen from 5th Ave. & 12th St. Please share & keep an eye out. Exactly as pictured. #BikeNYC pic.twitter.com/mFsoBxKGZ4 \n— Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) February 22, 2017 Trending Report: Obama unimpressed by 'too unflashy' design of his new library, which could cost $1.5 billion \nStephan might not get his bike back, but he thinks the thief will occupy a “special place in hell” in the afterlife: I don't believe in an afterlife but I firmly believe there is a special place in hell for bike thieves. \n— Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) February 22, 2017 \nCoincidentally, Stephan — who is need of the NYPD right about now — just yesterday went on a rant against the NYPD for the way they’re policing cyclists in the city: Great job to our NCOs for making 2 arrests for Reckless bicycle riding in #NewDorp just now! #BicycleSafety #NCO #122Pct pic.twitter.com/DFk0euD0J2 \n— NYPD 122nd Precinct (@NYPD122Pct) February 21, 2017 There is so much wrong with this I don't even know where to begin. #BikeNYC #VisionZero . https://t.co/9XX2kEF396 \n— Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) February 22, 2017 Cyclists kill ~0 NYers a year and you're ARRESTING people for \"reckless bicycle riding\"? #VisionZero fail. #BikeNYC . https://t.co/9XX2kEF396 \n— Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) February 22, 2017 This is neighborhood policing.
