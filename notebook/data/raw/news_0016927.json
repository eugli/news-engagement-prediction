(Harry How/Getty Images) \nI won’t hold it against Keegan Bradley, but I still shouldn’t have put myself in the position to sweat it out. \nHindsight being what it is, here I find myself nonetheless, lamenting that I shouldn’t have ruled out that Bradley wouldn’t have been distracted by his New England Patriots gearing up for Super Bowl LI. After all, he’s been a mainstay at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. If anything, I should have been encouraged that his two best finishes – a T15 in 2012 and a T17 in 2015 – occurred in the last two years the Patriots advanced to the National Football League’s championship game. \nThis time, however, Bradley missed the cut. Yes, the two events are mutually exclusive, but I’d have been happier with my decision if I went with someone else as my pick and he won versus the reality. Don’t get me wrong, I love being lucky as much as anyone, but I don’t like making foolish decisions even if I’m the only one who thinks they’re foolish. \nSpeaking of which, the way the weather sets up for this week’s AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am could yield another, but a simple examination of what’s expected should direct you into one of two approaches. This is unusual for a one-and-done, but it’s necessary because the tournament is contested over different courses in the first three rounds. \nBottom line, you should decide when you want your pick to play the easiest and hardest courses. The weather will improve as the week prolongs, but the wind will still be a factor through Saturday. \nAs I explained in Tuesday’s Fantasy Insider, in relation to par, since joining the rotation in 2010, MPCC has been the easiest and Spyglass Hill has been the hardest, but when weather was last below average (2014), Pebble Beach scored highest. Interestingly and somewhat relevantly, of the 12 golfers who finished inside the top 10 in the 2014 edition, each course hosted exactly four in the third round when the weather was at its worst for the week. \nScores of the four on each: \nMPCC = 67, 69, 70, 72 Spyglass Hill = 69, 71, 72, 72 Pebble Beach = 70, 70, 72, 78 \nAverages of the four on each: \nMPCC = 69.50 (-1.50) Spyglass Hill = 71.00 (-1.00) Pebble Beach = 72.50 (+0.50) \nGranted, those are small sample sizes, but they are in line with the overall scoring. What’s more, that four survived the host course in the worst weather and still posted a top 10 gives us some peace of mind if we’re stuck on choices who open there this week. \nThe fact is, most of the notables always rotate to Pebble Beach on Saturday, which is the case again this year. The difference is that the expected severity of the weather is opposite to what it was three years ago. So, I’m encouraged to invest in the rotation that gets Pebble on Saturday this week. \nRotations: \nR1) MPCC; R2) Spyglass; R3) Pebble R1) Spyglass; R2) Pebble; R3) MPCC R1) Pebble; R2) MPCC; R3) Spyglass \nAll of the following in my Power Rankings open on MPCC: Jason Day, J.B. Holmes, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose, Webb Simpson, Brandt Snedeker, Jordan Spieth and defending champion Vaughn Taylor. So, that’s my pool. \nAgainst the competition, I’ll eliminate Taylor right off the bat, although he’s intriguing in two-man games. I’ll also put back Day, DJ and Spieth for usage when weather isn’t a factor and perhaps when more FedExCup points are available. In fact, I might holster all three for the Playoffs. \nWhile Rose sits atop my Power Rankings, he’s yet to tackle the trio of tracks under sour skies. I want experience here and in these elements. I’ve written about and planned to burn Mickelson at the FedEx St. Jude Classic, but he’s getting the call this week. He’s played here in everything and anything. \nIf Snedeker didn’t struggle here in 2014, I’d probably have gone with him. Walker won that edition and opens on Pebble this week, so Sean will be putting my theory to the test. Certainly, it would help our confidence if Walker’s recent form was better. \nBefore you go save your selection at FantasyGolf.PGATOUR.COM , be aware that the PGA TOUR Champions is back in action at the Allianz Championship .
