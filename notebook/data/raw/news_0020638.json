Trump praised the Turkish leader's handling of the coup in a July interview with the New York Times . \"I give him great credit for being able to turn that around,\" he said. The Trump administration's controversial travel ban, enacted in January 2017, has become another point of difference between the two countries. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek posted on his official Twitter on January 29 that refugees were welcome in Turkey . \"We'd happily welcome global talent not allowed back into #USA,\" he wrote. Safe zones But Trump will need close relations with Turkey if he is going to enact one of his campaign promises to create \"safe zones\" in the war-ravaged country of Syria. Syria 'safe zones': Is Trump's proposal viable? The Trump administration has yet to detail exactly what the safe zones will entail but, given Turkey's close proximity and military involvement, the US President will need their help. \"Trump's safe zone plan relies on Turkish cooperation and Trump has said unequivocally there will be safe zones,\" Shanahan said. \"There's a potential political win-win in this and Erdogan would know that it's a bone he could throw Trump for better relations at a relatively minimal cost.\" The two leaders are expected to meet face-to-face at the European summit of NATO leaders in May, which Trump attend despite his previous criticism of the security pact.
