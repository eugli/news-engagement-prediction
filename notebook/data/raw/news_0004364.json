PUBLISHED: 03:42, Sat, Feb 4, 2017 | UPDATED: 04:04, Sat, Feb 4, 2017 \nThe debt-ridden EU state faces a critical few weeks as pressures rise from the US and Germany for it to meet the conditions agreed in Greece’s bailout package almost seven years ago.Negotiations between Athens and its creditors have come to a standstill, with bond yields skyrocketing.

GETTY The Greek prime minister's party, Syriza, has reportedly discussed breaking from the EU. \nPantelis Kapsis, a prominent Greek political commentator, told the Guardian: “I am very worried we are heading towards a rupture with the EU.“There are lots of signs that at the back of their minds people in Syriza are entertaining various ideas of going it alone.”Mr Kapsis added: “What is sure is that we are entering a very difficult period which quite possible could lead us to a point of no return.” GETTY The German chancellor was expected to hold talks with Tsipras at the EU summit in Malta on Friday.

If an agreement isn’t reached, if there is yet more uncertainty, we don’t know how Greeks will react.In July Greece will have to repay €7.4billion to its creditors, who have demanded the country be given additional austerity measures once the current bailout expires. \nThe International Monetary Fund has argued the country will never be able to reach its agreed goal of a surplus of 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2018, thanks to reductions in pensions and the tax-free threshold of personal incomes.But Tsipras blasted back at the IMF’s demands in a fiery parliamentary debate last Wednesday, arguing they go \"beyond any democratic and constitutional logic and value”.The IMF’s board will discuss the issue formally on 6 December, but has already suggested it will be unable to contribute further loans without a commitment of debt relief from the EU.
