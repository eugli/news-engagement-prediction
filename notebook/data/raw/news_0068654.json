He had previously been in foster care in B.C. for about a year after an investigation determined that his parents were not adequately taking care of his medical condition.\nHe was returned to his parents in 2005 and the family moved from B.C. to Alberta, where court heard that Alex did not see a doctor or go to school.\nThe Crown stated during the trial that the Raditas didn’t believe in Alex’s diagnosis, saying that “Alex was doomed and trapped by the two people with the power to save him.”\nThe defence said the couple didn’t mean to kill their son and the Crown hasn’t been able to offer any evidence of intent to kill.\nJustice Karen Horner said that Alex's death was 'unnecessary and completely avoidable' and that his murder was 'planned and deliberate.'\n“This was a really difficult case for all involved. The facts that Justice Horner found were such that you really did see the magnitude of Alex’s suffering. How long it was and how extensive it was and this verdict reflects the magnitude of that suffering and reflects the magnitude of the crime that was committed,” said Prosecutor Susan Pepper.\nPepper says the evidence shows that the social safety net in Canada failed Alex.\nThe Raditas were handed a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years.\nRelated Stories Photos released at trial for Calgary couple accused of killing diabetic son Defence delivers closing arguments in Radita murder case Trial to begin for Calgary parents accused in teenager’s death Parents face homicide charges in death of son Daughter takes stand in trial of Calgary couple accused of murdering diabetic son Photos Police escort Emil and Rodica Radita to the CPS arrest processing unit in February 2014\nAlex Radita was 15-years-old when he died of starvation and untreated diabetes in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:55:25.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
