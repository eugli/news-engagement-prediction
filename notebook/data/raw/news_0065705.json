Dallas center Andrew Bogut will go to the 76ers in the Noel trade too, league source tells @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 \nAccording to multiple reports, Dallas will send Justin Anderson, Andrew Bogut and a protected first-round pick to Philadelphia in the deal. Andrew Bogut and Justin Anderson and conditional first-round pick will be traded from Dallas to Philadelphia for Nerlens Noel, sources say \n— Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 23, 2017 \nAccording to Marc Stein of ESPN, the pick is protected for draft slots 1-18 in the 2017 draft. Andrew Bogut is in the trade to Philadelphia and Dallas' pick is protected 1-to-18 in the June draft, league sources say \n— Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 23, 2017 \nDallas currently holds the seventh pick in this year’s draft. To lose the pick to Philadelphia, the Mavericks would have to catch the current team with the 19th pick, the Oklahoma City Thunder, who are 9 1/2 games ahead of them in the standings. \nThe trade is a huge get for Dallas in search of young talent. Noel was blocked in Philadelphia by the presence of other talented big men Jahlil Okafor and Joel Embid. He is averaging nine points and five rebounds in 19 minutes per game this season. \nThe 22-year-old Kentucky product is a restricted free agent this off-season and Dallas has the right to match any offer he signs. \nThe Mavericks lose a former first round pick in Justin Anderson and an uninterested Andrew Bogut in the deal. \nAnderson showed flashes of potential in his first three seasons in Dallas, however, they weren’t as frequent as the Mavs would have liked. \nThe 23-year-old Virginia product gets a fresh start in Philadelphia after he’s been restricted to an end of the bench role behind another young player in Dorian-Finney Smith. \nBogut, who had no interest in being here after the team started out 4-17, goes to Philadelphia where he’ll likely be traded or bought out. \nBogut averaged 3.0 points, just over 8 rebounds and block per game with Dallas in 26 games. Anderson was averaging 6.5 points and 2.9 rebounds in 13.9 minutes per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:45:49.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
