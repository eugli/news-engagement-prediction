Poultry industry is one of the most organised in Nigeria and one of the most important. Input of the industry are maize and soya beans and because of what happened sometimes last year about the invasion of Army worms on maize farms, we have a huge shortage of maize and soya beans in the country. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:12:05.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
