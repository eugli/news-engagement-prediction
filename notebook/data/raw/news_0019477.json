He is not yet through his second season and he is putting up points at a torrid pace. He is a shot maker – he was 17-of-24 on Friday night. He continues to be an unselfish player – he had five assists. And he has smiled and joked through this entire magic carpet ride. \n“I need to thank my teammates because they pass me the ball,” Jokic said. “In that third quarter they said ‘throw him the ball inside!’ I said, ‘Oh, they trust me.’” \nAnd why not? They knew he’d delivered, and Jokic did. \nHe scored 18 points in the third quarter, displaying a killer scoring instinct that belies his mild-mannered personality. The Knicks could not stop him. Couldn’t even come close. Jokic made 7-of-9 shots in the third quarter, and generally owned the paint all night long. He made 13 of the 16 shots he attempted around the rim. \n“He had one stretch where it seemed like he scored 15 straight,” Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur said. \nBOXSCORE: Nuggets 131, Knicks 123 \nArthur has never wavered on Jokic’s potential, saying last season as he is again this season that Jokic is a star-level talent. \n“He is a very special player,” Arthur said. “I saw it early last year. He’s a tough guard. I don’t know how anybody can guard him. He makes the offense 10 times better when he’s out on the court. He makes everyone better – and he’s still getting better. He’s only 21 years old.” \nJokic has 13 games of 20 or more points. He’s got three of 30 or more. And he’s got Friday’s career-high 40 points. Nuggets coach Michael Malone is done with the ‘he’ll be a star’ talk. He’s already there, the coach said. \n“I don’t think he is a star in the making,” Malone said. “He is a star. His numbers back him up. He’s is doing it, and he is doing it against really good players; other All-Star level players. He is going to get everything he deserves because he works hard and he is a great kid.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:41:36.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
