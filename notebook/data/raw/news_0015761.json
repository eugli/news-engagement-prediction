PSORIASIS - THE INCURABLE SKIN CONDITION THAT CAN WRECK CONFIDENCE Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back but can appear anywhere on the body. It can start at any age. The severity of the condition varies from person to person, for some causing a minor irritation, while for others it has a major impact on their quality of life. Psoriasis is a long-lasting, or chronic, condition that involves periods when a sufferer will have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by more severe outbreaks. While the condition is not fully understood, it is thought the increased production of skin cells is related to a problem with a person's immune system. For those suffering with the condition, their immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake. Psoriasis can run in families and there is thought to be a genetic element to the condition. Many sufferers will experience symptoms following a certain event, a trigger. A trigger can include injury to a person's skin, throat infections and using certain medications. The condition is not contagious, so cannot be spread from person to person. While there is no cure, a range of treatments can be used to improve symptoms and the appearance of the affected skin patches.
