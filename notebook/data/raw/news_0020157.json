Last week, a federal judge in Seattle blocked the order’s implementation nationwide . \nBut the hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, could be a bellwether for the order’s legality ― as well as an important test for the limits of executive authority over immigration and the power of courts to check that authority. \nWashington Solicitor General Noah Purcell is representing the states of Washington and Minnesota in urging the 9th Circuit to keep the travel ban on hold until a later time, while August Flentje is urging for its reinstatement for the Trump administration and the Department of Justice. \nPrior to the hearing, a court representative for the 9th Circuit announced that a ruling in the case is not expected until later in the week. \nYou can listen to a live feed of the court hearing above or at this link . \nThis is a developing story.
