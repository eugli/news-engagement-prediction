We’ve got great coaching staff and people in administration roles. \n“The club’s in really good hands and the future looks exciting.” New Fremantle captain Nat Fyfe.

He led us well under difficult circumstances,” Lyon said. \n“But as Nathan said when he spoke to the players, it is a transitioning list. \n“We’re aiming high and in a different situation to the year before. We had a more mature list and were coming off a strong year in 2015. \n“We’re transitioning, and it talks to an emerging leader who can be with the group for a long period.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:05:57.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
