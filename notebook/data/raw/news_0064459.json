They'd had kids in the back of their car.\" \nMr Rose was taken to hospital where doctors feared he may have had a collapsed lung. \nHowever, he was soon released with only minor injuries to his hands. \nTheir son was supposed to accompany Mr Rose to the shops but had stayed behind. \n\"Anybody in the passenger seat would have been sliced through the middle, so we've had two miracles really,\" Ms Rose said. \nThe horse was killed in the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:22.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
