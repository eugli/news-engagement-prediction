The union said nine of those are permanent employees who could be transferred to other jobs within government. Thirty-nine are casual staff on a seasonal recall list. One is involved with special projects.\nMill River resort, attractions, to be sold to Blue Jays founder Mill River could rival Cavendish, says Don McDougall\nCurrent wages at Mill River Resort range from $18.50 to $35.40 an hour, according to the union. (CBC)\nIn January, the province announced it was selling the resort — which includes a golf course, hotel, campground and fun park — to Don McDougall.\nMcDougall, 79, is originally from the area. His business resume includes a stint as the president of Labatt Breweries. He was also the founding director of the Toronto Blue Jays.\n'Priority consideration' McDougall told CBC News outgoing staff would be given \"priority consideration\" to be hired back, providing they are \"in good standing … and they're interested in coming back to work for us at private-sector wages, as opposed to government wages.\"\nMcDougall said the wages offered would be \"industry standard or above.\"\nThe current wages range from $18.50 to $35.40 an hour, according to UPSE.\nExtensive renovations The union said it plans to apply to the P.E.I. Labour Board to be able to continue to represent workers at the resort.\nMcDougall said some positions would be lost as the fun park is decommissioned, but said there would be more jobs created as the resort undergoes extensive renovations over the next 30 months.\nA government spokesperson told CBC News the layoff notices were expected by staff, and as far as government is aware, the transition between owners \"is going quite smoothly for the employees and we haven't heard any serious concerns.\"\nConfederacy looking to block sale Meanwhile, the Mi'kmaq Confederacy said it has retained legal counsel and is preparing an application for an injunction to block the sale of the resort.\nChief Brian Francis of the Abegweit First Nation said a formal public statement would be issued within days.\nMORE P.E.I.
