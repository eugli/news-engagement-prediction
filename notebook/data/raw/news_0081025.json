(Joe Skipper/Reuters) Court documents filed Monday allege that five auto companies were aware of defects that caused Takata air bags to potentially harm or kill motorists but continued to use them to save on costs.\nThe documents filed by lawyers representing victims and their families claim that Honda, Ford, BMW, Toyota and Nissan have known about the issues with the Japanese manufacturer’s air bags for more than a decade but used the air bags anyway because Takata was cheaper than its competitors and could produce the bulk quantities the automakers needed, according to the court documents.\nThe allegations come as Takata entered a guilty plea in a federal courtroom Monday as part of its agreement with the Department of Justice . That deal, reached last month in the final days of the Obama administration , required the company to pay $1 billion in fines and restitution. In December, three Takata executives were indicted on wire fraud charges.\nThe largest portion of the penalty, $850 million, will be paid to automakers that incurred billions of dollars in expenses recalling vehicles and replacing air bags. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which sets automobile safety standards , recalled more than 64 million air bags in 42 million vehicles, making the Takata recall the largest in U.S. history.\nTakata also agreed to set up a $125 million fund for the families and individuals affected by the faulty air bags as part of the Justice Department deal.\nThe device that inflates Takata air bags was found to explode in certain instances, sending shrapnel into the cabin of the car. The defect has been blamed for 11 deaths and roughly 180 injuries in the United States, according to NHTSA, as well as others around the globe.\nThe allegations raise new questions about who should shoulder blame for the deaths and injuries the air bags caused.\nThe agreement reached with the Justice Department claims that Takata deliberately omitted or falsified data to make its air bags appear safer, then passed the doctored information on to automakers. Automakers have said that deception should exonerate them of liability.\nBut the documents filed Monday say automakers nevertheless had independent information that the air bags were faulty and chose to continue installing them in millions of vehicles.\n“For the automotive defendants to call themselves victims insults the real victims here — hundreds of people who have been seriously injured or killed by a device that was [supposed] to protect them, and tens of millions of vehicle owners who have been forced to bear the risk of such injury and incurred substantial economic damages,” the documents say.\nToyota and Ford declined to comment on the accusations.\nIn court documents, lawyers allege that Honda was “intimately involved” with the design of Takata’s air bags and that at least two air bag inflaters ruptured during testing at Honda’s facilities in 1999 and 2000. Honda used the air bags anyway, according to the court documents, and at least 77 air bags ruptured on the road before the company implemented a nationwide recall.\nHonda called the allegations that it used the air bags despite safety concerns “categorically false” and pointed to the Takata settlement as evidence that automakers were misled to believe the product met safety standards.\n“The reality is that when Honda learned of the risks that these air bag inflaters presented, Honda reacted promptly and appropriately by issuing safety recalls and replacing the affected Takata air bag inflaters at no charge to its customers,” the company said in a statement.\nRead more from The Washington Post’s Innovation section .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:24:38.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
