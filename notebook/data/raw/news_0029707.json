It definitely gives you confidence as well. There's a reason why we're number one and that's because we're playing good cricket.\n\"We've got a bit of unfinished business there from the 2015 World Cup and we're very keen to play good cricket against a team that has also been playing well.\n\"I think we deserve to be number one and we want to carry on playing the way we have been.\"\nDe Villiers said he expected a tough challenge.\n\"New Zealand are a street-smart team and they find ways to compete but we have a decent record there. The last few tours we have been there we have played really good cricket.\"\nFaf du Plessis , who will captain the team in the T20 international as well as a three-match Test series which follows the one-day games, said overcoming jet lag would be the immediate challenge for the squad.\n\"Normally we go there and we've got about a week to ten days to get over jet lag. We rested a lot of players from our (losing) T20 series against Sri Lanka but we still should have won. All our players are back now and we've got an opportunity to perform well in a once-off game.\"\nCoach Russell Domingo said: \"Schedules are so tight these days but we can't be seen to be making any excuses. We want to start the tour playing good cricket.\"\nSouth African limited overs squad: AB de Villiers (one-day international captain), Faf du Plessis (T20 international captain), Hashim Amla , Farhaan Behardien , Quinton de Kock (wkt), JP Duminy , Imran Tahir, David Miller , Chris Morris , Wayne Parnell , Dane Paterson, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:35:03.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
