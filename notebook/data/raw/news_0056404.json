'Honest and courageous' \nMr Bekjanov's release on Wednesday was reported by relatives and a local human rights group. \nHe was tried in connection with a series of bomb attacks that shook the capital Tashkent in 1999. Image copyright HRW Image caption Mr Bekjanov is seen here in an undated photo \nHe had fled Uzbekistan for Ukraine, where he edited pro-opposition newspaper Erk from exile, but that country extradited both him and Mr Ruzimuradov, a reporter for the same paper. \nBack in Uzbekistan, the two men were tried and convicted on a host of charges including publishing a banned newspaper, trying to overthrow the government and involvement in bombings. \nBoth had their sentences extended while serving them. \nMr Bekjanov's health reportedly deteriorated while he was in prison. \nHis daughter Aygul Bekjanova told the BBC in 2014 that when her mother visited him two years earlier, she had found him in a terrible state, suffering from tuberculosis and with most of his teeth missing. \nIn December, the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists reported that he had been moved to solitary confinement. \nAn official from Human Rights Watch , the US-based international campaign group, said at the time that Mr Bekjanov's \"only crime was to have done his job in an honest and courageous manner\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:56:31.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
