PHOTO COURTESY: IDI \nKARACHI: Former Pakistan T20I captain Shahid Afridi has been kept unaware of Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) round table conference which is scheduled for March 6 and 7 in Lahore to discuss the betterment of national teams. \nAfridi, while talking to the media after an award ceremony held in Karachi for the throwball team which won silver medal said: “I am not aware of the conference; I have heard it from the media that PCB has invited current and former Test cricketers.” Afridi backs Sarfraz to captain Pakistan in all formats \nHowever, he added that it was a good step. “If it is happening, then it is a really good step by PCB to discuss cricket affairs with former players,” he said. \nThe 36-year-old said he is available to be a part of the meeting. “I am always available for cricket and for my country. If PCB calls me I’ll give my maximum input, otherwise, if they don’t then I have my foundation running well,” he said. \nPSL a good opportunity for youngsters \nThe second edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) kicks-off from February 9 in the UAE and Afridi said he had a lot of hopes from the tournament. Afridi asks Chappell: ‘Did you watch’ Pakistan beat Australia? \n“PSL is giving chances to young players and I hope to see some talent emerging which can be accommodated in the national team,” he said. \nHe also praised PSL chairman’s move to hold the final in Lahore. “PSL is made for Pakistan so more and more matches should be held in Pakistan especially in big cities of the country to promote the game,” said Afridi. \nTalking about the new captain of PSL franchise Peshawar Zalmi, Afridi said that West Indies World T20-winning captain Darren Sammy will prove to be a good prospect for the team. Shahid Afridi rescues 30 Pakistani prisoners detained in Dubai \n“I hope that he will lead the team to victory. No team can be taken lightly after looking at the result of the previous edition where the team which was losing won the league,” he said. “So we will go with full confidence and will try to win in this edition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:23:16.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
