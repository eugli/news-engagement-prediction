A former Illinois State Police facility on Cicero Avenue in Crestwood is being transferred by the state to the village. (Mike Nolan / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy \nCrestwood will soon be the owner of long-vacant property previously used as an Illinois State Police facility. \nThe building and land is at 13863 S. Cicero Ave., across the street from Crestwood's Village Hall and just north of Midlothian Turnpike. A public act signed recently by Gov. Bruce Rauner calls for the village to pay the state $1. \nCrestwood will take formal ownership of the land in a matter of days, but what the village will do with the property hasn't yet been finalized, according to Mayor Lou Presta. \nThe site is about 21/2 acres and has sat unused for more than a decade, Presta said. The property is wedged between a used-car lot and a school bus operator. \nCrestwood first started talking with state police about the property more than two years ago, the mayor said. The aged building and parking lot have fallen into disrepair, and Presta said he hoped the village could begin soliciting bids to raze the building within two months. \nThe public act approved by the Legislature then signed by Rauner last week requires that Crestwood use the land for public purposes, so no commercial development could occur there. If the site isn't used for a public purpose, ownership would revert back to the state, according to the act. \nPresta said that new facilities for the village's police and fire departments are possible uses for the land, but that \"the main thing is finding the money\" to build. Both departments are housed on the other side of Cicero near Village Hall. The village also is in line to get its own ZIP code, and Presta said that a post office could be sought for the property. \n\"The fire department could use more room, as (well as) the police,\" the mayor said. \nHe said the village would explore the possibility of obtaining grant money, such as through the Department of Homeland Security, for new public safety facilities. \nPresta said that commercial growth in the village will require additional fire and police services. \nThe next big untapped area eyed for commercial development is property owned by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, both east and west of Cicero Avenue between the Calumet-Sag Channel and Cal-Sag Road/Route 83. The property in total is about 60 acres, and Crestwood has been in talks with developers interested in bringing stores and restaurants to part of the land, northeast of the Cicero/Cal-Sag Road intersection, according to Presta. Although the MWRD won't sell land to developers, it will agree to a long-term lease, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:12:58.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
