'He is determined to try and help as many people as possible not go through all the suffering he has and also improving our poor treatment options here in the UK.'

'We plan to fight against this and try and get some awareness and help for not only us Lyme sufferers but for everyone. Things must and will change.' Kirk's first event will see him host a £45 lunch with Pied a Terre head chef Andy McFadden at L'Autre Pied in Marylebone at 1pm on Sunday. WHAT IS LYME DISEASE? Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. Some also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness, muscle pain, headaches, fever, chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early. These range from pain and swelling of the joints to problems affecting the nervous system, facial paralysis, meningitis and heart block.
