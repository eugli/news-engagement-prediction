And Shell Shocked. Then throw in a little Caged and Confused, plus a game of In the Trenches and Who's Got Balls for good measure. Who'd come out on top? \nFirst, let's review the men: There's self-proclaimed alpha male Cody , who's proven to be self-assured, smart, focused and, oh yeah, just a little bit ruthless . Then there's Cody's brother from another mother Chris , whose competitive streak already caused him to call his fellow campers \"Cub Scouts and little bitches.\" (LOL, come on, that was funny.) There's also TV reporter Alex , who showed immediate team leadership by organizing a few campers to start a fire and work on a shelter -- but got dissed when Cody glanced at his thin frame (and that questionable turban/baseball cap combination) and dismissed him as \"the definition of a goober.\" (Come on, that was kind of funny too). Next up: Eagle Scout Michael , who boasted that he plays three sports and is a \"force to be reckoned with\" -- but swiftly sold his soul (and spent $15K behind his peers' backs) for hamburgers and French fries when faced with the show's very first \"Temptation.\" Army vet Alonzo , meanwhile, seems strong and committed to bringing the prize money home to his favorite girl -- aka Mom. \nAs for the women? Working mom Eilish showed enough gumption to stand up to Cody when she felt he disrespected Gina , and Ashley seemed as comfortable in the jungle as one can get when bats are flying overhead at night. But Gina and Makani haven't fared as well: Both crumbled from the pressure and shed some tears, suggesting both will struggle to make it to Day 40. And Bria -- the aspiring model who proclaimed she'd be the \"bad-ass bitch of this jungle\" -- lasted just three days and two hours before throwing in the towel and heading home. \nBut hey, she could still get a second wind and give Johnny Bananas a run for his money someday. \nSo with all that in mind, who do think has what it takes for The Challenge ?
