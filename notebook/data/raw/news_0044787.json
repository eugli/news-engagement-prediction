Her latest victim? Jennifer Lopez. While asking whom she spent Valentine's Day with, the talk show host showed this famous photo of her with Drake taken last December . \"This guy right here? Was it this guy?\" Ellen asked.\nA post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Dec 27, 2016 at 11:38pm PST\n J. Lo, who did break her silence on their \"relationship\" on the Grammys red carpet , stuck to her same story. \"We did a song together, if that's what you're asking,\" she said, \"We're just hanging out. He sent me a song that he wanted me to be on. And then I got on the song. I don't know what he's going to do with it, but yeah.\"\nNot a totally satisfying response, but Ellen did pry a little more about the rumor that J.Lo likes to date younger men.", "external_links": ["http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a42989/jennifer-lopez-talks-drake-grammys-red-carpet/", "http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a41696/drake-jennifer-lopez-instagram/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BOjX-u4D_en/"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:23:36.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
