Ntsiki Mzwai shades Adele's 'humiliating' Beyoncé dedication \n\"It is not because of a lack of promotion. We have tried but albums that were released around the same time are receiving radio play while Brian's latest singles are not, \" Brian's manager Motlatsi \"Moz\" Motseoile added. \nBrian was a little more direct in his response to the perceived snub, accusing music bosses of ruining the industry by illegally paying for music to be playlisted - a practice commonly known as payola. \n\"I get scared sometimes because of this industry of music. You have music moguls killing our industry by paying to be playlisted on high rotation and sometime real music gets overshadowed by bubblegum music,\" Brian said in a heartfelt Facebook post on Monday. \nHe said that he had reflected on his music and fan's response to his new album and was proud of his achievements, but was a little disheartened. \n\"Music fortunately doesn't allow me to quit, but if I was weak, I would quit,\" he added. WATCH: What Trevor Noah thinks of the ANC leading SA \nSABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago told TshisaLIVE that the broadcaster took accusations of payola seriously and was committed to ensuring that the practice did not take place at the station. \nHe further added that playlists were decided by each station according to what they felt was appropriate for their audience. \n\"Each song has to be submitted to a station for consideration. A committee will then look at a number of factors, including whether the song is any good and whether it fits in the target market of the station. If your music fits the criteria, it will be playlisted,\" Kaizer said.
