While Keah wasn't exactly expecting her tweet to start a thing, #DisabledAndCute took off: People with both visible and invisible disabilities, of different races, sexual orientations, and genders, responded by posting their own photos with Keah's hashtag, on Twitter and beyond.\n#DisabledandCute cutest shawty with RA you'll see (hands don't always work but I keep em up) pic.twitter.com/qJ2rleKpKO\n— 9ine (@noshaidah) February 15, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n#DisabledandCute Shoutout to all my ♿️ sisters out here pic.twitter.com/TXsEJHk6U6\n— Unruly ♿️ (@Eliza_Heidi) February 12, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Celebrating body positivity, acceptance, visibility & joy with #DisabledAndCute \"you're so brave\" nah, I'm just dope #disabled #SayTheWord #bodypositive #plussizefashion #bbw #effyourbeautystandards #bodypositivity #plussize #disability #amputee #disabilitypride #wheelchair #curvygirl #curvy #gabifreshxswimsexy #disabledrightsarehumanrights\nA post shared by Danielle Perez (@divadelux) on Feb 12, 2017 at 7:17pm PST\n#disabledandcute I'd prefer handsome, but cute will suffice. ♿️ pic.twitter.com/AMEcS7zday\n— Ajani 'AJ' Murray (@gotnextaj) February 15, 2017 #DisabledandCute is an actual hashtag yasss I love it.
