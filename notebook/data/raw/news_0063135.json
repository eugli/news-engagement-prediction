May says businesses hit by rate hikes will get help \nAnd “by 25, the same child can expect to bring home £14,457.12 worth of income from full-time and part-time work, handouts from mum and dad, selling unwanted items, and rewards,\" the study suggests. \nTracie Pearce, HSBC UK’s Head of Mortgages, commented: “The findings are really quite astonishing. We have shown that it is possible to get onto the property ladder reasonably quickly, even by the age of 25. \n“For parents, the key is to start saving for your child early and to encourage a savings habit so when they are old enough to make financial decisions by themselves, they can see the benefit of saving towards their first home. \n“We’re not suggesting that children and young adults shouldn’t spend any of their pocket money or enjoy themselves, but they should be aware of what money they have and receive, and regularly save some of it.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:46:21.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
