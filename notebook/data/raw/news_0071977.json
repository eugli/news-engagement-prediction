Finally, ECS appealed with the state in August 2016, and the charter appeal board — which included state education Secretary Pedro Rivera — voted 5-1 in favor of the plan today. \n“We’re excited to begin this new phase of growth, which will allow us to extend our unique programming to even more students and families in the city of Pittsburgh. We look forward to partnering with the Pittsburgh Public Schools to continue to bring high quality education to our city,” Jon McCann, CEO of ECS, said in a news release. \nECS now operates a K-8 school in two buildings, a lower school for grades K-3 in the former Park Place School and an upper school for grades 4-8 in the former Regent Square School. It has proposed opening another K-8 school at the district’‍s now-closed Fort Pitt building in Garfield and a 9-12 school in the former Letsche School in the Lower Hill District. \nPPS solicitor Ira Weiss could not be reached for comment. \nCharter schools are public schools that are chartered by local school districts but have their own board. School districts must pay a fee set by the state for each student who attends. \nMolly Born: or 412-263-1944.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:49:46.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
