Luckily, the players themselves managed to liven it up with some funny antics on social media.\nMoussa Dembele could have become the star of the transfer window after Chelsea were linked\nAlex Bruce told one Aston Villa fan he was on his way to Real Madrid only to end up at Wigan\nMario Balotelli showed his appreciation for the female presenters during deadline day\nMario Balotelli was one of many who noticed a distinct lack of transfer but found another reason to tune in. He tweeted in Italian: 'The girls on Sky Sport Calciomercato are certainly more interesting than the signings being made.'\nCeltic star Moussa Dembele threatened to become the star of the window when Chelsea considered launching a last-minute ¬£30m bid for him. Speculation only grew when he was spotted on a flight to London.\nThe former Fulham man, who only joined the Hoops in the summer, put those rumours to the sword when he tweeted a picture of himself alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the Wolf of Wall Street.\nNice striker Balotelli finds another reason to watch Sky Sports despite the lack of activity\nItalian sports correspondent Daniella Matar agreed with Balotelli on his flirtatious observation\nHull defender Alex Bruce confirms he won't be joining his father at Aston Villa in comic fashion\nHis Hull team-mate David Meyler gets a bit overexcited at news that Nani might be joining\nWhat else ? üíöüíöüçÄüçÄüçÄü§ê pic.twitter.com/Zp4IQRmjPH\n‚Äî Moussa Demb√©l√© (@MDembele_10) January 31, 2017 The picture he chose was taken from the scene when DiCaprio - playing former Wall Street trader Jordan Belfort - states, very clear, he is 'not f leaving'. Although a subtle reference, enough Celtic fans got the link.\nThere was also plenty of good humour surrounding Hull City despite the Tigers being one of the most active of Premier League clubs throughout the window.\nDavid Meyler tweeted Valencia winger Nani directly to ask him where he was following reports that the Tigers had launched a late bid to sign him.\nThen, Hull defender Alex Bruce told one hopeful Aston Villa fan that he was on a flight to Madrid when in actual fact he was on the road to a very different place... Wigan.\nIn the past, Sky Sports presenters hanging outside training grounds have had to cope with the unsociable antics from local fans but those at Stoke City found themselves being heckled by none other than midfielder Marko Arnautovic.\nNo more signings at Stoke according to Marko Arnautovic and his drive-by heckling. üòÇ #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/GbAbGMp48f\n‚Äî Soccer AM (@SoccerAM) January 31, 2017 When you realise it's #DeadlineDay & there's 7 Premier League fixtures on tonight. https://t.co/ckBTDlltTQ\n‚Äî Footy Humour (@FootyHumour) January 31, 2017 You know what time it is #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/kCe6OJKPhj\n‚Äî JOE.co.uk (@JOE_co_uk) January 31, 2017 It was not just players who were messing about. Former Manchester United centre back and BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand posted a spoof video claiming he had just been signed up by Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce.\nThe Eagles, as we later found out, were in the market for defensive reinforcements but Ferdinand may have been a touch out of practice considering he retired 18 months ago.\nFinally, Bristol City threw a bit of banter to their local rivals Bristol Rovers after signing their star Matty Taylor, the first player to bridge the divide in 30 years.\nThey tweeted a message with the hashtag 'Making Bristol Proud', surely knowing that half of the city would be less than impressed with his decision.\nI've had the call... U-Turn drives...
