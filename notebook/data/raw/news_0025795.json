It’s harder to believe I’ve been a Patriot for 17 years! What happens on that field with my teammates, in front of our family and fans, is almost impossible to describe. It’s mythical for me, and yet it’s real. And it’s why I’ll never stop as long as I’m able.” A photo posted by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 12, 2017 at 3:51pm PST \nIf his Super Bowl performance is any indication, Brady will be able to play for the foreseeable future. The 39-year-old threw for a Super Bowl-record 466 yards, helping New England score 31 unanswered points to stun the Falcons. Brady won his fifth ring, the most by a starting quarterback in Super Bowl history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:29:44.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
