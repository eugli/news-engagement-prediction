The feedback of voters who exercised their franchise suggests that the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is leading the race. \nWith the polling for the first phase of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections completed today, the feedback of voters who exercised their franchise suggests that the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is leading the race. \nUttar Pradesh witnessed 64 per cent of voting in the first phase poll. The polling began at 7 am in the morning for 73 Assembly constituencies spread across 15 districts. \nAccording to Resource Development International’s (RDI) report, the BJP will become the numero uno party in the first phase. The Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will be at second position while the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance is not likely to get a positive response from the voters. The findings were first published by Dainik Jagran website. \nThe region is crucial to the BJP because it swept all the 12 Lok Sabha seats in Western UP in the 16th general election. The other important thing to be noted is that BJP-led NDA government has three Union Ministers from the region – Mahesh Sharma, Retired General VK Singh, and Sanjeev Baliyan. \nThe interview was conducted in 38 sampled Assembly constituencies which went into the poll on February 11. The constituencies were sampled using probability proportional to population method. \nIn each of the sampled constituency, 10 polling booths were chosen using systematic random sampling method. Exit interviews with 15 voters coming out of each polling station were conducted . The voting question was administered using a secret ballot. In total 5,700 interviews were conducted across 380 polling booths.
