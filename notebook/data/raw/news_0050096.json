Vishwa Hindu Parishat (VHP), Hindu Jagarana Vedike (HJV) and Bajrang Dal, which have opposed Vijayan's visit, has now added one more protest to its series by organizing a rally from Jyothi Circle to deputy commissioner's office on February 24. Later, Sangh Parivar workers will hold a protest near DC office, stated VHP zonal working president M B Puranik and Bajrang Dal zonal convener Sharan Pumpwell. \n\nSharan told TOI the hartal on February 25 will be voluntary and he asserted Hindu organisations have not called for a bundh in the district. \"It is an irony that Kerala CM, who heads a party that is engaged in killings and violence, is scheduled to deliver talk on communal harmony. We have requested people of the district to participate voluntarily in the hartal opposing killings and violence by Left in Kerala. We have requested all educational institutions, bus owners, auto rickshaw owners, drivers, hotel owners, workers, students and office-goers to participate in the hartal,\" Sharan said. \n\nExtending their support, Sri Ram Sene regional president Anand Shetty Adyar said the organization will join hands with VHP, HJV and Bajrang Dal to oppose Kerala CM's visit to Mangaluru. \"We have no objection in Left party holding a communal harmony rally in the city. However, Vijayan should not be allowed to take part and deliver speech,\" he added. \n\nMeanwhile, DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla said CPI(M) leaders have met chief minister Siddaramaiah seeking protection for the rally planned by the party. \"We have requested CM and police chief to ensure protection for the programme. We will hold the rally with Kerala CM as the main speaker in the city as per schedule without fail. There is no question of changing the decision,\" Katipalla said adding it is the duty of the government and police to ensure security. \n\n\"We will not react even if Sangh Parivar men resort to violence against us. We have requested the police to take stern action against those who are trying to stop us from organizing the harmony rally,\" he added. \n\nMuneer released a list of over 200 CPI (M) and DYFI leaders, who were allegedly killed by RSS in Kerala. Hindu organisations too have claimed that several innocent Hindu activists have allegedly been killed in Kerala by Left party men.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:28:41.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
