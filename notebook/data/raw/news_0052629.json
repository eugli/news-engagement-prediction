Said to be the first of its kind in the country, APU is also the first university in the country to feature such establishment. \nTo be jointly managed by APU and eSM, the academy will mainly act as platform not only to develop professional gamers but also other professionals within the eSports eco-system. Such roles include event management, coaches, shoutcasting, referees and others. \nAmong activities that academy has planned to help reach its objectives are game tournaments, seminars and industry talks. Other than that, the academy also aimed to connect local competitive gaming professionals and organizations with the global eSports industry and talents.
