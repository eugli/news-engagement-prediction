Through exaggerated Kangol-style hats, Seventies-worthy platform boots, big gold pendants and a synthesis of street style spanning from the Sugarhill Gang to OutKast, his collection was a reminder that revolutions begin in the street. At precisely 2 PM, the first models walked out in what Jacobs called his \"representation of the well-studied dressing up of casual sportswear. It is an acknowledgment and gesture of my respect for the polish and consideration applied to fashion from a generation that will forever be the foundation of youth culture street style.\" He was speaking specifically of the hip-hop generation of the '70s, '80s and '90s. 2 Of 165 Marc Jacobs \nThere were the standards of American style: jackets, sweaters and denim in long, fluid Seventies silhouettes—the kind seen just around the time hip-hop took root, co-opted these styles and created a whole new subculture. Here, argyle sweaters, menswear checked pants, giant fur coats and frilly lingerie walked with swagger and exaggerated excess.

But broken down, the clothes were everyday: v-neck sweaters in blue, maroon, camel; zipped knit toppers; cashmere pants left a little loose (tailor at will), and a lineup of great leather bags. Even the tracksuit, à la Run DMC at its prime. 4 Of 165 Marc Jacobs \nJacobs always puts extra effort into outerwear, and there were a ton of options here. Shearling-collared coats hit the right note of nostalgia while Fair Isle-meets-bomber looks offered something new. The designer did not back away from fur, either, showing half fur-half tweed toppers and giant fur chubbies that were, to use '80s hip-hop vernacular, tight. Imaxtree 5 Of 165 Marc Jacobs \nThis season saw Jacobs philosophical, political and tired of jumping through hoops. Like other designers before him, he just wanted to design clothes he loved and present them without frenzy. He politely asked that his audience refrained from taking pictures (Busted, anyone who posted pics from the show. You know who you are.), and after the models lapped the runway, they sat outside on marked fold-up chairs—like the ones the guests sat on—and took pictures of the guests as they left. How's that for a fashion 180? Imaxtree 6 Of 165 Ralph Lauren \nWhen Ralph decides to give a woman flowers, he doesn't half-ass it. It's not in his vocabulary. For his presentation, he transformed the uptown Madison Avenue Ralph Lauren flagship into a garden of greenery and orchids, a graceful stage from which he launched a collection (available right afterward) of neutral-toned ready-to-wear that for Lauren-ites work in Manhattan, Easthampton and Kenya.

Lauren varied his silhouettes to give his clients variety but kept the earthy palette consistent, adding in leopard totes and satchels, snake platform sandals and bold, tribal metal necklaces to anchor it all. Getty 8 Of 165 Ralph Lauren \nThere's always an element of leather and denim chez Ralph, this time seen in sexy motorcycle pants, a jumpsuit and a great belted jacket worn with harem pants—all black-on-black. Getty 9 Of 165 Ralph Lauren \nThe silk road continued for evening, with a bevy of lustrous long gowns in crushed monotone silk or subtle florals. In a few places, Lauren brought in an exotic theme, seen in the sari-like shoulder drape of one gown or the print of another. Getty 10 Of 165 Ralph Lauren \nIn a true mix of high-low, uptown-meets-downtown and urban glamour, the show ended on a silk parachute gown in a painterly floral worn open over a pair of terrifically distressed jeans. You never know when you might need to make a dashing getaway.
