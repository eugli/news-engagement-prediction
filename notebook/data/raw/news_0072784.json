Norwich have lost just twice in 10 league games since Boxing Day – but those defeats came away to Burton and Rotherham. \nThat stuttering run has left them playing catch-up in the play-off race, while Ipswich are mired in mid-table despite finding some rare consistency in February: four games unbeaten, and points picked up against Brighton, Reading and Leeds. That has eased the pressure on Mick McCarthy, although it’s sure to return in spades with defeat today. \nNorwich are unbeaten in the last seven Old Farm clashes, while Ipswich have not won at Carrow Road since 2006. The last time they headed north, it was for a play-off semi-final that Norwich won on their way to promotion. This one may not have as much riding on it, but the outcome may determine how both clubs’ seasons, and managers, are judged in the long term. \nKick off is at 12pm GMT . Who will be crowned kings of Anglia? Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:06:40.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
