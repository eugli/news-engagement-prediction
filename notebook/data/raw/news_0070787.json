Feb. 21, 2017, at 5:10 p.m. Cancel \nPHOENIX (AP) — Maricopa County prosecutors say a man has been sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and 160 hours of community restitution for false voter registration. \nThey say 38-year-old Alan Faygenblat electronically filed a fraudulent voter registration application with the Maricopa County Recorder's Office last September. \nProsecutors say Faygenblat falsely claimed he was currently a citizen of the United States and was born in New York. \nBy providing false information, Faygenblat was able to obtain a voter registration card. He then posted on social media the details of his fraudulent actions. \nAn investigation into his actions confirmed that Faygenblat was not a United States citizen, but rather a legal resident from Israel. \nProsecutors say Faygenblat admitted to investigators that he provided false information to obtain a voter registration card. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .
