That number is a small fraction of the total needed. Health officials estimate that each year about 300,000 people in China need a transplant. To help change the system, officials have issued public appeals and deployed organ donation coordinators at hospitals. But many Chinese are unwilling, fearing that it is unfilial to one’s ancestors be buried with organs missing. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The meeting in Rome comes amid warming ties between China and the Vatican. Pope Francis is eager to visit China, home to millions of Catholics who are members of either the state-sponsored church or the underground church that is loyal to Rome. Some consider themselves members of both. The Chinese state does not recognize the jurisdiction of Rome over Chinese Catholics, though Catholicism is one of China’s five official religions along with Buddhism, Islam, Protestantism and Taoism. Organizers of the Vatican meeting said they hoped it would help generate remedies to the problem of organ trafficking and transplant tourism, which they called a “form of human slavery” afflicting many parts of the world. “We hope this summit will create a top-down and bottom-up movement in society, to raise awareness of the extension and seriousness of this modern challenge and lay the groundwork for moral and appropriate solutions based on human dignity, freedom, justice and peace,” the academy’s website said. In a Twitter post last year, Pope Francis made clear his objections to organ trafficking: New forms of slavery such as human and organ trafficking, forced labour, and prostitution are true crimes against humanity. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) Aug. 23, 2016 The Vatican knows about the problem surrounding organ sourcing in China and wants to help change it, said Francesco Sisci , a specialist in Catholic affairs at Renmin University of China who interviewed the pope last year. “They are well aware of the situation,” Mr. Sisci said in an email. “But the Vatican can only do this: encourage better behavior. It can’t start a trade war or send in the Swiss Guards as paratroopers,” he added, referring to the small force responsible for the pope’s safety. Condemning the perpetrators “may be good revenge, but that’s the job of the Nuremberg trials, or of God,” Mr. Sisci said. “The church has a different job: to try to improve the world, in this case China. To understand what it is, not what we would like it to be.” \nFollow Didi Kirsten Tatlow on Twitter @dktatlow . \nGet news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
