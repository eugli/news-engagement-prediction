I can only imagine which commandment she found to be more offensive? \nIf I was a betting man I’d say it was either the one about coveting thy neighbor’s ass or the one about graven images. \nAnyway, the school district has 30 days to extricate the monument from the front lawn -- and they also have to fork over $164,000 in legal fees. \n“We’re very pleased,” Freedom From Religion Foundation attorney Patrick Elliott told the Valley News Dispatch . “It means that the Constitution is being followed by the school district.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:19:42.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
