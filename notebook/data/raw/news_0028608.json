During that time, the extremists destroyed ancient temples and eventually emptied the town of most of its residents, causing an international outcry. \nThe extremists were eventually driven out by Russian and Syrian government forces, but they seized the town again in December. \nRussia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement Monday that Syrian government troops advancing toward the city are about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away. It said Russian warplanes last week carried out more than 90 sorties to provide air cover for the offensive. \nIt added that some 200 IS fighters have been killed and that Syrian forces destroyed 180 “infrastructure objects” and 15 ammunition depots. \nThe drone footage, which the Russian Defense Ministry said was filmed earlier this month, showed a central section of Palmyra’s theater lying in ruins. \nThe ministry said its drones also recorded significant truck movements in the area around the archaeological site, which could mean that the IS militants are bringing explosives to the site. \nMaamoun Abdulkarim, the head of Syria’s antiquities department, said last month that reports of the recent destruction first trickled out in late December. Satellite images surfaced in January. \nThe release of the video in Russia came as the Syrian government and the opposition prepared for a new round of peace talks later this month aimed at ending the country’s nearly six-year civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. \nThe Syrian government said Monday it is ready to release prisoners in exchange for civilians or troops held by insurgents. Syrian state TV quoted an unnamed official as saying the offer comes ahead of a two-day meeting later this week in the Kazakh capital, Astana. \nKazakhstan’s Foreign Ministry has invited government and opposition officials, as well as delegates from Russia, Turkey, and Iran for preparatory talks in Astana on Thursday and Friday ahead of U.N.-brokered talks with the Syrian government planned for Feb. 20 in Geneva. \nLast week the Syrian government and rebels exchanged dozens of people, including women and children who were held by insurgents for years. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:54.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
