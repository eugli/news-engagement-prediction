That's gone, thanks to him,\" said host Jimmy Kimmel. \nA political climate for the evening was expected as numerous celebrities have used awards shows this season to express their concerns and criticisms with the Trump administration. \nTrump is allegedly not going to pay attention to the Oscars as he will be attending the Governors' Ball, White House press secretary Seas Spicer said previously. In years past, Trump has hate-watched the show and tweeted about it. \nSome Republicans and Trump supporters said over social media they would not watch the show because they expected it to be nothing more than Trump bashing. Some of those in that group used the hashtag \"#NoOscarsForMe.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:43:32.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
