Military jolted by recent NPA attacks \nDureza said the ceasefire “set in place to provide an enabling environment for the ongoing peace talks.” \n“We do not wish to unnecessarily squander those gains that even saw President Duterte exercising strong political will to move the peace process forward,” he said. \nThe peace adviser suspected that some NDF leaders were not in control of their forces in the ground. \n“Either some in the National Democratic Front (NDF) leadership talking to the government are not in full control of their own forces on the ground, or they are themselves undermining these efforts for sustainable peace, or pressuring government for certain concessions,” he said. \nDureza said the President was serious on his vow to achieve lasting peace in the country. \n“But our counterparts on the other side of the peace table must also reciprocate accordingly and do the same,” he said. \nThe Philippine government and the NDF resumed the hold third round of peace talks in Rome in January.
