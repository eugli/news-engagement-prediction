CUTS International Secretary general Pradeep Mehta (left) addresses the conference with former Bangladesh Bank chief Atiur Rahman (second from left) on the stage. \"The BBIN will work because all the four nations are determined to make it a success. The Motor Vehicles Agreement is only a start to ensure seamless movement of goods and people,\" Mehta said.\nHe stressed the need to look at BBIN as a platform to first create a transport corridor for trade facilitation and then slowly developed it into an economic corridor for sub-regional growth. \n\"South Asia is one of the least integrated regions of the world, but it is also one of the fastest growing. It is important to improve trade facilitation and cut down costs and other hurdles for trade within the region as the step towards regional cooperation,\" Mehta said. \nBut Mehta insisted that India must get her eastern states to back the process. \n\"India will have to handle the states, because if they create hurdles like has been the case with river water sharing, the process may get adversely affected,\" Mehta said. \nAbhishek Sharma of Trade Mark East Africa made a presentation on the East African experience in building regional corridors and suggested the BBIN process could benefit by looking at that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:43:53.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
