No doubt, he seeks to reiterate his good luck with another collab. \nIn a series of video IG posts Monday, the star beatmaker has been dropping hints at a future collaboration track with Migos , Chance The Rapper and Justin Bieber . They were spotted shooting a music video at a mansion lined with palm trees. \nClaiming it's top secret, Khaled unveiled his guest stars one by one: Chance, Migos and finally the Biebz. He even hinted at a fourth star missing from the set. Dubbed an anthem, this collaboration looks like it's going to be all-out flames, a true summer banger. \nLike Beyonce and Jay Z, this partnership is a reunion of styles. Chance and Migos have both worked with Bieber in the past . Khaled's album Grateful drops later this year.
