Foods with a low glycemic index (55 and below) break down slowly and steadily, providing a sustained supply of energy, unlike foods with a high glycemic index (70 and above) like sugars, which cause a spike in blood glucose levels. \nBlack Bengal gram has a glycaemic index of 14, which makes it a miracle food for all of us. You can have it dry roasted, soaked, boiled, sprouted and cooked -- one small bowl (three-fourths of a cup) of cooked gram provides protein and 25 gm of high-quality carbohydrate and fibre.

Fenugreek, both seeds and leaves, have low glycaemic index that leads to it being digested and absorbed slowly in the stomach and intestines. Studies show that having fenugreek 15 minutes before a meal helps in long-term control of blood glucose levels and prevents hyperglycaemia-related complications in people with diabetes. \nBoth seeds and leaves work as a mild antacid and help to treat digestive problems such as heartburn , loss of appetite, constipation, and gastritis.
