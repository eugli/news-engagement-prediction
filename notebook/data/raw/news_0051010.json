You look at what’s happening in Germany. You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.” \nThis appeared to confuse the Swedish government, which asked the US state department to explain what the new president meant. “We are trying to get clarity,” Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said. \nIt also baffled the Sweden residents and others on Twitter as nothing unusual had happened in the country. So much so that even former Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt took to social media to express his amusement. Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017 \nSoon after Trump’s statement, Twitter was flooded with hashtags ridiculing Trump for his remarks. \nHasgtags like LastNightInSweden and PrayForSweden emerged on Twitter that made jokes about what Trump might had been referring to. #swedenincident Main suspect in Bowling green massacre captured by Swedish police #lastnightinsweden , thanks to tip from @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/O9XAPElcdk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:47.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
