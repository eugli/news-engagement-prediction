An Fire \nIn his tournament debut, An is navigating TPC Scottsdale with reckless abandon, and itâs working. \nâYou   bunkers,â he said. The husky South Korean skies to six feet, two inches, and has averaged over 311 yards in distance of all drives, so he knows. \nThereâs also a specific affinity heâs enjoying with the layout that matches his success on similar tracks on the European Tour. \nâNever finished worse than 13th in the Middle East, and I just donât know why,â he said. âMaybe if you miss, youâre in the desert and can still play shots instead of going in the water. \nâI think the last couple of holes [at TPC Scottsdale] freak me out because there is water here and there.â \nAn has birdied the drivable, par-4 17th every day. Heâs also birdied the par-4 18th once. In fact, his only bogey of the week was of the three-putt variety on the par-3 seventh hole on Friday. Heâs scrambled for par all 11 times heâs missed a green in regulation. This mitigates the danger he introduces off the tee. \nDonât expect his approach to change as he pursues his first PGA TOUR title on Sunday, but heâs surprisingly at peace if he falls short of the target. \nâMy   smart,â he said. âHopefully, tomorrow, just keep the same [form], and then I will be happy. \nâDoesnât matter if I win or not.â \nWhatever works. Chance for Redemption \nMartin Laird crafted a 6-under 65 with seven birdies, including four in a row from beyond 12 feet on holes 3-6. \nAt 15-under, the 34-year-old Scot is alone in second (and three clear of third) entering the final round. \nâI feel really comfortable on these greens,â said Laird, a notable ball-striker who ranks third in strokes gained: putting this week. âThey are kind of tricky if you donât play the Valley effect on them.â \nHeâs glad that trophy presentations arenât conducted on Saturdays, but he may have wished differently two years ago. \nThe Scottsdale resident slept in his own bed and on a three-stroke lead entering the final round in 2015. He then played his first 16 holes that Sunday in bogey-free 2-under before a bogey-double bogey finish. The three shots he surrendered equaled the difference between forcing a playoff and a share of fifth place where he finished. \nIt was a lesson learned. \nâIâd say Iâm definitely better at coping with the crowds and all the mayhem the last three holes,â he said. âHopefully, tomorrow, if Iâm in the same position, I can handle it better than I did [in 2015].â Career Day \nThe primary enjoyment for recreational golfers is the company and camaraderie during the round. A good score is a bonus. When it happens on the PGA TOUR, it can translate into history. \nJohn Peterson rebounded from a second-round 72 with an 8-under 63 on Saturday. Itâs his lowest score of 214 on the PGA TOUR. His grouping that included Jordan Spieth and Boo Weekley wasnât lost on Peterson, either. \nâI saw the pairing yesterday when I was home, and I loved it,â said the 27-year-old. âJordan and I have grown up together. Heâs a little younger (23) than me. We are from the same area, and we played some golf together. And Boo is just a great dude and he loves to hunt and fish like I do, so we had a lot to talk about today. \nâAny time you get a pairing like that, youâre more comfortable.â \nHow about it. Peterson dropped in an eagle (at the par-5 13th hole) and eight birdies to cover a double bogey (at the par-4 sixth). He converted 151 feet worth of putts, seven of which from outside 10 feet, the longest ranging nearly 27 feet at No. 5. \nSpieth noticed the form that manufactured 10 fairways and 15 greens in regulation. \nâSaw   well,â Spieth said of Petersonâs round. âThatâs what it takes.â \nAt 12-under, the LSU product is in a four-way share of third place, four strokes off Anâs lead. Alternate Route \nBecause the field consists of only 132 golfers, TPC Scottsdale is not a stop on the schedule for most of the guys who have status as Web.com Tour Finals graduates. \nAndrew Johnston and Brandon Hagy gained entry on sponsor exemptions, while C.T. Pan, J.J. Spaun and Ollie Schniederjans (formerly in on a sponsor exemption) secured berths via top-10 finishes at the Farmers Insurance Open. \nSundayâs movement at Torrey Pines bumped Ryan Blaum to first alternate, he of the first position in the Web.com Tour reshuffle category. When he withdrew early, Cameron Smith assumed the role. \nThe 23-year-old Aussie has capitalized by making the cut. The last man in the field is 6-under through three rounds. \nâI knew I was in the field about 20 minutes before I actually teed off [on Thursday],â Smith said after converting birdie on his last hole for a third-round 68. âI had a fairly good idea that Colt [Knost] was going to pull out anyway. He did the good deed, telling me that heâs 50/50, so to be here early. I was on the range warming up.â \nAfter what he endured in 2016, thereâs little question that heâd be ready. \nSmith lost about 20 pounds during a four-month stretch due to an intestinal parasite. Heâd finish 157th in the FedExCup standings in what was his first season with fully exempt status. He recovered in time for the Finals to regain his card. Since, heâs survived seven of eight cuts on the PGA TOUR and started this week slotted 55th in FedExCup points. \nWith his health in check, heâs been able to settle into the customary learning curve of a second-year TOUR member. \nâI feel more comfortable out here, and then just knowing the courses is a huge help,â he added. âIt just takes a lot of stress off my hands. \nâJust being around the same guys all of the time. All of the guys out here are really nice, especially the Australian guys.â NOTABLE NUGGETS \nSaturday didnât disappoint at TPC Scottsdale. Mother Nature treated to ideal conditions for the 75 golfers who survived the cut and the record crowd in attendance. \nAttendance â˘ All-time record â˘ Previous record was 201,003 on Saturday in 2016. â˘ To break the tournament record for attendance, Sundayâs head count must be greater than 21,585. Last yearâs Sunday total was 65,330. \nScoring", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:03:04.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
