Picture: Jack Brockway/Virgin.com via AP\nApparently Mr Obama, who is a native of Hawaii, had told Mr Branson his security detail banned him from surfing during his time in office.\n“Just before he became president, he had been surfing on a dangerous break in Hawaii,” Mr Branson wrote in his blog post.\n“When he came in from an exhilarating session, the new head of his security team turned to him and said, ‘This will be the last time you surf for eight years.’ For the next eight years he didn’t have the chance to surf, enjoy watersports or do many of the things he loved.”\nMr Branson said after spending a couple days learning to kitesurf, Mr Obama bested him in a water-sport challenge. He also said inviting the Obamas to his island was “a huge honour.”\nMr Obama spent his first days after leaving Washington holidaying in Palm Springs, California.
