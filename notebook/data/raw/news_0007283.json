Image copyright Historic England Image caption The submarines had already been surrendered by the Germans, but sank while being towed by British ships Image copyright Historic England Image caption The targeting of supply ships without warning outraged the world, and ultimately brought the United States into World War One \nThe German submarines - known as U-boats - wrecked on the Cornish coast in Falmouth and some remains can still be seen. \nGerman forces surrendered the submarines in 1918 and having been stripped of their engines, they became difficult to tow and occasionally sank or wrecked on British beaches. Image copyright Mark Milburn Image caption Two of the U-boats - such as this one at Castle Beach in Falmouth - can still be seen at low water \nIn the year before unrestricted submarine warfare was declared by Germany, 431 ships were sunk by U-boats worldwide. \nThe following year, that number reached 1,263. \nRoger Bowdler, from Historic England, said the declaration was \"a decisive moment\" in World War One. \nHe said: \"It was seen as uncivilised, ungentlemanly and ultimately brought the might of the United States into the war.\" \nThe pictures were taken by naval officer Jack Casement and donated to the Historic England Archive by his family. Image copyright Historic England Image caption The National Submarine War Memorial commemorates the lives of those who died as part of the Submarine Service \nOne third of the Submarine Service's total personnel died during World War One, the highest proportion of any branch of the armed services. \nTo commemorate their lives, the National Submarine War Memorial was unveiled in 1922, at Temple Pier on the Thames in London. \nThe memorial has now been upgraded to Grade II* listed status, which means it has an \"above-average level of special interest\".
