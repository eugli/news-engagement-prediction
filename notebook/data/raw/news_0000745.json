Falwell said the task force’s membership has not yet been determined, but that its main aim will be addressing “overreaching regulation” that comes down from Washington.\n“The goal is to pare it back and give colleges and their accrediting agencies more leeway in governing their affairs,” said Falwell.\n  Mark Cuban Advises Democrats Not To Block Trump’s Supreme Court Pick Federal Judge Deals A Big Blow To President Trump Press Freaks After Trump Departs From White House Unexpectedly: ‘This Is Not Normal’ “In the Department of Education, there’s too much intrusion into the independent accreditation,” he said. “There’s too much intrusion into the operation of universities and colleges. I’ve got a whole list of concerns. It mainly has to do with deregulation.”\nDavid L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, believes there are several areas that should be addressed for deregulation in higher education, including a federal definition of the credit hour, new rules on teacher education, and regulations that require states to create additional consumer protections for students.\nWarren also believes new overtime rules, the gainful-employment regulation, and the borrower-defense-to-repayment rule are areas where government regulations need to be loosened.\n \nFalwell said the task force comes at a time when colleges need to reverse the trend of ever-increasing red tape.\n“We think many regulations published in the last decade need to be rolled back,” Falwell said. “I’ve got notebooks full of material from professors, from heads of accrediting bodies, from people in the financial aid department who have seen problems first-hand.”\nFederal rules “ micro-manage the colleges and they make the student loan process much more difficult than it has to be. That’s one area I will be focused on,” Falwell said.\nFalwell said he was offered the position during a November meeting with Trump, and was only allowed to speak about it publicly this week.\n  Trump Honors Scalia’s Widow As He Nominates Scalia’s Successor After Suspension For Attacking Conway, Philly Anchor Makes Another Inappropriate Comment Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order Falwell supported Trump’s candidacy, and Trump held several rallies at Liberty University.\nEfforts to reform higher education are not new.\nIn 2015, a panel led by Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos, ruled that for colleges, federal regulations are “unnecessarily voluminous” and that compliance is “inordinately costly.”\n \nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:55:54.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
