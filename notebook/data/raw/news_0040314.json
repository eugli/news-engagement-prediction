Hector Amezcua hamezcua@sacbee.com 1 of 2 \nclamarr@sacbee.com \nDeMarcus Cousins wants to stay in Sacramento. For his entire career. \nThe Kings power forward reiterated Thursday on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” that he intends to sign an extension with the team this summer, which The Sacramento Bee has previously reported. \nCousins told ESPN that he wants his “legacy to end in Sacramento” and for his “jersey to be in the rafters in Sacramento.” \nRELATED: Kings face critical decision on Cousins \nCousins, the fifth pick in the 2010 draft, is in his seventh season with the Kings. He has played for six head coaches in that time (Paul Westphal, Keith Smart, Michael Malone, Ty Corbin, George Karl and current coach Dave Joerger). Cousins, 26, can sign a five-year extension worth up to $219 million this summer. \n“I’m very happy. This is where I want to be,” Cousins said in the interview. \nThe Kings (24-33) are 1 1/2 games behind Denver for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. They have not made the playoffs since the 2005-06 season, and the most games they have won during Cousins’ tenure is 33, accomplished last season. \n“I think we’re on the right path this season,” Cousins told ESPN. “We’re playing the best basketball of the season so far. Our team is extremely confident. We believe we can make this push and make it happen.” \nCousins, a three-time All-Star, is averaging career highs in points (27.8) and assists (4.8) this season. \nDeMarcus Cousins’ career stats", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:03:50.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
