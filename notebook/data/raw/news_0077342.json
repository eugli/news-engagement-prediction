(credit: Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images) \nSome Twitter users were quick to highlight the photos as evidence of a lack of respect for the office from Conway and the Trump administration. Other users have countered with numerous photos of former President Barack Obama resting his feet on the office’s famed Resolute desk at various times during his eight years in office. \nConway has yet to weigh in on the criticism. \n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
