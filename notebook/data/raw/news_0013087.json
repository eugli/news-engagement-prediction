While he put together a solid season, he knows that winning the Super Bowl will only help his chances at signing a big deal in free agency. \nAfter the game, Bennett told reporters that he's going to get a hefty deal. \nPatriots TE Martellus Bennett: \"I'm going into free agency as a Super Bowl champion. You know they overpay Super Bowl champions!\" LOL â€” Manish Mehta (@MMehtaNYDN) February 6, 2017 \nBennett finished with five catches for 62 yards in the Super Bowl. He had 55 catches for 701 yards and seven touchdowns in the regular season. \nWhile he was a big part of the Patriots' season, it's unclear if they'll spend big to keep him, especially with Rob Gronkowski already in the fold. Still, one way or another, Bennett's resume now has a championship on it and that will help in free agency.
