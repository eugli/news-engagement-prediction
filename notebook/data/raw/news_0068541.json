It’s out on April 28 via Young God Records/Mute. It will be released on double vinyl and as a 2xCD set with a companion CD featuring Michael Gira’s solo debut, Drainland . The Great Annihilator was remastered by Doug Henderson after Bill Rieflin recently discovered DATs and cassettes containing unmastered mixes from the original sessions. In a press release, Gira describes the discovery as “a revelation of great sonic effect.” \nThe Great Annihilator is just the latest Swans album to get a reissue. In 2014, the band reissued their debut album, Filth , on vinyl. The next year, they bolstered the release with additional bonus material . That year, they also reissued two more albums: 1991’s White Light From the Mouth of Infinity and 1992’s Love of Life.
