But the House plan which is out there, the President had a plan, the Senate is thinking about their version. The real message from the business community is we need to get you together we need to move fast in this process. We need to have lower rates, we need to have a more competitive international system that doesn’t create penalties for bringing cash back into the United States for businesses,” he told the FOX Business Network’s Neil Cavuto. \nWeinberger also opened up about the impact Trump’s executive order on immigration could have on the business community. “We have a lot of people in the U.S. that work outside the borders. A lot of people outside the borders come to the U.S. and that there is clearly a recognition for the need for improved security, but not at the expense of immigration and moving people around and certainly not anything that would inhibit our view or the world view of us to be a good citizen where people want to create jobs and be,” Weinberger said.
