GC Images \nThe old-time-y grooming wave that took over menswear five years ago is thankfully on the wane, but many of the high-end waxes, oils, and shaving creams that flooded the market when the trend hit big are still standing strong (this is a good thing). A fussy, antiquated haircut or beard might not be stylish anymore (and no one wants to spend 45 minutes shaving every morning) but a nice beard oil that smells like heaven is something we can still get down with. \nLuxury combs are another old fashioned tool that still prove useful, even if you have the most modern haircut and scruff in the world. For one, they don't destroy your hair and scalp the way that cheap black plastic thing you stole from a hotel room will (don't use that). You can find options made with teeth built for your specific hair needs; wider for beards and coarse hair, more narrow for fine hair. For another, they're sturdy enough to last for years, if not decades. Most are made with acetate or horn and come with a soft suede or leather sleeve that protects the teeth from breaking in your bag. And, okay, they look fantastic; as pleasing on a table or counter as your fancy Japanese-made sunglasses and just as useful. \nIf you're still secretly using your girlfriend's brush every morning, or one of those black plastic combs that cost a dollar, consider upgrading to one of these instead. While it's a lot to spend on a comb, it isn't a Gucci-level investment. And anyway, your head deserves to be treated with respect. Take care of your hair now and you might still have some to comb when you're 70-years-old. Or, not. But at least you'll have made the most of the time you spent together.
