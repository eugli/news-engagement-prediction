Another is when someone begins to lose their sense of smell, with experts using a so-called 'peanut butter test' to test if people can sniff out the spread from a distance. The latest research looked at participants with an average age of 72, enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study, a major US investigation into heart disease risk factors. Another study has found that developing rambling speech may be an early indication of mild cognitive impairment The participants were asked how long they typically slept each night and followed up over a decade, with 234 cases of dementia recorded over the follow-up period. Sleeping for more than nine hours more than doubled the risk of both all types of dementia and specifically Alzheimer's. Participants without a high school degree who slept for more than nine hours increased their risk six-fold, suggesting that education may protect against the condition. FOOTBALLERS AT RISK OF DEMENTIA Footballers could be risking dementia by suffering repeated minor injuries when they head the ball, according to scientists from University College London. A study of 14 retired footballers found four had a condition known to cause dementia, while six had Alzheimer's disease. Repeated blows to the head suffered on the field, from headers and colliding with other players, are thought to be the cause. Dr Rosa Sancho, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'While unusual sleep patterns are common for people with dementia, this study adds to existing research suggesting that changes in sleep could be apparent long before symptoms like memory loss start to show. 'Understanding more about how sleep is affected by dementia could one day help doctors to identify those who are at risk of developing the condition.' However she called for further research, as the results were based on self-reported sleep information. Previous studies have shown people with early dementia also suffer from interrupted sleep, thought to be a similar sign of neurodegeneration. But sleep can also ward off dementia, with too little suggested by some experts to be a risk factor for the condition. The US study, published in the journal Neurology, states: 'Sleep may provide a restorative function, removing metabolic waste from the brain and preventing the accumulation of (protein) B-amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease. 'On the other hand, sleep disorders may also emerge as a result of atrophy to brain regions involved in sleep and wakefulness, or as a consequence of mood disturbances, which are common in dementia.'
