Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco are already sanctuary cities. \n“I think it’s ridiculous. Sanctuary cities, as you know, I’m very much opposed to sanctuary cities. They breed crime, there’s a lot of problems,” Trump said. \n“I don’t want to defund the state or city,” Trump said. But “if they’re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that — certainly that would be a weapon.” \nHe added: “If we have to, we’ll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California.” \nIn fact, California, which has the eighth largest economy in the world, receives approximately 78 cents for every dollar it pays the feds , according to the most recent analysis available by the non-profit Tax Foundation think tank. A recent survey found the state was the fifth least dependent state in the nation on federal funds . In an interview last month state Lt. Gov. Gavin Newson said that the U.S. “needs California more ... than California needs it from an economic perspective. California is the economic engine of the country .” (He also called Trump’s plans to build a border wall between Mexico “laughable.”) \nBut the University of California system would be vulnerable to federal funding reductions that would have to be made up by state money in the event of a cut. It receives at least $9 billion in grants, financial aid and research funds. Trump threatened to cut funds after violent Berkeley protests in early February forced the cancellation of a speech on campus by white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos . If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nTrump insisted to O’Reilly that California voters “obviously” agree with him on his anti-sanctuary issue “otherwise they wouldn’t have voted for me.” In fact, California, home to 39 million people, voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election (62 percent to Trump’s 32 percent). Trump has claimed illegal votes in California cost him a popular vote victory — though hasn’t offered any evidence for that claim. CA ballots are now all counted. Unofficial results posted online show Hillary Clinton votes almost doubled those for President-elect Trump. pic.twitter.com/uPgIMqB58T — John Myers (@johnmyers) December 8, 2016 \nCalifornian officials have vowed to defy Trump’s policies not only on immigration, but also against any reduction in environmental protections. The state has placed on retainer former U.S. Attorney Eric Holder to battle the Trump administration in court . Governor Jerry Brown is working with representatives to design a budget with some protections for federal funding cuts. He pledged in his State of the State address last month to defend “everybody — every man, woman and child — who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state .” Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:36:45.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
