The latest update on his GoFundMe page states that “his blood pressure and heartbeat are… staying stable, doctors have shifted him to the ward from [the surgical intensive care unit].” \nIn both Saskatoon and Regina, plastic partitions are not mandatory, though taxi drivers are able to purchase and install the shield in their cabs themselves. The shields can cost up to $1,000. \nIf the shields were made mandatory under a bylaw, cab companies would be responsible for outfitting their fleets to meet regulations. \nThe general manager of one such company, United Group’s Carlo Triolo, doesn’t believe the shields are worth the trouble. \n“If we do 20,000-some trips in a week and there is no instances, is it really an issue? If you multiply that by 52 weeks and there [are] two instances in a year, is it an issue?” Triolo asked. \nIn Edmonton, where the shields were deemed mandatory in 2008, only to be made optional last year, some cab drivers complained of the partitions being cumbersome. \n“When you get in the back of a taxi that has shields in it, you feel like you’re in the back of a police car. What does that do for service?” Triolo said. \nResearch conducted by the United States’ National Institute of Occupation Safety and Health showed that in-cab security cameras were effective in reducing crime against drivers. \nThe study found that taxi murder rates were seven times lower in cities that installed the cameras. Both Regina and Saskatoon have already made cameras mandatory in taxi cabs. \nThe City of Regina is currently reviewing its own taxi bylaw and is holding talks with local cab companies for feedback. \n“In our initial discussions with the taxi industry, there has been some interest in exploring the use of partitions in taxi cabs,” business support manager Dawn Schikowski said. \nAlong with safety, the review is also looking into customer experience and licensing. The report is expected to complete by June. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:31:30.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
