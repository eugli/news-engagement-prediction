The woman was arrested late last week when she went to the ICE office for her yearly check-in.\nIn their statement, Mexico’s Foreign Relations Ministry did not mention that Garcia de Rayos, while non-violent, had been convicted in 2009 on the felony charge of impersonation for having used someone else’s identifying information to work illegally in the country. According to various news articles, the woman was originally arrested in 2008 during a workplace raid. In 2013, federal authorities issued a removal order and the woman was granted supervised release until authorities were able to deport her.\nWhile everyday Mexico receives hundreds of deported individuals and the case of Garcia Rayos is considered common, the Mexican government issued a statement on Garcia Rayos’ case claiming that the case showed a “new reality” in the United States.\nThe Mexican government is further advising any migrants in the U.S. to get close to the 50 consular offices in the country, as they foresee further toughening of immigration enforcement. The Mexican government further state that they expect possible violations of constitutional rights or other violations in those immigration measures.\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
