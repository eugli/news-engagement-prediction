Last week, Space10 made the plans available to anyone who wants to build their own circular farm. \nWhile you probably won't be installing one in your studio apartment (it's not exactly a window herb garden or a topsy-turvy tomato plant), the Growroom takes up much less space than traditional farming, can be placed in a public space or building's courtyard, and effectively eliminates the transportation from farm to consumer. \nIt's also meant as a way to connect people with nature and their food source, functioning as an oasis in a concrete jungle. The 2.8 meter by 2.5 meter space (about 9 feet by 8 feet) has overlapping slices that allow each section of vegetation to receive light and water while protecting anyone that's sitting or standing inside from the elements. \nSpace10 developed the Growroom along with architects Mads-Ulrik Husum and Sine Lindholm. \"On the basis of a spatial experimentation with the urban farming concept, we strive towards creating architecture where atmosphere...acts as the primary design factor, to generate poetic spaces with a sense of tranquility,\" says Lindholm. \nAfter the original Growroom debuted, Space10 received many requests to buy or exhibit the garden. But since their goal is to increase sustainability, shipping Growrooms across the globe doesn't make much sense. So they created open source plans for the garden so you can build your own. \nIf you have access to a CNC milling machine or laser cutter, sheets of plywood, and a hammer, it's just 17 easy steps (a PAX wardrobe is more challenging, to be honest). And unlike IKEA directions, there are text instructions accompanying the images so you actually know what you're doing. \nCheck out more about the Growroom on Space10's Medium blog .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:05:29.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
