Image copyright Dumfries and Galloway Council Image caption Dumfries and Galloway Council wants to host the hoard in the new Kirkcudbright gallery \nThe final decision on where the artefacts are diplayed lies with the Treasure Trove Panel. \nCathy Agnew, who chairs the campaign which launched this week, said: \"This is a time for Scotland to take the lead. \n\"The Galloway Viking hoard is quite extraordinary and should have pride of place in a specially created exhibition space in the new Kirkcudbright art gallery. \n\"Remarkable finds have so often been whisked away from the communities where they were discovered only to become a small feature in a large national museum. \n\"This is a very old-fashioned approach and in 2017 we should be making sure that regions fully benefit from their cultural riches.\" \nShe said the collection could be a \"powerful magnet\" to bring in visitors. 'International significance' \nDavid Devereux, GVHC vice chair, said: \"Some of the items in the hoard are of breathtaking beauty and could become icons for the region, spurring people across the world to discover more about its distinctive past - and the people, lives, cultures and kingdoms that existed before Scotland was born.\" \nCampaign supporters have been urged to send letters of support ahead of two meetings taking place in coming weeks. \nThe first is a meeting of the council's communities committee on 7 March that will decide how best to take forward the local authority's bid. \nThe second is a meeting of the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel (SAFAP) which is due to discuss the hoard's future on 23 March. \nNational Museums Scotland has described the find as of \"considerable national and international significance\". \nIt said that if it acquired the hoard it would save it for the nation and ensure it was seen by \"people from Scotland, the rest of the UK and internationally\".
