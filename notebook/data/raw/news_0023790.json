People don't want to see that. It's not right.\"\nBut Mr Jenner's defence team said he believed his behaviour to have been reasonable - a freedom of expression.\nAlex Davey, for the defence, said Mr Jenner was not \"flaunting his nakedness\".\nMs Davey said: \"It is not illegal per se to be naked in public. Naturism is perfectly lawful and is considered a freedom of expression.\"\nShe argued just because some people might feel surprised or uncomfortable, that did not make Mr Jenner's behaviour disorderly, nor did it make it a crime.\nThe prosecution had alleged this was repeated behaviour over a period of time, and witnesses were harassed, alarmed or distressed.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1D60/production/_94002570_swns_naturist_jenner_01.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-07T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:05:47.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
