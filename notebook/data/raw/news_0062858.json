Skype \nMicrosoft is the latest US tech giant to help keep Indians connected. \nSkype Lite is a new version of the company's popular video and voice-calling app that's \"built in India.\" Microsoft unveiled the service on Wednesday at its Future Decoded conference, reports ZDNet . \nSkype Lite functions much like its big brother Skype, but it's designed to work well on low-speed, 2G networks, which are still prevalent in India and many developing nations. It uses less data and battery power than the fully fledged app, and at 13MB it's around a third of the download size. \nMicrosoft is hardly alone in shifting its focus to India. Seen as a huge growth market , several tech companies have made similar moves in the country. Google, for instance, last year announced YouTube Go , and Facebook brought out a Lite version of its app the year before that. \nMicrosoft also announced \"Project Sangam\" at the conference, a LinkedIn-based training initiative for India's low- and semi-skilled workers. \nMicrosoft has some tough competition in India though, especially from WhatsApp, which has more than 160 million daily active users in India .
