An inquest heard he died after a stab wound to the heart. His wallet was also taken. \nDetectives today released two clips showing two shadowy figures run past the scene shortly after the attack, before returning around 15 minutes later. Samuel Guidera was stabbed to death in 2011 \nThe footage was unearthed after a full review of all CCTV recovered from the scene. \nDetective Chief Inspector Chris Jones, leading the investigation, told the Standard: “This footage could be the key to unlocking vital information. \n“I’m appealing to everyone to watch the clips as they may recognise one or both of them. The way they walk, run, people may recognise them. They are both young men.” \nHe added: “I’d never say this is our last hope. This is still very much a live investigation, but I believe the footage is crucial in finding out more about what happened that day. \n“It is still hoped that after six years someone with knowledge of what happened to Sam can come forward and help solve the case.” \nHe said the “majority” of witnesses police want to speak to in connection with the case have been identified and spoken to. Samuel Guidera would have turned 30 this year \nPolice have continued to make appeals over the killing each year. Five suspects have been arrested, thousands of leads have been followed and hundreds of witnesses interviewed, but the attackers remain at large. \nPolice made a similar appeal in the case last year as they released a CCTV image of a woman they wanted to speak to visiting an off-licence nearby in Lennard Road. It was believed she could be a witness whose bus passed the stop near where Mr Guidera was found collapsed by passers-by. \nPolice had also appealed for information about a number dialled from Mr Guidera’s phone. The number was 07404 776433, but enquires found this was linked to a pay-as-you-go Lyca mobile phone that had not been activated or registered. It is still unknown why this number was dialled from his phone. \nIn the moments after that call was made, the victim also misdialed “9999” for the emergency services. \nHe was taken to King’s College Hospital in cardiac arrest and not breathing after passer-by came to his aid, but was pronounced dead 25 minutes later. \nOne man held in connection with the investigation in 2011 was arrested because he had made a “confession” to a friend in an effort to “enhance his status”, but was released without charge after police confirmed his account was a “fantasy”. \nA £20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the prosecution of the killer of Mr Guidera, who would have turned 30 this year. \nHis mother and father, Sarah and Chris, said in a statement: “We just want somebody out there who knows something that could help in the apprehending of the killers to come forward so they do not have the opportunity to take another person’s life and destroy another family. \n“It could be somebody reading this who gets the call about the savage death of a loved one next.” \nAnyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8345 3734 or police via 101 or via Twitter @MetCC. \nTo give information anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
