Even though it's unclear if butting out affects recurrence of breast cancer, the risk of death from smoking-related health issues is a strong reason to quit, the reviewers said.\nOther key points included:\nAll patients with breast cancer (except those with an abnormally low body mass index before diagnosis) should avoid weight gain. It's unclear whether weight loss improves prognosis. Soy consumption is not harmful. No specific type of diet has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Limiting alcohol consumption to one or fewer alcoholic drinks per day may help reduce the risk of a second breast cancer. The reviewers called a cancer diagnosis a \"teachable moment\" when patients are more receptive to healthy lifestyle changes that will improve their overall health.\nImproving lifestyle can also offer a psychological boost, they said, by empowering patients. \"The feeling of loss of control is one of the biggest challenges of a cancer diagnosis.\"\nBut they don't want patients to feel that inadequate lifestyle changes have led to  recurrence since some breast cancers are so aggressive in nature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:41:50.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
