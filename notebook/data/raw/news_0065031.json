You need to cut the plywood with a CNC machine, a laser cutter or a table saw and put it together using a screwdriver and hammer. The overlapping slices mean that plants can get light on each level - making it an idea shape for growing greens. The Nordic designers, Sine Lindholm and Mads-Ulrik Husum (pictured), say this is a vision of the future where healthy food is grown more locally At 2.8 x 2.5 metres, it's big enough for people to sit inside and pause for a moment of reflection The first Growroom was built in 2016, and exhibited at the Chart Art Fair in Copenhagen At 2.8 x 2.5 metres, it's big enough for people to sit inside and pause for a moment of reflection. Designer Ms Lindhold said she sees it as 'part of the floating cityscape'. The visitor is invited 'into an intimate world where only the visitor and vegetation co-exist - for a moment', she said. You need to cut the plywood with a CNC machine, a laser cutter or a table saw and put it together using a screwdriver and hammer The first Growroom was built in 2016, and exhibited at the Chart Art Fair in Copenhagen The shelves are 7cm deep which allows space for the soil - and the designers recommend treating the plywood beforehand to protect it. 'It is designed to support our everyday sense of well being in the cities by creating a small oasis or ‘pause’-architecture in our high paced societal scenery, and enables people to connect with nature as we smell and taste the abundance of herbs and plants', said the designers. 'Local food represents a serious alternative to the global food model. It reduces food miles, our pressure on the environment, and educates our children of where food actually comes from'. The garden can be put together using a screwdriver and hammer - but you'll need to cut the plywood first The Growroom is an open source design, which means people can copy the design without asking. The architects have encouraged people to build their own locally The first Growroom was built in 2016, and exhibited at the Chart Art Fair in Copenhagen. The Growroom is an open source design, which means people can copy the design without asking and architects have encouraged people to build their own locally. 'We could produce food of the highest quality that tastes better, is much more nutritional, fresh, organic and healthy', said Simon Caspersen, Director of Communications at Space10. 'We believe that local food production represents a serious alternative to the global food model', he said.
