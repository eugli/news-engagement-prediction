publishes a damning report highlighting the soaring number of insecure jobs in the UK.\nThe number of workers without guaranteed hours or basic employment rights has risen by more than 660,000 in the past five years, the study found.\nLabour said an \"explosion\" of insecure jobs was likely unless fundamental workers’ rights were protected.\nAnd the dire situation many employees now face is predicted to intensify once the Government drags the UK out of the EU .\nTUC general secretary France O'Grady (Reuters) TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said insecure work had become “the new normal for far too many people” and the problem was “getting worse” as Theresa May pushes ahead with a hard Brexit.\nRead more May insists she has 'mandate' to impose hardest possible Brexit “If the Government rushes to the bottom on employment rights after Brexit, we could see even more of these dodgy contracts,” she told The Independent .\n“People in Britain deserve better than cut-rate, bottom-of-the-league protections at work.”\nMore than three million people now work in insecure jobs, representing one in 10 employees in the UK. That is up from 2.4 million in 2011.\nTUC research showed the 27 per cent rise in insecure jobs was being driven by traditional industries, such as teachers, carers and the service sector.\nIt suggests those on lower salaries could be hit hardest by the shifting jobs market.\nTories jeer as Angus Robertson points out what Brexit will do to poor people Those employed in newer, technology sectors, for example, were better insulated from the changes in employment conditions, the federation of trade unions found.\nShadow business minister Jack Dromey questioned Ms May's sincerity in protecting workers' rights.\n\"Under the Tories, Brexit risks making a bad situation worse,\" he said. \"I simply do not believe assurances that Theresa May will protect workers’ rights that are currently guaranteed by membership of the European Union.\n“Labour will fight to make sure that the Tories do not use Brexit to rob British workers of their rights. Britain must not become an offshore island with British workers the poor relation to their European neighbours.”\nLabour's shadow minister in the business, energy and industrial strategy team, Jack Dromey ( Getty ) Labour backbencher Melanie Onn, who tabled a series of amendments to the Government’s bill and introduced her own bill to safeguard workers’ rights derived from EU legislation, said the Tories had a mandate to leave the EU but not to \"downgrade the rights of workers\".\n“There is a great risk that without fundamental workers’ rights, which come from the EU, we will see an explosion of temporary, insecure jobs and zero hour contracts,\" she told The Independent .\nThe TUC report reveals workers are increasingly faced with zero-hours contracts – where they have no guaranteed minimum income each month and the hours they work fluctuate – and fewer protections for casual, agency or temporary staff over 'benefits' such as sick pay.\nTheresa May avoids directly answering four questions in a row on Brexit Jobs in the arts and entertainment sector are most likely to face insecurity, a league table of industries shows, with two-thirds of actors and artists judged to be in unprotected employment. This is followed by those in other service industries, such as hairdressers, fitness instructors and cleaners, as well as taxi, train and lorry drivers, where around a third of jobs are classified as insecure.\nRead more Britons must get ‘associate EU citizenship’ regardless of Brexit deal The EU acts as a safeguard against any government overriding basic rights - from limits on working hours to guaranteed maternity rights.\nMs May has promised that existing rights will be guaranteed and the Great Repeal bill will convert all EU laws, including the ones relating to employment rights, to UK law.\nBut unions and MPs fear that the UK could fall behind the rest of the EU after Brexit, as Brussels enacts greater protections while Westminster enforces the status quo.\nMs O'Grady added: \"Insecurity at work is becoming the new normal for too many workers.\n“It's happening across new and old industries, with workers forced onto shady contracts, whether they're Uber drivers, bar staff or teaching assistants.\n\"People need jobs they can live on and build a life around, but if you don't how much work you will have from one day to the next, making ends meet is a nightmare.\n\"The rules that protect workers need to be dragged into the 21st Century.\"\nBrexit Concerns 22 show all Brexit Concerns 1/22 British Prime Minister Theresa May\nGetty\n2/22 Lead campaigner Gina Miller and her team outside the High Court\nGetty\n3/22 Raymond McCord holds up his newly issued Irish passport alongside his British passport outside the High Court in Belfast following a judges dismissal of the UK's first legal challenges to Brexit\nPA wire\n4/22 SDLP leader Colum Eastwood leaving the High Court in Belfast following a judges dismissal of the UK's first legal challenges to Brexit\nPA wire\n5/22 Migrants with luggage walk past a graffiti on a wall as they leave the 'Jungle' migrant camp, as part of a major three-day operation planned to clear the camp in Calais\nGetty\n6/22 Migrants leave messages on their tents in the Jungle migrant camp\nGetty\n7/22 The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (Adra) which distributes approximately 700 meals daily in the northern Paris camp states that it is noticing a spike in new migrant arrivals this week, potentially linked the the Calais 'jungle' camp closure - with around 1000 meals distributed today\nEPA\n8/22 Migrant workers pick apples at Stocks Farm in Suckley, Britain\nReuters\n9/22 Many farmers across the country are voicing concerns that Brexit could be a dangerous step into the unknown for the farming industry\nGetty\n10/22 Bank of England governor Mark Carney who said the long-term outlook for the UK economy is positive, but growth was slowing in the wake of the Brexit vote\nPA\n11/22 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down over 600 points on the news with markets around the globe pluninging\nGetty\n12/22 Immigration officers deal with each member of the public seeking entry into the United Kingdom but on average, 10 a day are refused entry at this London airport and between 2008 and 2009, 33,100 people were detained at the airport for mainly passport irregularities\nGetty\n13/22 A number of global investment giants have threatened to move their European operations out of London if Brexit proves to have a negative impact on their businesses\nGetty\n14/22 Following the possibility of a Brexit the UK would be released from its renewable energy targets under the EU Renewable Energy Directive and from EU state aid restrictions, potentially giving the government more freedom both in the design and phasing out of renewable energy support regimes\nGetty\n15/22 A woman looking at a chart showing the drop in the pound (Sterling) against the US Dollar in London after Britain voted to leave the EU\nGetty\n16/22 Young protesters outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, to protest against the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU following the referendum\nGetty\n17/22 Applications from Northern Ireland citizens for Irish Passports has soared to a record high after the UK Voted in favour of Leaving the EU\nGetty\n18/22 NFU Vice President Minette Batters with Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsome at the National Farmers Union (NFU) took machinery, produce, farmers and staff to Westminster to encourage Members of Parliament to back British farming, post Brexit\nGetty\n19/22 The latest reports released by the UK Cabinet Office warn that expats would lose a range of specific rights to live, to work and to access pensions, healthcare and public services.
