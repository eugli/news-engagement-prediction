And for both — rather as, I suspect, for most — they would never have wished to leave behind the ghosts of childhoods past flitting from room to room every day; memories of gappy grins and fairy hunts and racing snails that we, all grown up, had left in their care. The first reaction of many people to this story will surely be that it is no one else’s business if someone wants to remain in a house that has been their home for a long time. But my question is that while ministers can ‘encourage’ all they like, what are they actually offering in exchange for you giving it up? They might succeed in making some of these dutiful souls feel guilty about keeping their unsuitably cavernous homes. The problem is that for many who sell up, the destination will be sheltered accommodation or a care home. And despite all the caveats about there being some jolly good institutional care here and there, the fact remains that such places have become synonymous with mistreatment and loneliness. Scarce is the week that passes without some dreadful story of abuse: the infirm and incapable suffering neglect, tirades or even assault by misnamed ‘carers’ who do anything but. They are low-paid workers and often qualified accordingly. A great many do not even speak English, meaning the vulnerable elderly are in the hands of people with whom they cannot share basic communication. It’s often cruel and, except in the instances where there are no alternatives, not the answer. It is true that there are not enough family-sized homes in Britain, especially in major cities like London STOCK PHOTO Consider the harrowing story last week of 77-year-old dementia patient Betty Boylan, residing in a £1,000-a-month care home in Birmingham. Her concerned family, having planted a camera to uncover what they suspected was going on, recorded disturbing footage of her ‘carer’ lifting the great-grandmother by her head before throwing her back into her chair, which rocked backwards with the force, before Betty slumped to the side. At another point, a second carer was caught spraying deodorant in Betty’s face. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of trying to incentivise the old to move out of their homes, we should incentivise the young to move back in. For every old person struggling with too much space, there’s a fair chance that down the road is a son or daughter struggling with property ladders, deposits, mortgages, two jobs to pay for them — oh, and a couple of children of their own as well. Could we not make it palatable, or even desirable, for them to give up on their own struggles and move back into the big house in a revival of the three-generational family? Instinctively, plenty will cringe at the thought. As it happens, I live in a three-generational family and am a big advocate. Nevertheless, I know that for many the negatives seem insurmountable. Yet, if the funding is available for the Government’s down-sizing proposals, then that same money could be re-directed to smooth the path. First, it is understandable that many families would not fancy the idea of a gran or grandpa as a permanent presence, nodding off noisily in the corner armchair. But, wait. We are specifically talking about big houses here. If the stamp duty and moving costs and redecorating money really is on offer, it could be used, instead, to make a mini granny flat out of a large ground-floor room. The burden on the family, then, is not one of constant intrusion. They can take in a coffee in the morning, stop for a chat and enjoy Sunday lunch together. And best of all, instead of the big house being put on the market, it will be the younger generation’s almost certainly smaller house that is sold — thus freeing up that one for new buyers on the ladder. Much more useful. This is not a charter to turn adult children who enjoy their lives into full-time providers of care. But precisely because you have sold your smaller house you’ll have some money in the bank, on top of which you will no longer have a mortgage to pay at all. Gran will have paid hers off years ago and you’ll be living rent-free. So in exactly the same way that couples have pooled two salaries to help pay for childcare, they can help pay for elder care. Only last week, health minister David Mowat suggested that we consider looking after our parents in much the same way we look after our children; this would be a simple and direct way to do just that. Furthermore, the care you pay for will be happening in your own home, where you can keep a watchful eye on it. There are so many benefits to this arrangement that a man from Mars might wonder why it is not a more commonplace way to live. In fact a man from Spain would be equally bemused, coming as he does from a land that, like most others, got this sorted years ago. Yet if we want the family arrangement I have described to appeal more widely, then we have to insist governments stop penalising those who do it. As things stand, all may function well until the older person whose house they all share dies. At which point, under current law, there’s a good chance that the younger generation — having given the elderly relative a good last few years of life — will, along with their own children, lose what has become their home. A big house, especially if it is in a city, will exceed the threshold for inheritance tax; if it is anywhere in or near London, the inheritance tax bill will be absurdly large. The family who have lived in the home for years, whose children go to school nearby, who have built social circles in the area, who may have taken a job near there, is out on its collective ear. The house will be sold from under them, they will have to start again and perhaps be forced to move miles away. What a reward for having lifted much of the burden of an elderly person from the overstretched resources of the state. I would urge this Government to think again and quickly. It is not beyond the wit of man to decree that if a family can prove that the big, old house has been their main residence for, say, three years or more, then it is exempt from inheritance tax altogether, and they can continue to call it home. That is compassionate. That is clever. ‘Encouraging’ the frail and elderly to sell the house they love is not necessarily either.
