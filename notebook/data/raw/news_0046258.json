The video (embedded above) doesn't really tell us anything else, so we don't know just how resistant to water the G6 is. In any case, we're expecting the phone to be at least IPx7-certified, meaning it should offer the same level of water resistance as the iPhone 7 series (if not higher). Water resistance aside, other confirmed LG G6 features include a 5.7-inch FullVision display with 1440 x 2880 pixels, a wide-angle dual rear camera , and Android 7 Nougat with LG UX 6.0 . Unlike last year's G5, the LG G6 is not a modular phone, though it's still made out of metal . It's said that the handset will be powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, further offering 4 GB of RAM, USB Type-C port, 32 GB of expandable internal memory, and a 3200 non-removable battery . So, how do you like the LG G6 thus far?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:08:56.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
