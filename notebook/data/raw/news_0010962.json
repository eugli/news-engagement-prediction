Icka was left sitting at the table to look after their belongings. However, 2 Singaporean women approached Icka's table and allegedly removed her friends bags and sat on their places, even though Icka claims there were empty seats beside her. \nAn argument ensued, leaving Icka angered at the treatment she received. She believes that she had been discriminated against because she and her friends are maids. \nWhat do you think? Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
