College Championship?\nHanley, 20, a junior at Stetson University in DeLand , was one of 15 students nationwide who competed last month in the annual tournament in Los Angeles. The two-week competition will air its finale on Friday, with the grand prize winner getting $100,000.\nHanley advanced to the semifinals and placed second in an episode that aired Wednesday. That was good enough to her earn her $10,000 but not enough to make it to the finals.\n“I felt confident I would do the best I could, and I absolutely did,” she said Thursday in a phone interview from Deland.\nWatch parties were held at her college and in South Florida, although Hanley didn’t attend either of them because she came down with the flu. She said Thursday she is still recovering.\nHer parents, who went to California to watch the taping, had about 40 friends over to their house Wednesday night.\n“I knew the outcome, and I was still a nervous wreck watching it again,” said her father, Neil Hanley .\nFriends at the watch party “were thrilled to death. They knew her and came to celebrate her doing a really good job,” the father said.\nOne of the most popular moments at the parties was when Mari Hanley sang her response to a question on song lyrics.\n“Omi was rah-rah for this title gal who was always ‘Right there when I need her,’ ” Host Alex Trebek said.\n“What is a cheerleader?” Hanley sang, prompting Trebek to respond in song, “You are right.”\nHanley family members say it was hard to keep the outcome secret from friends and families, but they had signed agreements not to discuss it before the show aired. Jeopardy! doesn’t pay out until two months after the show airs, Neil Hanley said.\nHanley said she will use the $10,000 to help pay for graduate school. She’s studying anthropology and history at Stetson, a liberal arts school, and hopes to eventually work as a curator at a museum.\nShe lost a spot in the finals to Gary Tse, who attends the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.\n“He is a Quiz Bowl champion. He brushed up on just about everything,” Hanley said. \nShe had a score of $15,000 going into Final Jeopardy, trailing Tse, who had $22,995. Both missed a question that dealt with the 1864 presidential election year, but Tse’s wager was modest enough to clinch first place. \nHanley, a lifelong fan of the show, called the experience “absolutely wonderful. They flew me out, paid for my hotel, and I got to meet a bunch of wonderful students who I now consider friends.” \nHanley said she had applied several times prior for kids’ and teen tournaments. She said she's an avid reader, including the complete works of Shakespeare, and has stored a lot of random trivia in her brain.\nShe speaks six languages and is fluent in sign language.\n\n\nShe hopes her Jeopardy! success will inspire others.\n“Being a nerd is nothing to be ashamed of,” she said. “You never know what it can bring you.”\nstravis@sunsentinel.com , 561-243-6637 or Twitter @smtravis \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:43:13.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
