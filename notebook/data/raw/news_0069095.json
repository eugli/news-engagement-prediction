He will return to court on April 11. \nIf convicted of rape, he could be jailed for up to 20 years and fined. \nThe maximum penalty for outrage of modesty is two years' jail, fine, caning or any combined punishment. As he is above 50, no caning will be imposed. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:19:14.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
