Everyone in the United Center stands wore No. 23. That's the life of the co-star, the very, very good in the shadow of greatness. \nPippen went on ESPN's The Jump on Tuesday to discuss Russell Westbrook. And he couldn't help but see a similarity to his own career, with Michael Jordan serving as his (more successful and more lauded) Kevin Durant. \nIn that comparison, Pippen thinks Westbrook is just fine with the burden he's carried this season. Why? Well, he remembers 1993, when Jordan retired from the NBA for the first of three times. \n\"I was the happiest man alive,\" Pippen said. \"I got a chance to be the man for a change. It's something you embrace as a player, especially when you're in a position where you're probably not going to get that spotlight like myself playing with Michael. So when he retired, I was very happy. I did want him to come back, though.\" \nIn the 1993-94 season, Pippen averaged career-highs of 22.0 points and 8.7 rebounds a game, finished a career-best third in MVP voting, made his first All-NBA first team, won All-Star Game MVP and generally had the best season of his Hall of Fame career. The Bulls went 55-27 and impressed everyone even though their streak of three consecutive titles was snapped with a Round 2 exit against the Knicks. So yeah, Pippen knows what Westbrook is going through, even though he didn't need to average triple-doubles every night. \nWhat happened next? Horace Grant left the Bulls, they fell to barely above .500 and Jordan returned with 17 games left in the 1994-95 season. \n\"Going through those two years, I started to get a little bit sad,\" Pippen said. \"But he saw it and decided to come back.\" \nThen they won three more championships. It worked out. \nHere's the full segment with Pippen joining ESPN's Rachel Nichols and Amin Elhassan: Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/scottie-pippen-michael-jordan-retirement-bulls-1994-the-jump-rachel-nichols/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:44:11.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
