White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to the AP that this was the case. \nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly had told reporters on Saturday that \"a tighter, more streamlined version\" of the immigration executive order was being drafted. \nThe original order rolled out quickly and imposed a controversial blanket travel ban to last 90 days that targeted citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Its implementation was criticized as messy and chaotic as hundreds of individuals from the specified countries were detained, questioned, and deported from U.S. airports. \nAttorney’s set up stations in airports to provide legal help to the many affected travelers—which included dual citizens and permanent residents. \nThe order prompted protests at locations across the country and was temporarily suspended by a federal court action. \nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a temporary restraining order against the travel ban in early February, much to the disdain of Trump who lashed out at the judiciary in a cap locked rage and later accused it of political interference. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Despite the legal frustrations, Trump looks set to try again. The revised draft of the executive order upholds the ban but makes clear that those already granted green cards and visas are approved to enter the U.S. In this, Trump is seeking to overcome a major problem experienced with the original order, in which individuals who had already been vetted and approved were refused entry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:45:36.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
