(Photo: AP) \nKevin Durant is back in Oklahoma City for the first time since he joined the Warriors, and the Thunder fans are welcoming him with boos, anti-KD shirts , and lots and lots of cupcakes. \nThe cupcake trolling is a result of this detail that was revealed in Sports Illustrated 's Lee Jenkins' feature story about Westbrook: \nWestbrook didn't disparage Durant. He didn't judge him. All he did was take a picture. When Kendrick Perkins played center for the Thunder, he called teammates \"cupcake\" if he thought they were acting a little soft. Westbrook and Durant adopted the term in jest. Westbrook posted a bittersweet pic on Instagram: three plates of cupcakes topped by red and blue stars and sprinkles. \nOne young fan even dressed up like an actual cupcake - this costume is crazy, pretty cute, a little creepy. Well, this is happening. pic.twitter.com/WYtEeCGULz — Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) February 12, 2017 There is a little girl in a cupcake costume pic.twitter.com/I9sVhNMRVN — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) February 12, 2017 A fan dressed as a cupcake to troll former Thunder star Kevin Durant. https://t.co/wGpKEkvNuK pic.twitter.com/r941UdiZNb — Marc J.
