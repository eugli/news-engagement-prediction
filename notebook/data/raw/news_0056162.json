It was awesome for sure and hopefully we can continue to do that,\" she said.\n\"The other good thing about it is that we can have early germination and start very early and have plants that are strong enough so that we can put them in the soil in April.\"\nHydroponic cultivation uses far less water than outside farming, and it's more efficient, De Bonnault said.\n\"It can be up to the equivalent of one acre of land inside one of those containers,\" she said. \"Also you don't have the pollution, you don't have the pesticides.\"\nDe Bonnault says she and the other volunteers are still learning about hydroponics, but they hope to increase their yield in the coming months.\nDuring the growing season, the non-profit group also farms an 4.5-hectare piece of land and gives the crops to Calgary's Compassionate Food Access Agencies.\n​\nGrow Calgary is using this converted shipping container to cultivate vegetables to give to struggling families in the city.
