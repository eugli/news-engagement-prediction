No waiting around. No frustrations. \nThe downside of working out in your living room? It's easy to get stuck in the same routine. Fortunately for you, that's about to change. \nWe asked personal trainer Kaisa Keranen , M.S., to suggest 10 everyday objects that double as surprisingly effective workout tools. Plus, she's included two awesomely difficult exercises you can do with each—and that'll have you second-guessing why you ever bought a gym membership in the first place. Directions \nPick 5-7 moves from the list and perform them as a circuit. Do each move for 30 seconds. If a move is unilateral, complete 30 seconds per side, then take a 15-second break before moving on to the next move. \nOnce you've completed the circuit, take 1-2 minutes to recover, then repeat 2-4 more times. (Might want to grab an extra towel to mop up your sweat.) 1. Table \nA. Clapping pushup How to do it: *Make sure your table is sturdy—don't use the foldable table you use to play beer pong—and won't slide around as you push off of it. \nPlace your hands on the edge and walk your feet back so you’re in an incline pushup position. Lower yourself to perform a pushup, then explode from the bottom position so your hands leave the table. Clap your hands, then brace yourself as you come back to the start position. If you’re not comfortable with the movement, perform plyo pushups without the clap. \nB. Table dip with one-legged support How to do it: Face away from the table and place your palms on its edge as you would for a bench dip. Extend one leg so you only have one leg supporting you. Starting with your arms extended, lower yourself as far as you can comfortably go, then slowly press up back to the starting position. 2. Chair \nA. Stepup to reverse lunge How to do it: Place a sturdy chair in front of you. Step up on one leg, then come back down, going directly into a reverse lunge. Alternate sides after 30 sec. \nB. Straight-leg kickover with lunge How to do it: Stand behind the back of a chair. In one smooth motion, kick your left leg up and over the back of the chair to the left, then bring your left foot back behind you as you lower yourself into a reverse lunge. Stand, then kick your right leg up and over the back of the chair to the right, bringing your right foot back into a reverse lunge. 3. Towel \nA. Plank slide-out How to do it: This works best on a smooth floor. Start by standing up with a towel on the floor in front of you. Bend over and place each hand on the towel. Slide out to a pushup position, perform a pushup, then fire your abs to bring your hands back toward your feet. Keep your hands on the ground—as if you were doing a hamstring stretch—throughout the entire movement. \nB. Knee-ins to pushupHow to do it: Start in a plank position with towels under your feet. Pull your knees in, then push them back out to plank. Perform a pushup and repeat. 4. Paper plates \nA. Reverse lunge to lateral lunge How to do it: Place a paper plate under your sliding foot (the one that'll go behind you). Lower yourself into a reverse lunge , then drag your back foot and the paper plate up to the start position. From here, drag the plate and your foot into a side lunge. Alternate sides after 30 sec. \nB. Quick mountain climbers How to do it: Start in a plank position with paper plates under both feet. Perform mountain climbers as fast as you can. 5. Couch \nA. Couch pistol squat to hopHow to do it: Position yourself in front of a couch, facing away. Perform a pistol squat (single-leg squat) on your right leg until your butt touches the couch. Then stand back up and explosively hop up on your right leg. Switch sides after 30 sec. \nB. Plank leg jumps How to do it: Place your hands on the floor and feet on the couch. Jump your feet off the couch, bending your knees so your feet land in between your hands. Continue jumping your feet back and forth, keeping your core engaged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:29:38.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
