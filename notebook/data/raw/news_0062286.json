(PTI) \nAfter the CBI has registered an FIR against meat exporter Moin Qureshi in a graft case, in which it also named its former chief AP Singh (the 1974-batch IPS officer retired as CBI Director on November 30, 2012), and searches were conducted at his residence, the man himself reacted and claimed innocence. CBI had also conducted raids in Ghaziabad, Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai directed Qureshi. Another person whose premises were raided included businessman Pradeep Koneru who has also been linked to the disproportionate assets case against Andhra leader Jaganmohan Reddy, son of former chief minister of the state YS Rajasekhara Reddy, popularly known as YSR. Both the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has been probing Qureshi for tax evasion, and money-laundering. \nAdmitting to no wrongdoing, in his defense, AP Singh, who has become the first former CBI chief booked by the agency, today said, “Majority (of BBM chats with meat exporter Moin Qureshi) are after I retired from CBI in November 2012. None of the purported BBMs pertain to CBI investigations. They are mostly personal and innocuous in nature as between friends.” He added, “Suffice to say these BBMs have been in public domain for over 3 years,Income tax and ED have not added any thing further.” \nIn November last the case had been transferred to the CBI by the ED, which said that Qureshi had accepted money on behalf of public servants as bribes. ED wanted the CBI to investigate the case further. The Indian Express quoted a CBI official as saying, “We have received the reference from the ED and are examining it. No preliminary inquiry or formal case has yet been registered.” \nYou may also like to watch: \nAccording to the ED, three BBMs exchanged are during the period when A P Singh was the Director.
