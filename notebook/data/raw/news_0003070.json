The models on this list blur the line between tablet and laptop -- usually referred to as \"hybrids\" or \"2-in-1.\"\nThe double-life of a hybrid appeases business professionals, students and those who want more PC capabilities in a portable and -- sometimes -- more affordable package.\nHere are our top recommendations for tablets with complementary keyboard options.\nThe Dell XPS 13 has an extremely reasonable starting price.\nSarah Tew/CNET Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Interested in something that's a full-time laptop and part-time tablet? The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is a good pick. It's a 13-inch Windows device with a 360-degree hinge that lets you fold back the screen into a makeshift tablet. For a hybrid tablet/laptop, it's very thin and light, and its superthin bezels beautifully maximize its screen space.\nThe Galaxy TabPro S comes with a snazzy keyboard case that offers two comfortable typing positions.\nSarah Tew/CNET Samsung Galaxy TabPro S This Samsung Windows tablet does you a solid and includes its magnetically attachable keyboard cover in its base price. The Galaxy TabPro S features a stunning display in a very slim design. It's one of the better values for a skinny, keyboard-toting Windows tablet.\nThis HP also has a stylus.\nJosh Miller/CNET\nHP Elite x2 Like the Samsung above, this HP tablet also comes with the keys. However, the HP's keyboard is impressively comfortable to type on and lifts at an angle for a more ergonomic typing position. The 12-inch Elite x2 includes a fingerprint sensor and a non-proprietary USB-C charger that can power other devices as well.\nThe Pixel C's keyboard is one of its best assets.\nJosh Miller/CNET Google Pixel C If you want an Android tablet with a keyboard, Google 's tablet is your best bet. The Pixel C runs the latest version of Google's mobile OS known as Android 6.0 Marshmallow , and its sold-separately keyboard magnetically attaches so strongly, it stays connected even if you hold it upside down.\nThe Acer Switch Alpha 12 is one of the best 2-in-1's available for the money.\nSarah Tew/CNET Acer Aspire Switch Alpha 12 The Acer Aspire Switch Alpha 12 is a solid 2-in-1 with a thoughtful design. It has a detachable, full size, backlit keyboard that gives great tactile feedback. While it's a great deal for the price, if you're a content creator, you're going to want to go with something that has a better screen and stylus.\nMicrosoft's been making the best tablet-hybrids for a while now.\nSarah Tew/CNET Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 's keyboard is a must-buy. Microsoft 's latest model is the closest the company has come to perfecting the tablet-hybrid model, and the Surface Pro 4's keyboard is its best effort yet. It's superslim, yet successfully doubles as a cover case for the tablet.", "external_links": ["https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/CiuCjGS44HtQ-9dMS4vCYT6NSYY=/970x0/2015/12/08/c83b8e25-8a23-4959-ae6d-e896ada2bb98/cohchlytpicksyl-0390-018.jpg", "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/tJSNXOJTniUmAPizjl_69CGiqdc=/970x0/2017/01/31/c8c83c29-6296-4f32-8c3d-e9264db69a60/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-17.jpg", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/M58xxagpdmgs6iZgkwe4IvUtO5A=/970x0/2016/09/22/800635bc-b5fa-4e7b-a826-58ce169533c3/acer-switch-alpha-12-04.jpg", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/0LRjOdBqY6s5ewywu_o_5xd6okM=/970x0/2016/06/07/4066236a-48b8-42e3-8570-36d5b7acf1df/hp-elite-x2-laptop-1636.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/0igRHDYSa3kRIjycRjVd6Cm9qRU=/970x0/2016/03/23/f40f58ec-ed1f-476d-b420-5b916762b8ff/samsung-galaxy-tabpro-s-14.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/ZMRx8nZFMRuToq0uXPMSt3tuyYs=/970x0/2015/10/16/278bddfb-aec1-4c45-ac20-5dc378770c87/microsoft-surface-pro-4-23.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:11:34.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
