By Carly Ledbetter \nEmma Stone is up for Best Actress at the 2017 Oscars and in our minds, she’s already won best dressed. \nThe 28-year-old actress looked like a golden goddess on the red carpet Sunday night, wowing in a shimmering Givenchy haute couture gown. Her gorgeous wavy hair, dark red lip and long gold earrings gave us major Old Hollywood vibes: Steve Granitz via Getty Images WOW. \nThe intricate bodice and beaded bottom half of her gown ensured the “La La Land” actress looked like the major star she is. \nVanessa Friedman of the New York Times pointed out why Stone’s dress, one of the last designed by Riccardo Tisci before he left Gucci, is potentially pretty historic: Emma Stone snagged one of Riccardo Tisci's last @Givenchy looks. If she wins, that will make it doubly historic (save for auction). #Oscars — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 27, 2017 \nWe love it whether or not she snags the Oscar!
