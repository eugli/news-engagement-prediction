(Carolyn Kaster/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, February 15, 2017, 4:13 AM \nThe ex-wife of President Trump's pick for Labor Secretary, Andy Puzder, once claimed he \"vowed revenge\" after she leaked spousal abuse allegations to the public, according to a new video. \nLisa Fierstein donned a curly wig, large sunglasses and used a pseudonym to protect her identity — and the name of her estranged spouse — during a taped appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in March 1990. \nThe video, obtained Tuesday night by Politico, shows Fierstein on the episode \"High Class Battered Women\" explaining how fame, money and prestige favors a man's word over his victim. \nHe said, 'I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over, you will pay for this,'\" said Fierstein, as \"Ann.\" \nThe context of her identity implies she was speaking of Puzder, the CEO of the Carl's Jr. parent company, CKE, and his repeated attacks detailed in divorce documents. The couple split in 1987, when Puzder was known as anti-abortion advocate in St. Louis. \nAdditionally, Fierstein appeared to speak generally of men using their power to get away with abuse. \n\"Most men, who are in positions like this, don't leave marks. The damage I sustained, you can't see. It's permeant,\" she said. \n\"There was no mark, the damage, and there never was. They never hit you in the face. They're too smart. They don't hit you in front of everyone.\" \nThe Senate, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee requested the footage in January, along with about 20 other domestic violence-related episodes, ahead of Puzder's confirmation hearing on Thursday. His appointment is expected to be opposed by Democratic members of the U.S. Senate. Andy Puzder is the president and CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc. which operates the hamburger chain Carl's Jr. (HO/REUTERS) \n\"I wound up losing everything. Everything. I have nothing,\" Fierstein recalled. \n\"He has a Porshe and a Mercedes-Benz. He has the home. He has everything. He was an attorney. He knew how to play the system,\" she added. Months after the episode aired, Fierstein recanted to maintain custody of their two children and has denied the allegations against Puzder ever since. \nIn a letter obtained by Politico, Fierstein told the Senate committee she regretted her Oprah appearance. \nFierstein and Puzder's divorce records are sealed and the Campaign for Accountability is waging a legal battle to make public the original documents from the St. Louis County Circuit Court. \nThe nonprofit argues the documents \"are of high interest and concern\" to the public and Senate committee behind Puzder's nomination.
