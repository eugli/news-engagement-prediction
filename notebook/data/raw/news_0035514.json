And it is never acceptable to insult a woman based on her real or presumed sexual history. Doing so is straight-up slut-shaming. \nSlut-shaming is when a woman is judged \"too\" sexual – whatever that means – and therefore believed to deserve policing or punishment. The \"slut,\" \"ho\" or \"hooker\" may be not only publicly shamed but also verbally or physically harassed and made vulnerable to sexual coercion and assault. I have been tracking slut-shaming for over 20 years. Much of the time, the so-called slut is not any more sexually active than her peers. And if she is, does that matter? After all, men are not called out for being sexually active. But we live in a culture with a deeply entrenched sexual double standard: the sexist mindset that boys will be boys, and girls will be sluts. \nLabels like \"slut,\" \"ho\" or \"hooker\" say that women's primary value comes from being sexually desirable and available. But there's a paradox here because being sexually desirable and available reduces women's worth. And while there is nothing wrong with being sexually desirable or available, that is not the sum total of whom anyone is. \nRatajkowski was so disgusted by the \"hooker\" comment that she engaged in her own form of shaming, disclosing the comment on Twitter on Monday. Sat next to a journalist from the NYT last night who told me \"Melania is a hooker.\" Whatever your politics it's crucial to call this out for — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 13, 2017 what it is: slut shaming. I don't care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should. — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 13, 2017 \nIn response, Bernstein turned to Twitter himself and issued a public apology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:21:57.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
