After months of walking, hatching, and catching, the second generation of Pokemon are have finally arrived. And with the app relying largely on the hype of nostalgia, they're able to cash in on users who were kids when Pokemon Gold and Silver were first released. And while new game mechanics like the berries were changed as well, it was the new Pokemon that felt like Christmas Morning. And in addition to the new creature who will be available in the wild, there are also brand spankin new evolutions to the original 150, including the fan favorite Eevee evolutions. But how exactly do you get your Eevee to change into Umbreon and Espeon? We've got your back. \nIt turns out that getting your hands on the psychic and dark evolutions is pretty simple. Much like the original trio, IGN has confirmed that all you have to do is give your Eevee a certain name before evolving it. If you want Umbreon the dark type, you must name your Eevee Tamao. And if you prefer the special attack power of Espeon you should nickname it Sakura. \nThese names are after two more one day characters from the Pokemon anime . In the Johto series, we meet a young girl Sakura who lives in Ecruteak City. Her partner Pokemon is an Espeon, and she lives with her sisters, The Kimono Sisters who all have Eeveelutions of their own. One of those siblings is Tamao, who has an Umbreon. \nAs far as the new Pokemons' stats go, Espeon is probably going to get the most use due to its high CP. And while it health is pretty low, it'll be able to do deal some pain when you're battling in gyms. Umbreon is the reverse, with high defense and HP but little in the way of power. \nEspeon and Umbreon are some of the most popular Pokemon of all time. The player is usually gifted an Eevee at some point during each game, allowing the player to choose which evolution to add to their team. And every few generations come with new Eeveelutions, of which there are now eight. \nAlong with the new Eeveelutions, almost every Pokemon in Generation 2 is now available for you to catch and hatch in Pokemon Go . Unfortunately, there is still no word as to if and when the legendary Pokemon will be introduced. None of the legendary Pokemon from Generation One have been introduced into the app, including Mewtwo, Mew, and the legendary birds. Generation 2 has quite a few legendaries as well, including Ho-Oh, Lugia, and the legendary beasts (Entei, Raikou, Suicune). Niantic has yet to provide a plan for what mechanics will be utilized when they're available, but sprites for Gen 1's legendaries were seen.
