Delwyn Dickey \nKawau Islanders are being asked to take more care with their dogs after a kiwi is kiiled. \nInitially there were hopes the otherwise healthy adult bird would survive but it died while being transported off the island by water taxi the next day. \nREAD MORE: \nIt was headed for the New Zealand Centre of Conservation medicine, at Auckland Zoo, DOC Senior Biodiversity Ranger Thelma Wilson says. DOC \nWeka and kiwi can be found roaming freely on Kawau Is \nThere is a small population of brown kiwi on the island but they are slowly declining. Kawau Is still has introduced pests like cats, rats, and stoats on it which have decimated kiwi populations on the mainland by eating eggs and killing young birds. \nDogs are attracted to the birds' strong smell and are a particular problem for adult kiwi. With no breastplate (strernum) adult birds can easily suffer crush injuries even from dogs mouthing the birds. This sees dogs as the main cause of death for adult birds. \n\"Kiwi are a living treasure. It's everyone's responsibility to protect these taonga,\" Warkworth office community ranger Hollie Russell says. \"Kawau residents are fortunate to have kiwi and weka right on their doorstep, and in fact in back yards, so it is imperative that we all strive to protect them,\" Ad Feedback \n\"Keeping dogs contained, under control and making sure they have undertaken training to avoid Kiwi is really important in any area where Kiwi are present.\" Russell says. \nIslanders and visitors alike are being urged to take their dogs to kiwi aversion training. This sees dogs fitted with a collar that the trainer can give a mild electric shock with. The dog receives a shock when it comes across planted kiwi droppings or a kiwi (a dead bird is used). \nVery pleased the resident let them know the kiwi had been injured, Wilson says it is too early to say if there will be any action taken over the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:09:47.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
