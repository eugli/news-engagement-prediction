Christine as a little girl, beaming proudly over the first two babies her family adopted.

Ostroskey. Firefighters rescued Lomas, but she died at the hospital.\nLomas was a beloved special-education teacher at the Carlton M. Viveiros Elementary School, where she bought her students tablets with her own money and carted home dozens of tadpoles to raise, so the children could have frogs in the classroom.\nAdvertisement\n“She just had a huge heart,” said principal Anne-Marie Scott. “That was her calling.”\nAnd, like her mother and father, Lomas invited children with nowhere to go and no one to care for them into her home. Charette, whose husband died seven years ago, has fostered 237 children, many of them with special needs, and adopted 14. Lomas fostered more than 20 and adopted three, who also have special needs.\n“She had it in her from [the time she was] a child,” said Charette, 73, who spoke surrounded by family on the first floor of the home her daughter once lived in.\nAt 6 years old, Lomas had greeted with giddy excitement the first little boy her parents adopted, Paul, who took to calling her “Honey.” Paul had spina bifida, and Lomas helped him learn to walk by calling him toward her as he navigated a set of parallel bars her father had built.\nAs the Charettes’ brood grew, Lomas, who was their only biological child, took pleasure in assembling the little ones in rows, gathering pencils and notebooks, and pretending to be their teacher.\nLomas was so determined to become a teacher that she powered through college while raising three children, each born two years apart. She worked at a nursing home, and once she finished her undergraduate degree, found a job teaching children with special needs at a group home called Crystal Springs in Assonet. It didn’t pay well, but she loved it too much to quit, so she picked up a second job at Domino’s.\nBut still she did more.\n‘She just had a huge heart. That was her calling.’\nAnne-Marie Scott, principal at Carlton M. Viveiros Elementary School, on Christine Lomas On weekends, she’d bring home a little girl living at Crystal Springs who had severe cerebral palsy because the child never had any visitors. Lomas and her children would coo, “Hello, pretty girl,” and take the child, who could not speak, to McDonald’s and the movies.\nGretchen Ertl for The Boston Globe\nKayla Moniz, a daughter of Christine Lomas, embraced her grandmother, Mary Charette, as they spoke of their loss.\nLomas left Crystal Springs after about 10 years and began teaching in the public schools. She went back to school for her graduate degree, and despite her busy schedule, began fostering children.\n“I think she wanted to give other kids a second chance,” said her daughter, Kayla Moniz.\n“She’s seen it,” said Charette. “She knows where they come from.”\nShe even took in abandoned animals. She had five cats and two dogs when she died.\nLomas landed at Viveiros in 2008, working with the school’s most fragile students. Lomas was at once funny and firm with the children she raised and those she taught. Nothing ruffled her, said her mother. If one of her students swore at her, it rolled right off — but she would tease them about it later if they tried to ask for a treat.\nShe expected hard work from her own children, too. When Moniz brought home a B, she said, Lomas would say, “Not bad, could be better.”\n“She made me the person who I am today,” said Moniz, who has two children of her own and works as a paraprofessional in a special needs classroom in the same school as her mother.\n“That push, that drive, that strength she had.”\nLomas was the calm center of a joyful and sprawling family. She made the vacation plans. She shoveled for her mother after snowstorms. She gave her father CPR the night that he fell ill and died, nearly seven years to the day that she lost her own life.\nLomas had also put out two fires at her mother’s house in the past. Her family thinks she did not realize the severity of the fire raging in the attic when she ran toward it. They think her mind was focused on her children. Lomas had health problems, and fretted about making sure her children were cared for when she died. The house was her gift for them.\nShe had decorated it for Valentine’s Day, hanging heart-shaped wreaths on the fence. When someone stole them, she didn’t mind — she simply bought cheaper ones, her mother said, and hung them again.\nNow, the home’s top floor is sealed off. The roof has a hole in it. Lomas is gone, and downstairs, her family grieves. They spent Saturday taking stock of the damage. They finally found Lomas’s cat, Tabitha — a stray that Charette says followed Lomas home on her walk from Viveiros one winter, then sat on her front porch, scrawny and mewling.\nLike she always had and always would, Lomas opened the door and welcomed her inside.\nEvan Allen can be reached at evan.allen@globe.com .
