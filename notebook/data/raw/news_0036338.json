Mr. Trump’s Republican allies followed up on Mr. Spicer’s lead by demanding to know who in the government has been leaking to the news media. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News that his committee would be “asking the F.B.I. to do an assessment of this to tell us what’s going on here, because we cannot continue to have these leaks as a government.” Other Republicans have been circumspect about whether they intend to support investigations into the Russian connections. Some, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, support an inquiry by the intelligence committees. But Mr. McConnell has rejected the need for a select committee to investigate the issue. “We know how to do our work,” Mr. McConnell said on MSNBC. We have an Intelligence Committee.” In Mr. Trump’s remarks at the White House, the president appeared to press for an inquiry on how information about Mr. Flynn’s communications with the Russians became known publicly. “It’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on,” Mr. Trump said of the leaks, accusing those who spread the information of “trying to cover up” for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the election last year. Mr. Trump added that there were “documents and papers that were illegally — I stress that, illegally leaked.” If Republicans succeed in guiding those committees to focus more on leaks — rather than on the underlying information they reveal — they will be following a well-worn path. President Barack Obama , a Democrat, waged a furious war against leaks during his eight years in office, prosecuting more whistle-blowers than all of his predecessors combined.
