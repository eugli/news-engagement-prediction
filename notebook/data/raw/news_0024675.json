One would have expected them to declare openly either on the floor of the House or through a press conference, but they did not do any of these,” the source said. \nSpeaking in an interview, one of the members of PDP, Jude Idimogu denied the speculations, but added that it is not impossibility.“We have not defected yet. We are all still in the PDP to the best of my knowledge. I know there are crisis in the party, but we are yet to move. We are all still here. If we want to move, it would be done on the floor of the house or through a press conference,” he said. \nIt will be recalled that there was no PDP lawmaker in the 7th Assembly in the state as all the 40 members were from the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), which metamorphosed to the APC. However, in the 6th Assembly, one of the three PDP members in the assembly then, Hodewu Suuru Avoseh, who had earlier been impeached as the Minority Leader of the House, defected to the ACN then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:18:46.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
