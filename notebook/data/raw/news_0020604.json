Social media critics body-shamed the singer cum actress saying she exhibited some belly flab. TMZ caught up with Migos at the airport in L.A. They defended the diva and said her body looked good. \n\"It was on fleek,\" said Quavo. \"Internet not a safe place.\" \nWhen asked if Gaga's critics were right, Takeoff said people should \"leave her alone,\" and that they would work with her on a song given the chance. Before the Super Bowl, a petition was floating around to get rid of Gaga and have Migos instead -- and a host of other ATL rappers -- perform songs like \"Bad and Boujee\" at the halftime show. \nWhat do you think? Did Gaga look good?
