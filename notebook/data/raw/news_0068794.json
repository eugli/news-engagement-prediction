In the Israeli prime minister's case, it can take more than 11 hours. \nFlightAware showed The Israeli leader took an unusual detour when travelling from Singapore to Australia on Tuesday and Wednesday. FLIGHTAWARE \nBenjamin Netanyahu's plane wasn't taking the scenic route by choice. \nThe Guardian newspaper also confirmed this unusual route with Netanyahu's delegation. \nThis detour added several hours to his journey. \nREAD MORE: JASON REED \nIt was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's first visit to Australia as PM. \nNetanyahu's plane wasn't taking the scenic route by choice. Instead, the carrier - El Al, Israel's national airline - was deliberately avoiding the airspace of Indonesia. \nIndonesia has the world's largest Muslim population. \nLike other Muslim-majority nations, the country has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel because of the latter's conflict with Palestinians. \nSome implications of this are well known - Israeli passport holders are refused entry to a number of Muslim-majority nations, except in special circumstances, though Israeli citizens are permitted access to Indonesia on tourist visas. \nHowever, the strange route of Netanyahu's plane shows another effect of Israel's diplomatic situation. \nIndonesia doesn't grant El Al access to its national airspace, necessitating a circuitous route around it. \nAnd Indonesia isn't the only country to restrict access. \nA quick look at Netanyahu's earlier flight from Tel Aviv to Singapore also shows how the Israeli prime minister took an unusual route, which may have been designed to avoid the airspace of Saudi Arabia or another nation. \nRepresentatives of El Al didn't respond to clarify what airspaces they were prohibited from flying over. \nNetanyahu's awkward journey around Indonesia comes at a time when the Israeli leader is hoping for a closer relationship with Jakarta. \nThe two countries were reported to be informally upgrading their relations in 2012, with Indonesia opening a consulate in the West Bank city of Ramallah that would include a diplomat who would unofficially serve as ambassador to Israel. \nHowever, when Netanyahu called upon Indonesia to normalise diplomatic relations last year, the Indonesian government said it would do so only when the Palestinians are granted an independent state. - The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:33:53.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
