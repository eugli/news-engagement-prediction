(Chicago Tribune) Paul Sullivan . “Everybody thought Jesus Christ was a witch ( laughing ) — and he was our savior. So if they talk (bleep) about Jesus Christ, what about me? Are you kidding me?”\nThe interview was with former Cubs media relations employee Chuck Wasserstrom, who writes a personal blog. Sosa agreed to the interview because he “trusts” the author, according to the blog. \nSosa told Wasserstrom he would return to the organization to sing the seventh-inning stretch or attend the Cubs Convention if asked, but added: “I’m not going to go up there and say, ‘I’m here. Please bring me back and give me a chance.’ No way. I’m not hungry. I have too much pride. They know where they can find me. They’re in their way; I am in my way. If they want to have a meeting — of course ... I’m a gentleman. I’d never say ‘No’ to that. If one day it happens, I’d be happy. And if it doesn’t, we can talk again on Skype.” \nSosa admitted he made a mistake when he walked out on the Cubs at the end of the 2004 season, again insisting he got permission from manager Dusty Baker through a former trainer. Sosa lied about leaving early in the game, forcing the Cubs to announce they had videotaped evidence of him leaving. \nHis teammates weren’t happy about the way it played out, and one of them smashed his boombox with a bat. Sosa was traded to Baltimore after the ’04 season, fell out of favor with the organization and never came back to Wrigley Field. \nSosa admitted leaving the ballpark early was a “mistake.” \n“I should have stayed there. It was the last game,” he said. “My intention was to finish my career in Chicago. That was my intention all the way. I never wanted to leave Chicago. I should have handled that situation differently, yes indeed. I recognize my mistake. But look, I have my pride, and I know I had a tremendous career in Chicago. \n“When nobody knew who Chicago was, I put Chicago on the map. Like you said, if I could have done it again, I would have done it differently. The only thing we cannot do is turn back time. We can’t do that. But hey, we have to move forward. I understand I made a mistake. I regret it, definitely, but I have to move on.” \nSosa said he enjoyed watching the Cubs end their championship drought and praised Joe Maddon’s job. Sosa had problems with two of his former Cub managers, Don Baylor and Baker. \nThe Cubs have been reluctant to welcome Sosa back until he admits his transgressions, so perhaps this was a first step towards a reunion. But he still appears to be unable to openly address his alleged PED use, so that appears unlikely, at least for now. \n“Hey, if they send me an invitation, then I would definitely say ‘yes,’” Sosa said. “This is my house — no matter what happened (at the end). My numbers — nobody is going to take them from me. Not even Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks, hit that many home runs. And I did it with style ( laughing ). But if they invite me, why not? One day, if they invite me, a lot of people will be very happy about it.” Caption Scenes from Monday's Cubs spring training workout \nScenes from the Cubs' spring training workout in Mesa, Ariz., on Feb. 20, 2017.
