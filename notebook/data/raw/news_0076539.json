(photo credit:KOBI GIDON / GPO) \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday reiterated his warning that Israel will not allow any \"drizzle\" of rocket fire on its territory from enemy entities. \"We respond to all fire at our territory; thus we did today and as such we will do in the future,\" the premier underscored hours after a projectile launched by terrorists exploded in an open field in southern Israel overnight. IDF strikes 5 Hamas targets in Gaza after rocket attack Meanwhile, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman stated that while Israel has no intention of initiating any military action in Gaza, “we have no intention to continue to absorb drizzles (of rockets out of the Strip). Hamas must take responsibility and calm down.\"No group immediately laid claim to the rocket attack. However, in retaliation to the strike, the IDF struck multiple Hamas terror targets in Gaza as the military holds the Palestinian terror group responsible for any fire originating from the Strip.Taking to Twitter, Hamas evaded responsibility for the rocket launching and accused the IDF of escalating tensions with Gaza. Netanyahu warns Hamas after weekend of rocket fire from Gaza [March 2016] There were no injuries or damage in Sunday's rocket attack on Israel.There have been several rockets launched at southern Israel in February, including two incidents in which the Islamic State group in the Sinai fired a barrage of rockets towards the southern city of Eilat. Three of the projectiles were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile system while a fourth landed in open territory.Two weeks ago, following a previous rocket attack, Netanyahu told reporters in London that his directives are to respond with force to every missile attack.“The two-and-a-half years since Operation Protective Edge were the two quietest years since the Six Day War,” he said, adding that Israel will be steadfast in responding to every attack, and not permit a “drizzle” of missile attacks that go without a response.
