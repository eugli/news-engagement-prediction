Rob Maness and Ralph King, an Electoral College member from Ohio. \n“I am proud to lead the charge here in Louisiana to get supporters of President Trump to show their support of his policy agenda through these Spirit of America rallies,” stated Maness, a two-time Senate candidate and founder of the pro-Trump GatorPAC , which is dedicated to assisting in the effort to “drain the swamp.” \n“Average citizens from across the political spectrum and all walks of life elected Mr. Trump and we at GatorPAC are especially pleased to help him with his national effort to Make America Great Again and #DrainTheSwamp priorities in Washington, D.C.” Advertisement - story continues below ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:31:33.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
